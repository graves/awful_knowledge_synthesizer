The re_format(7) manual page\n\t     fully describes both formats.\n\n     -H      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned\n\t     for each symbolic link specified on the command line to be those\n\t     of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself.  If the\n\t     referenced file does not exist, the file information and type\n\t     will be for the link itself.  File information of all symbolic\n\t     links not on the command line is that of the link itself."

If the mode is symbolic, a starting value of zero is\n\t     assumed and the mode sets or clears permissions without regard to\n\t     the process' file mode creation mask.  If the mode is octal, only\n\t     bits 07777 (S_ISUID | S_ISGID | S_ISTXT | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG |\n\t     S_IRWXO) of the file's mode bits participate in the comparison.\n\t     If the mode is preceded by a dash (“-”), this primary evaluates\n\t     to true if at least all of the bits in the mode are set in the\n\t     file's mode bits.\tIf the mode is preceded by a plus (“+”), this\n\t     primary evaluates to true if any of the bits in the mode are set\n\t     in the file's mode bits.  Otherwise, this primary evaluates to\n\t     true if the bits in the mode exactly match the file's mode bits.\n\t     Note, the first character of a symbolic mode may not be a dash\n\t     (“-”).\n\n     -print  This primary always evaluates to true.  It prints the pathname of\n\t     the current file to standard output.  If none of -exec, -ls,\n\t     -print, -print0, or -ok is specified, the given expression shall\n\t     be effectively replaced by ( given expression ) -print."

    STANDARDS
         The find utility syntax is a superset of the syntax specified by the IEEE
         Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) standard.

         All the single character options except -H and -L as well as -amin,
         -anewer, -cmin, -cnewer, -delete, -empty, -fstype, -iname, -inum,
         -iregex, -ls, -maxdepth, -mindepth, -mmin, -not, -path, -print0, -regex,
         -sparse and all of the -B* birthtime related primaries are extensions to
         IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

         Historically, the -d, -L and -x options were implemented using the
         primaries -depth, -follow, and -xdev.  These primaries always evaluated
         to true.  As they were really global variables that took effect before
         the traversal began, some legal expressions could have unexpected
         results.  An example is the expression -print -o -depth.  As -print
         always evaluates to true, the standard order of evaluation implies that
         -depth would never be evaluated.  This is not the case.

In particular, the characters “*”, “[”, “]”, “?”, “(”,\n     “)”, “!”, “\\” and “;” may have to be escaped from the shell.\n\n     As there is no delimiter separating options and file names or file names\n     and the expression, it is difficult to specify files named -xdev or !.\n     These problems are handled by the -f option and the getopt(3) “--”\n     construct."
