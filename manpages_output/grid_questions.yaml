This causes\n       geometry information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a\n       top-level window so that the entire sub-tree sizes itself to fit the\n       needs of the leaf windows.  However, the grid propagate command may be\n       used to turn off propagation for one or more masters.  If propagation\n       is disabled then grid will not set the requested width and height of\n       the master window.  This may be useful if, for example, you wish for a\n       master window to have a fixed size that you specify.\n\nRESTRICTIONS ON MASTER WINDOWS\n       The master for each slave must either be the slave's parent (the\n       default) or a descendant of the slave's parent.\tThis restriction is\n       necessary to guarantee that the slave can be placed over any part of\n       its master that is visible without danger of the slave being clipped by\n       its parent.
