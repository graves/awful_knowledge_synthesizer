[-h] prog [args ...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The arch command with no arguments, displays the machine's architecture\n     type.\n\n     The other use of the arch command is to run a selected architecture of a\n     universal binary.\tA universal binary contains code that can run on\n     different architectures.  By default, the operating system will select\n     the architecture that most closely matches the processor type.  A 64-bit\n     architecture is preferred over a 32-bit architecture on a 64-bit\n     processor, while only 32-bit architectures can run on a 32-bit processor.\n\n     When the most natural architecture is unavailable, the operating system\n     will try to pick another architecture.  On 64-bit processors, a 32-bit\n     architecture is tried.  Otherwise, no architecture is run, and an error\n     results."

The most common use is to select the 32-bit\n     architecture on a 64-bit processor, even if a 64-bit architecture is\n     available.\n\n     The arch_name argument must be one of the currently supported\n     architectures:\n\n\t   i386     32-bit intel\n\n\t   x86_64   64-bit intel\n\n\t   x86_64h  64-bit intel (haswell)\n\n\t   arm64    64-bit arm\n\n\t   arm64e   64-bit arm (Apple Silicon)\n\n     If the binary does not contain code for arch_name, the arch command may\n     try to select a close match.  If arm64 is specified and not found, arm64e\n     will be tried next.  If this happens, the order the architectures will be\n     tried is not guaranteed.\n\n     Either prefix the architecture with a hyphen, or (for compatibility with\n     other commands), use -arch followed by the architecture.\n\n     If more than one architecture is specified, the operating system will try\n     each one in order, skipping an architecture that is not supported on the\n     current processor, or is unavailable in the universal binary."

    Manpage text:

    The value of the environment variable ARCHPREFERENCE is composed of one
         or more specifiers, separated by semicolons.  A specifier is made up of
         one, two or three fields, separated by colons.  Architectures specified
         in order, are separated by commas and make up the last (mandatory) field.
         The first field, if specified, is a name of a program, which selects this
         specifier if that name matches the program name in question.  If the name
         field is empty or there is no name field, the specifier matches any
         program name.  Thus, ordering of specifiers is important, and the one
         with no name should be last.

         When the arch command is called directly, the prog name provides the path
         information to the executable (possibly via the command search path).
         When a name is specified in a ARCHPREFERENCE specifier, the path
         information can alternately be specified as a second field following the
         name.  When the arch command is called indirectly via a link, this path
         information must be specified.  If not specified as a second field in a
         specifier, the executable path will be looked up in the corresponding
         property list file.
