It\n     loads DCE/RPC services from the list of plugins given as arguments, binds\n     to an appropriate set of endpoints and listens for protocol requests.\n\n     If service is not a relative file name, it is assumed to be the name of a\n     dylib located in /usr/lib/rpcsvc.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -debug, -nodebug\n\t      rpcsvchost will log debug information and may perform extra\n\t      diagnostic checks. This option is typically only useful for\n\t      debugging.\n\n     -endpoints BINDING [,BINDING]\n\t      This argument specifies additional endpoints that rpcsvchost\n\t      should attempt to bind.  BINDING must be a comma-separated list\n\t      of DCE/RPC binding strings that include both the protocol\n\t      sequence and endpoint fields."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rpcsvchost`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-help    Prints a usage message and exits.\n\n     -launchd, -nolaunchd\n\t      Normally, rpcsvchost attempts to bind all the well-known\n\t      endpoints specified by the service plugins.  If there are no\n\t      well-known endpoints, it will bind new endpoints on all\n\t      supported protocol sequences. The -launchd option disables this\n\t      behavior and causes rpcsvchost to check in with launchd(8) to\n\t      obtain a set of sockets to bind as protocol endpoints.\n\n\t      Launchd sockets vended to rpcsvchost must be named with the\n\t      appropriate DCE/RPC protocol sequence (eg. \"ncacn_np\").\n\n     -sandbox, -nosandbox\n\t      When this option is specified, the modules loaded by rpcsvchost\n\t      will be run in a sandbox.  rpcsvchost will attempt to intialize\n\t      the sandbox using the sandbox profile with the name\n\t      com.apple.<module-name>.sb. See sandbox(7) for an overview of\n\t      the sandbox facility.\n\n     -register, -noregister\n\t      When this option is specified, rpcsvchost attempts to register\n\t      the loaded services with the DCE/RPC endpoint mapper."
