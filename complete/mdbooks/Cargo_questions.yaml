The default registry is <https://crates.io>. This performs the\nfollowing steps:\n\n1. Performs a few checks, including:\n   - Checks the `package.publish` key in the manifest for restrictions on\n     which registries you are allowed to publish to.\n2. Create a `.crate` file by following the steps in {{man \"cargo-package\" 1}}.\n3. Upload the crate to the registry. The server will perform additional\n   checks on the crate. \n4. The client will poll waiting for the package to appear in the index,\n   and may timeout. In that case, you will need to check for completion\n   manually. This timeout does not affect the upload.\n\nThis command requires you to be authenticated with either the `--token` option\nor using {{man \"cargo-login\" 1}}.\n\nSee [the reference](../reference/publishing.html) for more details about\npackaging and publishing.\n\n## OPTIONS\n\n### Publish Options\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{#option \"`--dry-run`\" }}\nPerform all checks without uploading.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{> options-token }}\n\n{{#option \"`--no-verify`\" }}\nDon't verify the contents by building them.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--allow-dirty`\" }}\nAllow working directories with uncommitted VCS changes to be packaged.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{> options-index }}\n\n{{#option \"`--registry` _registry_\"}}\nName of the registry to publish to. Registry names are defined in [Cargo\nconfig files](../reference/config.html). If not specified, and there is a\n[`package.publish`](../reference/manifest.html#the-publish-field) field in\n`Cargo.toml` with a single registry, then it will publish to that registry.\nOtherwise it will use the default registry, which is defined by the\n[`registry.default`](../reference/config.html#registrydefault) config key\nwhich defaults to `crates-io`.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{/options}}\n\n### Package Selection\n\nBy default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected\ndepend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if\n`--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then\nthe workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined\nby the manifest will be selected.\n\nThe default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the\n`workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a\nvirtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing\n`--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.\n\nSelecting more than one package is unstable and available only on the\n[nightly channel](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html)\nand requires the `-Z package-workspace` flag to enable.\nSee <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10948> for more information.\n\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{#option \"`-p` _spec_...\" \"`--package` _spec_...\"}}\n{{actionverb}} only the specified packages.

    Documentation text:

    # cargo-metadata(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-metadata --- Machine-readable metadata about the current package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo metadata` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Output JSON to stdout containing information about the workspace members and
    resolved dependencies of the current package.

    The output format is subject to change in future versions of Cargo. It
    is recommended to include the `--format-version` flag to future-proof your code
    and ensure the output is in the format you are expecting. For more on the
    expectations, see ["Compatibility"](#compatibility).

    See the [cargo_metadata crate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo_metadata)
    for a Rust API for reading the metadata.

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT

    ### Compatibility

    Within the same output format version, the compatibility is maintained, except
    some scenarios. The following is a non-exhaustive list of changes that are not
    considered as incompatible:

    * **Adding new fields** — New fields will be added when needed. Reserving this
      helps Cargo evolve without bumping the format version too often.
    * **Adding new values for enum-like fields** — Same as adding new fields. It
      keeps metadata evolving without stagnation.
    * **Changing opaque representations** — The inner representations of some
      fields are implementation details. For example, fields related to
      "Source ID" are treated as opaque identifiers to differentiate packages or
      sources. Consumers shouldn't rely on those representations unless specified.

    ### JSON format

    The JSON output has the following format:

    ```javascript
    {
        /* Array of all packages in the workspace.
           It also includes all feature-enabled dependencies unless --no-deps is used.
        */
        "packages": [
            {
                /* The name of the package. */
                "name": "my-package",
                /* The version of the package. */
                "version": "0.1.0",
                /* The Package ID for referring to the
                   package within the document and as the `--package` argument to many commands
                */
                "id": "file:///path/to/my-package#0.1.0",
                /* The license value from the manifest, or null. */
                "license": "MIT/Apache-2.0",
                /* The license-file value from the manifest, or null. */
                "license_file": "LICENSE",
                /* The description value from the manifest, or null. */
                "description": "Package description.",
                /* The source ID of the package, an "opaque" identifier representing
                   where a package is retrieved from. See "Compatibility" above for
                   the stability guarantee.

                   This is null for path dependencies and workspace members.

                   For other dependencies, it is a string with the format:
                   - "registry+URL" for registry-based dependencies.
                     Example: "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
                   - "git+URL" for git-based dependencies.
                     Example: "git+https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo?rev=5e85ba14aaa20f8133863373404cb0af69eeef2c#5e85ba14aaa20f8133863373404cb0af69eeef2c"
                   - "sparse+URL" for dependencies from a sparse registry
                     Example: "sparse+https://my-sparse-registry.org"

                   The value after the `+` is not explicitly defined, and may change
                   between versions of Cargo and may not directly correlate to other
                   things, such as registry definitions in a config file. New source
                   kinds may be added in the future which will have different `+`
                   prefixed identifiers.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `cargo-install page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# cargo-install(1)\n{{~*set command=\"install\"}}\n{{~*set actionverb=\"Install\"}}\n{{~*set temp-target-dir=true}}\n\n## NAME\n\ncargo-install --- Build and install a Rust binary\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n`cargo install` [_options_] _crate_[@_version_]...\\\n`cargo install` [_options_] `--path` _path_\\\n`cargo install` [_options_] `--git` _url_ [_crate_...]\\\n`cargo install` [_options_] `--list`\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nThis command manages Cargo's local set of installed binary crates. Only\npackages which have executable `[[bin]]` or `[[example]]` targets can be\ninstalled, and all executables are installed into the installation root's\n`bin` folder. By default only binaries, not examples, are installed.\n\n{{> description-install-root }}\n\nThere are multiple sources from which a crate can be installed. The default\nsource location is crates.io but the `--git`, `--path`, and `--registry` flags\ncan change this source. If the source contains more than one package (such as\ncrates.io or a git repository with multiple crates) the _crate_ argument is\nrequired to indicate which crate should be installed.\n\nCrates from crates.io can optionally specify the version they wish to install\nvia the `--version` flags, and similarly packages from git repositories can\noptionally specify the branch, tag, or revision that should be installed. If a\ncrate has multiple binaries, the `--bin` argument can selectively install only\none of them, and if you'd rather install examples the `--example` argument can\nbe used as well.\n\nIf the package is already installed, Cargo will reinstall it if the installed\nversion does not appear to be up-to-date. If any of the following values\nchange, then Cargo will reinstall the package:\n\n- The package version and source.\n- The set of binary names installed.\n- The chosen features.\n- The profile (`--profile`).\n- The target (`--target`).\n\nInstalling with `--path` will always build and install, unless there are\nconflicting binaries from another package. The `--force` flag may be used to\nforce Cargo to always reinstall the package.\n\nIf the source is crates.io or `--git` then by default the crate will be built\nin a temporary target directory. To avoid this, the target directory can be\nspecified by setting the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` environment variable to a relative\npath. In particular, this can be useful for caching build artifacts on\ncontinuous integration systems.\n\n### Dealing with the Lockfile\n\nBy default, the `Cargo.lock` file that is included with the package will be\nignored. This means that Cargo will recompute which versions of dependencies\nto use, possibly using newer versions that have been released since the\npackage was published. The `--locked` flag can be used to force Cargo to use\nthe packaged `Cargo.lock` file if it is available. This may be useful for\nensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact same set of dependencies that\nwere available when the package was published. It may also be useful if a\nnewer version of a dependency is published that no longer builds on your\nsystem, or has other problems. The downside to using `--locked` is that you\nwill not receive any fixes or updates to any dependency. Note that Cargo did\nnot start publishing `Cargo.lock` files until version 1.37, which means\npackages published with prior versions will not have a `Cargo.lock` file\navailable.\n\n### Configuration Discovery\n\nThis command operates on system or user level, not project level.\nThis means that the local [configuration discovery] is ignored.\nInstead, the configuration discovery begins at `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml`. \nIf the package is installed with `--path $PATH`, the local configuration \nwill be used, beginning discovery at `$PATH/.cargo/config.toml`.\n\n[configuration discovery]: ../reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure\n\n## OPTIONS\n\n### Install Options\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{#option \"`--vers` _version_\" \"`--version` _version_\" }}\nSpecify a version to install. This may be a [version\nrequirement](../reference/specifying-dependencies.html), like `~1.2`, to have Cargo\nselect the newest version from the given requirement. If the version does not\nhave a requirement operator (such as `^` or `~`), then it must be in the form\n_MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH_, and will install exactly that version; it is *not*\ntreated as a caret requirement like Cargo dependencies are.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--git` _url_\" }}\nGit URL to install the specified crate from.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--branch` _branch_\" }}\nBranch to use when installing from git.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--tag` _tag_\" }}\nTag to use when installing from git.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--rev` _sha_\" }}\nSpecific commit to use when installing from git.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--path` _path_\" }}\nFilesystem path to local crate to install from.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--list`\" }}\nList all installed packages and their versions.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`-n`\" \"`--dry-run`\" }}\n(unstable) Perform all checks without installing.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`-f`\" \"`--force`\" }}\nForce overwriting existing crates or binaries. This can be used if a package\nhas installed a binary with the same name as another package. This is also\nuseful if something has changed on the system that you want to rebuild with,\nsuch as a newer version of `rustc`.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--no-track`\" }}\nBy default, Cargo keeps track of the installed packages with a metadata file\nstored in the installation root directory. This flag tells Cargo not to use or\ncreate that file. With this flag, Cargo will refuse to overwrite any existing\nfiles unless the `--force` flag is used. This also disables Cargo's ability to\nprotect against multiple concurrent invocations of Cargo installing at the\nsame time.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--bin` _name_...\" }}\nInstall only the specified binary.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--bins`\" }}\nInstall all binaries. This is the default behavior.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--example` _name_...\" }}\nInstall only the specified example.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--examples`\" }}\nInstall all examples.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--root` _dir_\" }}\nDirectory to install packages into.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{> options-registry }}\n\n{{> options-index }}\n\n{{/options}}\n\n{{> section-features }}\n\n### Compilation Options\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{> options-target-triple }}\n\n{{> options-target-dir }}\n\n{{#option \"`--debug`\" }}\nBuild with the `dev` profile instead of the `release` profile.\nSee also the `--profile` option for choosing a specific profile by name.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{> options-profile }}\n\n{{> options-timings }}\n\n{{/options}}\n\n### Manifest Options\n\n{{#options}}\n{{> options-ignore-rust-version }}\n\n{{> options-locked }}\n{{/options}}\n\n### Miscellaneous Options\n\n{{#options}}\n{{> options-jobs }}\n{{> options-keep-going }}\n{{/options}}\n\n### Display Options\n\n{{#options}}\n{{> options-display }}\n\n{{> options-message-format }}\n\n{{/options}}\n\n{{> section-options-common }}\n\n{{> section-environment }}\n\n{{> section-exit-status }}\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n1.

    # cargo-login(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-login --- Log in to a registry

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo login` [_options_] [`--` _args_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will run a credential provider to save a token so that commands
    that require authentication, such as {{man "cargo-publish" 1}}, will be
    automatically authenticated.

    All the arguments following the two dashes (`--`) are passed to the credential provider.

    For the default `cargo:token` credential provider, the token is saved
    in `$CARGO_HOME/credentials.toml`. `CARGO_HOME` defaults to `.cargo`
    in your home directory.

    If a registry has a credential-provider specified, it will be used. Otherwise,
    the providers from the config value `registry.global-credential-providers` will
    be attempted, starting from the end of the list.

    The _token_ will be read from stdin.

    The API token for crates.io may be retrieved from <https://crates.io/me>.

    Take care to keep the token secret, it should not be shared with anyone else.

    # cargo-pkgid(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-pkgid --- Print a fully qualified package specification

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo pkgid` [_options_] [_spec_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Given a _spec_ argument, print out the fully qualified package ID specifier
    for a package or dependency in the current workspace. This command will
    generate an error if _spec_ is ambiguous as to which package it refers to in
    the dependency graph. If no _spec_ is given, then the specifier for the local
    package is printed.

    This command requires that a lockfile is available and dependencies have been
    fetched.

    A package specifier consists of a name, version, and source URL. You are
    allowed to use partial specifiers to succinctly match a specific package as
    long as it matches only one package. This specifier is also used by other parts
    in Cargo, such as {{man "cargo-metadata" 1}} and [JSON messages] emitted by Cargo.

    The format of a _spec_ can be one of the following:

    SPEC Structure             | Example SPEC
    ---------------------------|--------------
    _name_                     | `bitflags`
    _name_`@`_version_         | `bitflags@1.0.4`
    _url_                      | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo`
    _url_`#`_version_          | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#0.33.0`
    _url_`#`_name_             | `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index#bitflags`
    _url_`#`_name_`@`_version_ | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#crates-io@0.21.0`

    The specification grammar can be found in chapter [Package ID Specifications].

    # cargo-init(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-init --- Create a new Cargo package in an existing directory

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo init` [_options_] [_path_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will create a new Cargo manifest in the current directory. Give a
    path as an argument to create in the given directory.

    If there are typically-named Rust source files already in the directory, those
    will be used. If not, then a sample `src/main.rs` file will be created, or
    `src/lib.rs` if `--lib` is passed.

    If the directory is not already in a VCS repository, then a new repository
    is created (see `--vcs` below).

    See {{man "cargo-new" 1}} for a similar command which will create a new package in
    a new directory.

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Init Options

    {{#option "`+`_toolchain_"}}
    If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to `cargo`
    begins with `+`, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such

    {{#option "`--config` _KEY=VALUE_ or _PATH_"}}
    Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in TOML syntax of `KEY=VALUE`,
    or provided as a path to an extra configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times.
    See the [command-line overrides section](../reference/config.html#command-line-overrides) for more information.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`-C` _PATH_"}}
    Changes the current working directory before executing any specified operations. This affects
    things like where cargo looks by default for the project manifest (`Cargo.toml`), as well as
    the directories searched for discovering `.cargo/config.toml`, for example. This option must
    appear before the command name, for example `cargo -C path/to/my-project build`.

    This option is only available on the [nightly
    channel](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html) and
    requires the `-Z unstable-options` flag to enable (see
    [#10098](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098)).
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`-h`" "`--help`"}}

    # cargo-rustc(1)
    {{~*set command="rustc"}}
    {{~*set actionverb="Build"}}
    {{~*set multitarget=true}}

    ## NAME

    cargo-rustc --- Compile the current package, and pass extra options to the compiler

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo rustc` [_options_] [`--` _args_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    The specified target for the current package (or package specified by `-p` if
    provided) will be compiled along with all of its dependencies. The specified
    _args_ will all be passed to the final compiler invocation, not any of the
    dependencies. Note that the compiler will still unconditionally receive
    arguments such as `-L`, `--extern`, and `--crate-type`, and the specified
    _args_ will simply be added to the compiler invocation.

    See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html> for documentation on rustc
    flags.

    {{> description-one-target }}

    To pass flags to all compiler processes spawned by Cargo, use the `RUSTFLAGS`
    [environment variable](../reference/environment-variables.html) or the
    `build.rustflags` [config value](../reference/config.html).

    ## OPTIONS

    {{> section-options-package }}

    ### Target Selection

    When no target selection options are given, `cargo rustc` will build all
    binary and library targets of the selected package.

    {{> options-targets-bin-auto-built }}

    {{> options-targets }}

    {{> section-features }}

    ### Compilation Options

    {{#options}}

    {{> options-target-triple }}

    {{> options-release }}

    {{#option "`--profile` _name_" }}
    Build with the given profile.

    The `rustc` subcommand will treat the following named profiles with special behaviors:

    * `check` --- Builds in the same way as the {{man "cargo-check" 1}} command with
      the `dev` profile.
    * `test` --- Builds in the same way as the {{man "cargo-test" 1}} command,
      enabling building in test mode which will enable tests and enable the `test`
      cfg option. See [rustc
      tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html) for more detail.
    * `bench` --- Builds in the same was as the {{man "cargo-bench" 1}} command,
      similar to the `test` profile.

    See [the reference](../reference/profiles.html) for more details on profiles.
    {{/option}}

    {{> options-timings }}

    {{#option "`--crate-type` _crate-type_"}}
    Build for the given crate type. This flag accepts a comma-separated list of
    1 or more crate types, of which the allowed values are the same as `crate-type`
    field in the manifest for configuring a Cargo target. See
    [`crate-type` field](../reference/cargo-targets.html#the-crate-type-field)
    for possible values.

    If the manifest contains a list, and `--crate-type` is provided,
    the command-line argument value will override what is in the manifest.

    This flag only works when building a `lib` or `example` library target.
    {{/option}}

    {{/options}}

    ### Output Options

    {{#options}}
    {{> options-target-dir }}
    {{/options}}

    ### Display Options

    {{#options}}

    {{> options-display }}

    {{> options-message-format }}

    ## EXAMPLES

    1. Check if your package (not including dependencies) uses unsafe code:

           cargo rustc --lib -- -D unsafe-code

    2. Try an experimental flag on the nightly compiler, such as this which prints
       the size of every type:

           cargo rustc --lib -- -Z print-type-sizes

    3. Override `crate-type` field in Cargo.toml with command-line option:

           cargo rustc --lib --crate-type lib,cdylib

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `cargo-tree page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# cargo-tree(1)\n{{~*set command=\"tree\"}}\n{{~*set actionverb=\"Display\"}}\n{{~*set noall=true}}\n\n## NAME\n\ncargo-tree --- Display a tree visualization of a dependency graph\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n`cargo tree` [_options_]\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nThis command will display a tree of dependencies to the terminal. An example\nof a simple project that depends on the \"rand\" package:\n\n```\nmyproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)\n└── rand v0.7.3\n    ├── getrandom v0.1.14\n    │   ├── cfg-if v0.1.10\n    │   └── libc v0.2.68\n    ├── libc v0.2.68 (*)\n    ├── rand_chacha v0.2.2\n    │   ├── ppv-lite86 v0.2.6\n    │   └── rand_core v0.5.1\n    │       └── getrandom v0.1.14 (*)\n    └── rand_core v0.5.1 (*)\n[build-dependencies]\n└── cc v1.0.50\n```\n\nPackages marked with `(*)` have been \"de-duplicated\". The dependencies for the\npackage have already been shown elsewhere in the graph, and so are not\nrepeated. Use the `--no-dedupe` option to repeat the duplicates.\n\nThe `-e` flag can be used to select the dependency kinds to display. The\n\"features\" kind changes the output to display the features enabled by\neach dependency. For example, `cargo tree -e features`:\n\n```\nmyproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)\n└── log feature \"serde\"\n    └── log v0.4.8\n        ├── serde v1.0.106\n        └── cfg-if feature \"default\"\n            └── cfg-if v0.1.10\n```\n\nIn this tree, `myproject` depends on `log` with the `serde` feature. `log` in\nturn depends on `cfg-if` with \"default\" features. When using `-e features` it\ncan be helpful to use `-i` flag to show how the features flow into a package.\nSee the examples below for more detail.\n\n### Feature Unification\n\nThis command shows a graph much closer to a feature-unified graph Cargo will\nbuild, rather than what you list in `Cargo.toml`. For instance, if you specify\nthe same dependency in both `[dependencies]` and `[dev-dependencies]` but with\ndifferent features on. This command may merge all features and show a `(*)` on\none of the dependency to indicate the duplicate.\n\nAs a result, for a mostly equivalent overview of what `cargo build` does,\n`cargo tree -e normal,build` is pretty close; for a mostly equivalent overview\nof what `cargo test` does, `cargo tree` is pretty close. However, it doesn't\nguarantee the exact equivalence to what Cargo is going to build, since a\ncompilation is complex and depends on lots of different factors.\n\nTo learn more about feature unification, check out this\n[dedicated section](../reference/features.html#feature-unification).\n\n## OPTIONS\n\n### Tree Options\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{#option \"`-i` _spec_\" \"`--invert` _spec_\" }}\nShow the reverse dependencies for the given package. This flag will invert\nthe tree and display the packages that depend on the given package.\n\nNote that in a workspace, by default it will only display the package's\nreverse dependencies inside the tree of the workspace member in the current\ndirectory. The `--workspace` flag can be used to extend it so that it will\nshow the package's reverse dependencies across the entire workspace. The `-p`\nflag can be used to display the package's reverse dependencies only with the\nsubtree of the package given to `-p`.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--prune` _spec_\" }}\nPrune the given package from the display of the dependency tree.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--depth` _depth_\" }}\nMaximum display depth of the dependency tree. A depth of 1 displays the direct\ndependencies, for example.\n\nIf the given value is `workspace`, only shows the dependencies that are member\nof the current workspace, instead.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--no-dedupe`\" }}\nDo not de-duplicate repeated dependencies. Usually, when a package has already\ndisplayed its dependencies, further occurrences will not re-display its\ndependencies, and will include a `(*)` to indicate it has already been shown.\nThis flag will cause those duplicates to be repeated.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`-d`\" \"`--duplicates`\" }}\nShow only dependencies which come in multiple versions (implies `--invert`).\nWhen used with the `-p` flag, only shows duplicates within the subtree of the\ngiven package.\n\nIt can be beneficial for build times and executable sizes to avoid building\nthat same package multiple times. This flag can help identify the offending\npackages. You can then investigate if the package that depends on the\nduplicate with the older version can be updated to the newer version so that\nonly one instance is built.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`-e` _kinds_\" \"`--edges` _kinds_\" }}\nThe dependency kinds to display. Takes a comma separated list of values:\n\n- `all` --- Show all edge kinds.\n- `normal` --- Show normal dependencies.\n- `build` --- Show build dependencies.\n- `dev` --- Show development dependencies.\n- `features` --- Show features enabled by each dependency. If this is the only\n  kind given, then it will automatically include the other dependency kinds.\n- `no-normal` --- Do not include normal dependencies.\n- `no-build` --- Do not include build dependencies.\n- `no-dev` --- Do not include development dependencies.\n- `no-proc-macro` --- Do not include procedural macro dependencies.\n\nThe `normal`, `build`, `dev`, and `all` dependency kinds cannot be mixed with\n`no-normal`, `no-build`, or `no-dev` dependency kinds.\n\nThe default is `normal,build,dev`.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--target` _triple_\" }}\nFilter dependencies matching the given [target triple](../appendix/glossary.html#target). \nThe default is the host platform. Use the value `all` to include *all* targets.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{/options}}\n\n### Tree Formatting Options\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{#option \"`--charset` _charset_\" }}\nChooses the character set to use for the tree. Valid values are \"utf8\" or\n\"ascii\". When unspecified, cargo will auto-select a value.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`-f` _format_\" \"`--format` _format_\" }}\nSet the format string for each package. The default is \"{p}\".\n\nThis is an arbitrary string which will be used to display each package. The following\nstrings will be replaced with the corresponding value:\n\n- `{p}` --- The package name.\n- `{l}` --- The package license.\n- `{r}` --- The package repository URL.\n- `{f}` --- Comma-separated list of package features that are enabled.\n- `{lib}` --- The name, as used in a `use` statement, of the package's library.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{#option \"`--prefix` _prefix_\" }}\nSets how each line is displayed. The _prefix_ value can be one of:\n\n- `indent` (default) --- Shows each line indented as a tree.\n- `depth` --- Show as a list, with the numeric depth printed before each entry.\n- `none` --- Show as a flat list.\n{{/option}}\n\n{{/options}}\n\n{{> section-package-selection }}\n\n### Manifest Options\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{> options-manifest-path }}\n\n{{> options-locked }}\n\n{{> options-lockfile-path }}\n{{/options}}\n\n{{> section-features }}\n\n### Display Options\n\n{{#options}}\n\n{{> options-display }}\n\n{{/options}}\n\n{{> section-options-common }}\n\n{{> section-environment }}\n\n{{> section-exit-status }}\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n1. Display the tree for the package in the current directory:\n\n       cargo tree\n\n2. Display all the packages that depend on the `syn` package:\n\n       cargo tree -i syn\n\n3. Show the features enabled on each package:\n\n       cargo tree --format \"{p} {f}\"\n\n4. Show all packages that are built multiple times. This can happen if multiple\n   semver-incompatible versions appear in the tree (like 1.0.0 and 2.0.0).\n\n       cargo tree -d\n\n5. Explain why features are enabled for the `syn` package:\n\n       cargo tree -e features -i syn\n\n   The `-e features` flag is used to show features. The `-i` flag is used to\n   invert the graph so that it displays the packages that depend on `syn`. An\n   example of what this would display:\n\n   ```\n   syn v1.0.17\n   ├── syn feature \"clone-impls\"\n   │   └── syn feature \"default\"\n   │       └── rustversion v1.0.2\n   │           └── rustversion feature \"default\"\n   │               └── myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)\n   │                   └── myproject feature \"default\" (command-line)\n   ├── syn feature \"default\" (*)\n   ├── syn feature \"derive\"\n   │   └── syn feature \"default\" (*)\n   ├── syn feature \"full\"\n   │   └── rustversion v1.0.2 (*)\n   ├── syn feature \"parsing\"\n   │   └── syn feature \"default\" (*)\n   ├── syn feature \"printing\"\n   │   └── syn feature \"default\" (*)\n   ├── syn feature \"proc-macro\"\n   │   └── syn feature \"default\" (*)\n   └── syn feature \"quote\"\n       ├── syn feature \"printing\" (*)\n       └── syn feature \"proc-macro\" (*)\n   ```\n\n   To read this graph, you can follow the chain for each feature from the root\n   to see why it is included. For example, the \"full\" feature is added by the\n   `rustversion` crate which is included from `myproject` (with the default\n   features), and `myproject` is the package selected on the command-line. All\n   of the other `syn` features are added by the \"default\" feature (\"quote\" is\n   added by \"printing\" and \"proc-macro\", both of which are default features).\n\n   If you're having difficulty cross-referencing the de-duplicated `(*)`\n   entries, try with the `--no-dedupe` flag to get the full output.\n\n## SEE ALSO\n{{man \"cargo\" 1}}, {{man \"cargo-metadata\" 1}}"

    ## NAME

    cargo-new --- Create a new Cargo package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo new` [_options_] _path_

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will create a new Cargo package in the given directory. This
    includes a simple template with a `Cargo.toml` manifest, sample source file,
    and a VCS ignore file. If the directory is not already in a VCS repository,
    then a new repository is created (see `--vcs` below).

    See {{man "cargo-init" 1}} for a similar command which will create a new manifest
    in an existing directory.

    ## NAME

    cargo-check --- Check the current package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo check` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Check a local package and all of its dependencies for errors. This will
    essentially compile the packages without performing the final step of code
    generation, which is faster than running `cargo build`. The compiler will save
    metadata files to disk so that future runs will reuse them if the source has
    not been modified. Some diagnostics and errors are only emitted during code
    generation, so they inherently won't be reported with `cargo check`.

    ## OPTIONS

    {{> section-package-selection }}

    ### Target Selection

    When no target selection options are given, `cargo check` will check all
    binary and library targets of the selected packages. Binaries are skipped if
    they have `required-features` that are missing.

    # cargo-update(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-update --- Update dependencies as recorded in the local lock file

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo update` [_options_] _spec_

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will update dependencies in the `Cargo.lock` file to the latest
    version. If the `Cargo.lock` file does not exist, it will be created with the
    latest available versions.

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Update Options

    {{#options}}

    {{#option "_spec_..." }}
    Update only the specified packages. This flag may be specified
    multiple times. See {{man "cargo-pkgid" 1}} for the SPEC format.

    If packages are specified with _spec_, then a conservative update of
    the lockfile will be performed. This means that only the dependency specified
    by SPEC will be updated. Its transitive dependencies will be updated only if
    SPEC cannot be updated without updating dependencies.  All other dependencies
    will remain locked at their currently recorded versions.

    If _spec_ is not specified, all dependencies are updated.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--recursive`" }}
    When used with _spec_, dependencies of _spec_ are forced to update as well.
    Cannot be used with `--precise`.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--precise` _precise_" }}
    When used with _spec_, allows you to specify a specific version number to set
    the package to. If the package comes from a git repository, this can be a git
    revision (such as a SHA hash or tag).

    While not recommended, you can specify a yanked version of a package.
    When possible, try other non-yanked SemVer-compatible versions or seek help
    from the maintainers of the package.

    A compatible `pre-release` version can also be specified even when the version
    requirement in `Cargo.toml` doesn't contain any pre-release identifier (nightly only).
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--breaking` _directory_" }}
    Update _spec_ to latest SemVer-breaking version.

    Version requirements will be modified to allow this update.

    This only applies to dependencies when
    - The package is a dependency of a workspace member
    - The dependency is not renamed
    - A SemVer-incompatible version is available
    - The "SemVer operator" is used (`^` which is the default)

    This option is unstable and available only on the
    [nightly channel](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html)
    and requires the `-Z unstable-options` flag to enable.
    See <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12425> for more information.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`-w`" "`--workspace`" }}
    Attempt to update only packages defined in the workspace. Other packages
    are updated only if they don't already exist in the lockfile. This
    option is useful for updating `Cargo.lock` after you've changed version
    numbers in `Cargo.toml`.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--dry-run`" }}
    Displays what would be updated, but doesn't actually write the lockfile.

    ## NAME

    cargo-logout --- Remove an API token from the registry locally

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo logout` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will run a credential provider to remove a saved token.

    For the default `cargo:token` credential provider, credentials are stored
    in `$CARGO_HOME/credentials.toml` where `$CARGO_HOME` defaults to `.cargo`
    in your home directory.

    If a registry has a credential-provider specified, it will be used. Otherwise,
    the providers from the config value `registry.global-credential-providers` will
    be attempted, starting from the end of the list.

    If `--registry` is not specified, then the credentials for the default
    registry will be removed (configured by
    [`registry.default`](../reference/config.html#registrydefault), which defaults
    to <https://crates.io/>).

    This will not revoke the token on the server. If you need to revoke the token,
    visit the registry website and follow its instructions (see
    <https://crates.io/me> to revoke the token for <https://crates.io/>).

    `required-features` that are missing.

    The default behavior can be changed by setting `doc = false` for the target in
    the manifest settings. Using target selection options will ignore the `doc`
    flag and will always document the given target.

    remaining warnings will be displayed when the check process is finished. For
    example if you'd like to apply all fixes to the current package, you can run:

        cargo fix

    which behaves the same as `cargo check --all-targets`.

    `cargo fix` is only capable of fixing code that is normally compiled with
    `cargo check`. If code is conditionally enabled with optional features, you
    will need to enable those features for that code to be analyzed:

        cargo fix --features foo

    Similarly, other `cfg` expressions like platform-specific code will need to
    pass `--target` to fix code for the given target.

        cargo fix --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

    If you encounter any problems with `cargo fix` or otherwise have any questions
    or feature requests please don't hesitate to file an issue at
    <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo>.

    ### Edition migration

    The `cargo fix` subcommand can also be used to migrate a package from one
    [edition] to the next. The general procedure is:

    1. Run `cargo fix --edition`. Consider also using the `--all-features` flag if
       your project has multiple features. You may also want to run `cargo fix
       --edition` multiple times with different `--target` flags if your project
       has platform-specific code gated by `cfg` attributes.
    2. Modify `Cargo.toml` to set the [edition field] to the new edition.
    3. Run your project tests to verify that everything still works. If new
       warnings are issued, you may want to consider running `cargo fix` again
       (without the `--edition` flag) to apply any suggestions given by the
       compiler.

    And hopefully that's it! Just keep in mind of the caveats mentioned above that
    `cargo fix` cannot update code for inactive features or `cfg` expressions.
    Also, in some rare cases the compiler is unable to automatically migrate all
    code to the new edition, and this may require manual changes after building
    with the new edition.

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Fix options

    {{#options}}

    {{#option "`--broken-code`" }}
    Fix code even if it already has compiler errors. This is useful if `cargo fix`
    fails to apply the changes. It will apply the changes and leave the broken
    code in the working directory for you to inspect and manually fix.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--edition`" }}
    Apply changes that will update the code to the next edition. This will not
    update the edition in the `Cargo.toml` manifest, which must be updated
    manually after `cargo fix --edition` has finished.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--edition-idioms`" }}
    Apply suggestions that will update code to the preferred style for the current
    edition.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--allow-no-vcs`" }}
    Fix code even if a VCS was not detected.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--allow-dirty`" }}
    Fix code even if the working directory has changes (including staged changes).
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--allow-staged`" }}
    Fix code even if the working directory has staged changes.
    {{/option}}

    {{/options}}

    {{> section-package-selection }}

    ### Target Selection

    When no target selection options are given, `cargo fix` will fix all targets
    (`--all-targets` implied). Binaries are skipped if they have
    `required-features` that are missing.

    # cargo-package(1)
    {{~*set command="package"}}
    {{~*set actionverb="Package"}}
    {{~*set noall=true}}
    {{~*set multitarget=true}}

    ## NAME

    cargo-package --- Assemble the local package into a distributable tarball

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo package` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will create a distributable, compressed `.crate` file with the
    source code of the package in the current directory. The resulting file will be
    stored in the `target/package` directory. This performs the following steps:

    1. Load and check the current workspace, performing some basic checks.
        - Path dependencies are not allowed unless they have a version key. Cargo
          will ignore the path key for dependencies in published packages.
          `dev-dependencies` do not have this restriction.
    2. Create the compressed `.crate` file.
        - The original `Cargo.toml` file is rewritten and normalized.
        - `[patch]`, `[replace]`, and `[workspace]` sections are removed from the
          manifest.
        - `Cargo.lock` is always included. When missing, a new lock file will be
          generated unless the `--exclude-lockfile` flag is used. {{man "cargo-install" 1}}
          will use the packaged lock file if the `--locked` flag is used.
        - A `.cargo_vcs_info.json` file is included that contains information
          about the current VCS checkout hash if available, as well as a flag if the
          worktree is dirty.
        - Symlinks are flattened to their target files.
        - Files and directories are included or excluded based on rules mentioned in
          [the `[include]` and `[exclude]` fields](../reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields).

    3. Extract the `.crate` file and build it to verify it can build.
        - This will rebuild your package from scratch to ensure that it can be
          built from a pristine state. The `--no-verify` flag can be used to skip
          this step.
    4. Check that build scripts did not modify any source files.

    The list of files included can be controlled with the `include` and `exclude`
    fields in the manifest.

    See [the reference](../reference/publishing.html) for more details about
    packaging and publishing.

    ### .cargo_vcs_info.json format

    Will generate a `.cargo_vcs_info.json` in the following format

    ```javascript
    {
     "git": {
       "sha1": "aac20b6e7e543e6dd4118b246c77225e3a3a1302",
       "dirty": true
     },
     "path_in_vcs": ""
    }
    ```

    `dirty` indicates that the Git worktree was dirty when the package
    was built.

    `path_in_vcs` will be set to a repo-relative path for packages
    in subdirectories of the version control repository.

    The compatibility of this file is maintained under the same policy
    as the JSON output of {{man "cargo-metadata" 1}}.

    Note that this file provides a best-effort snapshot of the VCS information.
    However, the provenance of the package is not verified.
    There is no guarantee that the source code in the tarball matches the VCS information.

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Package Options

    {{#options}}

    {{#option "`-l`" "`--list`" }}
    Print files included in a package without making one.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--no-verify`" }}
    Don't verify the contents by building them.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--no-metadata`" }}
    Ignore warnings about a lack of human-usable metadata (such as the description
    or the license).
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--allow-dirty`" }}
    Allow working directories with uncommitted VCS changes to be packaged.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--exclude-lockfile`" }}
    Don't include the lock file when packaging.

    This flag is not for general use.
    Some tools may expect a lock file to be present (e.g. `cargo install --locked`).
    Consider other options before using this.
    {{/option}}

    {{> options-index }}

    {{#option "`--registry` _registry_"}}
    Name of the registry to package for; see `cargo publish --help` for more details
    about configuration of registry names. The packages will not be published
    to this registry, but if we are packaging multiple inter-dependent crates,
    lock-files will be generated under the assumption that dependencies will be
    published to this registry.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--message-format` _fmt_" }}
    Specifies the output message format.
    Currently, it only works with `--list` and affects the file listing format.
    This is unstable and requires `-Zunstable-options`.
    Valid output formats:

    - `human` (default): Display in a file-per-line format.
    - `json`: Emit machine-readable JSON information about each package.
      One package per JSON line (Newline delimited JSON).
      ```javascript

    # cargo-locate-project(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-locate-project --- Print a JSON representation of a Cargo.toml file's location

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo locate-project` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will print a JSON object to stdout with the full path to the manifest. The
    manifest is found by searching upward for a file named `Cargo.toml` starting from the current
    working directory.

    If the project happens to be a part of a workspace, the manifest of the project, rather than
    the workspace root, is output. This can be overridden by the `--workspace` flag. The root
    workspace is found by traversing further upward or by using the field `package.workspace` after
    locating the manifest of a workspace member.

    ## OPTIONS

    {{#options}}

    {{#option "`--workspace`" }}
    Locate the `Cargo.toml` at the root of the workspace, as opposed to the current
    workspace member.
    {{/option}}

    cargo-fetch --- Fetch dependencies of a package from the network

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo fetch` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    If a `Cargo.lock` file is available, this command will ensure that all of the
    git dependencies and/or registry dependencies are downloaded and locally
    available. Subsequent Cargo commands will be able to run offline after a `cargo
    fetch` unless the lock file changes.

    If the lock file is not available, then this command will generate the lock
    file before fetching the dependencies.

    If `--target` is not specified, then all target dependencies are fetched.

    See also the [cargo-prefetch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-prefetch)
    plugin which adds a command to download popular crates. This may be useful if
    you plan to use Cargo without a network with the `--offline` flag.

    # cargo-vendor(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-vendor --- Vendor all dependencies locally

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo vendor` [_options_] [_path_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This cargo subcommand will vendor all crates.io and git dependencies for a
    project into the specified directory at `<path>`. After this command completes
    the vendor directory specified by `<path>` will contain all remote sources from
    dependencies specified. Additional manifests beyond the default one can be
    specified with the `-s` option.

    The configuration necessary to use the vendored sources would be printed to
    stdout after `cargo vendor` completes the vendoring process.
    You will need to add or redirect it to your Cargo configuration file,
    which is usually `.cargo/config.toml` locally for the current package.

    Cargo treats vendored sources as read-only as it does to registry and git sources.
    If you intend to modify a crate from a remote source,
    use `[patch]` or a `path` dependency pointing to a local copy of that crate.
    Cargo will then correctly handle the crate on incremental rebuilds,
    as it knows that it is no longer a read-only dependency.

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Vendor Options

    {{#options}}

    {{#option "`-s` _manifest_" "`--sync` _manifest_" }}
    Specify an extra `Cargo.toml` manifest to workspaces which should also be
    vendored and synced to the output. May be specified multiple times.
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--no-delete`" }}
    Don't delete the "vendor" directory when vendoring, but rather keep all
    existing contents of the vendor directory
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--respect-source-config`" }}
    Instead of ignoring `[source]` configuration by default in `.cargo/config.toml`
    read it and use it when downloading crates from crates.io, for example
    {{/option}}

    {{#option "`--versioned-dirs`" }}
    Normally versions are only added to disambiguate multiple versions of the
    same package. This option causes all directories in the "vendor" directory
    to be versioned, which makes it easier to track the history of vendored
    packages over time, and can help with the performance of re-vendoring when
    only a subset of the packages have changed.

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo test` [_options_] [_testname_] [`--` _test-options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Compile and execute unit, integration, and documentation tests.

    The test filtering argument `TESTNAME` and all the arguments following the two
    dashes (`--`) are passed to the test binaries and thus to _libtest_ (rustc's
    built in unit-test and micro-benchmarking framework).  If you're passing
    arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after `--` go to the binary,
    the ones before go to Cargo.  For details about libtest's arguments see the
    output of `cargo test -- --help` and check out the rustc book's chapter on
    how tests work at <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html>.

    As an example, this will filter for tests with `foo` in their name and run them
    on 3 threads in parallel:

        cargo test foo -- --test-threads 3

    Tests are built with the `--test` option to `rustc` which creates a special
    executable by linking your code with libtest. The executable automatically
    runs all functions annotated with the `#[test]` attribute in multiple threads.
    `#[bench]` annotated functions will also be run with one iteration to verify
    that they are functional.

    If the package contains multiple test targets, each target compiles to a
    special executable as aforementioned, and then is run serially.

    The libtest harness may be disabled by setting `harness = false` in the target
    manifest settings, in which case your code will need to provide its own `main`
    function to handle running tests.

    ### Documentation tests

    Documentation tests are also run by default, which is handled by `rustdoc`. It
    extracts code samples from documentation comments of the library target, and
    then executes them.

    Different from normal test targets, each code block compiles to a doctest
    executable on the fly with `rustc`. These executables run in parallel in
    separate processes. The compilation of a code block is in fact a part of test
    function controlled by libtest, so some options such as `--jobs` might not
    take effect. Note that this execution model of doctests is not guaranteed
    and may change in the future; beware of depending on it.

    See the [rustdoc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/) for more information
    on writing doc tests.

    ### Working directory of tests

    The working directory when running each unit and integration test is set to the
    root directory of the package the test belongs to.
    Setting the working directory of tests to the package's root directory makes it
    possible for tests to reliably access the package's files using relative paths,
    regardless from where `cargo test` was executed from.

    For documentation tests, the working directory when invoking `rustdoc` is set to
    the workspace root directory, and is also the directory `rustdoc` uses as the
    compilation directory of each documentation test.
    The working directory when running each documentation test is set to the root
    directory of the package the test belongs to, and is controlled via `rustdoc`'s
    `--test-run-directory` option.

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Test Options

    {{> options-test }}

    {{> section-package-selection }}

    ### Target Selection

    When no target selection options are given, `cargo test` will build the
    following targets of the selected packages:

    - lib --- used to link with binaries, examples, integration tests, and doc tests
    - bins (only if integration tests are built and required features are
      available)
    - examples --- to ensure they compile
    - lib as a unit test
    - bins as unit tests
    - integration tests
    - doc tests for the lib target

    The default behavior can be changed by setting the `test` flag for the target
    in the manifest settings. Setting examples to `test = true` will build and run
    the example as a test, replacing the example's `main` function with the
    libtest harness. If you don't want the `main` function replaced, also include
    `harness = false`, in which case the example will be built and executed as-is.

    Setting targets to `test = false` will stop them from being tested by default.
    Target selection options that take a target by name (such as `--example foo`)
    ignore the `test` flag and will always test the given target.

    Doc tests for libraries may be disabled by setting `doctest = false` for the
    library in the manifest.

    See [Configuring a target](../reference/cargo-targets.html#configuring-a-target)
    for more information on per-target settings.

    {{> options-targets-bin-auto-built }}

    {{> options-targets }}

    {{#options}}

    {{#option "`--doc`" }}
    Test only the library's documentation. This cannot be mixed with other
    target options.
    {{/option}}

    {{/options}}

    {{> section-features }}

    ### Compilation Options

    {{#options}}

    {{> options-target-triple }}

    {{> options-release }}

    {{> options-profile }}

    {{> options-timings }}

    {{/options}}

    ### Output Options

    {{#options}}
    {{> options-target-dir }}
    {{/options}}

    ### Display Options

    By default the Rust test harness hides output from test execution to keep
    results readable. Test output can be recovered (e.g., for debugging) by passing
    `--nocapture` to the test binaries:

        cargo test -- --nocapture

    {{#options}}

    {{> options-display }}

    {{> options-message-format }}

    {{/options}}

    ### Manifest Options

    {{#options}}

    {{> options-manifest-path }}

    {{> options-ignore-rust-version }}

    {{> options-locked }}

    {{> options-lockfile-path }}

    {{/options}}

    {{> section-options-common }}

    ### Miscellaneous Options

    The `--jobs` argument affects the building of the test executable but does not
    affect how many threads are used when running the tests. The Rust test harness
    includes an option to control the number of threads used:

        cargo test -j 2 -- --test-threads=2

    {{#options}}

    {{> options-jobs }}
    {{> options-future-incompat }}

    {{/options}}

    While `cargo test` involves compilation, it does not provide a `--keep-going`
    flag. Use `--no-fail-fast` to run as many tests as possible without stopping at
    the first failure. To "compile" as many tests as possible, use `--tests` to
    build test binaries separately. For example:

        cargo build --tests --keep-going
        cargo test --tests --no-fail-fast

    {{> section-environment }}

    {{> section-exit-status }}

    ## EXAMPLES

    1. Execute all the unit and integration tests of the current package:

           cargo test

    2. Run only tests whose names match against a filter string:

           cargo test name_filter

    3. Run only a specific test within a specific integration test:

           cargo test --test int_test_name -- modname::test_name

    # cargo-yank(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-yank --- Remove a pushed crate from the index

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo yank` [_options_] _crate_@_version_\
    `cargo yank` [_options_] `--version` _version_ [_crate_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    The yank command removes a previously published crate's version from the
    server's index. This command does not delete any data, and the crate will
    still be available for download via the registry's download link.

    Cargo will not use a yanked version for any new project or checkout without a
    pre-existing lockfile, and will generate an error if there are no longer
    any compatible versions for your crate.

    This command requires you to be authenticated with either the `--token` option
    or using {{man "cargo-login" 1}}.

    If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from the
    current directory.

    ### How yank works

    For example, the `foo` crate published version `1.5.0` and another crate `bar`
    declared a dependency on version `foo = "1.5"`. Now `foo` releases a new, but
    not semver compatible, version `2.0.0`, and finds a critical issue with `1.5.0`.
    If `1.5.0` is yanked, no new project or checkout without an existing lockfile
    will be able to use crate `bar` as it relies on `1.5`.

    In this case, the maintainers of `foo` should first publish a semver compatible
    version such as `1.5.1` prior to yanking `1.5.0` so that `bar` and all projects
    that depend on `bar` will continue to work.

    As another example, consider a crate `bar` with published versions `1.5.0`,
    `1.5.1`, `1.5.2`, `2.0.0` and `3.0.0`. The following table identifies the
    versions cargo could use in the absence of a lockfile for different SemVer
    requirements, following a given release being yanked:

    | Yanked Version / SemVer requirement | `bar = "1.5.0"`                         | `bar = "=1.5.0"` | `bar = "2.0.0"`  |
    |-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
    | `1.5.0`                             | Use either `1.5.1` or `1.5.2`           | **Return Error** | Use `2.0.0`      |
    | `1.5.1`                             | Use either `1.5.0` or `1.5.2`           | Use `1.5.0`      | Use `2.0.0`      |
    | `2.0.0`                             | Use either `1.5.0`, `1.5.1` or `1.5.2`  | Use `1.5.0`      | **Return Error** |

    ### When to yank

    Crates should only be yanked in exceptional circumstances, for example, an
    accidental publish, an unintentional SemVer breakages, or a significantly
    broken and unusable crate. In the case of security vulnerabilities, [RustSec]
    is typically a less disruptive mechanism to inform users and encourage them
    to upgrade, and avoids the possibility of significant downstream disruption
    irrespective of susceptibility to the vulnerability in question.

    A common workflow is to yank a crate having already published a semver
    compatible version, to reduce the probability of preventing dependent
    crates from compiling.

    When addressing copyright, licensing, or personal data issues with a published
    crate, simply yanking it may not suffice. In such cases, contact the maintainers
    of the registry you used. For crates.io, refer to their [policies] and contact
    them at <help@crates.io>.

    If credentials have been leaked, the recommended course of action is to revoke
    them immediately. Once a crate has been published, it is impossible to determine
    if the leaked credentials have been copied. Yanking the crate only prevents new
    users from downloading it, but cannot stop those who have already downloaded it
    from keeping or even spreading the leaked credentials.

    # Running Tests

    Using `cargo test` is usually sufficient for running the full test suite. This
    can take a few minutes, so you may want to use more targeted flags to pick the
    specific test you want to run, such as `cargo test --test testsuite
    -- check::check_success`.

    ## Running nightly tests

    Some tests only run on the nightly toolchain, and will be ignored on other
    channels. It is recommended that you run tests with both nightly and stable to
    ensure everything is working as expected.

    Some of the nightly tests require the `rustc-dev` and `llvm-tools-preview`
    rustup components installed. These components include the compiler as a
    library. This may already be installed with your nightly toolchain, but if it
    isn't, run `rustup component add rustc-dev llvm-tools-preview
    --toolchain=nightly`.

    ## Running cross tests

    Some tests exercise cross compiling to a different target. This will require
    you to install the appropriate target. This typically is the 32-bit target of
    your host platform. For example, if your host is a 64-bit
    `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, then you should install the 32-bit target with
    `rustup target add i686-unknown-linux-gnu`. If you don't have the alternate
    target installed, there should be an error message telling you what to do. You
    may also need to install additional tools for the target. For example, on Ubuntu
    you should install the `gcc-multilib` package.

    If you can't install an alternate target, you can set the
    `CFG_DISABLE_CROSS_TESTS=1` environment variable to disable these tests. The
    Windows cross tests only support the MSVC toolchain.

    ## Running build-std tests

    The `build-std` tests are disabled by default, but you can run them by setting
    the `CARGO_RUN_BUILD_STD_TESTS=1` environment variable and running `cargo test
    --test build-std`. This requires the nightly channel, and also requires the
    `rust-src` component installed with `rustup component add rust-src
    --toolchain=nightly`.

    ## Running with `gitoxide` as default git backend in tests

    By default, the `git2` backend is used for most git operations. As tests need to explicitly
    opt-in to use nightly features and feature flags, adjusting all tests to run with nightly
    and `-Zgitoxide` is unfeasible.

    This is why the private environment variable named `__CARGO_USE_GITOXIDE_INSTEAD_OF_GIT2` can be
    set while running tests to automatically enable the `-Zgitoxide` flag implicitly, allowing to
    test `gitoxide` for the entire cargo test suite.

    ## Running public network tests

    Some (very rare) tests involve connecting to the public internet.
    These tests are disabled by default,
    but you can run them by setting the `CARGO_PUBLIC_NETWORK_TESTS=1` environment variable.
    Additionally our CI suite has a smoke test for fetching dependencies.
    For most contributors, you will never need to bother with this.

    ## Running container tests

    Tests marked with `container_test` involve running Docker to test more complex configurations.
    These tests are disabled by default,
    but you can run them by setting the `CARGO_CONTAINER_TESTS=1` environment variable.
    You will need to have Docker installed and running to use these.

    # Benchmarking and Profiling

    ## Internal profiler

    Cargo leverages [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing)
    as a basic, hierarchical built-in profiler.

    Environment variables:
    - `CARGO_LOG_PROFILE=<true|1>`: log tracing events to a file in the current working directory
    - `CARGO_LOG_PROFILE_CAPTURE_ARGS=<true|1>`: include arguments in the events

    At process exit, your trace will be in a file like `trace-1668480819035032.json`.
    Open that file with [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev) (or chrome://tracing) to browse your trace.

    Example:
    ```console
    $ # Output first three levels of profiling info
    $ CARGO_LOG_PROFILE=true cargo generate-lockfile
    ```

    **Note:** This is intended for the development of cargo and there are no compatibility guarantees on this functionality.

    ## Benchmarking

    ### Benchsuite

    Head over to the [`benches`
    directory](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/benches) for more
    information about the benchmarking suite.

    ### Informal benchmarking

    The overhead for starting a build should be kept as low as possible
    (preferably, well under 0.5 seconds on most projects and systems). Currently,
    the primary parts that affect this are:

    * Running the resolver.
    * Querying the index.
    * Checking git dependencies.
    * Scanning the local project.
    * Building the unit dependency graph.

    One way to test this is to use [hyperfine]. This is a tool that can be used to
    measure the difference between different commands and settings. Usually this
    is done by measuring the time it takes for `cargo build` to finish in a large
    project where the build is fresh (no actual compilation is performed). Just
    run `cargo build` once before using hyperfine.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `writing page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Writing Tests\n\nThe following focuses on writing an integration test. However, writing unit\ntests is also encouraged!\n\n## Testsuite\n\nCargo has a wide variety of integration tests that execute the `cargo` binary\nand verify its behavior, located in the [`testsuite`] directory.  The\n[`support`] crate and [`snapbox`] contain many helpers to make this process easy.\n\nThere are two styles of tests that can roughly be categorized as\n- functional tests\n  - The fixture is programmatically defined\n  - The assertions may be in-source snapshots, hard-coded strings, or programmatically generated\n  - Easier to share in an issue as a code block is completely self-contained\n- ui tests\n  - The fixture is file-based\n  - The assertions use file-backed snapshots that can be updated with an env variable\n  - Easier to review the expected behavior of the command as more details are included\n  - Easier to get up and running from an existing project\n  - Easier to reason about as everything is just files in the repo\n\nThese tests typically work by creating a temporary \"project\" with a\n`Cargo.toml` file, executing the `cargo` binary process, and checking the\nstdout and stderr output against the expected output.\n\n### Functional Tests\n\nGenerally, a functional test will be placed in `tests/testsuite/<command>.rs` and will look roughly like:\n```rust,ignore\nuse cargo_test_support::prelude::*;\nuse cargo_test_support::str;\nuse cargo_test_support::project;\n\n#[cargo_test]\nfn <description>() {\n    let p = project()\n        .file(\"src/main.rs\", r#\"fn main() { println!(\"hi!\"); }\"#)\n        .build();\n\n    p.cargo(\"run --bin foo\")\n        .with_stderr_data(str![[r#\"\n[COMPILING] foo [..]\n[FINISHED] [..]\n[RUNNING] `target/debug/foo`\n\"#]])\n        .with_stdout_data(str![[\"hi!\"]])\n        .run();\n}\n```\n\nThe [`#[cargo_test]` attribute][cargo_test attribute] is used in place of\n`#[test]` to inject some setup code and declare requirements for running the\ntest.\n\n[`ProjectBuilder`] via `project()`:\n- Each project is in a separate directory in the sandbox\n- If you do not specify a `Cargo.toml` manifest using `file()`, one is\n  automatically created with a project name of `foo` using `basic_manifest()`.\n\n[`Execs`] via `p.cargo(...)`:\n- This executes the command and evaluates different assertions\n  - See [`support::compare`] for an explanation of the string pattern matching.\n    Patterns are used to make it easier to match against the expected output.\n\n#### Testing Nightly Features\n\nIf you are testing a Cargo feature that only works on \"nightly\" Cargo, then\nyou need to call `masquerade_as_nightly_cargo` on the process builder and pass \nthe name of the feature as the reason, like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\np.cargo(\"build\").masquerade_as_nightly_cargo(&[\"print-im-a-teapot\"])\n```\n\nIf you are testing a feature that only works on *nightly rustc* (such as\nbenchmarks), then you should use the `nightly` option of the `cargo_test`\nattribute, like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\n#[cargo_test(nightly, reason = \"-Zfoo is unstable\")]\n```\n\nThis will cause the test to be ignored if not running on the nightly toolchain.\n\n#### Specifying Dependencies\n\nYou should not write any tests that use the network such as contacting\ncrates.io. Typically, simple path dependencies are the easiest way to add a\ndependency. Example:\n\n```rust,ignore\nlet p = project()\n    .file(\"Cargo.toml\", r#\"\n        [package]\n        name = \"foo\"\n        version = \"1.0.0\"\n\n        [dependencies]\n        bar = {path = \"bar\"}\n    \"#)\n    .file(\"src/lib.rs\", \"extern crate bar;\")\n    .file(\"bar/Cargo.toml\", &basic_manifest(\"bar\", \"1.0.0\"))\n    .file(\"bar/src/lib.rs\", \"\")\n    .build();\n```\n\nIf you need to test with registry dependencies, see\n[`support::registry::Package`] for creating packages you can depend on.\n\nIf you need to test git dependencies, see [`support::git`] to create a git\ndependency.\n\n#### Cross compilation\n\nThere are some utilities to help support tests that need to work against a\ntarget other than the host. See [Running cross\ntests](running.md#running-cross-tests) for more an introduction on cross\ncompilation tests.\n\nTests that need to do cross-compilation should include this at the top of the\ntest to disable it in scenarios where cross compilation isn't available:\n\n```rust,ignore\nif cargo_test_support::cross_compile::disabled() {\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nThe name of the target can be fetched with the [`cross_compile::alternate()`]\nfunction. The name of the host target can be fetched with\n[`cargo_test_support::rustc_host()`].\n\nThe cross-tests need to distinguish between targets which can *build* versus\nthose which can actually *run* the resulting executable. Unfortunately, macOS is\ncurrently unable to run an alternate target (Apple removed 32-bit support a\nlong time ago). For building, `x86_64-apple-darwin` will target\n`x86_64-apple-ios` as its alternate. However, the iOS target can only execute\nbinaries if the iOS simulator is installed and configured. The simulator is\nnot available in CI, so all tests that need to run cross-compiled binaries are\ndisabled on CI. If you are running on macOS locally, and have the simulator\ninstalled, then it should be able to run them.\n\nIf the test needs to run the cross-compiled binary, then it should have\nsomething like this to exit the test before doing so:\n\n```rust,ignore\nif cargo_test_support::cross_compile::can_run_on_host() {\n    return;\n}\n```\n\n[`cross_compile::alternate()`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/d58902e22e148426193cf3b8c4449fd3c05c0afd/crates/cargo-test-support/src/cross_compile.rs#L208-L225\n[`cargo_test_support::rustc_host()`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/d58902e22e148426193cf3b8c4449fd3c05c0afd/crates/cargo-test-support/src/lib.rs#L1137-L1140\n\n### UI Tests\n\nUI Tests are a bit more spread out and generally look like:\n\n`tests/testsuite/<command>/mod.rs`:\n```rust,ignore\nmod <case>;\n```\n\n`tests/testsuite/<command>/<case>/mod.rs`:\n```rust,ignore\nuse cargo_test_support::compare::assert_ui;\nuse cargo_test_support::current_dir;\nuse cargo_test_support::file;\nuse cargo_test_support::prelude::*;\nuse cargo_test_support::Project;\n\n#[cargo_test]\nfn case() {\n    let project = Project::from_template(current_dir!().join(\"in\"));\n    let project_root = project.root();\n    let cwd = &project_root;\n\n    snapbox::cmd::Command::cargo_ui()\n        .arg(\"run\")\n        .arg_line(\"--bin foo\")\n        .current_dir(cwd)\n        .assert()\n        .success()\n        .stdout_matches(file!(\"stdout.log\"))\n        .stderr_matches(file!(\"stderr.log\"));\n\n    assert_ui().subset_matches(current_dir!().join(\"out\"), &project_root);\n}\n```\n\nThen populate\n- `tests/testsuite/<command>/<case>/in` with the project's directory structure\n- `tests/testsuite/<command>/<case>/out` with the files you want verified\n- `tests/testsuite/<command>/<case>/stdout.log` with nothing\n- `tests/testsuite/<command>/<case>/stderr.log` with nothing\n\n`#[cargo_test]`:\n- This is used in place of `#[test]`\n- This attribute injects code which does some setup before starting the\n  test, creating a filesystem \"sandbox\" under the \"cargo integration test\"\n  directory for each test such as\n  `/path/to/cargo/target/cit/t123/`\n- The sandbox will contain a `home` directory that will be used instead of your normal home directory\n\n`Project`:\n- The project is copied from a directory in the repo\n- Each project is in a separate directory in the sandbox\n\n[`Command`] via `Command::cargo_ui()`:\n- Set up and run a command.\n\n[`OutputAssert`] via `Command::assert()`:\n- Perform assertions on the result of the [`Command`]\n\n[`Assert`] via `assert_ui()`:\n- Verify the command modified the file system as expected\n\n#### Updating Snapshots\n\nThe project, stdout, and stderr snapshots can be updated by running with the\n`SNAPSHOTS=overwrite` environment variable, like:\n```console\n$ SNAPSHOTS=overwrite cargo test\n```\n\nBe sure to check the snapshots to make sure they make sense.\n\n#### Testing Nightly Features\n\nIf you are testing a Cargo feature that only works on \"nightly\" Cargo, then\nyou need to call `masquerade_as_nightly_cargo` on the process builder and pass\nthe name of the feature as the reason, like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\n    snapbox::cmd::Command::cargo()\n        .masquerade_as_nightly_cargo(&[\"print-im-a-teapot\"])\n```\n\nIf you are testing a feature that only works on *nightly rustc* (such as\nbenchmarks), then you should use the `nightly` option of the `cargo_test`\nattribute, like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\n#[cargo_test(nightly, reason = \"-Zfoo is unstable\")]\n```\n\nThis will cause the test to be ignored if not running on the nightly toolchain.\n\n### Platform-specific Notes\n\nWhen checking output, use `/` for paths even on Windows: the actual output\nof `\\` on Windows will be replaced with `/`.\n\nBe careful when executing binaries on Windows. You should not rename, delete,\nor overwrite a binary immediately after running it. Under some conditions\nWindows will fail with errors like \"directory not empty\" or \"failed to remove\"\nor \"access is denied\".\n\n## Debugging tests\n\nIn some cases, you may need to dig into a test that is not working as you\nexpect, or you just generally want to experiment within the sandbox\nenvironment. The general process is:\n\n1. Build the sandbox for the test you want to investigate. For example:\n\n   `cargo test --test testsuite -- features2::inactivate_targets`.\n2. In another terminal, head into the sandbox directory to inspect the files and run `cargo` directly.\n    1. The sandbox directories start with `t0` for the first test.\n\n       `cd target/tmp/cit/t0`\n    2. Set up the environment so that the sandbox configuration takes effect:\n\n       `export CARGO_HOME=$(pwd)/home/.cargo`\n    3. Most tests create a `foo` project, so head into that:\n\n       `cd foo`\n3. Run whatever cargo command you want. See [Running Cargo] for more details\n   on running the correct `cargo` process. Some examples:\n\n   * `/path/to/my/cargo/target/debug/cargo check`\n   * Using a debugger like `lldb` or `gdb`:\n        1. `lldb /path/to/my/cargo/target/debug/cargo`\n        2. Set a breakpoint, for example: `b generate_root_units`\n        3. Run with arguments: `r check`\n\n[cargo_test attribute]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo_test_macro/attr.cargo_test.html\n[`testsuite`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/tests/testsuite/\n[`ProjectBuilder`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/d847468768446168b596f721844193afaaf9d3f2/crates/cargo-test-support/src/lib.rs#L196-L202\n[`Execs`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/d847468768446168b596f721844193afaaf9d3f2/crates/cargo-test-support/src/lib.rs#L531-L550\n[`support`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/crates/cargo-test-support/src/lib.rs\n[`support::compare`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/crates/cargo-test-support/src/compare.rs\n[`support::registry::Package`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/d847468768446168b596f721844193afaaf9d3f2/crates/cargo-test-support/src/registry.rs#L311-L389\n[`support::git`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/crates/cargo-test-support/src/git.rs\n[Running Cargo]: ../process/working-on-cargo.md#running-cargo\n[`snapbox`]: https://docs.rs/snapbox/latest/snapbox/\n[`Command`]: https://docs.rs/snapbox/latest/snapbox/cmd/struct.Command.html\n[`OutputAssert`]: https://docs.rs/snapbox/latest/snapbox/cmd/struct.OutputAssert.html\n[`Assert`]: https://docs.rs/snapbox/latest/snapbox/struct.Assert.html"

    # Tests

    Cargo has an extensive test suite. Most of it is implemented as integration
    tests in the [`testsuite`] directory. There are several other tests:

    * Unit tests are scattered throughout.
    * The dependency resolver has its own set of tests in the [`resolver-tests`]
      directory.
    * All of the packages in the [`crates`] directory have their own set of tests.
    * The [`build-std`] test is for the [build-std feature]. It is separate since
      it has some special requirements.
    * Documentation has a variety of tests, such as link validation, and the
      [SemVer chapter validity checks].

    # Crater

    [Crater](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater) is a tool for compiling and running tests for _every_ crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io) (and a few on GitHub).
    It is mainly used for checking the extent of breakage when implementing potentially breaking changes and ensuring lack of breakage by running beta vs stable compiler versions.

    Essentially it runs some `cargo` command on every crate twice; once against the "start" toolchain and again against the "end" toolchain.
    For example, "start" could be the stable release, and "end" could be beta.
    If it passes in "start" but fails with "end", then that is reported as a regression.

    There is a bot called [craterbot] which is used to run crater on hardware managed by the rust-lang organization.

    Crater is run by the release team during the beta cycle.
    If there are any regressions that look like they are caused by Cargo, they should contact the Cargo team to decide how to handle it.

    ## Running crater

    If you have a change that you want to test before the beta release, or you want to test behavior that is not normally exercised by crater, you can do a manual run of crater.
    Roughly the steps are:

    1. Create a branch with your changes.

       In your clone of cargo, make the changes to incorporate whatever new thing you want to test and push it to a branch on your fork on GitHub.

    2. Get a clone of <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust>

    3. Create a branch in your rust-lang/rust clone to add your changes.

    4. Change the `src/tools/cargo` submodule to point to your new branch.

       Modify `.gitmodules` to point to your clone and branch of cargo with the changes you want to test.
       For example:

       ```bash
       git submodule set-url src/tools/cargo https://github.com/ehuss/cargo.git
       git submodule set-branch --branch my-awesome-feature src/tools/cargo
       git submodule update --remote src/tools/cargo
       git add .gitmodules src/tools/cargo
       git commit
       ```

    5. Create a PR on rust-lang/rust.

       Push your submodule changes to GitHub and make a PR.
       Start the PR title with `[EXPERIMENT]` to make it clear what the PR is for and assign yourself or @ghost.

    6. Make a "try" build.

       A "try" build creates a full release of x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu and stores it on rust-lang servers.
       This can be done with a comment `@bors try` on the PR (all Cargo team members should have permission to do this).

    7. Run crater.

       Look at the [craterbot] docs to determine the command that you want to run.
       There are different modes like `check-only`, `build-and-test`, `rustdoc`, etc.

       You can also choose how many crates to run against.
       If you are uncertain if your cargo changes will work correctly, it might be a good idea to run against `top-100` first to check its behavior.
       This will run much faster.
       You can do a full run afterwards.

       After the try build finishes (which should take a couple hours), ask someone to make a crater run.
       The Cargo team does not have that permission, so just ask someone on Zulip.
       They will need to write a comment to `@craterbot` with the command that you have specified.

    8. Wait.

       Crater can take anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks to run depending on how long the [craterbot queue](https://crater.rust-lang.org/) is and which mode you picked and the priority of your job.
       When the crater run finishes, craterbot will post a comment to the PR with a link to a report of the results.

    9. Investigate the report.

       Look through the report which contains links to build logs for any regressions or errors.

    10. Close the PR.

        Whenever you are done doing crater runs, close your PR.

    [craterbot]: https://github.com/rust-lang/crater/blob/master/docs/bot-usage.md


    ## Advanced crater modes

    Crater only has a few built-in modes, such as running `cargo check` or `cargo test`.
    You can pass extra flags with `+cargoflags`.

    More complex tests can be accomplished by customizing Cargo to perform whatever actions you want.
    Since crater essentially runs `cargo check`, you can modify the `check` command to perform whichever actions you want.
    For example, to test `cargo fix --edition`, [this commit](https://github.com/ehuss/cargo/commit/6901690a6f8d519efb4fabf48c1c2b94af0c3bd8) intercepted `cargo check` and modified it to instead:

    1. Only run on crates with the 2018 edition.
    2. Run `cargo fix --edition`.
    3. Modify the manifest to switch to the 2021 edition.
    4. Run `cargo check` to verify.

    If you need to compare the before and after of a command that is not part of crater's built-in modes, that can be more difficult.
    Two possible options:

    * Work with the infra team to add a new mode.
    * Build two custom try builds.
      Each one should modify the `cargo check` command as described above.
      The "start" build should perform whichever action you want with an otherwise unmodified cargo.
      The "end" build should perform whichever action you want with your modified cargo.
      Then, in the `@craterbot` command, specify the start and end hashes of the two try builds.

    ## Limitations

    There are some limitations of crater to consider when running Cargo:

    * A crater run without regressions is not a green light to move forward.
       * A large portion of Rust code is not tested, such as closed-source projects or things otherwise not collected by crater.
       * Many crates can't build in crater's environment or are otherwise broken.
       * Some crates have flaky tests.
    * Crater runs in an isolated environment.
        * It only runs on Linux x86-64.
        * It does not have network access.
        * The crate source is in a read-only mount.
    * Crater does several steps before running the test (using its own copy of the stable toolchain):
        * It generates a lockfile using `generate-lockfile` and includes `-Zno-index-update` to prevent index updates (which makes it run much faster).
        * All dependencies are downloaded ahead-of-time with `cargo fetch`.
    * The built-in modes pass several flags to cargo such as `--frozen` or `--message-format=json`.
      It will sometimes use `--all-targets` and sometimes not.
      Check the [crater source](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater/blob/master/src/runner/test.rs) for more details on how it works.

    # Introduction

    Thank you for your interest in contributing to [Cargo]! This guide provides an
    overview of how to contribute to Cargo, how to dive into the code, and how the
    testing infrastructure works.

    There are many ways to contribute, such as [helping other users], [filing
    issues], [improving the documentation], [triaging issues], [fixing bugs], and
    working on [small] and [large features].

    If you have a general question about Cargo or its internals, feel free to ask
    on [Zulip].

    This guide assumes you have some familiarity with Rust, and how to use Cargo,
    [rustup], and general development tools like [git].

    Please also read the [Rust Code of Conduct].

    # Issue Tracker

    Cargo's issue tracker is located at
    <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/>. This is the primary spot where
    we track bugs and small feature requests. See [Process] for more about our
    process for proposing changes.

    ## Filing issues

    We can't fix what we don't know about, so please report problems liberally.
    This includes problems with understanding the documentation, unhelpful error
    messages, and unexpected behavior.

    **If you think that you have identified an issue with Cargo that might
    compromise its users' security, please do not open a public issue on GitHub.
    Instead, we ask you to refer to Rust's [security policy].**

    Opening an issue is as easy as following [this link][new-issues]. There are
    several templates for different issue kinds, but if none of them fit your
    issue, don't hesitate to modify one of the templates, or click the [Open a
    blank issue] link.

    The Rust tools are spread across multiple repositories in the Rust
    organization. It may not always be clear where to file an issue. No worries!
    If you file in the wrong tracker, someone will either transfer it to the
    correct one or ask you to move it. Some other repositories that may be
    relevant are:

    * [`rust-lang/rust`] --- Home for the [`rustc`] compiler and [`rustdoc`].
    * [`rust-lang/rustup`] --- Home for the [`rustup`] toolchain installer.
    * [`rust-lang/rustfmt`] --- Home for the `rustfmt` tool, which also includes `cargo fmt`.
    * [`rust-lang/rust-clippy`] --- Home for the `clippy` tool, which also includes `cargo clippy`.
    * [`rust-lang/crates.io`] --- Home for the [crates.io] website.

    Issues with [`cargo fix`] can be tricky to know where they should be filed,
    since the fixes are driven by `rustc`, and the front-interface is implemented
    in Cargo. Feel free to file in the Cargo issue tracker, and it will get moved
    to the [`rust-lang/rust`] issue tracker if necessary.

    ## Issue labels

    [Issue labels] are very helpful to identify the types of issues and which
    category they are related to.

    Anyone can apply most labels by posting comments with a form such as:

    ```text
    @rustbot label: +A-doctests, -A-dependency-resolution
    ```

    This example will add the [`A-doctests`] label and remove the
    [`A-dependency-resolution`] label.

    [Issue labels]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels
    [`A-doctests`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/A-doctests
    [`A-dependency-resolution`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/A-dependency-resolution

    The labels use a naming convention with short prefixes and colors to indicate
    the kind of label:

    <style>
    .label-color {
        border-radius:0.5em;
    }
    table td:nth-child(2) {
        white-space: nowrap;
    }

    </style>

    ### Issue status labels

    The `S-` prefixed *status* labels are the primary mechanism we use to track
    what is happening with an issue and what it is waiting on. The following is a
    list of the status labels and what they mean. This is listed roughly in the
    order that an issue might go through, though issues will often jump to
    different steps, or in rare cases have multiple statuses.

    * **[S-triage]** --- New issues get this label automatically assigned to them
      to indicate that nobody has yet looked at them, and they need someone to
      assign other labels and decide what the next step is.

    * **[S-needs-info]** --- Needs more info, such as a reproduction or more
      background for a feature request.

      Anyone is welcome to help with providing additional info to help reproduce
      or provide more detail on use cases and such. But usually this is a request
      to the initial author.

      When adding this label, there should also usually be a comment that goes
      along with it stating the information requested.

    * **[S-needs-team-input]** --- Needs input from team on whether/how to
      proceed.

      Here it is essentially blocked waiting for a team member to move it to the
      next stage.

    * **[S-needs-design]** --- Needs someone to work further on the design for the
      feature or fix.

      Anyone is welcome to help at this stage, but it should be clear that it is
      not yet accepted. It is expected that people should contribute comments and
      ideas to the issue which furthers the process of fleshing out what is
      needed, or alternate ideas. This may also require reaching out to the wider
      community via forums and such.

    * **[S-needs-rfc]** --- Needs an [RFC] before this can make more progress.

      Anyone is welcome to help at this stage, but it should be clear that it is
      not yet accepted.
      See [Before creating an RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs?tab=readme-ov-file#before-creating-an-rfc)
      for next steps.

    * **[S-needs-mentor]** --- Needs a Cargo team member to commit to helping and
      reviewing.

      This is for something that is accepted, such as after an RFC or a team
      discussion, or an obvious issue that just needs fixing, but no team member
      is available to help or review.

    * **[S-accepted]** --- Issue or feature is accepted, and has a team member
      available to help mentor or review.

    * **[S-waiting-on-feedback]** --- An implemented feature is waiting on
      community feedback for bugs or design concerns.

      This is typically used on a [tracking issue] after it has been implemented
      to indicate what it is waiting on.

    ## Triaging issues

    Triaging issues involves processing issues to assign appropriate labels, make
    sure the issue has sufficient information, and to decide the next steps.
    When new issues are filed, they should automatically get the [S-triage] label
    assuming the author uses one of the templates. This helps identify which
    issues have not yet been triaged.

    There are several things to consider when triaging an issue:

    * Is this a duplicate? Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) to
      see if there is an issue with a similar or identical root cause to what is reported.
      We generally focus issues around root causes so alternative solutions can be
      discussed and evaluated together.
      If it is obviously a duplicate, write a comment that it is a duplicate of the
      other issue, and close the issue.
      If it isn't obvious that it is a duplicate, leave a comment asking the author
      if the other issue covers what they reported.

    * For a bug, check if the report contains enough information to reproduce it.
      If you can't reproduce it, solicit more information from the author to
      better understand the issue.
      Change the label from [S-triage] to [S-needs-info] if this is the case.

    * Add labels that describe what the issue is related to.

        * Add the appropriate [A-], [Command-], [O-], and [Z-] prefixed labels.
        * If this is a regression from stable, add one of the [regression-]
          prefixed labels (depending on if it is a regression in an already
          released stable release, or it is in nightly).

    * Assuming the issue looks valid, switch the [S-triage] label for one of the following:

      * [S-needs-team-input] --- The next steps are not clear, and the Cargo team
        needs to discuss whether or not to proceed and what needs to be done to
        address the issue.
      * [S-needs-design] --- The resolution of the issue or small feature request
        will need more work to come up with the appropriate design.
      * [S-needs-rfc] --- This is a large feature request that will require a
        public design process.
      * [S-needs-mentor] --- This is something the Cargo team wants to address,
        but does not currently have the capacity to help with reviewing. **(reserved for Cargo team)**
      * [S-accepted] --- This is something that clearly needs to be addressed, and
        a Cargo team member has volunteered to help review. **(reserved for Cargo team)**

    Anyone is welcome to help with the triaging process. You can help with
    reproducing issues, checking for duplicates, gathering more information from
    the reporter, assigning labels using [`@rustbot` comments](#issue-labels), and
    creating a test using [Cargo's testsuite] ([example][cargotest-example]).

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `schemas page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.



    Documentation text:

    # Data Schemas

    Cargo reads and writes user and machine facing data formats, like
    - `Cargo.toml`, read and written on `cargo package`
    - `Cargo.lock`, read and written
    - `.cargo/config.toml`, read-only
    - `cargo metadata` output
    - `cargo build --message-format` output

    ## Schema Design

    Generally,
    - Fields should be kebab case
      - `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` should be applied defensively
    - Fields should only be present when needed, saving space and parse time
      - Also, we can always switch to always outputting the fields but its harder to stop outputting them
      - `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Default::default")]` should be applied liberally
    - For output, prefer [jsonlines](https://jsonlines.org/) as it allows streaming output and flexibility to mix content (e.g. adding diagnostics to output that didn't previously have it
    - `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` should not be used to allow evolution of formats, including feature gating

    ## Schema Evolution Strategies

    When changing a schema for data that is read, some options include:
    - Adding new fields is relatively safe
      - If the field must not be ignored when present,
        have a transition period where it is invalid to use on stable Cargo before stabilizing it or
        error if its used before supported within the schema version
        (e.g. `edition` requires a minimum `package.rust-version`, if present)
    - Adding new values to a field is relatively safe
      - Unstable values should fail on stable Cargo
    - Version the structure and interpretation of the data (e.g. the `edition` field or `package.resolver` which has an `edition` fallback)

    Note: some formats that are read are also written back out
    (e.g. `cargo package` generating a `Cargo.toml` file)
    and those strategies need to be considered as well.

    When changing a schema for data that is written, some options include:
    - Add new fields if the presence can be ignored
    - Infer permission from the users use of the new schema (e.g. a new alias for an `enum` variant)
    - Version the structure and interpretation of the format
      - Defaulting to the latest version with a warning that behavior may change (e.g. `cargo metadata --format-version`, `edition` in cargo script)
      - Defaulting to the first version, eventually warning the user of the implicit stale behavior (e.g. `package.edition` in `Cargo.toml`)
      - Without a default (e.g. `package.rust-version`, or a command-line flag like `--format-version`)

    Note: While `serde` makes it easy to support data formats that add new fields,
    new data types or supported values for a field are more difficult to future-proof
    against.

    Documentation text:

    # Console Output

    All of Cargo's output should go through the [`Shell`] struct. You can normally
    obtain the `Shell` instance from the [`GlobalContext`] struct. Do **not** use
    the std `println!` macros.

    Most of Cargo's output goes to stderr. When running in JSON mode, the output
    goes to stdout.

    It is important to properly handle errors when writing to the console.
    Informational commands, like `cargo list`, should ignore any errors writing
    the output. There are some [`drop_print`] macros that are intended to make
    this easier.

    Messages written during compilation should handle errors, and abort the build
    if they are unable to be displayed. This is generally automatically handled in
    the [`JobQueue`] as it processes each message.

    [`Shell`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/core/shell.rs
    [`GlobalContext`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/util/context/mod.rs
    [`drop_print`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/e4b65bdc80f2a293447f2f6a808fa7c84bf9a357/src/cargo/util/config/mod.rs#L1820-L1848
    [`JobQueue`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/core/compiler/job_queue/mod.rs

    ## Errors

    Cargo uses [`anyhow`] for managing errors. This makes it convenient to "chain"
    errors together, so that Cargo can report how an error originated, and what it
    was trying to do at the time.

    Error helpers are implemented in the [`errors`] module. Use the
    `InternalError` error type for errors that are not expected to happen. This
    will print a message to the user to file a bug report.

    The binary side of Cargo uses the `CliError` struct to wrap the process exit
    code. Usually Cargo exits with 101 for an error, but some commands like `cargo
    test` will exit with different codes.

    [`errors`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/util/errors.rs

    ## Style

    Some guidelines for Cargo's output:

    * Keep the normal output brief. Cargo is already fairly noisy, so try to keep
      the output as brief and clean as possible.
    * Good error messages are very important! Try to keep them brief and to the
      point, but good enough that a beginner can understand what is wrong and can
      figure out how to fix. It is a difficult balance to hit! Err on the side of
      providing extra information.
    * When using any low-level routines, such as `std::fs`, *always* add error
      context about what it is doing. For example, reading from a file should
      include context about which file is being read if there is an error.
    * Cargo's error style is usually a phrase, starting with a lowercase letter.
      If there is a longer error message that needs multiple sentences, go ahead
      and use multiple sentences. This should probably be improved sometime in the
      future to be more structured.

    # New Packages

    This chapter sketches out how to add a new package to the cargo workspace.

    ## Steps

    Choose the relevant parent directory
    - `credential/` for credential-process related packages
    - `benches/` for benchmarking of cargo itself
    - `crates/` for everything else

    Run `cargo new <name>`
    - `<name>`:
      - We tend to use `-` over `_`
      - For internal APIs, to avoid collisions with third-party subcommands, we can use the `cargo-util-` prefix
      - For xtasks, we use the `xtask-` prefix
    - `package.rust-version`
      - Internal packages tend to have a policy of "latest" with a [`# MSRV:1` comment](#msrv-policy)
      - Ecosystem packages tend to have a policy of "N-2" with a [`# MSRV:3` comment](#msrv-policy)
      - If the right choice is inherited from the workspace, feel free to keep it that way
    - If running without [cargo new automatically adding to workspace](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12779), add it as a workspace member if not already captured by a glob

    If its an xtask,
    - Add it to `.cargo/config.toml`s `[alias]` table
    - Mark `package.publish = false`

    If needed to be published with `cargo`,
    add the package to `publish.py` in the repo root,
    in dependency order.

    Note: by adding the package to the workspace, you automatically get
    - CI running `cargo test`
    - CI verifying MSRV
    - CI checking for `cargo doc` warnings

    ## MSRV Policy

    Our MSRV policies are
    - Internal packages: support latest version
    - Ecosystem packages: support latest 3 versions

    We proactively update the MSRV
    - So contributors don't shy away from using newer features, either assuming they
      can't ask or feeling like they have to have a justification when asking
    - To avoid a de facto MSRV developing from staying on a version for a long
      period of time, leaving users unhappy when their expectations aren't met

    To proactively update the MSRV, we use [RenovateBot](https://docs.renovatebot.com/)
    with the configuration file in `.github/renovatebot.json5`.
    To know what MSRV policy to use,
    it looks for comments of the form `# MSRV:N`,
    where `N` is the number of supported rust versions.

    # New Subcommands

    Cargo is a single binary composed of a set of [`clap`] subcommands. All
    subcommands live in [`src/bin/cargo/commands`] directory.
    [`src/bin/cargo/main.rs`] is the entry point.

    Each subcommand, such as [`src/bin/cargo/commands/build.rs`], usually performs
    the following:

    1. Parse the CLI flags. See the [`command_prelude`] module for some helpers to make this easier.
    2. Load the config files.
    3. Discover and load the workspace.
    4. Calls the actual implementation of the subcommand which resides in [`src/cargo/ops`].

    If the subcommand is not found in the built-in list, then Cargo will
    automatically search for a subcommand named `cargo-{NAME}` in the users `PATH`
    to execute the subcommand.

    # Debugging

    ## Logging

    Cargo uses the [`tracing`] crate to display debug log messages.
    The `CARGO_LOG` environment variable can be set to enable debug logging, with a value such as `trace`, `debug`, or `warn`.
    It also supports filtering for specific modules with comma-separated [directives].
    Feel free to use [shorthand macros] to help with diagnosing problems.
    We're looking forward to making Cargo logging mechanism more structural!

    ```sh
    # Outputs all logs with levels debug and higher
    CARGO_LOG=debug cargo generate-lockfile

    # Don't forget that you can filter by module as well
    CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::resolver=trace cargo generate-lockfile

    # This will print lots of info about the download process. `trace` prints even more.

    # Formatting

    When modifying user files, like `Cargo.toml`, we should not change other
    sections of the file,
    preserving the general formatting.
    This includes the table, inline-table, or array that a field is being edited in.

    When adding new entries, they do not need to match the canonical style of the
    document but can use the default formatting.
    If the entry is already sorted, preserving the sort order is preferred.

    When removing entries,
    comments on the same line should be removed but comments on following lines
    should be preserved.

    # Filesystem

    Cargo tends to get run on a very wide array of file systems. Different file
    systems can have a wide range of capabilities, and Cargo should strive to do
    its best to handle them. Some examples of issues to deal with:

    * Not all file systems support locking. Cargo tries to detect if locking is
      supported, and if not, will ignore lock errors. This isn't ideal, but it is
      difficult to deal with.
    * The [`fs::canonicalize`] function doesn't work on all file systems
      (particularly some Windows file systems). If that function is used, there
      should be a fallback if it fails. This function will also return `\\?\`
      style paths on Windows, which can have some issues (such as some tools not
      supporting them, or having issues with relative paths).
    * Timestamps can be unreliable. The [`fingerprint`] module has a deeper
      discussion of this. One example is that Docker cache layers will erase the
      fractional part of the time stamp.
    * Symlinks are not always supported, particularly on Windows.

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `design page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.



    Documentation text:

    # Design Principles

    The purpose of Cargo is to formalize a canonical Rust workflow, by automating
    the standard tasks associated with distributing software. Cargo simplifies
    structuring a new project, adding dependencies, writing and running unit
    tests, and more.

    Cargo is not intended to be a general-purpose build tool. Ideally, it should
    be easy to integrate it within another build tool, though admittedly that is
    not as seamless as desired.

    ## Stability and compatibility

    ### Backwards compatibility

    Cargo strives to remain backwards compatible with projects created in previous
    versions. The CLI interface also strives to remain backwards compatible, such
    that the commands and options behave the same. That being said, changes in
    behavior, and even outright breakage are sometimes done in limited situations.
    The following outlines some situations where backwards-incompatible changes are
    made:

    * Anything that addresses a security concern.
    * Dropping support for older platforms and tooling. Cargo follows the Rust
      [tiered platform support].
    * Changes to resolve possibly unsafe or unreliable behavior.

    None of these changes should be taken lightly, and should be avoided if
    possible, or possibly with some transition period to alert the user of the
    potential change.

    Behavior is sometimes changed in ways that have a high confidence that it
    won't break existing workflows. Almost every change carries this risk, so it
    is often a judgment call balancing the benefit of the change with the
    perceived possibility of its negative consequences.

    At times, some changes fall in the gray area, where the current behavior is
    undocumented, or not working as intended. These are more difficult judgment
    calls. The general preference is to balance towards avoiding breaking existing
    workflows.

    Support for older registry APIs and index formats may be dropped, if there is
    high confidence that there aren't any active registries that may be affected.
    This has never (to my knowledge) happened so far, and is unlikely to happen in
    the future, but remains a possibility.

    In all of the above, a transition period may be employed if a change is known
    to cause breakage. A warning can be issued to alert the user that something
    will change, and provide them with an alternative to resolve the issue
    (preferably in a way that is compatible across versions if possible).

    Cargo is only expected to work with the version of the related Rust tools
    (`rustc`, `rustdoc`, etc.) that it is released with. As a matter of choice,
    the latest nightly works with the most recent stable release, but that is
    mostly to accommodate development of Cargo itself, and should not be expected
    by users.

    ### Forwards compatibility

    Additionally, Cargo strives a limited degree of *forwards compatibility*.
    Changes should not egregiously prevent older versions from working. This is
    mostly relevant for persistent data, such as on-disk files and the registry
    interface and index. It also applies to a lesser degree to the registry API.

    Changes to `Cargo.lock` require a transition time, where the new format is not
    automatically written when the lock file is updated. The transition time
    should not be less than 6 months, though preferably longer. New projects may
    use the new format in a shorter time frame.

    Changes to `Cargo.toml` can be made in any release. This is because the user
    must manually modify the file, and opt-in to any new changes. Additionally,
    Cargo will usually only issue a warning about new fields it doesn't
    understand, but otherwise continue to function.

    Changes to cache files (such as artifacts in the `target` directory, or cached
    data in Cargo's home directory) should not *prevent* older versions from
    running, but they may cause older versions to recreate the cache, which may
    result in a performance impact.

    Changes to the registry index should not prevent older versions from working.
    Generally, older versions ignore new fields, so the format should be easily
    extensible. Changes to the format or interpretation of existing fields should
    be done very carefully to avoid preventing older versions of Cargo from
    working. In some cases, this may mean that older versions of Cargo will not be
    able to *select* a newly published crate, but it shouldn't prevent them from
    working at all. This level of compatibility may not last forever, but the
    exact time frame for such a change has not yet been decided.

    The registry API may be changed in such a way to prevent older versions of
    Cargo from working. Generally, compatibility should be retained for as long as
    possible, but the exact length of time is not specified.

    ## Simplicity and layers

    Standard workflows should be easy and consistent. Each knob that is added has
    a high cost, regardless if it is intended for a small audience. Layering and
    defaults can help avoid the surface area that the user needs to be concerned
    with. Try to avoid small functionalities that may have complex interactions
    with one another.

    # Cargo Team

    ## Mission

    The Cargo Team is a group of volunteers that support the Rust community in developing and maintaining Cargo, the Rust package manager and build tool.
    The team is responsible for deciding how Cargo and its related libraries operate and evolve.
    The team has a shared responsibility with the [crates.io team] for the design and usage of Cargo's index format and its registry API as it relates to the [crates.io] service.

    The team is expected to keep Cargo in an operational state, to support Rust's 6-week release cycle, and to uphold the [Design Principles] of Cargo.

    [crates.io team]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/crates-io
    [crates.io]: https://crates.io/
    [Design Principles]: design.md

    ## Team membership

    The Cargo Team consists of team members with one serving as a team leader.
    The team leader is responsible for coordinating the team and providing a contact point with other teams.
    The leader is selected by consensus of the existing members with no objections.

    Membership is maintained in the [Rust team database].

    [Rust team database]: https://github.com/rust-lang/team/blob/master/teams/cargo.toml

    ### Membership expectations

    Team members are expected to participate in voting on RFCs and major change proposals

    Team members are expected to regularly participate in at least some of the following membership-related activities.

    [triagebot.toml]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/triagebot.toml

    ### Meetings

    The primary focus of team meetings is for unblocking designs, including discussing
    - [RFCs][t-cargo-rfcs]
    - [FCPs][cargo-status-tracker]
    - [Items marked **I-nominated-to-discuss**][i-nominated]
    - [Items marked **S-needs-team-input**][s-team-input]
    - Topics proposed on [Zulip][zulip-meeting], subject to availability

    Generally, topics for the agenda should be posted a day in advance to give people the opportunity to review them before the meeting.

    The team meets on a weekly basis ([ics][meeting-ics]) on a video chat.
    Members of the community are welcome to attend.
    Minutes for all meetings are recorded on [HackMD][meeting-minutes].

    For discussing contributions, [Office Hours](../process/index.md#mentorship) would be more appropriate venue.

    ### Becoming a member

    A contributor can become a member of the Cargo Team by requesting a review or being nominated by one of the existing members.
    They can be added by unanimous consent of the team.
    The team lead or another member of the team will also confirm with the moderation team that there are no concerns involving the proposed team member.

    Contributors who wish to join the team should exhibit an interest in carrying the design principles of Cargo and participate in some of the activities listed above in [Membership Expectations](#membership-expectations).

    Members may leave at any time, preferably by letting the team know ahead of time.

    ## Team resources

    ### Zulip

    The Cargo team has several streams on Zulip:

    - [`#t-cargo`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo) --- General public channel for discussing any topics related to Cargo.
    - [`#t-cargo/build-integration`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/334885-t-cargo.2Fbuild-integration) --- Discussions about integration with build systems.
    - [`#t-cargo/PubGrub`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/260232-t-cargo.2FPubGrub) --- Discussions about the [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) project.

    The following are private streams for the Cargo team. The team should avoid using this unless necessary (for example, discussing a security issue or team and meeting organization).

    - [`#t-cargo/private`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/296752-t-cargo.2Fprivate) --- Private channel for discussions among the team.
    - [`#t-cargo/meetings`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/364532-t-cargo.2Fmeetings) --- Private channel for discussions about team meetings, including non-members who regularly attend the meetings.

    ### HackMD

    The Cargo team has a shared, public workspace on HackMD at <https://hackmd.io/@rust-cargo-team> for drafting documents and recording meeting minutes.

    Since this HackMD workspace is using the free service, it does not support private documents. If you need to draft a private document, create it in your personal workspace and use private channels to share the link.

    ## Decision process

    The team uses a consensus-driven process for making decisions ranging from new features and major changes to management of the team itself.
    The degree of process is correlated with the degree of change being proposed:

    - Bug fixes, refactorings, documentation updates, and other small changes are usually delegated to a single team member (who is not the author) to approve based on their judgement.
      Team members may also solicit feedback from other members or the whole team for any change should they want to gather other perspectives from the team.

      Some examples of what this might cover are:
      - Bug fixes that do not introduce backwards-incompatible changes, and adhere to Cargo's expected behavior.
      - Addition of new warnings, or other diagnostic changes.
      - New or updated documentation.
      - Localized refactorings (that is, those that do not have a significant, wide-ranging impact to the usage and maintenance of the codebase).
      - Minor or planned changes to Cargo's console output.
      - Beta backports that clearly address a regression, and are expected to be low-risk.
      - Development of a previously approved unstable feature that matches the expected development of that feature.

    - Small features or changes, large refactorings, or major changes to Cargo's codebase or process require an approval by the team via consensus.
      These decisions can be done via the FCP process of [rfcbot], or in an ad-hoc manner such as during a team meeting.
      rfcbot FCP requests do not require waiting for the 10-day feedback window if there is a complete team consensus, as this process is mostly aimed at polling the team rather than publicly soliciting feedback.
      Though, public feedback is welcome at any time.

      Some examples of what this might cover are:
      - Addition of a new, minor command-line argument, or an addition of an option to an existing one.
      - Addition of new fields and values to JSON outputs.
      - A bug fix or change that may technically involve a backwards-incompatible change.
        See the [Backwards compatibility] section for some examples.
      - Documentation changes that may substantially change the expected usage of Rust and Cargo.
        For example, the [SemVer chapter] contains subjective prescriptions for how users should develop their code.
      - A significant change in Cargo's console output.
      - A significant change to Cargo's code structure, or how maintenance or usage of the Cargo codebase is handled.
      - Beta backports that are risky or have any uncertainty about their necessity.
      - [Stable backports].
        These usually also require involvement with the Release team.
      - A significant change to the management of the Cargo team itself or the processes it uses, such as significant updates to this document.
      - Addition of new members to the Cargo team, or other actions involving the team membership.
        These decisions are usually processed via private channels by the entirety of the team.
      - A change that is a "one-way door".
        That is, something that is difficult to reverse without breaking backwards compatibility.
      - New or transferred "Intentional Artifact" crates to the team, see also [Rust crate ownership policy](https://forge.rust-lang.org/policies/crate-ownership.html)

    - Larger features should usually go through the [RFC process].
      This usually involves first soliciting feedback from the Cargo team and the rest of the community, often via the [Rust Internals] discussion board, [Cargo's issue tracker], and the [Zulip] channel.
      If there is positive feedback to the idea, the next step is to formally post an RFC on the RFC repo.
      The community and the Cargo team will have an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposal.
      After some period of time, the Cargo team may decide to either accept, postpone, or close a proposal based on the interest in the proposal and the team's availability.

      Some examples of what this might cover are:
      - Major changes or new features or options in `Cargo.toml` or the config files.
      - Changes to the registry index or API.
      - New or changed CLI options that are expected to have a significant impact on how Cargo is used.
      - New `cargo` commands that are not trivial.
        In some cases, the team may decide to adopt a pre-existing external command without an RFC if the command has already been broadly adopted.

    - Stabilization of [Unstable] features requires an approval via the FCP process of [rfcbot].
      This provides a final opportunity to solicit feedback from the public, and for the Cargo team to agree via consensus.

    - The team may decide to experiment with larger features without starting the RFC process if it is an initiative that the team has consensus that it is something they want to pursue.
      This is usually reserved for something that has an unclear path that the RFC process is not expected to provide feedback that would substantially move the process forward.
      Such experiments are expected to be nightly-only (see the [Unstable] chapter), and involve efforts to shape the final result via exploration, testing, and public involvement.
      Any such features *must* ultimately have an RFC approved before they can be stabilized.

    `.cargo/config.toml` is for environment or transient configuration,
    being dependent on what directory you are running from and settable on the command-line,
    independent of other flags like `--manifest-path` or `--package`.

    On the other hand `Cargo.toml` is for static, high-level project configuration.

    For example,
    - [RFC 3537] chose
      configuration for the MSRV-aware resolver because users would likely need
      to change this setting, like in CI to verify the opposite case of
      what they run by default.
    - The Cargo team rejected a [`[cfg]` table][cfg table] to represent `rustc`
      `--cfg` flags as it was a direct port of low-level rustc behavior that didn't
      mesh with the other high level abstractions of manifests.
      - For stabilization, this was worked around through a build script directive and a `[lints]` field configuration.
    - [#12738][cargo#12738] for exploring how existing config might be representable in `Cargo.toml`.

    ## `Cargo.toml`

    When adding a table to a manifest,
    - Should it be inheritable?
    - Ensure the package table and the inheritable table under `workspace` align
    - Care is needed to ensure a `workspace = true` field doesn't conflict with other entries
      - e.g. [RFC 3389] had to explicitly exclude ever supporting a `workspace` linter

    When adding a field,
    - Is it inheritable?
      - Consider whether sharing of the field would be driven by requirements or is a manifestation of the current implementation.
        For example, in most cases, dependency sources (e.g. `version` field) should be aligned across a workspace
        However, frequently dependency `features` will vary across a workspace.
    - When inheriting, can specify it in your package?
    - How does specifying a field in both `workspace` and a package interact?
      - e.g. dependency sources cannot be overridden
      - e.g. dependency `features` get merged
      - e.g. dependency `default-features` has been hard to get right ([#12162][cargo#12162])

    When working extending `dependencies` tables:
    - How does this affect `cargo add` or `cargo remove`?
    - How does this affect `[patches]` which are just modified dependencies?

    # Release process

    Cargo is released with `rustc` using a ["train model"][choochoo]. After a
    change lands in Cargo's master branch, it will be synced with the
    [rust-lang/rust] repository by a Cargo team member, which happens about once a
    week. If there are complications, it can take longer. After it is synced and
    merged, the changes will appear in the next nightly release, which is usually
    published around 00:30 UTC.

    After changes are in the nightly release, they will make their way to the
    stable release anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks later, depending on when during the
    cycle it landed.

    The current release schedule is posted on the [Rust Forge]. See the [release
    process] for more details on how Rust's releases are created. Rust releases
    are managed by the [Release team].

    [Rust Forge]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/

    ## Build process

    The build process for Cargo is handled as part of building Rust. Every PR on
    the [rust-lang/rust] repository creates a full collection of release artifacts
    for every platform. The code for this is in the [`dist` bootstrap module].
    Every night at 00:00 UTC, the artifacts from the most recently merged PR are
    promoted to the nightly release channel. A similar process happens for beta
    and stable releases.

    [`dist` bootstrap module]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/bootstrap/src/core/build_steps/dist.rs

    ## Submodule updates

    Cargo is tracked in the [rust-lang/rust] repository using a [git submodule].
    It is updated manually about once a week by a Cargo team member.
    However, anyone is welcome to update it as needed.

    [@ehuss] has a tool called [subup](https://github.com/ehuss/subup) to automate the process of updating the submodule, updating the lockfile, running tests, and creating a PR.
    Running the tests ahead-of-time helps avoid long cycle times waiting for bors if there are any errors.
    Subup will also provide a message to include in the PR with a list of all PRs it covers.
    Posting this in the PR message also helps create reference links on each Cargo PR to the submodule update PR to help track when it gets merged.

    The following is an example of the command to run in a local clone of rust-lang/rust to run a certain set of tests of things that are likely to get broken by a Cargo update:

    ```bash
    subup --up-branch update-cargo \
        --commit-message "Update cargo" \
        --test="src/tools/linkchecker tidy \
            src/tools/cargo \
            src/tools/rustfmt" \
        src/tools/cargo
    ```

    If doing a [beta backport](#beta-backports), the command is similar, but needs to point to the correct branches:

    ```bash
    subup --up-branch update-beta-cargo \
        --rust-branch beta \
        --set-config rust.channel=beta \
        --commit-message "[beta] Update cargo" \
        --test="src/tools/linkchecker tidy \
            src/tools/cargo \
            src/tools/rustfmt" \
        rust-1.66.0:src/tools/cargo
    ```

    [git submodule]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

    ## Version updates

    Shortly after each major release, a Cargo team member will post a PR to update
    Cargo's version in `Cargo.toml`. Cargo's library is permanently unstable, so
    its version number starts with a `0`. The minor version is always 1 greater
    than the Rust release it is a part of, so cargo 0.49.0 is part of the 1.48
    Rust release. The [CHANGELOG] is also usually updated at this time.

    Also, any version-specific checks that are no longer needed can be removed.
    For example, some tests are disabled on stable if they require some nightly
    behavior. Once that behavior is available on the new stable release, the
    checks are no longer necessary. (I usually search for the word "nightly" in
    the testsuite directory, and read the comments to see if any of those nightly
    checks can be removed.)

    Sometimes Cargo will have a runtime check to probe `rustc` if it supports a
    specific feature. This is usually stored in the [`TargetInfo`] struct. If this
    behavior is now stable, those checks should be removed.

    Cargo has several other packages in the [`crates/` directory]. If any of these
    packages have changed, the version should be bumped **before the beta
    release**. It is rare that these get updated. Bumping these as-needed helps
    avoid churning incompatible version numbers. This process should be improved
    in the future!

    [@ehuss] has a tool called [cargo-new-release] to automate the process of doing a version bump.
    It runs through several steps:
    1. Creates a branch
    2. Updates the version numbers
    3. Creates a changelog for anything on the master branch that is not part of beta
    4. Creates a changelog for anything on the beta branch

    It opens a browser tab for every PR in order to review each change.
    It places each PR in the changelog with its title, but usually every PR should be rewritten to explain the change from the user's perspective.
    Each PR should also be categorized as an Addition, Change, Fix, or Nightly-only change.
    Most PRs are deleted, since they are not relevant to users of Cargo.
    For example, remove all PRs related to Cargo internals, infrastructure, documentation, error changes, refactorings, etc.
    Usually about half of the PRs get removed.
    This process usually takes @ehuss about an hour to finish.

    [cargo-new-release]: https://github.com/ehuss/cargo-new-release
    [`crates/` directory]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/crates

    ## Docs publishing

    Docs are automatically published during the Rust release process. The nightly
    channel's docs appear at <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/>. Once
    nightly is promoted to beta, those docs will appear at
    <https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/cargo/>. Once the stable release is made, it
    will appear on <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/> (which is the "current"
    stable) and the release-specific URL such as
    <https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.46.0/cargo/>.

    The code that builds the documentation is located in the [`doc` bootstrap
    module].

    [`doc` bootstrap module]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/bootstrap/src/core/build_steps/doc.rs

    ## crates.io publishing

    Cargo's library and its related dependencies (like `cargo-util`) are published
    to [crates.io] as part of the 6-week stable release process by the [Release
    team]. The release process involves a series of steps:

    1. The Release team's automation scripts (see <https://github.com/rust-lang/simpleinfra/>) will run [`promote-release`] which will create a tag in the `rust-lang/cargo` repository associated with the version of the cargo submodule for that release.
    2. The creation of a tag will trigger the [release workflow] in `rust-lang/cargo`.
    3. The release workflow will run the [`publish.py` script] on the commit associated with the tag.
    4. The `publish.py` script will run `cargo publish` on any crates that are not already published.

    [`promote-release`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/promote-release
    [release workflow]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml

    On very rare cases, the Cargo team may decide to manually publish a new
    release to [crates.io]. For example, this may be necessary if there is a
    problem with the current version that only affects API users, and does not
    affect the `cargo` binary shipped in the stable release. In this situation,
    PRs should be merged to the associated stable release branch in the cargo repo
    (like `rust-1.70.0`) that fix the issue and bump the patch version of the
    affected package. Then you need to work with the Release Team to get a release
    published to crates.io.[^release-problem]

    Some packages are not published automatically because they are not part of the
    Rust release train. This currently only includes the [`home`] package. These
    are published manually on an as-needed or as-requested basis by whoever has
    permissions (currently [@ehuss] or the Release/Infra team)[^fix-manual-release].

    [^release-problem]: Unfortunately there are some complications with this process. See <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14538> for more detail, and thoughts on how to improve this.

    [^fix-manual-release]: This should be fixed, see [crate ownership policy](https://forge.rust-lang.org/policies/crate-ownership.html) about removing ownership. Also see <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14538> for problems with tagging. In general, these should be published from GitHub Actions, but we don't have the infrastructure set up for that, yet.

    [`home`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/crates/home
    [`publish.py` script]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/publish.py

    ## Beta backports

    If there is a regression or major problem detected during the beta phase, it
    may be necessary to backport a fix to beta. The process is documented in the
    [Beta Backporting] page.

    [Beta Backporting]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/beta-backporting.html

    ## Stable backports

    In (hopefully!) very rare cases, a major regression or problem may be reported
    after the stable release. Decisions about this are usually coordinated between
    the [Release team] and the Cargo team. There is usually a high bar for making
    a stable patch release, and the decision may be influenced by whether or not
    there are other changes that need a new stable release.

    The process here is similar to the beta-backporting process. The
    [rust-lang/cargo] branch is the same as beta (`rust-1.XX.0`). The
    [rust-lang/rust] branch is called `stable`.

    # Process

    This chapter gives an overview of how Cargo comes together, and how you can be
    a part of that process.

    See the [Working on Cargo] chapter for an overview of the contribution
    process.

    Please read the guidelines below before working on an issue or new feature.

    [Working on Cargo]: working-on-cargo.md

    ## Mentorship

    Some Cargo team members are available to directly mentor contributions to Cargo.
    See the [office hours] page for more information.

    [office hours]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Office-Hours

    ## Roadmap

    The [Roadmap Project Board] is used for tracking major initiatives. This gives
    an overview of the things the team is interested in and thinking about.

    The [RFC Project Board] is used for tracking [RFCs].

    [the 2020 roadmap]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/01/10/cargo-in-2020.html
    [Roadmap Project Board]: https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/37
    [RFC Project Board]: https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/36
    [RFCs]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/

    ## Working on issues

    Issues labeled with the [S-accepted] [label] are typically issues that the
    Cargo team wants to see addressed. If you are interested in one of those, and
    it has not already been assigned to someone, leave a comment. See [Issue
    assignment](#issue-assignment) below for assigning yourself.

    When possible, the Cargo team will try to also include [E-easy], [E-medium],
    or [E-hard] labels to try to give an estimate of the difficulty involved with
    the issue.

    If there is a specific issue that you are interested in, but it is not marked
    as [S-accepted], leave a comment on the issue. If a Cargo team member has the
    time to help out, they will respond to help with the next steps.

    [E-easy]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/E-easy
    [E-medium]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/E-medium
    [E-hard]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/E-hard
    [S-accepted]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/S-accepted
    [label]: ../issues.md#issue-labels

    ## Working on small features

    Small feature requests are typically managed on the [issue
    tracker][issue-feature-request]. Features that the Cargo team have approved
    will have the [S-accepted] label.

    If there is a feature request that you are interested in, but it is not marked
    as [S-accepted], feel free to leave a comment expressing your interest. If a
    Cargo team member has the time to help out, they will respond to help with the
    next steps. Keep in mind that the Cargo team has limited time, and may not be
    able to help with every feature request. Most of them require some design
    work, which can be difficult. Check out the [design principles chapter] for
    some guidance.

    ## Working on large features

    Cargo follows the Rust model of evolution. Major features usually go through
    an [RFC process]. Therefore, before opening a feature request issue create a
    Pre-RFC thread on the [internals][irlo] forum to get preliminary feedback.

    Implementing a feature as a [custom subcommand][subcommands] is encouraged as
    it helps demonstrate the demand for the functionality and is a great way to
    deliver a working solution faster as it can iterate outside of Cargo's release
    cadence.

    See the [unstable chapter] for how new major features are typically
    implemented.

    [unstable chapter]: unstable.md

    ## Bots and infrastructure

    The Cargo project uses several bots:

    * [GitHub Actions] are used to automatically run all tests for each PR.
    * [triagebot] automatically assigns reviewers for PRs, see [PR Assignment] for
      how to configure.
    * [GitHub merge queue] is used to merge PRs. See [The merging process].
    * [triagebot] is used for assigning issues to non-members, see [Issue
      assignment](#issue-assignment).
    * [rfcbot] is used for making asynchronous decisions by team members.

    [GitHub merge queue]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue

    [PR Assignment]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/triagebot/pr-assignment.html

    ## Issue assignment

    Normally, if you plan to work on an issue that has been marked with the
    [S-accepted] label, it is sufficient just to leave a comment that you are
    working on it. We also have a bot that allows you to formally claim an issue
    by entering the text `@rustbot claim` in a comment. See the [Issue Assignment] docs
    on how this works.

    # Working on Cargo

    This chapter gives an overview of how to build Cargo, make a change, and
    submit a Pull Request.

    0. [Before hacking on Cargo.](#before-hacking-on-cargo)
    1. [Check out the Cargo source.](#checkout-out-the-source)
    2. [Building Cargo.](#building-cargo)
    3. [Making a change.](#making-a-change)
    4. [Writing and running tests.](../tests/index.md)
    5. [Submitting a Pull Request.](#submitting-a-pull-request)
    6. [The merging process.](#the-merging-process)

    ## Before hacking on Cargo

    We encourage people to discuss their design before hacking on code. This gives
    the Cargo team a chance to know your idea more. Sometimes after a discussion,
    we even find a way to solve the problem without coding! Typically, you
    [file an issue] or start a thread on the [internals forum] before submitting a
    pull request.

    Please read [the process] of how features and bugs are managed in Cargo.
    **Only issues that have been explicitly marked as [accepted] will be reviewed.**

    ## Checkout the source

    We use the "fork and pull" model [described here][development-models], where
    contributors push changes to their personal fork and [create pull requests] to
    bring those changes into the source repository. Cargo uses [git] and [GitHub]
    for all development.

    1. Fork the [`rust-lang/cargo`] repository on GitHub to your personal account
       (see [GitHub docs][how-to-fork]).
    2. Clone your fork to your local machine using `git clone` (see [GitHub
       docs][how-to-clone])
    3. It is recommended to start a new branch for the change you want to make.
       All Pull Requests are made against the master branch.

    ## Building Cargo

    Cargo is built by...running `cargo`! There are a few prerequisites that you
    need to have installed:

    * `rustc` and `cargo` need to be installed. Cargo is expected to build and
      test with the current stable, beta, and nightly releases. It is your choice
      which to use. Nightly is recommended, since some nightly-specific tests are
      disabled when using the stable release. But using stable is fine if you
      aren't working on those.
    * A C compiler (typically gcc, clang, or MSVC).
    * [git]
    * Unix:
        * pkg-config
        * OpenSSL (`libssl-dev` on Ubuntu, `openssl-devel` on Fedora)
    * macOS:
        * OpenSSL ([homebrew] is recommended to install the `openssl` package)

    If you can successfully run `cargo build`, you should be good to go!

    [homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

    ## Running Cargo

    You can use `cargo run` to run cargo itself, or you can use the path directly
    to the cargo binary, such as `target/debug/cargo`.

    If you are using [`rustup`], beware that running the binary directly can cause
    issues with rustup overrides. Usually, when `cargo` is executed as part of
    rustup, the toolchain becomes sticky (via an environment variable), and all
    calls to `rustc` will use the same toolchain. But when `cargo` is not run via
    rustup, the toolchain may change based on the directory. Since Cargo changes
    the directory for each compilation, this can cause different calls to `rustc`
    to use different versions. There are a few workarounds:

    * Don't use rustup overrides.
    * Use `rustup run <toolchain> target/debug/cargo` to specify the toolchain(rustc) to use.
      For example, `rustup run nightly target/debug/cargo`.
    * Set the `RUSTC` environment variable to a specific `rustc` executable (not
      the rustup wrapper).
    * Create a [custom toolchain]. This is a bit of a hack, but you can create a
      directory in the rustup `toolchains` directory, and create symlinks for all
      the files and directories in there to your toolchain of choice (such as
      nightly), except for the `cargo` binary, which you can symlink to your
      `target/debug/cargo` binary in your project directory.

    *Normally*, all development is done by running Cargo's test suite, so running
    it directly usually isn't required. But it can be useful for testing Cargo on
    more complex projects.

    [`rustup`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/
    [custom toolchain]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html#custom-toolchains

    ## Making a change

    Some guidelines on working on a change:

    * All code changes are expected to comply with the formatting suggested by
      `rustfmt`. You can use `rustup component add rustfmt` to install `rustfmt`
      and use `cargo fmt` to automatically format your code.
    * Include tests that cover all non-trivial code. See the [Testing chapter] for
      more about writing and running tests.
    * All code should be warning-free. This is checked during tests.

    ## Submitting a Pull Request

    After you have committed your work, and pushed it to GitHub, you can
    open a Pull Request

    * Push your commits to GitHub and create a pull request against Cargo's
      `master` branch.
    * Include a clear description of what the change is and why it is being made.
    * Use [GitHub's keywords] in the description to automatically link to an issue
      if the PR resolves the issue. For example `Closes #1234` will link issue
      #1234 to the PR. When the PR is merged, GitHub will automatically close the
      issue.

    [`@rustbot`] will automatically assign a reviewer for the PR. It
    may take at least a few days for someone to respond. If you don't get a
    response in over a week, feel free to ping the assigned reviewer.

    When your PR is submitted, GitHub automatically runs all tests. The GitHub
    interface will show a green checkmark if it passes, or a red X if it fails.
    There are links to the logs on the PR page to diagnose any issues. The tests
    typically finish in under 30 minutes.

    The reviewer might point out changes deemed necessary. Large or tricky changes
    may require several passes of review and changes.

    > **tip:** Prefer atomic commits where each commit is a single, complete, and coherent unit of work.
    > For example, if your feature work leads to renaming a module, make the rename its own commit.
    > However, adding an internal function that is unused is not complete or coherent.
    >
    > As part of your atomic commits, prefer adding tests as their own commit *before* any functionality changes.
    > The tests should pass in each commit, demonstrating the behavior before your
    > change and how each commit affects behavior.
    > This makes it easier for reviewers and community members to understand the
    > precise details of the side effects of your change and gives you confidence
    > that your tests are verifying the right behavior.

    ### Status labeling

    PRs will get marked with [labels] like [`S-waiting-on-review`] or [`S-waiting-on-author`] to indicate their status.
    The [`@rustbot`] bot can be used by anyone to adjust the labels.
    If a PR gets marked as `S-waiting-on-author`, and you have pushed new changes that you would like to be reviewed, you can write a comment on the PR with the text `@rustbot ready`.
    The bot will switch the labels on the PR.

    More information about these commands can be found at the [shortcuts documentation].

    ## The merging process

    After a reviewer has approved your PR,
    they will add the PR to [GitHub merge queue].
    The merge queue will create a temporary branch with your PR,
    and run all required jobs.
    If it fails, it will be removed from the queue.
    The merge queue ensures that the master branch is always in a good state,
    and that merges are processed one at a time.
    The [merge queue dashboard] shows the current queued pull requests.

    Assuming everything works, congratulations! It may take at least a week for
    the changes to arrive on the nightly channel. See the [release chapter] for
    more information on how Cargo releases are made.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `unstable page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Unstable features\n\nMost new features should go through the unstable process. This means that the\nfeature will only be usable on the nightly channel, and requires a specific\nopt-in by the user. Small changes can skip this process, but please consult\nwith the Cargo team first.\n\n## Tracking issues\n\nEach unstable feature should get a [tracking issue]. These issues are\ntypically created when a PR is close to being merged, or soon after it is\nmerged. Use the [tracking issue template] when creating a tracking issue.\n\nLarger features should also get a new label in the issue tracker so that when\nissues are filed, they can be easily tied together. Typically this would be\none of the `Z-` prefixed labels for nightly features.\n\nWhen opening a tracking issue, be sure to also add an `S-` status label to\nindicate what needs to happen for it to move forward:\n\n* [S-needs-mentor] --- The feature isn't yet implemented, and needs a Cargo\n  team member to commit to helping guide and review the implementation.\n* [S-accepted] --- The feature isn't yet implemented, and has a Cargo team\n  member willing to help review the implementation.\n* [S-waiting-on-feedback] --- After the feature has been implemented, this\n  label indicates that it is waiting on community feedback for bugs or design\n  concerns.\n\nTracking issues may have multiple status labels if necessary, for example if\nsomething is only partially implemented, it may have both\n[S-waiting-on-feedback] (for what is implemented) and [S-needs-mentor] or\n[S-accepted] to finish the rest of the work.\n\n[tracking issue]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/C-tracking-issue\n[tracking issue template]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/new?labels=C-tracking-issue&template=tracking_issue.yml\n[S-needs-mentor]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/S-needs-mentor\n[S-accepted]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/S-accepted\n[S-waiting-on-feedback]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/S-waiting-on-feedback\n\n## Implementation\n\nSee [Working on Cargo](working-on-cargo.md).\n\nDuring implementation and testing, you may find reasons to deviate from the RFC.\nPlease call these out in the tracking issue, with links to more information justifying the change\n(e.g. see [workspace inheritance tracking issue]).\n\n[workspace inheritance tracking issue]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8415\n\n#### Unstable feature opt-in\n\nFor features that require behavior changes or new syntax in `Cargo.toml`, then\nit will need a `cargo-features` value placed at the top of `Cargo.toml` to\nenable it. The process for adding a new feature is described in the\n[`features` module]. Code that implements the feature will need to manually\ncheck that the feature is enabled for the current manifest.\n\nFor features that add new command-line flags, config options, or environment\nvariables, then the `-Z` flags will be needed to enable them. The [`features`\nmodule] also describes how to add these. New flags should use the\n`fail_if_stable_opt` method to check if the `-Z unstable-options` flag has\nbeen passed.\n\n#### Unstable documentation\n\nEvery unstable feature should have a section added to the [unstable chapter]\ndescribing how to use the feature.\nThis can also serve as a place for the final documentation to live until its stabilized.\n\n[unstable chapter]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/doc/src/reference/unstable.md\n\n## Pre-Stabilization \n\nOnce an unstable feature is \"complete\", the search for users to test\nand give feedback begins:\n1. Write up test instructions for users, summarizing where the feature is useful, how to use it (with links to the unstable documentation), and if there are any areas of particular concern\n  - This could be on the tracking issue or in a dedicated issue for feedback\n  - e.g. [workspace inheritance testing notes]\n2. Call for testing\n  - In the RFC, link to the test instructions and label it with `call-for-testing` to be picked up by [This Week in Rust]\n    - If there is not an RFC, a pull request should be made to the [TWiR repo]\n      adding the feature to the `Call for Testing` section ([example]).\n  - Post on various Rust communities ([rust subreddit], [users], [internals], etc)\n  - e.g. [reddit post], [users post], [internals post]\n\n[workspace inheritance testing notes]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/6d6dd9d9be9c91390da620adf43581619c2fa90e/src/doc/src/reference/unstable.md#testing-notes\n[rust subreddit]: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/\n[users]: https://users.rust-lang.org/\n[internals]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/\n[reddit post]: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/uo8zeh/help_test_workspace_inheritance_in_preparation/\n[users post]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/help-test-workspace-inheritance-in-preparation-for-stablization/75582\n[internals post]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/help-test-workspace-inheritance-in-preparation-for-stablization/16618\n[This Week in Rust]: https://this-week-in-rust.org/\n[TWiR repo]: https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust\n[example]: https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/pull/3256\n\n## Stabilization\n\nAfter some period of time, typically measured in months, the feature can be\nconsidered to be stabilized. The feature should not have any significant known\nbugs or issues, and any design concerns should be resolved.\n\nThe stabilization process depends on the kind of feature. For smaller\nfeatures, you can leave a comment on the tracking issue expressing interest in\nstabilizing it. It can usually help to indicate that the feature has received\nsome real-world testing, and has exhibited some demand for broad use.\n\nFor larger features that have not gone through the [RFC process], then an RFC\nto call for stabilization might be warranted. This gives the community a final\nchance to provide feedback about the proposed design.\n\nFor a small feature, or one that has already gone through the RFC process, a\nCargo Team member may decide to call for a \"final comment period\" using\n[rfcbot]. This is a public signal that a major change is being made, and gives\nthe Cargo Team members an opportunity to confirm or block the change. This\nprocess can take a few days or weeks, or longer if a concern is raised.\n\nOnce the stabilization has been approved, the person who called for\nstabilization should prepare a PR to stabilize the feature. This PR should:\n\n* Flip the feature to stable in the [`features` module].\n* Remove any unstable checks that aren't automatically handled by the feature\n  system.\n* Move the documentation from the [unstable chapter] into the appropriate\n  places in the Cargo book and man pages.\n* Remove the `-Z` flags and help message if applicable.\n* Update all tests to remove nightly checks.\n* Tag the PR with [relnotes] label if it seems important enough to highlight\n  in the [Rust release notes].\n\n[`features` module]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/core/features.rs\n[RFC process]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/\n[rfcbot]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcbot-rs\n[Rust release notes]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md\n[relnotes]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues?q=label%3Arelnotes"

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `security page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.



    Documentation text:

    # Security issues

    Issues involving reporting a security vulnerability in cargo usually start by following the [Rust security policy].
    The Security Response Working Group ("the WG") is responsible for running the process of handling the response to a security issue.
    Their process is documented at [Handling Reports].
    This document gives an overview of the process from a Cargo team member's perspective.

    The general order of events happens as follows:

    1. The "reporter" (even if it is a Cargo team member) reports an issue to <security@rust-lang.org>.
    1. The WG will evaluate if the report is credible, and manages responses to the reporter.
    1. The WG will start a private Zulip stream to coordinate discussion and plans for a fix.
    1. The WG will pull in one or more team members into the Zulip stream ("responders").
        - Security vulnerabilities are **embargoed** until they are released publicly.
          People who are brought into these discussions should **not** discuss the issue with *anyone* outside of the group, including your employer, without first consulting The WG.
    1. A discussion then starts to evaluate the severity of the issue and what possible solutions should be considered.
       This includes figuring out who will volunteer to actually develop the patches to resolve the issue, and who will review it.
    1. The WG will create a temporary private fork of the `rust-lang/cargo` repo using GitHub's [repository security advisory][github-advisory] system.
       This provides a space where changes can be securely posted, and the security advisory can be drafted.
       See ["Collaborating in a temporary private fork"][private-fork] for some screenshots of what this looks like.
       GitHub includes instructions on how to work with the fork.

       Beware that the private fork has some limitations, such as not supporting CI, or (for some weird reason) not supporting syntax highlighting.
    1. Someone will need to review the patches and make sure everyone agrees on the solution.
       This may also involve the WG conferring with the reporter to validate the fix.
    1. Create a rollout plan.
       This includes deciding if there will be a new patch release of Rust, or if it should wait for the next stable release, or whether to remove the embargo on the fix.
    1. The WG will handle drafting a Security Advisory using GitHub's Security Advisory ("GHSA") system.
       [GHSA-r5w3-xm58-jv6j] is an example of what this looks like.
       This process also involves reserving a [CVE](https://www.cve.org/) number, where the report will eventually be posted.

       The responders should carefully review the report to make sure it is correct.

       This process may also involve deciding on the CVSS score.
       There are a bunch of calculators on the web where you can see how this works (such as the [FIRST CVSS Calculator][calc], or you can view GitHub's calculator by drafting a security advisory in one of your personal repos).
       FIRST has a [user guide][first-guide] for deciding how to score each characteristic.
    1. If it is decided to do a patch release of Rust, the general overview of steps is:
        1. Finalizing the patches.
           This includes all the little details like updating changelogs, version numbers, and such.
        1. Preparing PRs in the private fork against the stable, beta, and nightly (master) branches.
        1. The WG handles creating a private fork of `rust-lang/rust` to prepare the point release.
           This usually includes changes for stable, beta, and nightly.
        1. The WG handles posting patches in various places (such as mailing lists), possibly several days in advance.
        1. The WG handles posting public PRs to `rust-lang/rust` to incorporate the fix and prepare a new release.
        1. The WG handles announcing everything, including publishing the GHSA, publishing a blog post, and several other places.

    ## External dependency patches

    Sometimes it may be necessary to make changes to external dependencies to support a fix.
    This can make things complicated.
    If the change is by itself benign and not directly related to the security issue,
    then it may be safe to publicly propose the change (but not giving context) and try to get a new release of the dependency made (though confer with the WG first!).
    However, if the issue is directly related to the dependency, then it becomes significantly more awkward.

    The general process for [GHSA-r5w3-xm58-jv6j] which involved a fix in `git2-rs` was handled by the responders because it is a dependency owned by the rust-lang org.
    The general outline of how we managed this is:

    - Pre-release:
        1. Created a private fork of `rust-lang/git2-rs` just like we did for `rust-lang/cargo`.
           git2-rs also had its own Security Advisory just like cargo did.
        1. Created and reviewed PRs in the private fork for the fixes.
            - The PRs in the `rust-lang/cargo` private fork had to have a temporary `[patch]` git dependency on the `git2-rs` private fork.
        1. Before the release, the PRs were changed to remove the `[patch]`, and pretend as-if git2-rs had already been published.
    - Showtime:
        1. The git2-rs changes were publicly merged, and a new release was published to crates.io.
        1. The cargo PR was merged to cargo's stable branch.
        1. The private rust-lang/rust PR updated the cargo submodule and updated `Cargo.lock` to pick up the new git2 dependencies.
        1. Release proceeds as normal (publish both GHSA, create release, etc.).
    - Post-release:
        1. Various forward ports were created in git2-rs, and new releases were made.

    If the change is in a crate not managed by any responder, then confer with the WG on a strategy.
    One option is to create a temporary fork used for the security response that will be removed as soon as the security advisory is released and a new public release of the dependency is made with the fix.

    ## Checklist

    There are a lot of details to handle, and it can be a bit of a challenge under time pressure.
    The following is a checklist of some items to pay attention to during the process.

    Pre-release:
    - [ ] Check for any SemVer-incompatible changes in the public API of any crates that are modified.
      - Try to avoid these if at all possible.
        Although not a severe problem, making Cargo's version number drift farther from Rust's can contribute to confusion.
      - If a SemVer-breaking release is made to a dependency, make sure this is coordinated correctly between the stable, beta, and master branches.
    - [ ] With a checkout of the proposed fixes, run as much of cargo's CI testsuite locally as you can.
      Since private forks don't support CI, the responders will be responsible for making sure all tests pass.
      Enlist other responders if you don't have the necessary systems like Windows.
    - [ ] Manually exercise the fix locally.
      Since we will essentially have *no* nightly testing, the responders are responsible for making sure things work.
      Try to consider all the different environments users may be using.
    - [ ] Make sure any comments or docs that need updating get updated.
    - [ ] Review the git commit messages of the patch.
      Make sure they clearly and accurately reflect what is being changed and why.
      Clean up the commit history if it goes through several revisions during review.
    - [ ] Make sure that the *public* cargo repo's stable and beta branches are in a state where they are passing CI.
      This may require backporting changes that fix problems that have already been fixed in master.
      This can be done publicly at any time, and helps with ensuring a smooth process once the security issue is released.
      (The WG may disable branch protections to push directly to the stable branch, but this step is still useful to assist with local testing and the beta branch.)
    - [ ] After the fix is approved, create backports to the stable and beta master branches and post PRs to the private fork.
    - [ ] If any internal dependencies are changed, make sure their versions are bumped appropriately, and dependency specifications are updated (stable, beta, and master branches).
    - [ ] Thoroughly test the stable and beta PRs locally, too. We want to make sure everything goes smoothly, and we can't assume that just because a patch applied cleanly that there won't be issues.
    - [ ] Make sure cargo's version in [`Cargo.toml`] is updated correctly on the stable branch private PR.
    - [ ] Make sure cargo's `Cargo.lock` is updated (stable, beta, master branches).
    - [ ] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`] on cargo's master branch private PR.
    - [ ] Update [`RELEASES.md`] on rust's master branch private PR (and stable and beta?).
    - [ ] Remove any temporary things in the patch, like a temporary `[patch]` table.

    Showtime:
    - [ ] Publish any embargoed external dependencies to crates.io.
    - [ ] (WG) Merge the cargo stable change.
    - [ ] (WG) Update the cargo submodule in the rust-lang/rust private PR to point to the new stable commit.
        - [ ] Also update `Cargo.lock`.
    - [ ] (WG) Make a new stable release.
    - [ ] (WG) Publish the GHSA.
    - [ ] (WG) Send announcements.
    - [ ] Make sure stable, beta, and master branches of `rust-lang/cargo` get updated.
    - [ ] Make sure stable, beta, and master branches of `rust-lang/rust` get updated, pointing to the correct submodule versions.
    - [ ] If any external dependencies are updated, make sure their back or forward ports are handled.

    Post release:
    - [ ] Verify that the appropriate crates are published on crates.io.
    - [ ] Verify that `rust-lang/cargo` got a new tag.
    - [ ] Verify that the patches were backported to the correct branches in the `rust-lang/cargo` repository (stable, beta, and master).
    - [ ] Verify that the cargo submodule is updated on the correct branches in the `rust-lang/rust` repository (stable, beta, and master).
    - [ ] Follow up on any non-critical tasks that were identified during review.

    # Cargo documentation

    This directory contains Cargo's documentation. There are two parts, [The Cargo
    Book] which is built with [mdbook] and the man pages, which are built with
    [mdman].

    [The Cargo Book]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
    [mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook
    [mdman]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/crates/mdman/

    ### Building the book

    Building the book requires [mdBook]. To get it:

    ```console
    $ cargo install mdbook
    ```

    To build the book:

    ```console
    $ mdbook build
    ```

    `mdbook` provides a variety of different commands and options to help you work
    on the book:

    * `mdbook build --open`: Build the book and open it in a web browser.
    * `mdbook serve`: Launches a web server on localhost. It also automatically
      rebuilds the book whenever any file changes and automatically reloads your
      web browser.

    The book contents are driven by the [`SUMMARY.md`](src/SUMMARY.md) file, and
    every file must be linked there.

    ### Building the man pages

    The man pages use a tool called [mdman] to convert markdown to a man page
    format. Check out the documentation at
    [`mdman/doc/`](../../crates/mdman/doc/)
    for more details.

    The man pages are converted from a templated markdown (located in the
    [`src/doc/man/`](man)
    directory) to three different formats:

    1. Troff-style man pages, saved in [`src/etc/man/`](../etc/man).
    2. Markdown (with some HTML) for the Cargo Book, saved in
       [`src/doc/src/commands/`](src/commands).
    3. Plain text (needed for embedded man pages on platforms without man such as
       Windows), saved in [`src/doc/man/generated_txt/`](man/generated_txt).

    To rebuild the man pages, run `cargo build-man` inside the workspace.

    ### SemVer chapter tests

    There is a script to verify that the examples in the SemVer chapter work as
    intended. To run the tests, run `cargo +stable run -p semver-check`.

    Note that these tests run on the most recent stable release because they
    validate the output of the compiler diagnostics. The output can change between
    releases, so we pin to a specific release to avoid frequent and unexpected
    breakage.

    ## Contributing

    We'd love your help with improving the documentation! Please feel free to
    [open issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues) about anything, and
    send in PRs for things you'd like to fix or change. If your change is large,
    please open an issue first, so we can make sure that it's something we'd
    accept before you go through the work of getting a PR together.

    # Creating a New Package

    To start a new [package][def-package] with Cargo, use `cargo new`:

    ```console
    $ cargo new hello_world --bin
    ```

    We’re passing `--bin` because we’re making a binary program: if we
    were making a library, we’d pass `--lib`. This also initializes a new `git`
    repository by default. If you don't want it to do that, pass `--vcs none`.

    Let’s check out what Cargo has generated for us:

    ```console
    $ cd hello_world
    $ tree .
    .
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs

    1 directory, 2 files
    ```

    Let’s take a closer look at `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"

    [dependencies]

    ```

    This is called a [***manifest***][def-manifest], and it contains all of the
    metadata that Cargo needs to compile your package. This file is written in the
    [TOML] format (pronounced /tɑməl/).

    Here’s what’s in `src/main.rs`:

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

    Cargo generated a “hello world” program for you, otherwise known as a
    [*binary crate*][def-crate]. Let’s compile it:

    ```console
    $ cargo build
       Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/package/hello_world)
    ```

    And then run it:

    ```console
    $ ./target/debug/hello_world
    Hello, world!
    ```

    You can also use `cargo run` to compile and then run it, all in one step (You
    won't see the `Compiling` line if you have not made any changes since you last
    compiled):

    ```console
    $ cargo run
       Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/package/hello_world)
         Running `target/debug/hello_world`
    Hello, world!
    ```

    You’ll now notice a new file, `Cargo.lock`. It contains information about your
    dependencies. Since there are none yet, it’s not very interesting.

    Once you’re ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile
    your files with optimizations turned on:

    ```console
    $ cargo build --release
       Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/package/hello_world)
    ```

    `cargo build --release` puts the resulting binary in `target/release` instead of
    `target/debug`.

    Compiling in debug mode is the default for development. Compilation time is
    shorter since the compiler doesn't do optimizations, but the code will run
    slower. Release mode takes longer to compile, but the code will run faster.

    # Why Cargo Exists

    ## Preliminaries

    In Rust, as you may know, a library or executable program is called a
    [*crate*][def-crate]. Crates are compiled using the Rust compiler,
    `rustc`. When starting with Rust, the first source code most people encounter
    is that of the classic “hello world” program, which they compile by invoking
    `rustc` directly:

    ```console
    $ rustc hello.rs
    $ ./hello
    Hello, world!
    ```

    Note that the above command required that you specify the file name
    explicitly. If you were to directly use `rustc` to compile a different program,
    a different command line invocation would be required. If you needed to specify
    any specific compiler flags or include external dependencies, then the
    needed command would be even more specific (and complex).

    Furthermore, most non-trivial programs will likely have dependencies on
    external libraries, and will therefore also depend transitively on *their*
    dependencies. Obtaining the correct versions of all the necessary dependencies
    and keeping them up to date would be hard and error-prone if done by
    hand.

    Rather than work only with crates and `rustc`, you can avoid the difficulties
    involved with performing the above tasks by introducing a higher-level
    ["*package*"][def-package] abstraction and by using a
    [*package manager*][def-package-manager].

    ## Enter: Cargo

    *Cargo* is the Rust package manager. It is a tool that allows Rust
    [*packages*][def-package] to declare their various dependencies and ensure
    that you’ll always get a repeatable build.

    To accomplish this goal, Cargo does four things:

    * Introduces two metadata files with various bits of package information.
    * Fetches and builds your package’s dependencies.
    * Invokes `rustc` or another build tool with the correct parameters to build
      your package.
    * Introduces conventions to make working with Rust packages easier.

    To a large extent, Cargo normalizes the commands needed to build a given
    program or library; this is one aspect to the above mentioned conventions. As
    we show later, the same command can be used to build different
    [*artifacts*][def-artifact], regardless of their names. Rather than invoke
    `rustc` directly, you can instead invoke something generic such as `cargo
    build` and let cargo worry about constructing the correct `rustc`
    invocation. Furthermore, Cargo will automatically fetch any dependencies
    you have defined for your artifact from a [*registry*][def-registry],
    and arrange for them to be added into your build as needed.

    It is only a slight exaggeration to say that once you know how to build one
    Cargo-based project, you know how to build *all* of them.

    Documentation text:

    # Cargo.toml vs Cargo.lock

    `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` serve two different purposes. Before we talk
    about them, here’s a summary:

    * `Cargo.toml` is about describing your dependencies in a broad sense, and is
      written by you.
    * `Cargo.lock` contains exact information about your dependencies. It is
      maintained by Cargo and should not be manually edited.

    When in doubt, check `Cargo.lock` into the version control system (e.g. Git).
    For a better understanding of why and what the alternatives might be, see
    [“Why have Cargo.lock in version control?” in the FAQ](../faq.md#why-have-cargolock-in-version-control).
    We recommend pairing this with
    [Verifying Latest Dependencies](continuous-integration.md#verifying-latest-dependencies)

    Let’s dig in a little bit more.

    `Cargo.toml` is a [**manifest**][def-manifest] file in which you can specify a
    bunch of different metadata about your package. For example, you can say that you
    depend on another package:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"

    [dependencies]
    regex = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git" }
    ```

    This package has a single dependency, on the `regex` library. It states in
    this case to rely on a particular Git repository that lives on
    GitHub. Since you haven’t specified any other information, Cargo assumes that
    you intend to use the latest commit on the default branch to build our package.

    Sound good? Well, there’s one problem: If you build this package today, and
    then you send a copy to me, and I build this package tomorrow, something bad
    could happen. There could be more commits to `regex` in the meantime, and my
    build would include new commits while yours would not. Therefore, we would
    get different builds. This would be bad because we want reproducible builds.

    You could fix this problem by defining a specific `rev` value in our `Cargo.toml`,
    so Cargo could know exactly which revision to use when building the package:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    regex = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git", rev = "9f9f693" }
    ```

    Now our builds will be the same. But there’s a big drawback: now you have to
    manually think about SHA-1s every time you want to update our library. This is
    both tedious and error prone.

    Enter the `Cargo.lock`. Because of its existence, you don’t need to manually
    keep track of the exact revisions: Cargo will do it for you. When you have a
    manifest like this:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"

    [dependencies]
    regex = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git" }
    ```

    Cargo will take the latest commit and write that information out into your
    `Cargo.lock` when you build for the first time. That file will look like this:

    ```toml
    [[package]]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    dependencies = [
     "regex 1.5.0 (git+https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git#9f9f693768c584971a4d53bc3c586c33ed3a6831)",
    ]

    [[package]]
    name = "regex"
    version = "1.5.0"
    source = "git+https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git#9f9f693768c584971a4d53bc3c586c33ed3a6831"
    ```

    You can see that there’s a lot more information here, including the exact
    revision you used to build. Now when you give your package to someone else,
    they’ll use the exact same SHA, even though you didn’t specify it in your
    `Cargo.toml`.

    When you're ready to opt in to a new version of the library, Cargo can
    re-calculate the dependencies and update things for you:

    ```console
    $ cargo update         # updates all dependencies
    $ cargo update regex   # updates just “regex”
    ```

    This will write out a new `Cargo.lock` with the new version information. Note
    that the argument to `cargo update` is actually a
    [Package ID Specification](../reference/pkgid-spec.md) and `regex` is just a
    short specification.

    Documentation text:

    # Dependencies

    [crates.io] is the Rust community's central [*package registry*][def-package-registry]
    that serves as a location to discover and download
    [packages][def-package]. `cargo` is configured to use it by default to find
    requested packages.

    To depend on a library hosted on [crates.io], add it to your `Cargo.toml`.

    [crates.io]: https://crates.io/

    ## Adding a dependency

    If your `Cargo.toml` doesn't already have a `[dependencies]` section, add
    that, then list the [crate][def-crate] name and version that you would like to
    use. This example adds a dependency on the `time` crate:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    time = "0.1.12"
    ```

    The version string is a [SemVer] version requirement. The [specifying
    dependencies](../reference/specifying-dependencies.md) docs have more information about
    the options you have here.

    [SemVer]: https://semver.org

    If you also wanted to add a dependency on the `regex` crate, you would not need
    to add `[dependencies]` for each crate listed. Here's what your whole
    `Cargo.toml` file would look like with dependencies on the `time` and `regex`
    crates:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"

    [dependencies]
    time = "0.1.12"
    regex = "0.1.41"
    ```

    Re-run `cargo build`, and Cargo will fetch the new dependencies and all of
    their dependencies, compile them all, and update the `Cargo.lock`:

    ```console
    $ cargo build
          Updating crates.io index
       Downloading memchr v0.1.5
       Downloading libc v0.1.10
       Downloading regex-syntax v0.2.1
       Downloading memchr v0.1.5
       Downloading aho-corasick v0.3.0
       Downloading regex v0.1.41
         Compiling memchr v0.1.5
         Compiling libc v0.1.10
         Compiling regex-syntax v0.2.1
         Compiling memchr v0.1.5
         Compiling aho-corasick v0.3.0
         Compiling regex v0.1.41
         Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/package/hello_world)
    ```

    `Cargo.lock` contains the exact information about which revision was used
    for all of these dependencies.

    Now, if `regex` gets updated, you will still build with the same revision until
    you choose to run `cargo update`.

    You can now use the `regex` library in `main.rs`.

    ```rust,ignore
    use regex::Regex;

    fn main() {
        let re = Regex::new(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$").unwrap();
        println!("Did our date match? {}", re.is_match("2014-01-01"));
    }
    ```

    Running it will show:

    ```console
    $ cargo run
       Running `target/hello_world`
    Did our date match? true
    ```

    # Tests

    Cargo can run your tests with the `cargo test` command. Cargo looks for tests
    to run in two places: in each of your `src` files and any tests in `tests/`.
    Tests in your `src` files should be unit tests and [documentation tests].
    Tests in `tests/` should be integration-style tests. As such, you’ll need to
    import your crates into the files in `tests`.

    Here's an example of running `cargo test` in our [package][def-package], which
    currently has no tests:

    ```console
    $ cargo test
       Compiling regex v1.5.0 (https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git#9f9f693)
       Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/package/hello_world)
         Running target/test/hello_world-9c2b65bbb79eabce

    running 0 tests

    test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
    ```

    If your package had tests, you would see more output with the correct number of
    tests.

    You can also run a specific test by passing a filter:

    ```console
    $ cargo test foo
    ```

    This will run any test with `foo` in its name.

    `cargo test` runs additional checks as well. It will compile any examples
    you’ve included to ensure they still compile. It also runs documentation
    tests to ensure your code samples from documentation comments compile.
    Please see the [testing guide][testing] in the Rust documentation for a general
    view of writing and organizing tests. See [Cargo Targets: Tests] to learn more
    about different styles of tests in Cargo.

The crates are compressed gzip archives named with a `.crate` extension.\n\n  * `registry/src`\n\t\tIf a downloaded `.crate` archive is required by a package, it is unpacked into `registry/src` folder where rustc will find the `.rs` files.\n\n\n## Caching the Cargo home in CI\n\nTo avoid redownloading all crate dependencies during continuous integration, you can cache the `$CARGO_HOME` directory.\nHowever, caching the entire directory is often inefficient as it will contain downloaded sources twice.\nIf we depend on a crate such as `serde 1.0.92` and cache the entire `$CARGO_HOME` we would actually cache the sources twice, the `serde-1.0.92.crate` inside `registry/cache` and the extracted `.rs` files of serde inside `registry/src`.\nThat can unnecessarily slow down the build as downloading, extracting, recompressing and reuploading the cache to the CI servers can take some time.\n\nIf you wish to cache binaries installed with [`cargo install`], you need to cache the `bin/` folder and the `.crates.toml` and `.crates2.json` files.\n\nIt should be sufficient to cache the following files and directories across builds:\n\n* `.crates.toml`\n* `.crates2.json`\n* `bin/`\n* `registry/index/`\n* `registry/cache/`\n* `git/db/`\n\n\n\n## Vendoring all dependencies of a project\n\nSee the [`cargo vendor`] subcommand.\n\n\n\n## Clearing the cache\n\nIn theory, you can always remove any part of the cache and Cargo will do its best to restore sources if a crate needs them either by reextracting an archive or checking out a bare repo or by simply redownloading the sources from the web.\n\nAlternatively, the [cargo-cache](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-cache) crate provides a simple CLI tool to only clear selected parts of the cache or show sizes of its components in your command-line.\n\n[`cargo install`]: ../commands/cargo-install.md\n[`cargo login`]: ../commands/cargo-login.md\n[`cargo vendor`]: ../commands/cargo-vendor.md\n[config]: ../reference/config.md\n[def-crate]:     ../appendix/glossary.md#crate     '\"crate\" (glossary entry)'\n[def-package]:   ../appendix/glossary.md#package   '\"package\" (glossary entry)'\n[def-registry]:  ../appendix/glossary.md#registry  '\"registry\" (glossary entry)'\n[env]: ../reference/environment-variables.md"

    # Working on an Existing Cargo Package

    If you download an existing [package][def-package] that uses Cargo, it’s
    really easy to get going.

    First, get the package from somewhere. In this example, we’ll use `regex`
    cloned from its repository on GitHub:

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git
    $ cd regex
    ```

    To build, use `cargo build`:

    ```console
    $ cargo build
       Compiling regex v1.5.0 (file:///path/to/package/regex)
    ```

    This will fetch all of the dependencies and then build them, along with the
    package.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `continuous-integration page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Continuous Integration\n\n## Getting Started\n\nA basic CI will build and test your projects:\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\nTo test your package on GitHub Actions, here is a sample `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nname: Cargo Build & Test\n\non:\n  push:\n  pull_request:\n\nenv: \n  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always\n\njobs:\n  build_and_test:\n    name: Rust project - latest\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        toolchain:\n          - stable\n          - beta\n          - nightly\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - run: rustup update ${{ matrix.toolchain }} && rustup default ${{ matrix.toolchain }}\n      - run: cargo build --verbose\n      - run: cargo test --verbose\n  \n```\n\nThis will test all three release channels (note a failure in any toolchain version will fail the entire job). You can also click `\"Actions\" > \"new workflow\"` in the GitHub UI and select Rust to add the [default configuration](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/rust.yml) to your repo. See [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more information.\n\n### GitLab CI\n\nTo test your package on GitLab CI, here is a sample `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nstages:\n  - build\n\nrust-latest:\n  stage: build\n  image: rust:latest\n  script:\n    - cargo build --verbose\n    - cargo test --verbose\n\nrust-nightly:\n  stage: build\n  image: rustlang/rust:nightly\n  script:\n    - cargo build --verbose\n    - cargo test --verbose\n  allow_failure: true\n```\n\nThis will test on the stable channel and nightly channel, but any\nbreakage in nightly will not fail your overall build. Please see the\n[GitLab CI documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/index.html) for more\ninformation.\n\n### builds.sr.ht\n\nTo test your package on sr.ht, here is a sample `.build.yml` file.\nBe sure to change `<your repo>` and `<your project>` to the repo to clone and\nthe directory where it was cloned.\n\n```yaml\nimage: archlinux\npackages:\n  - rustup\nsources:\n  - <your repo>\ntasks:\n  - setup: |\n      rustup toolchain install nightly stable\n      cd <your project>/\n      rustup run stable cargo fetch\n  - stable: |\n      rustup default stable\n      cd <your project>/\n      cargo build --verbose\n      cargo test --verbose\n  - nightly: |\n      rustup default nightly\n      cd <your project>/\n      cargo build --verbose ||:\n      cargo test --verbose  ||:\n  - docs: |\n      cd <your project>/\n      rustup run stable cargo doc --no-deps\n      rustup run nightly cargo doc --no-deps ||:\n```\n\nThis will test and build documentation on the stable channel and nightly\nchannel, but any breakage in nightly will not fail your overall build. Please\nsee the [builds.sr.ht documentation](https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/) for more\ninformation.\n\n\n### CircleCI\n\nTo test your package on CircleCI, here is a sample `.circleci/config.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 2.1\njobs:\n  build:\n    docker:\n      # check https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/rust#image-tags for latest\n      - image: cimg/rust:1.77.2\n    steps:\n      - checkout\n      - run: cargo test\n```\n\nTo run more complex pipelines, including flaky test detection, caching, and artifact management, please see [CircleCI Configuration Reference](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/).\n\n## Verifying Latest Dependencies\n\nWhen [specifying dependencies](../reference/specifying-dependencies.md) in\n`Cargo.toml`, they generally match a range of versions.\nExhaustively testing all version combination would be unwieldy.\nVerifying the latest versions would at least test for users who run [`cargo\nadd`] or [`cargo install`].\n\nWhen testing the latest versions some considerations are:\n- Minimizing external factors affecting local development or CI\n- Rate of new dependencies being published\n- Level of risk a project is willing to accept\n- CI costs, including indirect costs like if a CI service has a maximum for\n  parallel runners, causing new jobs to be serialized when at the maximum.\n\nSome potential solutions include:\n- [Not checking in the `Cargo.lock`](../faq.md#why-have-cargolock-in-version-control)\n  - Depending on PR velocity, many versions may go untested\n  - This comes at the cost of determinism\n- Have a CI job verify the latest dependencies but mark it to \"continue on failure\"\n  - Depending on the CI service, failures might not be obvious\n  - Depending on PR velocity, may use more resources than necessary\n- Have a scheduled CI job to verify latest dependencies\n  - A hosted CI service may disable scheduled jobs for repositories that\n    haven't been touched in a while, affecting passively maintained packages\n  - Depending on the CI service, notifications might not be routed to people\n    who can act on the failure\n  - If not balanced with dependency publish rate, may not test enough versions\n    or may do redundant testing\n- Regularly update dependencies through PRs, like with [Dependabot] or [RenovateBot]\n  - Can isolate dependencies to their own PR or roll them up into a single PR\n  - Only uses the resources necessary\n  - Can configure the frequency to balance CI resources and coverage of dependency versions\n\nAn example CI job to verify latest dependencies, using GitHub Actions:\n```yaml\njobs:\n  latest_deps:\n    name: Latest Dependencies\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    continue-on-error: true\n    env:\n      CARGO_RESOLVER_INCOMPATIBLE_RUST_VERSIONS: allow\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - run: rustup update stable && rustup default stable\n      - run: cargo update --verbose\n      - run: cargo build --verbose\n      - run: cargo test --verbose\n```\nNotes:\n- [`CARGO_RESOLVER_INCOMPATIBLE_RUST_VERSIONS`](../reference/config.md#resolverincompatible-rust-versions) is set to ensure the [resolver](../reference/resolver.md) doesn't limit selected dependencies because of your project's [Rust version](../reference/rust-version.md).\n\nFor projects with higher risks of per-platform or per-Rust version failures,\nmore combinations may want to be tested.\n\n## Verifying `rust-version`\n\nWhen publishing packages that specify [`rust-version`](../reference/manifest.md#the-rust-version-field),\nit is important to verify the correctness of that field.\n\nSome third-party tools that can help with this include:\n- [`cargo-msrv`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-msrv)\n- [`cargo-hack`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hack)\n\nAn example of one way to do this, using GitHub Actions:\n```yaml\njobs:\n  msrv:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n    - uses: taiki-e/install-action@cargo-hack\n    - run: cargo hack check --rust-version --workspace --all-targets --ignore-private\n```\nThis tries to balance thoroughness with turnaround time:\n- A single platform is used as most projects are platform-agnostic, trusting platform-specific dependencies to verify their behavior.\n- `cargo check` is used as most issues contributors will run into are API availability and not behavior.\n- Unpublished packages are skipped as this assumes only consumers of the verified project, through a registry, will care about `rust-version`.\n\n[`cargo add`]: ../commands/cargo-add.md\n[`cargo install`]: ../commands/cargo-install.md\n[Dependabot]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot\n[RenovateBot]: https://renovatebot.com/"

    Documentation text:

    # Glossary

    ## Artifact

    An *artifact* is the file or set of files created as a result of the
    compilation process. This includes linkable libraries, executable binaries,
    and generated documentation.

    ## Cargo

    *Cargo* is the Rust [*package manager*](#package-manager), and the primary
    topic of this book.

    ## Cargo.lock

    See [*lock file*](#lock-file).

    ## Cargo.toml

    See [*manifest*](#manifest).

    ## Crate

    A Rust *crate* is either a library or an executable program, referred to as
    either a *library crate* or a *binary crate*, respectively.

    Every [target](#target) defined for a Cargo [package](#package) is a *crate*.

    Loosely, the term *crate* may refer to either the source code of the target or
    to the compiled artifact that the target produces. It may also refer to a
    compressed package fetched from a [registry](#registry).

    The source code for a given crate may be subdivided into [*modules*](#module).

    ## Edition

    A *Rust edition* is a developmental landmark of the Rust language. The
    [edition of a package][edition-field] is specified in the `Cargo.toml`
    [manifest](#manifest), and individual targets can specify which edition they
    use. See the [Edition Guide] for more information.

    ## Feature

    The meaning of *feature* depends on the context:

    - A [*feature*][feature] is a named flag which allows for conditional
      compilation. A feature can refer to an optional dependency, or an arbitrary
      name defined in a `Cargo.toml` [manifest](#manifest) that can be checked
      within source code.

    - Cargo has [*unstable feature flags*][cargo-unstable] which can be used to
      enable experimental behavior of Cargo itself.

    - The Rust compiler and Rustdoc have their own unstable feature flags (see
      [The Unstable Book][unstable-book] and [The Rustdoc
      Book][rustdoc-unstable]).

    - CPU targets have [*target features*][target-feature] which specify
      capabilities of a CPU.

    ## Index

    The *index* is the searchable list of [*crates*](#crate) in a
    [*registry*](#registry).

    ## Lock file

    The `Cargo.lock` *lock file* is a file that captures the exact version of
    every dependency used in a [*workspace*](#workspace) or
    [*package*](#package). It is automatically generated by Cargo. See
    [Cargo.toml vs Cargo.lock].

    ## Manifest

    A [*manifest*][manifest] is a description of a [package](#package) or a
    [workspace](#workspace) in a file named `Cargo.toml`.

    A [*virtual manifest*][virtual] is a `Cargo.toml` file that only describes a
    workspace, and does not include a package.

    ## Member

    A *member* is a [*package*](#package) that belongs to a
    [*workspace*](#workspace).

    ## Module

    Rust's module system is used to organize code into logical units called
    *modules*, which provide isolated namespaces within the code.

    The source code for a given [crate](#crate) may be subdivided into one or more
    separate modules. This is usually done to organize the code into areas of
    related functionality or to control the visible scope (public/private) of
    symbols within the source (structs, functions, and so on).

    A [`Cargo.toml`](#manifest) file is primarily concerned with the
    [package](#package) it defines, its crates, and the packages of the crates on
    which they depend. Nevertheless, you will see the term "module" often when
    working with Rust, so you should understand its relationship to a given crate.

    ## Package

    A *package* is a collection of source files and a `Cargo.toml`
    [*manifest*](#manifest) file which describes the package. A package has a name
    and version which is used for specifying dependencies between packages.

    A package contains multiple [*targets*](#target), each of which is a
    [*crate*](#crate). The `Cargo.toml` file describes the type of the crates
    (binary or library) within the package, along with some metadata about each
    one --- how each is to be built, what their direct dependencies are, etc., as
    described throughout this book.

    The *package root* is the directory where the package's `Cargo.toml` manifest
    is located. (Compare with [*workspace root*](#workspace).)

    The [*package ID specification*][pkgid-spec], or *SPEC*, is a string used to
    uniquely reference a specific version of a package from a specific source.

    Small to medium sized Rust projects will only need a single package, though it
    is common for them to have multiple crates.

    Larger projects may involve multiple packages, in which case Cargo
    [*workspaces*](#workspace) can be used to manage common dependencies and other
    related metadata between the packages.

    ## Package manager

    Broadly speaking, a *package manager* is a program (or collection of related
    programs) in a software ecosystem that automates the process of obtaining,
    installing, and upgrading artifacts. Within a programming language ecosystem,
    a package manager is a developer-focused tool whose primary functionality is
    to download library artifacts and their dependencies from some central
    repository; this capability is often combined with the ability to perform
    software builds (by invoking the language-specific compiler).

    [*Cargo*](#cargo) is the package manager within the Rust ecosystem. Cargo
    downloads your Rust [package](#package)’s dependencies
    ([*artifacts*](#artifact) known as [*crates*](#crate)), compiles your
    packages, makes distributable packages, and (optionally) uploads them to
    [crates.io][], the Rust community’s [*package registry*](#registry).

    ## Package registry

    See [*registry*](#registry).

    ## Project

    Another name for a [package](#package).

    ## Registry

    A *registry* is a service that contains a collection of downloadable
    [*crates*](#crate) that can be installed or used as dependencies for a
    [*package*](#package). The default registry in the Rust ecosystem is
    [crates.io](https://crates.io). The registry has an [*index*](#index) which
    contains a list of all crates, and tells Cargo how to download the crates that
    are needed.

    ## Source

    A *source* is a provider that contains [*crates*](#crate) that may be included
    as dependencies for a [*package*](#package). There are several kinds of
    sources:

    - **Registry source** --- See [registry](#registry).
    - **Local registry source** --- A set of crates stored as compressed files on
      the filesystem. See [Local Registry Sources].
    - **Directory source** --- A set of crates stored as uncompressed files on the
      filesystem. See [Directory Sources].
    - **Path source** --- An individual package located on the filesystem (such as a
      [path dependency]) or a set of multiple packages (such as [path overrides]).
    - **Git source** --- Packages located in a git repository (such as a [git
      dependency] or [git source]).

    See [Source Replacement] for more information.

    ## Spec

    See [package ID specification](#package).

    ## Target

    The meaning of the term *target* depends on the context:

    - **Cargo Target** --- Cargo [*packages*](#package) consist of *targets* which
      correspond to [*artifacts*](#artifact) that will be produced. Packages can
      have library, binary, example, test, and benchmark targets. The
      [list of targets][targets] are configured in the `Cargo.toml`
      [*manifest*](#manifest), often inferred automatically by the [directory
      layout] of the source files.
    - **Target Directory** --- Cargo places all built artifacts and intermediate
      files in the *target* directory. By default this is a directory named
      `target` at the [*workspace*](#workspace) root, or the package root if not
      using a workspace. The directory may be changed with the `--target-dir`
      command-line option, the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` [environment variable], or the
      `build.target-dir` [config option].
    - **Target Architecture** --- The OS and machine architecture for the built
      artifacts are typically referred to as a *target*.
    - **Target Triple** --- A triple is a specific format for specifying a target
      architecture. Triples may be referred to as a *target triple* which is the
      architecture for the artifact produced, and the *host triple* which is the
      architecture that the compiler is running on. The target triple can be
      specified with the `--target` command-line option or the `build.target`
      [config option]. The general format of the triple is
      `<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>` where:

      - `arch` = The base CPU architecture, for example `x86_64`, `i686`, `arm`,
        `thumb`, `mips`, etc.
      - `sub` = The CPU sub-architecture, for example `arm` has `v7`, `v7s`,
        `v5te`, etc.
      - `vendor` = The vendor, for example `unknown`, `apple`, `pc`, `nvidia`, etc.
      - `sys` = The system name, for example `linux`, `windows`, `darwin`, etc.
        `none` is typically used for bare-metal without an OS.
      - `abi` = The ABI, for example `gnu`, `android`, `eabi`, etc.

      Some parameters may be omitted. Run `rustc --print target-list` for a list of
      supported targets.

    ## Test Targets

    Cargo *test targets* generate binaries which help verify proper operation and
    correctness of code. There are two types of test artifacts:

    * **Unit test** --- A *unit test* is an executable binary compiled directly from
      a library or a binary target. It contains the entire contents of the library
      or binary code, and runs `#[test]` annotated functions, intended to verify
      individual units of code.
    * **Integration test target** --- An [*integration test
      target*][integration-tests] is an executable binary compiled from a *test
      target* which is a distinct [*crate*](#crate) whose source is located in the
      `tests` directory or specified by the [`[[test]]` table][targets] in the
      `Cargo.toml` [*manifest*](#manifest). It is intended to only test the public
      API of a library, or execute a binary to verify its operation.

    ## Workspace

    A [*workspace*][workspace] is a collection of one or more
    [*packages*](#package) that share common dependency resolution (with a shared
    `Cargo.lock` [*lock file*](#lock-file)), output directory, and various
    settings such as profiles.

    A [*virtual workspace*][virtual] is a workspace where the root `Cargo.toml`
    [*manifest*](#manifest) does not define a package, and only lists the
    workspace [*members*](#member).

    The *workspace root* is the directory where the workspace's `Cargo.toml`
    manifest is located. (Compare with [*package root*](#package).)

    # Git Authentication

    Cargo supports some forms of authentication when using git dependencies and
    registries. This appendix contains some information for setting up git
    authentication in a way that works with Cargo.

    If you need other authentication methods, the [`net.git-fetch-with-cli`]
    config value can be set to cause Cargo to execute the `git` executable to
    handle fetching remote repositories instead of using the built-in support.
    This can be enabled with the `CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true` environment
    variable.

    > **Note:** Cargo does not require authentication for public git dependencies
    > so if you see an authentication failure in that context, ensure that the
    > URL is correct.

    ## HTTPS authentication

    HTTPS authentication requires the [`credential.helper`] mechanism. There are
    multiple credential helpers, and you specify the one you want to use in your
    global git configuration file.

    ```ini
    # ~/.gitconfig

    [credential]
    helper = store
    ```

    Cargo does not ask for passwords, so for most helpers you will need to give
    the helper the initial username/password before running Cargo. One way to do
    this is to run `git clone` of the private git repo and enter the
    username/password.

    > **Tip:**<br>
    > macOS users may want to consider using the osxkeychain helper.<br>
    > Windows users may want to consider using the [GCM] helper.

    > **Note:** Windows users will need to make sure that the `sh` shell is
    > available in your `PATH`. This typically is available with the Git for
    > Windows installation.

    ## SSH authentication

    SSH authentication requires `ssh-agent` to be running to acquire the SSH key.
    Make sure the appropriate environment variables are set up (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on
    most Unix-like systems), and that the correct keys are added (with `ssh-add`).

    Windows can use Pageant (part of [PuTTY]) or `ssh-agent`.
    To use `ssh-agent`, Cargo needs to use the OpenSSH that is distributed as part
    of Windows, as Cargo does not support the simulated Unix-domain sockets used
    by MinGW or Cygwin.
    More information about installing with Windows can be found at the [Microsoft
    installation documentation] and the page on [key management] has instructions
    on how to start `ssh-agent` and to add keys.

    > **Note:** Cargo does not support git's shorthand SSH URLs like
    > `git@example.com:user/repo.git`. Use a full SSH URL like
    > `ssh://git@example.com/user/repo.git`.

    > **Note:** SSH configuration files (like OpenSSH's `~/.ssh/config`) are not
    > used by Cargo's built-in SSH library. More advanced requirements should use
    > [`net.git-fetch-with-cli`].

    ### SSH Known Hosts

    When connecting to an SSH host, Cargo must verify the identity of the host
    using "known hosts", which are a list of host keys. Cargo can look for these
    known hosts in OpenSSH-style `known_hosts` files located in their standard
    locations (`.ssh/known_hosts` in your home directory, or
    `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` on Unix-like platforms or
    `%PROGRAMDATA%\ssh\ssh_known_hosts` on Windows). More information about these
    files can be found in the [sshd man page]. Alternatively, keys may be
    configured in a Cargo configuration file with [`net.ssh.known-hosts`].

    When connecting to an SSH host before the known hosts has been configured,
    Cargo will display an error message instructing you how to add the host key.
    This also includes a "fingerprint", which is a smaller hash of the host key,
    which should be easier to visually verify. The server administrator can get
    the fingerprint by running `ssh-keygen` against the public key (for example,
    `ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub`). Well-known sites may
    publish their fingerprints on the web; for example GitHub posts theirs at
    <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints>.

    Cargo comes with the host keys for [github.com](https://github.com) built-in.
    If those ever change, you can add the new keys to the config or known_hosts file.

    > **Note:** Cargo doesn't support the `@cert-authority` or `@revoked`
    > markers in `known_hosts` files. To make use of this functionality, use
    > [`net.git-fetch-with-cli`]. This is also a good tip if Cargo's SSH client
    > isn't behaving the way you expect it to.

Note that this automatic garbage collection will not take\n  place if running offline (using `--offline` or `--frozen`).\n\n  Cargo 1.78 and newer track the access information needed for this garbage\n  collection.

    ## Cargo 1.80 (2024-07-25)
    [b60a1555...rust-1.80.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/b60a1555...rust-1.80.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 Stabilize `-Zcheck-cfg`! This by default enables rustc's checking of
      conditional compilation at compile time, which verifies that the crate is
      correctly handling conditional compilation for different target platforms or
      features. Internally, cargo will be passing a new command line option
      `--check-cfg` to all rustc and rustdoc invocations.

      A new build script invocation
      [`cargo::rustc-check-cfg=CHECK_CFG`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#rustc-check-cfg)
      is added along with this stabilization, as a way to add custom cfgs to the
      list of expected cfg names and values.

      If a build script is not an option for your package, Cargo provides a config
      [`[lints.rust.unexpected_cfgs.check-cfg]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/check-cfg/cargo-specifics.html#check-cfg-in-lintsrust-table)
      to add known custom cfgs statically.

      ([RFC 3013](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/3013-conditional-compilation-checking.md))

    ## Cargo 1.79 (2024-06-13)
    [2fe739fc...rust-1.79.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/2fe739fc...rust-1.79.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 `cargo add` respects `package.rust-version` a.k.a. MSRV when adding new
      dependencies. The behavior can be overridden by specifying a version requirement,
      or passing the `--ignore-rust-version` flag.
      ([RFC 3537](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/3537-msrv-resolver.md))
      [#13608](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13608)
    - A new `Locking` status message shows dependency changes on any command.
      For `cargo update`, it also tells you if any dependency version is outdated.
      [#13561](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13561)
      [#13647](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13647)
      [#13651](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13651)
      [#13657](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13657)
      [#13759](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13759)
      [#13764](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13764)

    ### Changed

    - ❗️ `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`, and variables from the `[env]`
      table now also apply to the initial `rustc -vV` invocation Cargo uses for
      probing rustc information.
      [#13659](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13659)
    - ❗️ Turns dependencies like `foo = { optional = true }` from `version="*"`
      dependencies with a warning into errors.
      This behavior has been considered a bug from the beginning.
      [#13775](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13775)
    - ❗️ Replace dashes with underscores also if `lib.name` is inferred from `package.name`.
      This change aligns to the documented behavior. One caveat is that JSON messages
      emitted by Cargo, like via `cargo metadata` or `--message-format=json`,
      will start reporting underscore lib names.
      [#12783](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12783)
    - Switch to `gitoxide` for listing files. This improves the performance of
      build script and `cargo doc` for computing cache freshness,
      as well as fixes some subtle bugs for `cargo publish`.
      [#13592](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13592)
      [#13696](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13696)
      [#13704](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13704)
      [#13777](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13777)
    - Warn on `-Zlints` being passed and no longer necessary.
      [#13632](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13632)
    - Warn on unused `workspace.dependencies` keys on virtual workspaces.
      [#13664](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13664)
    - Emit 1.77 build script syntax error only when msrv is incompatible.
      [#13808](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13808)
    - Don't warn on `lints.rust.unexpected_cfgs.check-cfg`.
      [#13925](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13925)
    - cargo-init: don't assign `target.name` in Cargo.toml if the value can be inferred.
      [#13606](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13606)
    - cargo-package: normalize paths in `Cargo.toml`, including replacing `\` with `/`.
      [#13729](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13729)
    - cargo-test: recategorize cargo test's `--doc` flag under “Target Selection”.
      [#13756](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13756)

    Documentation text:

    ## Cargo 1.77.1 (2024-03-28)

    ### Fixed

    - Debuginfo is no longer stripped by default for Windows MSVC targets. This caused an unexpected regression in 1.77.0 that broke backtraces.
      [#13654](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13654)

    ## Cargo 1.77 (2024-03-21)
    [1a2666dd...rust-1.77.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/1a2666dd...rust-1.77.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 Stabilize the package identifier format as [Package ID Spec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/pkgid-spec.html).
      This format can be used across most of the commands in Cargo, including the
      `--package`/`-p` flag, `cargo pkgid`, `cargo metadata`, and JSON messages
      from `--message-format=json`.
      [#12914](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12914)
      [#13202](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13202)
      [#13311](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13311)
      [#13298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13298)
      [#13322](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13322)
    - Add colors to `-Zhelp` console output
      [#13269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13269)
    - build script: Extend the build directive syntax with `cargo::`.
      [#12201](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12201)
      [#13212](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13212)

    ### Changed

    - 🎉 Disabling debuginfo now implies `strip = "debuginfo"` (when `strip` is not set)
      to strip pre-existing debuginfo coming from the standard library,
      reducing the default size of release binaries considerably
      (from ~4.5 MiB down to ~450 KiB for helloworld on Linux x64).
      [#13257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13257)
    - Add `rustc` style errors for manifest parsing.
      [#13172](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13172)
    - Deprecate rustc plugin support in cargo
      [#13248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13248)
    - cargo-vendor: Hold the mutate exclusive lock when vendoring.
      [#12509](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12509)
    - crates-io: Set `Content-Type: application/json` only for requests with a body payload
      [#13264](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13264)

    ### Fixed

    - jobserver: inherit jobserver from env for all kinds of runner
      [#12776](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12776)
    - build script: Set `OUT_DIR` for all units with build scripts
      [#13204](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13204)
    - cargo-add: find the correct package with given features from Git repositories
      with multiple packages.
      [#13213](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13213)
    - cargo-fix: always inherit the jobserver
      [#13225](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13225)
    - cargo-fix: Call rustc fewer times to improve the performance.
      [#13243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13243)
    - cargo-new: only inherit workspace package table if the new package is a member
      [#13261](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13261)
    - cargo-update: `--precise` accepts arbitrary git revisions
      [#13250](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13250)
    - manifest: Provide unused key warnings for lints table
      [#13262](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13262)
    - rustfix: Support inserting new lines.
      [#13226](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13226)

    ### Internal

    - 🎉 New member crate [`cargo-util-schemas`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-util-schemas)!
      This contains low-level Cargo schema types, focusing on `serde` and `FromStr`
      for use in reading files and parsing command-lines.
      Any logic for getting final semantics from these will likely need other tools
      to process, like `cargo metadata`.
      The crates.io publish of this crate is the same as other members crates.
      It follows Rust's [6-week release process](https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/release.html#cratesio-publishing).

    ## Cargo 1.72 (2023-08-24)
    [64fb38c9...rust-1.72.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/64fb38c9...rust-1.72.0)

    ### Added

    - ❗ Enable `-Zdoctest-in-workspace` by default. When running each documentation
      test, the working directory is set to the root directory of the package the
      test belongs to.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html#working-directory-of-tests)
      [#12221](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12221)
      [#12288](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12288)
    - Add support of the "default" keyword to reset previously set `build.jobs`
      parallelism back to the default.
      [#12222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12222)

    ### Changed

    - 🚨 [CVE-2023-40030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-wrrj-h57r-vx9p):
      Malicious dependencies can inject arbitrary JavaScript into cargo-generated timing reports.
      To mitigate this, feature name validation check is now turned into a hard error.
      The warning was added in Rust 1.49. These extended characters aren't allowed on crates.io,
      so this should only impact users of other registries, or people who don't publish to a registry.
      [#12291](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12291)
    - Cargo now warns when an edition 2021 package is in a virtual workspace and
      `workspace.resolver` is not set. It is recommended to set the resolver
      version for workspaces explicitly.
      [#10910](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10910)
    - Set IBM AIX shared libraries search path to `LIBPATH`.
      [#11968](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11968)
    - Don't pass `-C debuginfo=0` to rustc as it is the default value.
      [#12022](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12022)
      [#12205](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12205)
    - Added a message on reusing previous temporary path on `cargo install` failures.
      [#12231](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12231)
    - Added a message when `rustup` override shorthand is put in a wrong position.
      [#12226](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12226)
    - Respect scp-like URL as much as possible when fetching nested submodules.
      [#12359](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12359)
      [#12411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12411)

    ### Fixed

    - `cargo clean` uses `remove_dir_all` as a fallback to resolve race conditions.
      [#11442](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11442)
    - Reduced the chance Cargo re-formats the user's `[features]` table.
      [#12191](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12191)
    - Fixed nested Git submodules not able to fetch.
      [#12244](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12244)

    ### Nightly only

    - 🔥 The `-Zscript` is an experimental feature to add unstable support for
      single-file packages in Cargo, so we can explore the design and resolve
      questions with an implementation to collect feedback on.

When Cargo detects it will run `rustc`\n  pointing a rustup proxy, it'll try bypassing the proxy and use the underlying\n  binary directly. There are assumptions around the interaction with rustup and\n  `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`. However, it's not expected to affect normal users.\n  [#11917](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11917)\n- ❗ When querying a package, Cargo tries only the original name, all hyphens,\n  and all underscores to handle misspellings.

    Documentation text:

    ## Cargo 1.69 (2023-04-20)
    [985d561f...rust-1.69.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/985d561f...rust-1.69.0)

    ### Added

    - Cargo now suggests `cargo fix` or `cargo clippy --fix`
      when compilation warnings are auto-fixable.
      [#11558](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11558)
    - Cargo now suggests `cargo add` if you try to install a library crate.
      [#11410](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11410)
    - Cargo now sets the `CARGO_BIN_NAME` environment variable also for binary examples.
      [#11705](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11705)

    ### Changed

    - ❗ When `default-features` is set to false of a workspace dependency,
      and an inherited dependency of a member has `default-features = true`,
      Cargo will enable default features of that dependency.
      [#11409](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11409)
    - ❗ Deny `CARGO_HOME` in `[env]` configuration table. Cargo itself doesn't
      pick up this value, but recursive calls to cargo would, which was not intended.
      [#11644](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11644)
    - ❗ Debuginfo for build dependencies is now off if not explicitly set. This is
      expected to improve the overall build time.
      [#11252](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11252)
    - Cargo now emits errors on invalid alphanumeric characters in a registry token.
      [#11600](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11600)
    - `cargo add` now checks only the order of `[dependencies]`
      without considering `[dependencies.*]`.
      [#11612](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11612)
    - Cargo now respects the new jobserver IPC style in GNU Make 4.4, by updating
      its dependency `jobserver`.
      [#11767](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11767)
    - `cargo install` now reports required features when no binary meets its requirements.
      [#11647](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11647)

    ### Fixed

    - Uplifted `.dwp` DWARF package file next to the executable for debuggers to
      locate them.
      [#11572](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11572)
    - Fixed build scripts triggering recompiles when a `rerun-if-changed` points to
      a directory whose mtime is not preserved by the filesystem.
      [#11613](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11613)
    - Fixed panics when using dependencies from `[workspace.dependencies]`
      for `[patch]`. This usage is not supposed to be supported.
      [#11565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11565)
      [#11630](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11630)
    - Fixed `cargo report` saving the same future-incompat reports multiple times.
      [#11648](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11648)
    - Fixed the incorrect inference of a directory ending with `.rs` as a file.
      [#11678](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11678)
    - Fixed `.cargo-ok` file being truncated wrongly, preventing from using a dependency.
      [#11665](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11665)
      [#11724](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11724)

    ### Nightly only

    - `-Zrustdoc-scrape-example` must fail with bad build script.
      [#11694](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11694)
    - Updated 1password credential manager integration to the version 2 CLI.
      [#11692](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11692)

    ## Cargo 1.66.1 (2023-01-10)

    ### Fixed
    - 🚨 [CVE-2022-46176](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-r5w3-xm58-jv6j):
      Added validation of SSH host keys for git URLs.
      See [the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/git-authentication.html#ssh-known-hosts) for more information on how to configure the known host keys.

    ## Cargo 1.66 (2022-12-15)
    [08250398...rust-1.66.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/08250398...rust-1.66.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 Added `cargo remove` command for removing dependencies from `Cargo.toml`.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-remove.html)
      [#11059](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11059)

      [#11227](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11227)
    - Added support for git dependencies having git submodules with relative paths.
      [#11106](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11106)
    - Cargo now sends requests with an `Accept-Encoding` header to registries.
      [#11292](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11292)
    - Cargo now forwards non-UTF8 arguments to external subcommands.
      [#11118](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11118)

    ### Changed

    - ❗ Disambiguate source replacements from various angles.
      [RFC-3289](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/3289-source_replacement_ambiguity.md)
      [#10907](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10907)
      - When the crates-io source is replaced, the user is required to specify which registry to use with `--registry <NAME>` when performing an API operation.
      - Publishing to source-replaced crates.io is no longer permitted using the crates.io token (`registry.token`).
      - In source replacement, the `replace-with` key can reference the name of an alternative registry in the `[registries]` table.
    - ❗ `cargo publish` now blocks until it sees the published package in the index.

    ### Fixed

    - ❗ Config file loaded via `cargo --config <file>` now takes priority over
      environment variables. This is a documented behaviour but the old
      implementation accidentally got it wrong.
      [#11077](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11077)
    - ❗ Cargo collects rustflags in `target.cfg(…).rustflags` more correctly
      and warns if that's not enough for convergence.
      [#11114](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11114)
    - Final artifacts not removed by linker should be removed before a compilation gets started.
      [#11122](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11122)

      [#11087](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11087)
    - A better error message when `cargo login` prompt receives empty input.
      [#11145](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11145)
    - A better error message for fields with wrong types
      where workspace inheritance is supported.
      [#11113](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11113)
    - A better error message when mixing feature syntax `dep:` with `/`.
      [#11172](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11172)
    - A better error message when publishing but `package.publish` is `false`
      in the manifest.
      [#11280](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11280)

    ### Nightly only

      [#11247](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11247)
    - Fixed publishing with a dependency on a sparse registry.
      [#11268](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11268)
    - Fixed confusing error messages when using `-Zsparse-registry`.
      [#11283](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11283)
    - Fixed 410 gone response handling for sparse registries.

      [`workspace.package`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/workspaces.html#the-package-table)
      and
      [`workspace.dependencies`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/workspaces.html#the-dependencies-table)

    - The
      [`workspace.default-members`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/workspaces.html#package-selection)

      the root package.
      [#10784](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10784)

    ### Fixed

    - 🚨 [CVE-2022-36113](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-rfj2-q3h3-hm5j):

      a crate if the manifest has the `rust-version` field set.
      [#10713](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10713)


    ### Changed
    - A warning is emitted when encountering multiple packages with the same name
      in a git dependency. This will ignore packages with `publish=false`.
      [#10701](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10701)
      [#10767](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10767)
    - Change tracking now uses the contents of a `.json` target spec file instead
      of its path. This should help avoid rebuilds if the path changes.
      [#10746](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10746)
    - Git dependencies with a submodule configured with the `update=none` strategy
      in `.gitmodules` is now honored, and the submodule will not be fetched.
      [#10717](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10717)
    - Crate files now use a more recent date (Jul 23, 2006 instead of Nov 29, 1973)
      for deterministic behavior.
      [#10720](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10720)
    - The initial template used for `cargo new` now includes a slightly more
      realistic test structure that has `use super::*;` in the test module.
      [#10706](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10706)
    - Updated the internal HTTP library libcurl with various small fixes and updates.

      [#10810](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10810)
      [#10811](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10811)
    - Fixed `-p` being ignored with `cargo publish` in the root of a virtual
      workspace. Some additional checks were also added to generate an error if
      multiple packages were selected (previously it would pick the first one).
      [#10677](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10677)
    - The human-readable executable name is no longer displayed for `cargo test`
      when using JSON output.

    ## Cargo 1.62 (2022-06-30)
    [1ef1e0a1...rust-1.62.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/1ef1e0a1...rust-1.62.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 Added the `cargo add` command for adding dependencies to `Cargo.toml` from
      the command-line.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-add.html)
      [#10472](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10472)
      [#10577](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10577)
      [#10578](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10578)
    - Package ID specs now support `name@version` syntax in addition to the
      previous `name:version` to align with the behavior in `cargo add` and other
      tools. `cargo install` and `cargo yank` also now support this syntax so the
      version does not need to passed as a separate flag.
      [#10582](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10582)
      [#10650](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10650)
      [#10597](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10597)
    - Added the CLI option `-F` as an alias of `--features`.
      [#10576](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10576)
    - The `git` and `registry` directories in Cargo's home directory (usually
      `~/.cargo`) are now marked as cache directories so that they are not
      included in backups or content indexing (on Windows).
      [#10553](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10553)
    - Added the `--version` flag to `cargo yank` to replace the `--vers` flag to
      be consistent with `cargo install`.
      [#10575](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10575)
    - Added automatic `@` argfile support, which will use "response files" if the
      command-line to `rustc` exceeds the operating system's limit.
      [#10546](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10546)
    - `cargo clean` now has a progress bar (if it takes longer than half a second).
      [#10236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10236)

    ### Changed

    - `cargo install` no longer generates an error if no binaries were found
      to install (such as missing required features).
      [#10508](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10508)
    - `cargo test` now passes `--target` to `rustdoc` if the specified target is
      the same as the host target.
      [#10594](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10594)
    - `cargo doc` now automatically passes `-Arustdoc::private-intra-doc-links`
      when documenting a binary (which automatically includes
      `--document-private-items`). The
      [`private-intra-doc-links`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/lints.html#private_intra_doc_links)
      lint is only relevant when *not* documenting private items, which doesn't
      apply to binaries.
      [#10142](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10142)
    - The length of the short git hash in the `cargo --version` output is now
      fixed to 9 characters. Previously the length was inconsistent between
      different platforms.
      [#10579](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10579)
    - Attempting to publish a package with a `Cargo.toml.orig` file will now
      result in an error. The filename would otherwise conflict with the
      automatically-generated file.
      [#10551](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10551)

    ### Fixed

    - The `build.dep-info-basedir` configuration setting now properly supports the
      use of `..` in the path to refer to a parent directory.
      [#10281](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10281)
    - Fixed regression in automatic detection of the default number of CPUs to use
      on systems using cgroups v1.
      [#10737](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10737)
      [#10739](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10739)


    ### Nightly only

    - `cargo fetch` now works with `-Zbuild-std` to fetch the standard library's dependencies.
      [#10129](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10129)
    - Added support for workspace inheritance.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#workspace-inheritance)

    ## Cargo 1.60 (2022-04-07)
    [358e79fe...rust-1.60.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/358e79fe...rust-1.60.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 Added the `dep:` prefix in the `[features]` table to refer to an optional
      dependency. This allows creating feature names with the same name as a
      dependency, and allows for "hiding" optional dependencies so that they do
      not implicitly expose a feature name.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#optional-dependencies)
      [#10269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10269)
    - 🎉 Added the `dep-name?/feature-name` syntax to the `[features]` table to
      only enable the feature `feature-name` if the optional dependency `dep-name`
      is already enabled by some other feature.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features)
      [#10269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10269)
    - 🎉 Added `--timings` option to generate an HTML report about build timing,
      concurrency, and CPU use.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/timings.html)
      [#10245](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10245)
    - Added the `"v"` and `"features2"` fields to the registry index.
      The `"v"` field provides a method for compatibility with future changes to the index.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registries.html#index-format)
      [#10269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10269)
    - Added bash completion for `cargo clippy`
      [#10347](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10347)
    - Added bash completion for `cargo report`
      [#10295](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10295)
    - Added support to build scripts for `rustc-link-arg-tests`,
      `rustc-link-arg-examples`, and `rustc-link-arg-benches`.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#outputs-of-the-build-script)
      [#10274](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10274)

    ### Changed

    - Cargo now uses the clap 3 library for command-line argument parsing.
      [#10265](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10265)
    - The `build.pipelining` config option is now deprecated, pipelining will now
      always be enabled.
      [#10258](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10258)
    - `cargo new` will now generate a `.gitignore` which only ignores `Cargo.lock`
      in the root of the repo, instead of any directory.
      [#10379](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10379)
    - Improved startup time of bash completion.
      [#10365](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10365)
    - The `--features` flag is now honored when used with the `--all-features`
      flag, which allows enabling features from other packages.
      [#10337](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10337)
    - Cargo now uses a different TOML parser. This should not introduce any
      user-visible changes. This paves the way to support format-preserving
      programmatic modification of TOML files for supporting `cargo add` and other
      future enhancements.
      [#10086](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10086)
    - Setting a library to emit both a `dylib` and `cdylib` is now an error, as
      this combination is not supported.
      [#10243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10243)
    - `cargo --list` now includes the `help` command.
      [#10300](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10300)

    ### Fixed

    - Fixed running `cargo doc` on examples with dev-dependencies.
      [#10341](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10341)
    - Fixed `cargo install --path` for a path that is relative to a directory
      outside of the workspace in the current directory.
      [#10335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10335)
    - `cargo test TEST_FILTER` should no longer build binaries that are explicitly
      disabled with `test = false`.
      [#10305](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10305)
    - Fixed regression with `term.verbose` without `term.quiet`, and vice versa.
      [#10429](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10429)
      [#10436](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10436)

    ### Nightly only

    - Added `rustflags` option to a profile definition.
      [#10217](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10217)
    - Changed `--config` to only support dotted keys.
      [#10176](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10176)
    - Fixed profile `rustflags` not being gated in profile overrides.
      [#10411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10411)
      [#10413](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10413)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `--timings` option in Cargo 1.60 as described in the documentation?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user enable a feature named `feature-name` only if the optional dependency `dep-name` is already enabled, using the new syntax introduced in Cargo 1.60?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the `dep:` prefix in the `[features]` table when defining optional dependencies in Cargo 1.60?

    ## Cargo 1.59 (2022-02-24)
    [7f08ace4...rust-1.59.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/7f08ace4...rust-1.59.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 The `strip` option can now be specified in a profile to specify the
      behavior for removing symbols and debug information from binaries.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#strip)
      [#10088](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10088)
      [#10376](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10376)
    - 🎉 Added future incompatible reporting.
      This provides reporting for when a future change in `rustc` may cause a
      package or any of its dependencies to stop building.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/future-incompat-report.html)
      [#10165](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10165)

      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/appendix/git-authentication.html#ssh-authentication)
      [#10248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10248)
    - Added `term.quiet` configuration option to enable the `--quiet` behavior
      from a config file.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#termquiet)
      [#10152](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10152)
    - Added `-r` CLI option as an alias for `--release`.
      [#10133](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10133)

    ### Changed

    - Scanning the package directory should now be resilient to errors, such as
      filesystem loops or access issues.
      [#10188](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10188)
      [#10214](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10214)
      [#10286](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10286)
    - `cargo help <alias>` will now show the target of the alias.
      [#10193](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10193)
    - Removed the deprecated `--host` CLI option.
      [#10145](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10145)
      [#10327](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10327)
    - Cargo should now report its version to always be in sync with `rustc`.
      [#10178](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10178)
    - Added EOPNOTSUPP to ignored file locking errors, which is relevant to BSD
      operating systems.
      [#10157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10157)

    ### Fixed

    - macOS: Fixed an issue where running an executable would sporadically be
      killed by the kernel (likely starting in macOS 12).
      [#10196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10196)
    - Fixed so that the `doc=false` setting is honored in the `[lib]` definition
      of a dependency.
      [#10201](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10201)
      [#10324](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10324)
    - The `"executable"` field in the JSON option was incorrectly including the
      path to `index.html` when documenting a binary. It is now null.
      [#10171](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10171)
    - Documenting a binary now waits for the package library to finish documenting
      before starting. This fixes some race conditions if the binary has intra-doc
      links to the library.
      [#10172](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10172)
    - Fixed panic when displaying help text to a closed pipe.

    ## Cargo 1.57 (2021-12-02)
    [18751dd3...rust-1.57.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/18751dd3...rust-1.57.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 Added custom named profiles. This also changes the `test` and `bench`
      profiles to inherit their settings from `dev` and `release`, and Cargo will
      now only use a single profile during a given command instead of using
      different profiles for dependencies and cargo-targets.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#custom-profiles)
      [#9943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9943)
    - The `rev` option for a git dependency now supports git references that start
      with `refs/`. An example where this can be used is to depend on a pull
      request from a service like GitHub before it is merged.
      [#9859](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9859)
    - Added `path_in_vcs` field to the `.cargo_vcs_info.json` file.

      [#9866](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9866)

    ### Changed

    - ❗ `RUSTFLAGS` is no longer set for build scripts. This change was made in
      1.55, but the release notes did not highlight this change. Build scripts
      should use `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` instead. See the
      [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts)
      for more details.
    - The `cargo version` command now includes some extra information.
      [#9968](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9968)
    - Updated libgit2 to 1.3 which brings in a number of fixes and changes to git
      handling.
      [#9963](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9963)
      [#9988](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9988)
    - Shell completions now include shorthand b/r/c/d subcommands.
      [#9951](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9951)
    - `cargo update --precise` now allows specifying a version without semver
      metadata (stuff after `+` in the version number).
      [#9945](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9945)
    - zsh completions now complete `--example` names.
      [#9939](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9939)
    - The progress bar now differentiates when building unittests.
      [#9934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9934)
    - Some backwards-compatibility support for invalid TOML syntax has been removed.
      [#9932](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9932)
    - Reverted the change from 1.55 that triggered an error for dependency
      specifications that did not include any fields.
      [#9911](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9911)

    ### Fixed

    - Removed a log message (from `CARGO_LOG`) that may leak tokens.
      [#9873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9873)
    - `cargo fix` will now avoid writing fixes to the global registry cache.
      [#9938](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9938)
    - Fixed `-Z help` CLI option when used with a shorthand alias (b/c/r/d).

    ## Cargo 1.56 (2021-10-21)
    [cebef295...rust-1.56.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/cebef295...rust-1.56.0)

    ### Added

    - 🎉 Cargo now supports the 2021 edition.
      More information may be found in the [edition
      guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/edition-guide/rust-2021/index.html).
      [#9800](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9800)
    - 🎉 Added the
      [`rust-version`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field)
      field to `Cargo.toml` to specify the minimum supported Rust version, and the
      `--ignore-rust-version` command line option to override it.
      [#9732](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9732)
    - Added the `[env]` table to config files to specify environment variables to
      set.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#env)
      [#9411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9411)
    - `[patch]` tables may now be specified in config files.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#patch)
      [#9839](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9839)
    - `cargo doc` now supports the `--example` and `--examples` flags.
      [#9808](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9808)
    - 🎉 Build scripts can now pass additional linker arguments for binaries or all
      linkable targets. [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#outputs-of-the-build-script)
      [#9557](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9557)
    - Added support for the `-p` flag for `cargo publish` to publish a specific
      package in a workspace. `cargo package` also now supports `-p` and
      `--workspace`.
      [#9559](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9559)
    - Added documentation about third-party registries.
      [#9830](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9830)
    - Added the `{sha256-checksum}` placeholder for URLs in a registry `config.json`.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registries.html#index-format)
      [#9801](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9801)
    - Added a warning when a dependency does not have a library.
      [#9771](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9771)

    ### Changed

    - Doc tests now support the `-q` flag to show terse test output.
      [#9730](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9730)

    - Changed so that only `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` executables are built
      without a hash in the filename. Previously it was all `wasm32` targets.
      Additionally, all `apple` binaries are now built with a hash in the
      filename. This allows multiple copies to be cached at once, and matches the
      behavior on other platforms (except `msvc`).
      [#9653](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9653)
    - `cargo new` now generates an example that doesn't generate a warning with
      clippy.

      edition when running on stable instead of generating an error.
      [#9792](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9792)
    - `cargo install` will now determine all of the packages to install before
      starting the installation, which should help with reporting errors without
      partially installing.
      [#9793](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9793)
    - The resolver report for `cargo fix --edition` now includes differences for
      dev-dependencies.
      [#9803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9803)
    - `cargo fix` will now show better diagnostics for abnormal errors from `rustc`.
      [#9799](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9799)

      [#9818](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9818)
    - Return an error instead of a stack overflow for command alias loops.
      [#9791](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9791)
    - Updated to curl 7.79.1, which will hopefully fix intermittent http2 errors.
      [#9937](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9937)

    ### Nightly only

    - Added `[future-incompat-report]` config section.
      [#9774](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9774)
    - Fixed value-after-table error with custom named profiles.
      [#9789](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9789)
    - Added the `different-binary-name` feature to support specifying a
      non-rust-identifier for a binary name.

      [#9627](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9627)
    - Added a profile option to select the codegen backend.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#codegen-backend)
      [#9118](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9118)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `rust-version` field in Cargo.toml as introduced in Cargo 1.56?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user specify a custom binary name in a Cargo project using the `different-binary-name` feature available in Cargo 1.56?

    ## Cargo 1.55 (2021-09-09)
    [aa8b0929...rust-1.55.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/aa8b0929...rust-1.55.0)

    ### Added

    - The package definition in `cargo metadata` now includes the `"default_run"`
      field from the manifest.
      [#9550](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9550)
    - ❗ Build scripts now have access to the following environment variables:
      `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`, `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`.
      `RUSTFLAGS` is no longer set for build scripts; they should use
      `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` instead.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts)
      [#9601](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9601)
    - Added `cargo d` as an alias for `cargo doc`.
      [#9680](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9680)
    - Added `{lib}` to the `cargo tree --format` option to display the library
      name of a package.
      [#9663](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9663)
    - Added `members_mut` method to the `Workspace` API.
      [#9547](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9547)

    ### Changed

    - If a build command does not match any targets when using the
      `--all-targets`, `--bins`, `--tests`, `--examples`, or `--benches` flags, a
      warning is now displayed to inform you that there were no matching targets.
      [#9549](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9549)
    - The way `cargo init` detects whether or not existing source files represent
      a binary or library has been changed to respect the command-line flags
      instead of trying to guess which type it is.
      [#9522](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9522)
    - Registry names are now displayed instead of registry URLs when possible.
      [#9632](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9632)
    - Duplicate compiler diagnostics are no longer shown. This can often happen
      with `cargo test` which builds multiple copies of the same code in parallel.
      This also updates the warning summary to provide more context.
      [#9675](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9675)
    - The output for warnings or errors is now improved to be leaner, cleaner, and
      show more context.
      [#9655](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9655)
    - Network send errors are now treated as "spurious" which means they will be retried.
      [#9695](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9695)
    - Git keys (`branch`, `tag`, `rev`) on a non-git dependency are now an error.
      Additionally, specifying both `git` and `path` is now an error.
      [#9689](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9689)
    - Specifying a dependency without any keys is now an error.
      [#9686](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9686)
    - The resolver now prefers to use `[patch]` table entries of dependencies when
      possible.
      [#9639](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9639)
    - Package name typo errors in dependencies are now displayed aligned with the
      original to help make it easier to see the difference.
      [#9665](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9665)
    - Windows platforms may now warn on environment variables that have the wrong case.
      [#9654](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9654)
    - `features` used in a `[patch]` table now issues a warning, as they are ignored.
      [#9666](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9666)
    - The `target` directory is now excluded from content indexing on Windows.
      [#9635](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9635)
    - When `Cargo.toml` is not found, the error message now detects if it was
      misnamed with a lowercase `c` to suggest the correct form.
      [#9607](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9607)
    - Building `diesel` with the new resolver displays a compatibility notice.
      [#9602](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9602)
    - Updated the `opener` dependency, which handles opening a web browser, which
      includes several changes, such as new behavior when run on WSL, and using
      the system `xdg-open` on Linux.
      [#9583](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9583)
    - Updated to libcurl 7.78.
      [#9809](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9809)
      [#9810](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9810)

    ### Fixed

    - Fixed dep-info files including non-local build script paths.
      [#9596](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9596)

    - `cargo fix` now supports rustc's suggestions with multiple spans.
      [#9567](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9567)
    - `cargo fix` now fixes each target serially instead of in parallel to avoid
      problems with fixing the same file concurrently.
      [#9677](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9677)
    - Changes to the target `linker` config value now trigger a rebuild.
      [#9647](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9647)
    - Git unstaged deleted files are now ignored when using the `--allow-dirty`
      flag with `cargo publish` or `cargo package`.
      [#9645](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9645)

    ### Nightly only

    ## Cargo 1.54 (2021-07-29)
    [4369396c...rust-1.54.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4369396c...rust-1.54.0)

    ### Added

    - Fetching from a git repository (such as the crates.io index) now displays
      the network transfer rate.
      [#9395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9395)
    - Added `--prune` option for `cargo tree` to limit what is displayed.
      [#9520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9520)
    - Added `--depth` option for `cargo tree` to limit what is displayed.
      [#9499](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9499)
    - Added `cargo tree -e no-proc-macro` to hide procedural macro dependencies.
      [#9488](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9488)
    - Added `doc.browser` config option to set which browser to open with `cargo doc --open`.
      [#9473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9473)
    - Added `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR` environment variable set for integration tests &
      benches. This provides a temporary or "scratch" directory in the `target`
      directory for tests and benches to use.
      [#9375](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9375)

    ### Changed

    - `--features` CLI flags now provide typo suggestions with the new feature resolver.
      [#9420](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9420)
    - Cargo now uses a new parser for SemVer versions. This should behave mostly
      the same as before with some minor exceptions where invalid syntax for
      version requirements is now rejected.
      [#9508](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9508)
    - Mtime handling of `.crate` published packages has changed slightly to avoid
      mtime values of 0. This was causing problems with lldb which refused to read
      those files.
      [#9517](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9517)
    - Improved performance of git status check in `cargo package`.
      [#9478](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9478)
    - `cargo new` with fossil now places the ignore settings in the new repository
      instead of using `fossil settings` to set them globally. This also includes
      several other cleanups to make it more consistent with other VCS
      configurations.
      [#9469](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9469)
    - `rustc-cdylib-link-arg` applying transitively displays a warning that this
      was not intended, and may be an error in the future.
      [#9563](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9563)

    ### Fixed

    - Fixed `package.exclude` in `Cargo.toml` using inverted exclusions
      (`!somefile`) when not in a git repository or when vendoring a dependency.
      [#9186](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9186)
    - Dep-info files now adjust build script `rerun-if-changed` paths to be
      absolute paths.
      [#9421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9421)
    - Fixed a bug when with resolver = "1" non-virtual package was allowing
      unknown features.
      [#9437](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9437)
    - Fixed an issue with the index cache mishandling versions that only
      differed in build metadata (such as `110.0.0` and `110.0.0+1.1.0f`).
      [#9476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9476)
    - Fixed `cargo install` with a semver metadata version.
      [#9467](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9467)

    ### Nightly only

    - Added `report` subcommand, and changed `cargo
      describe-future-incompatibilitie` to `cargo report
      future-incompatibilities`.
      [#9438](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9438)
    - Added a `[host]` table to the config files to be able to set build flags for
      host target. Also added `target-applies-to-host` to control how the
      `[target]` tables behave.
      [#9322](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9322)
    - Added some validation to build script `rustc-link-arg-*` instructions to
      return an error if the target doesn't exist.
      [#9523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9523)
    - Added `cargo:rustc-link-arg-bin` instruction for build scripts.

    ## Cargo 1.53 (2021-06-17)
    [90691f2b...rust-1.53.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/90691f2b...rust-1.53.0)

    ### Added

    ### Changed
    - 🔥 Cargo now supports git repositories where the default `HEAD` branch is not
      "master". This also includes a switch to the version 3 `Cargo.lock` format
      which can handle default branches correctly.
      [#9133](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9133)
      [#9397](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9397)
      [#9384](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9384)
      [#9392](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9392)
    - 🔥 macOS targets now default to `unpacked` split-debuginfo.
      [#9298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9298)
    - ❗ The `authors` field is no longer included in `Cargo.toml` for new
      projects.
      [#9282](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9282)
    - `cargo update` may now work with the `--offline` flag.
      [#9279](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9279)
    - `cargo doc` will now erase the `doc` directory when switching between
      different toolchain versions. There are shared, unversioned files (such as
      the search index) that can become broken when using different versions.
      [#8640](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8640)
      [#9404](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9404)
    - Improved error messages when path dependency/workspace member is missing.
      [#9368](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9368)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed `cargo doc` detecting if the documentation needs to be rebuilt when
      changing some settings such as features.
      [#9419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9419)
    - `cargo doc` now deletes the output directory for the package before running
      rustdoc to clear out any stale files.
      [#9419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9419)
    - Fixed the `-C metadata` value to always include all information for all
      builds. Previously, in some situations, the hash only included the package
      name and version. This fixes some issues, such as incremental builds with
      split-debuginfo on macOS corrupting the incremental cache in some cases.
      [#9418](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9418)
    - Fixed man pages not working on Windows if `man` is in `PATH`.

    ## Cargo 1.51 (2021-03-25)
    [75d5d8cf...rust-1.51.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/75d5d8cf...rust-1.51.0)

    ### Added
    - 🔥 Added the `split-debuginfo` profile option.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#split-debuginfo)
      [#9112](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9112)
    - Added the `path` field to `cargo metadata` for the package dependencies list
      to show the path for "path" dependencies.
      [#8994](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8994)
    - 🔥 Added a new feature resolver, and new CLI feature flag behavior. See the
      new [features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-resolver-version-2)
      and [resolver](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/resolver.html#feature-resolver-version-2)
      documentation for the `resolver = "2"` option. See the
      [CLI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options)
      and [resolver 2 CLI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#resolver-version-2-command-line-flags)
      options for the new CLI behavior. And, finally, see
      [RFC 2957](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2957-cargo-features2.md)
      for a detailed look at what has changed.
      [#8997](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8997)

    ### Changed
    - `cargo install --locked` now emits a warning if `Cargo.lock` is not found.

      suggestions for the correct package ID.
      [#9095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9095)
    - Slightly optimize `cargo vendor`
      [#8937](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8937)
      [#9131](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9131)
      [#9132](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9132)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed environment variables and cfg settings emitted by a build script that
      are set for `cargo test` and `cargo run` when the build script runs multiple
      times during the same build session.
      [#9122](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9122)
    - Fixed a panic with `cargo doc` and the new feature resolver. This also
      introduces some heuristics to try to avoid path collisions with `rustdoc` by
      only documenting one variant of a package if there are multiple (such as
      multiple versions, or the same package shared for host and target
      platforms).
      [#9077](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9077)
    - Fixed a bug in Cargo's cyclic dep graph detection that caused a stack
      overflow.
      [#9075](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9075)
    - Fixed build script `links` environment variables (`DEP_*`) not showing up
      for testing packages in some cases.
      [#9065](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9065)
    - Fixed features being selected in a nondeterministic way for a specific
      scenario when building an entire workspace with all targets with a
      proc-macro in the workspace with `resolver="2"`.
      [#9059](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9059)
    - Fixed to use `http.proxy` setting in `~/.gitconfig`.
      [#8986](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8986)
    - Fixed --feature pkg/feat for V1 resolver for non-member.
      [#9275](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9275)
      [#9277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9277)
    - Fixed panic in `cargo doc` when there are colliding output filenames in a workspace.
      [#9276](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9276)
      [#9277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9277)
    - Fixed `cargo install` from exiting with success if one of several packages
      did not install successfully.
      [#9185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9185)
      [#9196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9196)
    - Fix panic with doc collision orphan.
      [#9142](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9142)
      [#9196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9196)

    ### Nightly only
    - Removed the `publish-lockfile` unstable feature, it was stabilized without
      the need for an explicit flag 1.5 years ago.
      [#9092](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9092)
    - Added better diagnostics, help messages, and documentation for nightly
      features (such as those passed with the `-Z` flag, or specified with
      `cargo-features` in `Cargo.toml`).
      [#9092](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9092)
    - Added support for Rust edition 2021.
      [#8922](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8922)
    - Added support for the `rust-version` field in project metadata.
      [#8037](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8037)
    - Added a schema field to the index.
      [#9161](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9161)
      [#9196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9196)
  documentationQuestion1: What are the primary purposes of the new feature resolver and CLI feature flag behavior introduced in Cargo 1.51?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user specify the new feature resolver version 2 using the CLI, and what is an example command that demonstrates this?

    ## Cargo 1.50 (2021-02-11)
    [8662ab42...rust-1.50.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/8662ab42...rust-1.50.0)

    ### Added
    - Added the `doc` field to `cargo metadata`, which indicates if a target is
      documented.
      [#8869](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8869)
    - Added `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`, an alternate RUSTC wrapper that only runs
      for the local workspace packages, and caches its artifacts independently of
      non-wrapped builds.
      [#8976](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8976)
    - Added `--workspace` to `cargo update` to update only the workspace members,
      and not their dependencies. This is particularly useful if you update the
      version in `Cargo.toml` and want to update `Cargo.lock` without running any
      other commands.
      [#8725](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8725)

    ### Changed
    - `.crate` files uploaded to a registry are now built with reproducible
      settings, so that the same `.crate` file created on different machines
      should be identical.
      [#8864](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8864)
    - Git dependencies that specify more than one of `branch`, `tag`, or `rev` are
      now rejected.
      [#8984](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8984)
    - The `rerun-if-changed` build script directive can now point to a directory,
      in which case Cargo will check if any file in that directory changes.
      [#8973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8973)
    - If Cargo cannot determine the username or email address, `cargo new` will no
      longer fail, and instead create an empty authors list.
      [#8912](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8912)
    - The progress bar width has been reduced to provide more room to display the
      crates currently being built.
      [#8892](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8892)
    - `cargo new` will now support `includeIf` directives in `.gitconfig` to match
      the correct directory when determining the username and email address.
      [#8886](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8886)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed `cargo metadata` and `cargo tree` to only download packages for the
      requested target.
      [#8987](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8987)
    - Updated libgit2, which brings in many fixes, particularly fixing a zlib
      error that occasionally appeared on 32-bit systems.
      [#8998](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8998)
    - Fixed stack overflow with a circular dev-dependency that uses the `links`
      field.
      [#8969](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8969)
    - Fixed `cargo publish` failing on some filesystems, particularly 9p on WSL2.
      [#8950](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8950)

    ### Nightly only
    - Allow `resolver="1"` to specify the original feature resolution behavior.
      [#8857](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8857)
    - Added `-Z extra-link-arg` which adds the `cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins`
      and `cargo:rustc-link-arg` build script options.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#extra-link-arg)
      [#8441](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8441)
    - Implemented external credential process support, and added `cargo logout`.
      ([RFC 2730](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2730-cargo-token-from-process.md))
      ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#credential-process))
      [#8934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8934)
    - Fix panic with `-Zbuild-std` and no roots.
      [#8942](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8942)
    - Set docs.rs as the default extern-map for crates.io

    ## Cargo 1.49 (2020-12-31)
    [75615f8e...rust-1.49.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/75615f8e...rust-1.49.0)

    ### Added
    - Added `homepage` and `documentation` fields to `cargo metadata`.
      [#8744](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8744)
    - Added the `CARGO_PRIMARY_PACKAGE` environment variable which is set when
      running `rustc` if the package is one of the "root" packages selected on the
      command line.
      [#8758](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8758)
    - Added support for Unix-style glob patterns for package and target selection
      flags on the command-line (such as `-p 'serde*'` or `--test '*'`).
      [#8752](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8752)

    ### Changed
    - Computed LTO flags are now included in the filename metadata hash so that
      changes in LTO settings will independently cache build artifacts instead of
      overwriting previous ones. This prevents rebuilds in some situations such as
      switching between `cargo build` and `cargo test` in some circumstances.
      [#8755](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8755)
    - `cargo tree` now displays `(proc-macro)` next to proc-macro packages.
      [#8765](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8765)
    - Added a warning that the allowed characters for a feature name have been
      restricted to letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `+` to accommodate future
      syntax changes. This is still a superset of the allowed syntax on crates.io,
      which requires ASCII. This is intended to be changed to an error in the
      future.
      [#8814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8814)
    - `-p` without a value will now print a list of workspace package names.
      [#8808](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8808)
    - Add period to allowed feature name characters.
      [#8932](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8932)
      [#8943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8943)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed building a library with both "dylib" and "rlib" crate types with LTO enabled.
      [#8754](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8754)
    - Fixed paths in Cargo's dep-info files.
      [#8819](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8819)
    - Fixed inconsistent source IDs in `cargo metadata` for git dependencies that
      explicitly specify `branch="master"`.
      [#8824](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8824)
    - Fixed re-extracting dependencies which contained a `.cargo-ok` file.
      [#8835](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8835)

    ### Nightly only
    - Fixed a panic with `cargo doc -Zfeatures=itarget` in some situations.
      [#8777](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8777)
    - New implementation for namespaced features, using the syntax `dep:serde`.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#namespaced-features)
      [#8799](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8799)
    - Added support for "weak" dependency features, using the syntax
      `dep_name?/feat_name`, which will enable a feature for a dependency without
      also enabling the dependency.
      [#8818](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8818)
    - Fixed the new feature resolver downloading extra dependencies that weren't
      strictly necessary.
      [#8823](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8823)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `homepage` and `documentation` fields added to `cargo metadata` in Cargo 1.49?

      [#8165](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8165)
    - Added `--message-format plain` option to `cargo locate-project` to display
      the project location without JSON to make it easier to use in a script.
      [#8707](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8707)
    - Added `--workspace` option to `cargo locate-project` to display the path to
      the workspace manifest.
      [#8712](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8712)

      [#8740](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8740)

    ### Changed

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed `cargo new` creating a fossil repository to properly ignore the `target` directory.
      [#8671](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8671)
    - Don't show warnings about the workspace in the current directory when using `cargo install`
      of a remote package.

      encountered in the git repository.
      [#8735](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8735)
    - Updated libgit2, which brings in several fixes for git repository handling.
      [#8778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8778)
      [#8780](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8780)

    ### Nightly only
    - Fixed `cargo install` so that it will ignore the `[unstable]` table in local config files.
      [#8656](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8656)
    - Fixed nondeterministic behavior of the new feature resolver.
      [#8701](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8701)
    - Fixed running `cargo test` on a proc-macro with the new feature resolver
      under a specific combination of circumstances.

    ## Cargo 1.47 (2020-10-08)
    [4f74d9b2...rust-1.47.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4f74d9b2...rust-1.47.0)

    ### Added
    - `cargo doc` will now include the package's version in the left sidebar.
      [#8509](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8509)
    - Added the `test` field to `cargo metadata` targets.
      [#8478](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8478)
    - Cargo's man pages are now displayed via the `cargo help` command (such as
      `cargo help build`).
      [#8456](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8456)
      [#8577](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8577)
    - Added new documentation chapters on [how dependency resolution
      works](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/resolver.html) and
      [SemVer
      compatibility](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/semver.html),
      along with suggestions on how to version your project and work with
      dependencies.
      [#8609](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8609)

    ### Changed
    - The comments added to `.gitignore` when it is modified have been tweaked to
      add some spacing.
      [#8476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8476)
    - `cargo metadata` output should now be sorted to be deterministic.
      [#8489](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8489)
    - By default, build scripts and proc-macros are now built with `opt-level=0`
      and the default codegen units, even in release mode.
      [#8500](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8500)
    - `workspace.default-members` is now filtered by `workspace.exclude`.
      [#8485](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8485)
    - `workspace.members` globs now ignore non-directory paths.
      [#8511](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8511)
    - git zlib errors now trigger a retry.
      [#8520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8520)
    - "http" class git errors now trigger a retry.
      [#8553](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8553)
    - git dependencies now override the `core.autocrlf` git configuration value to
      ensure they behave consistently across platforms, particularly when
      vendoring git dependencies on Windows.
      [#8523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8523)
    - If `Cargo.lock` needs to be updated, then it will be automatically
      transitioned to the new V2 format. This format removes the `[metadata]`
      table, and should be easier to merge changes in source control systems. This
      format was introduced in 1.38, and made the default for new projects in
      1.41.
      [#8554](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8554)
    - Added preparation for support of git repositories with a non-"master"
      default branch. Actual support will arrive in a future version. This
      introduces some warnings:
      - Warn if a git dependency does not specify a branch, and the default branch
        on the repository is not "master". In the future, Cargo will fetch the
        default branch. In this scenario, the branch should be explicitly
        specified.
      - Warn if a workspace has multiple dependencies to the same git repository,
        one without a `branch` and one with `branch="master"`. Dependencies should
        all use one form or the other.
      [#8522](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8522)
    - Warnings are now issued if a `required-features` entry lists a feature that
      does not exist.
      [#7950](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7950)
    - Built-in aliases are now included in `cargo --list`.
      [#8542](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8542)
    - `cargo install` with a specific version that has been yanked will now
      display an error message that it has been yanked, instead of "could not
      find".
      [#8565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8565)
    - `cargo publish` with a package that has the `publish` field set to a single
      registry, and no `--registry` flag has been given, will now publish to that
      registry instead of generating an error.
      [#8571](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8571)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed issue where if a project directory was moved, and one of the
      build scripts did not use the `rerun-if-changed` directive, then that
      build script was being rebuilt when it shouldn't.
      [#8497](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8497)
    - Console colors should now work on Windows 7 and 8.
      [#8540](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8540)
    - The `CARGO_TARGET_{triplet}_RUNNER` environment variable will now correctly
      override the config file instead of trying to merge the commands.
      [#8629](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8629)
    - Fixed LTO with doctests.
      [#8657](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8657)
      [#8658](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8658)

    ### Nightly only
    - Added support for `-Z terminal-width` which tells `rustc` the width of the
      terminal so that it can format diagnostics better.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#terminal-width)
      [#8427](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8427)
    - Added ability to configure `-Z` unstable flags in config files via the
      `[unstable]` table.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html)
      [#8393](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8393)
    - Added `-Z build-std-features` flag to set features for the standard library.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std-features)
      [#8490](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8490)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the Cargo 1.47 release features related to documentation and dependency management?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a developer use the `cargo doc` command to include the package's version in the left sidebar of the generated documentation?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the new Cargo.lock V2 format introduced in Cargo 1.47, and how does it affect version control workflows?

    Documentation text:

    ## Cargo 1.46 (2020-08-27)
    [9fcb8c1d...rust-1.46.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/9fcb8c1d...rust-1.46.0)

    ### Added
    - The `dl` key in `config.json` of a registry index now supports the
      replacement markers `{prefix}` and `{lowerprefix}` to allow spreading crates
      across directories similar to how the index itself is structured.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registries.html#index-format)
      [#8267](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8267)
    - Added new environment variables that are set during compilation:
      - `CARGO_CRATE_NAME`: The name of the crate being built.
      - `CARGO_BIN_NAME`: The name of the executable binary (if this is a binary crate).
      - `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE`: The `license` field from the manifest.
      - `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE_FILE`: The `license-file` field from the manifest.
      [#8270](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8270)
      [#8325](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8325)
      [#8387](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8387)
    - If the value for `readme` is not specified in `Cargo.toml`, it is now
      automatically inferred from the existence of a file named `README`,
      `README.md`, or `README.txt`. This can be suppressed by setting
      `readme = false`.
      [#8277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8277)
    - `cargo install` now supports the `--index` flag to install directly from an index.
      [#8344](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8344)
    - Added the `metadata` table to the `workspace` definition in `Cargo.toml`.
      This can be used for arbitrary data similar to the `package.metadata` table.
      [#8323](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8323)
    - Added the `--target-dir` flag to `cargo install` to set the target directory.
      [#8391](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8391)
    - Changes to environment variables used by the
      [`env!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.env.html) or
      [`option_env!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.option_env.html) macros
      are now automatically detected to trigger a rebuild.
      [#8421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8421)
    - The `target` directory now includes the `CACHEDIR.TAG` file which is used by
      some tools to exclude the directory from backups.
      [#8378](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8378)
    - Added docs about rustup's `+toolchain` syntax.
      [#8455](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8455)

    ### Changed
    - A warning is now displayed if a git dependency includes a `#` fragment in
      the URL. This was potentially confusing because Cargo itself displays git
      URLs with this syntax, but it does not have any meaning outside of the
      `Cargo.lock` file, and would not work properly.
      [#8297](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8297)
    - Various optimizations and fixes for bitcode embedding and LTO.
      [#8349](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8349)
    - Reduced the amount of data fetched for git dependencies. If Cargo knows the
      branch or tag to fetch, it will now only fetch that branch or tag instead of
      all branches and tags.
      [#8363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8363)
    - Enhanced git fetch error messages.
      [#8409](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8409)
    - `.crate` files are now generated with GNU tar format instead of UStar, which
      supports longer file names.
      [#8453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8453)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed a rare situation where an update to `Cargo.lock` failed once, but then
      subsequent runs allowed it proceed.
      [#8274](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8274)
    - Removed assertion that Windows dylibs must have a `.dll` extension. Some
      custom JSON spec targets may change the extension.
      [#8310](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8310)
    - Updated libgit2, which brings in a fix for zlib errors for some remote
      git servers like googlesource.com.
      [#8320](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8320)
    - Fixed the GitHub fast-path check for up-to-date git dependencies on
      non-master branches.
      [#8363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8363)
    - Fixed issue when enabling a feature with `pkg/feature` syntax, and `pkg` is
      an optional dependency, but also a dev-dependency, and the dev-dependency
      appears before the optional normal dependency in the registry summary, then
      the optional dependency would not get activated.
      [#8395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8395)
    - Fixed `clean -p` deleting the build directory if there is a test named
      `build`.
      [#8398](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8398)
    - Fixed indentation of multi-line Cargo error messages.
      [#8409](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8409)
    - Fixed issue where the automatic inclusion of the `--document-private-items`
      flag for rustdoc would override any flags passed to the `cargo rustdoc`
      command.
      [#8449](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8449)
    - Cargo will now include a version in the hash of the fingerprint directories
      to support backwards-incompatible changes to the fingerprint structure.
      [#8473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8473)
      [#8488](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8488)

    ### Nightly only
    - Added `-Zrustdoc-map` feature which provides external mappings for rustdoc
      (such as https://docs.rs/ links).
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#rustdoc-map)
      [#8287](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8287)
    - Fixed feature calculation when a proc-macro is declared in `Cargo.toml` with
      an underscore (like `proc_macro = true`).
      [#8319](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8319)
    - Added support for setting `-Clinker` with `-Zdoctest-xcompile`.
      [#8359](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8359)
    - Fixed setting the `strip` profile field in config files.
      [#8454](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8454)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `metadata` table in the `workspace` definition of a `Cargo.toml` file according to the Cargo 1.46 release notes?
  documentationQuestion2: How can the `--index` flag be used with the `cargo install` command to install a package directly from a custom index, and what is the typical use case for this?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the function of the `CARGO_CRATE_NAME` environment variable, and how can it be utilized in a Rust project's build process?

    ## Cargo 1.45 (2020-07-16)
    [ebda5065e...rust-1.45.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/ebda5065...rust-1.45.0)

    ### Added

    ### Changed
    - Changed official documentation to recommend `.cargo/config.toml` filenames
      (with the `.toml` extension). `.toml` extension support was added in 1.39.
      [#8121](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8121)
    - The `registry.index` config value is no longer allowed (it has been
      deprecated for 4 years).
      [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
    - An error is generated if both `--index` and `--registry` are passed
      (previously `--index` was silently ignored).
      [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
    - The `registry.token` config value is no longer used with the `--index` flag.
      This is intended to avoid potentially leaking the crates.io token to another
      registry.
      [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
    - Added a warning if `registry.token` is used with source replacement. It is
      intended this will be an error in future versions.
      [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
    - Windows GNU targets now copy `.dll.a` import library files for DLL crate
      types to the output directory.
      [#8141](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8141)
    - Dylibs for all dependencies are now unconditionally copied to the output
      directory. Some obscure scenarios can cause an old dylib to be referenced
      between builds, and this ensures that all the latest copies are used.
      [#8139](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8139)
    - `package.exclude` can now match directory names. If a directory is
      specified, the entire directory will be excluded, and Cargo will not attempt
      to inspect it further. Previously Cargo would try to check every file in the
      directory which could cause problems if the directory contained unreadable
      files.
      [#8095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8095)
    - When packaging with `cargo publish` or `cargo package`, Cargo can use git to
      guide its decision on which files to include. Previously this git-based
      logic required a `Cargo.toml` file to exist at the root of the repository.
      This is no longer required, so Cargo will now use git-based guidance even if
      there is not a `Cargo.toml` in the root of the repository.
      [#8095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8095)
    - While unpacking a crate on Windows, if it fails to write a file because the
      file is a reserved Windows filename (like "aux.rs"), Cargo will display an
      extra message to explain why it failed.
      [#8136](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8136)
    - Failures to set mtime on files are now ignored. Some filesystems did not
      support this.
      [#8185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8185)
    - Certain classes of git errors will now recommend enabling
      `net.git-fetch-with-cli`.
      [#8166](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8166)
    - When doing an LTO build, Cargo will now instruct rustc not to perform
      codegen when possible. This may result in a faster build and use less disk
      space. Additionally, for non-LTO builds, Cargo will instruct rustc to not
      embed LLVM bitcode in libraries, which should decrease their size.
      [#8192](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8192)
      [#8226](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8226)
      [#8254](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8254)
    - The implementation for `cargo clean -p` has been rewritten so that it can
      more accurately remove the files for a specific package.
      [#8210](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8210)
    - The way Cargo computes the outputs from a build has been rewritten to be
      more complete and accurate. Newly tracked files will be displayed in JSON
      messages, and may be uplifted to the output directory in some cases. Some of
      the changes from this are:

      - `.exp` export files on Windows MSVC dynamic libraries are now tracked.
      - Proc-macros on Windows track import/export files.
      - All targets (like tests, etc.) that generate separate debug files
        (pdb/dSYM) are tracked.
      - Added .map files for wasm32-unknown-emscripten.
      - macOS dSYM directories are tracked for all dynamic libraries
        (dylib/cdylib/proc-macro) and for build scripts.

      There are a variety of other changes as a consequence of this:

      - Binary examples on Windows MSVC with a hyphen will now show up twice in
        the examples directory (`foo_bar.exe` and `foo-bar.exe`). Previously Cargo
        just renamed the file instead of hard-linking it.
      - Example libraries now follow the same rules for hyphen/underscore
        translation as normal libs (they will now use underscores).

      [#8210](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8210)
    - Cargo attempts to scrub any secrets from the debug log for HTTP debugging.
      [#8222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8222)
    - Context has been added to many of Cargo's filesystem operations, so that
      error messages now provide more information, such as the path that caused
      the problem.
      [#8232](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8232)
    - Several commands now ignore the error if stdout or stderr is closed while it
      is running. For example `cargo install --list | grep -q cargo-fuzz` would
      previously sometimes panic because `grep -q` may close stdout before the
      command finishes. Regular builds continue to fail if stdout or stderr is
      closed, matching the behavior of many other build systems.
      [#8236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8236)
    - If `cargo install` is given an exact version, like `--version=1.2.3`, it
      will now avoid updating the index if that version is already installed, and
      exit quickly indicating it is already installed.
      [#8022](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8022)
    - Changes to the `[patch]` section will now attempt to automatically update
      `Cargo.lock` to the new version. It should now also provide better error
      messages for the rare cases where it is unable to automatically update.
      [#8248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8248)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed copying Windows `.pdb` files to the output directory when the filename
      contained dashes.
      [#8123](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8123)
    - Fixed error where Cargo would fail when scanning if a package is inside a
      git repository when any of its ancestor paths is a symlink.
      [#8186](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8186)
    - Fixed `cargo update` with an unused `[patch]` so that it does not get
      stuck and refuse to update.
      [#8243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8243)
    - Fixed a situation where Cargo would hang if stderr is closed, and the
      compiler generated a large number of messages.
      [#8247](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8247)
    - Fixed backtraces on macOS not showing filenames or line numbers. As a
      consequence of this, binary executables on apple targets do not include a
      hash in the filename in Cargo's cache. This means Cargo can only track one
      copy, so if you switch features or rustc versions, Cargo will need to
      rebuild the executable.
      [#8329](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8329)
      [#8335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8335)
    - Fixed fingerprinting when using lld on Windows with a dylib. Cargo was
      erroneously thinking the dylib was never fresh.
      [#8290](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8290)
      [#8335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8335)

    ### Nightly only
    - Fixed passing the full path for `--target` to `rustdoc` when using JSON spec
      targets.
      [#8094](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8094)
    - `-Cembed-bitcode=no` renamed to `-Cbitcode-in-rlib=no`
      [#8134](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8134)
    - Added new `resolver` field to `Cargo.toml` to opt-in to the new feature
      resolver.
      [#8129](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8129)
    - `-Zbuild-std` no longer treats std dependencies as "local". This means that
      it won't use incremental compilation for those dependencies, removes them
      from dep-info files, and caps lints at "allow".
      [#8177](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8177)
    - Added `-Zmultitarget` which allows multiple `--target` flags to build the
      same thing for multiple targets at once.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#multitarget)
      [#8167](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8167)
    - Added `strip` option to the profile to remove symbols and debug information.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#profile-strip-option)
      [#8246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8246)
    - Fixed panic with `cargo tree --target=all -Zfeatures=all`.
      [#8269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8269)

    ## Cargo 1.44 (2020-06-04)
    [bda50510...rust-1.44.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/bda50510...rust-1.44.0)

    ### Added
    - 🔥 Added the `cargo tree` command.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-tree.html)
      [#8062](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8062)
    - Added warnings if a package has Windows-restricted filenames (like `nul`,
      `con`, `aux`, `prn`, etc.).
      [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)
    - Added a `"build-finished"` JSON message when compilation is complete so that
      tools can detect when they can stop listening for JSON messages with
      commands like `cargo run` or `cargo test`.
      [#8069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8069)

    ### Changed
    - Valid package names are now restricted to Unicode XID identifiers. This is
      mostly the same as before, except package names cannot start with a number
      or `-`.
      [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)
    - `cargo new` and `init` will warn or reject additional package names
      (reserved Windows names, reserved Cargo directories, non-ASCII names,
      conflicting std names like `core`, etc.).
      [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)
    - Tests are no longer hard-linked into the output directory (`target/debug/`).
      This ensures tools will have access to debug symbols and execute tests in
      the same way as Cargo. Tools should use JSON messages to discover the path
      to the executable.
      [#7965](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7965)
    - Updating git submodules now displays an "Updating" message for each
      submodule.
      [#7989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7989)
    - File modification times are now preserved when extracting a `.crate` file.
      This reverses the change made in 1.40 where the mtime was not preserved.
      [#7935](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7935)
    - Build script warnings are now displayed separately when the build script
      fails.
      [#8017](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8017)
    - Removed the `git-checkout` subcommand.
      [#8040](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8040)
    - The progress bar is now enabled for all unix platforms. Previously it was
      only Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.
      [#8054](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8054)
    - Artifacts generated by pre-release versions of `rustc` now share the same
      filenames. This means that changing nightly versions will not leave stale
      files in the build directory.
      [#8073](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8073)
    - Invalid package names are rejected when using renamed dependencies.
      [#8090](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8090)
    - Added a certain class of HTTP2 errors as "spurious" that will get retried.
      [#8102](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8102)
    - Allow `cargo package --list` to succeed, even if there are other validation
      errors (such as `Cargo.lock` generation problem, or missing dependencies).
      [#8175](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8175)
      [#8215](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8215)

    ### Fixed
    - Cargo no longer buffers excessive amounts of compiler output in memory.
      [#7838](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7838)
    - Symbolic links in git repositories now work on Windows.
      [#7996](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7996)
    - Fixed an issue where `profile.dev` was not loaded from a config file with
      `cargo test` when the `dev` profile was not defined in `Cargo.toml`.
      [#8012](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8012)
    - When a binary is built as an implicit dependency of an integration test,
      it now checks `dep_name/feature_name` syntax in `required-features` correctly.
      [#8020](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8020)
    - Fixed an issue where Cargo would not detect that an executable (such as an
      integration test) needs to be rebuilt when the previous build was
      interrupted with Ctrl-C.
      [#8087](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8087)
    - Protect against some (unknown) situations where Cargo could panic when the
      system monotonic clock doesn't appear to be monotonic.
      [#8114](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8114)
    - Fixed panic with `cargo clean -p` if the package has a build script.
      [#8216](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8216)

    ### Nightly only
    - Fixed panic with new feature resolver and required-features.
      [#7962](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7962)
    - Added `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` environment variable, which provides a way
      to wrap `rustc` for workspace members only, and affects the filename hash so
      that artifacts produced by the wrapper are cached separately. This usage can
      be seen on nightly clippy with `cargo clippy -Zunstable-options`.
      [#7533](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7533)
    - Added `--unit-graph` CLI option to display Cargo's internal dependency graph
      as JSON.
      [#7977](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7977)
    - Changed `-Zbuild_dep` to `-Zhost_dep`, and added proc-macros to the feature
      decoupling logic.
      [#8003](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8003)
      [#8028](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8028)
    - Fixed so that `--crate-version` is not automatically passed when the flag
      is found in `RUSTDOCFLAGS`.
      [#8014](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8014)
    - Fixed panic with `-Zfeatures=dev_dep` and `check --profile=test`.
      [#8027](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8027)
    - Fixed panic with `-Zfeatures=itarget` with certain host dependencies.
      [#8048](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8048)
    - Added support for `-Cembed-bitcode=no`, which provides a performance boost
      and disk-space usage reduction for non-LTO builds.
      [#8066](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8066)
    - `-Zpackage-features` has been extended with several changes intended to make
      it easier to select features on the command-line in a workspace.
      [#8074](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8074)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `cargo tree` command introduced in Cargo 1.44?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a developer use the `--unit-graph` option to inspect Cargo's internal dependency graph, and what is the typical use case for this feature?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` environment variable in Cargo's nightly build process, and how can it be utilized in practice?

    ## Cargo 1.43 (2020-04-23)
    [9d32b7b0...rust-1.43.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/9d32b7b0...rust-1.43.0)

    ### Added
    - 🔥 Profiles may now be specified in config files (and environment variables).
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#profile)
      [#7823](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7823)
    - ❗ Added `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` environment variable when building
      integration tests. This variable contains the path to any `[[bin]]` targets
      in the package. Integration tests should use the `env!` macro to determine
      the path to a binary to execute.
      [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates)
      [#7697](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7697)

    ### Changed
    - `cargo install --git` now honors workspaces in a git repository. This allows
      workspace settings, like `[patch]`, `[replace]`, or `[profile]` to be used.
      [#7768](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7768)
    - `cargo new` will now run `rustfmt` on the new files to pick up rustfmt
      settings like `tab_spaces` so that the new file matches the user's preferred
      indentation settings.
      [#7827](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7827)
    - Environment variables printed with "very verbose" output (`-vv`) are now
      consistently sorted.
      [#7877](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7877)
    - Debug logging for fingerprint rebuild-detection now includes more information.
      [#7888](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7888)
      [#7890](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7890)
      [#7952](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7952)
    - Added warning during publish if the license-file doesn't exist.
      [#7905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7905)
    - The `license-file` file is automatically included during publish, even if it
      is not explicitly listed in the `include` list or is in a location outside
      of the root of the package.
      [#7905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7905)
    - `CARGO_CFG_DEBUG_ASSERTIONS` and `CARGO_CFG_PROC_MACRO` are no longer set
      when running a build script. These were inadvertently set in the past, but
      had no meaning as they were always true. Additionally, `cfg(proc-macro)`
      is no longer supported in a `target` expression.
      [#7943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7943)
      [#7970](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7970)

    ### Fixed
    - Global command-line flags now work with aliases (like `cargo -v b`).
      [#7837](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7837)
    - Required-features using dependency syntax (like `renamed_dep/feat_name`) now
      handle renamed dependencies correctly.
      [#7855](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7855)
    - Fixed a rare situation where if a build script is run multiple times during
      the same build, Cargo will now keep the results separate instead of losing
      the output of the first execution.
      [#7857](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7857)
    - Fixed incorrect interpretation of environment variable
      `CARGO_TARGET_*_RUNNER=true` as a boolean. Also improved related env var
      error messages.
      [#7891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7891)
    - Updated internal libgit2 library, bringing various fixes to git support.
      [#7939](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7939)
    - `cargo package` / `cargo publish` should no longer buffer the entire
      contents of each file in memory.
      [#7946](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7946)
    - Ignore more invalid `Cargo.toml` files in a git dependency. Cargo currently
      walks the entire repo to find the requested package. Certain invalid
      manifests were already skipped, and now it should skip all of them.
      [#7947](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7947)

    ### Nightly only
    - Added `build.out-dir` config variable to set the output directory.
      [#7810](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7810)
    - Added `-Zjobserver-per-rustc` feature to support improved performance for
      parallel rustc.
      [#7731](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7731)
    - Fixed filename collision with `build-std` and crates like `cc`.
      [#7860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7860)
    - `-Ztimings` will now save its report even if there is an error.
      [#7872](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7872)
    - Updated `--config` command-line flag to support taking a path to a config
      file to load.
      [#7901](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7901)
    - Added new feature resolver.
      [#7820](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7820)
    - Rustdoc docs now automatically include the version of the package in the
      side bar (requires `-Z crate-versions` flag).
      [#7903](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7903)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` environment variable introduced in Cargo 1.43?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user determine the path to a binary built for integration tests using the `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` environment variable?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the `license-file` inclusion during the publish process in Cargo 1.43?

    ## Cargo 1.42 (2020-03-12)
    [0bf7aafe...rust-1.42.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/0bf7aafe...rust-1.42.0)

    ### Added
    - Added documentation on git authentication.
      [#7658](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7658)
    - Bitbucket Pipeline badges are now supported on crates.io.
      [#7663](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7663)
    - `cargo vendor` now accepts the `--versioned-dirs` option to force it to
      always include the version number in each package's directory name.
      [#7631](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7631)
    - The `proc_macro` crate is now automatically added to the extern prelude for
      proc-macro packages. This means that `extern crate proc_macro;` is no longer
      necessary for proc-macros.
      [#7700](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7700)

    ### Changed
    - Emit a warning if `debug_assertions`, `test`, `proc_macro`, or `feature=` is
      used in a `cfg()` expression.
      [#7660](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7660)
    - Large update to the Cargo documentation, adding new chapters on Cargo
      targets, workspaces, and features.
      [#7733](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7733)
    - Windows: `.lib` DLL import libraries are now copied next to the dll for all
      Windows MSVC targets. Previously it was only supported for
      `pc-windows-msvc`. This adds DLL support for `uwp-windows-msvc` targets.
      [#7758](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7758)
    - The `ar` field in the `[target]` configuration is no longer read. It has
      been ignored for over 4 years.
      [#7763](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7763)
    - Bash completion file simplified and updated for latest changes.
      [#7789](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7789)
    - Credentials are only loaded when needed, instead of every Cargo command.
      [#7774](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7774)

    ### Fixed
    - Removed `--offline` empty index check, which was a false positive in some
      cases.
      [#7655](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7655)
    - Files and directories starting with a `.` can now be included in a package
      by adding it to the `include` list.
      [#7680](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7680)
    - Fixed `cargo login` removing alternative registry tokens when previous
      entries existed in the credentials file.
      [#7708](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7708)
    - Fixed `cargo vendor` from panicking when used with alternative registries.
      [#7718](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7718)
    - Fixed incorrect explanation in the fingerprint debug log message.
      [#7749](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7749)
    - A `[source]` that is defined multiple times will now result in an error.
      Previously it was randomly picking a source, which could cause
      non-deterministic behavior.
      [#7751](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7751)
    - `dep_kinds` in `cargo metadata` are now de-duplicated.
      [#7756](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7756)
    - Fixed packaging where `Cargo.lock` was listed in `.gitignore` in a
      subdirectory inside a git repository. Previously it was assuming
      `Cargo.lock` was at the root of the repo.
      [#7779](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7779)
    - Partial file transfer errors will now cause an automatic retry.
      [#7788](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7788)
    - Linux: Fixed panic if CPU iowait stat decreases.
      [#7803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7803)
    - Fixed using the wrong sysroot for detecting host compiler settings when
      `--sysroot` is passed in via `RUSTFLAGS`.
      [#7798](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7798)

    ### Nightly only
    - `build-std` now uses `--extern` instead of `--sysroot` to find sysroot
      packages.
      [#7699](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7699)
    - Added `--config` command-line option to set config settings.
      [#7649](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7649)
    - Added `include` config setting which allows including another config file.
      [#7649](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7649)
    - Profiles in config files now support any named profile. Previously it was

    ## Cargo 1.41 (2020-01-30)
    [5da4b4d4...rust-1.41.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/5da4b4d4...rust-1.41.0)

    ### Added
    - 🔥 Cargo now uses a new `Cargo.lock` file format. This new format should
      support easier merges in source control systems. Projects using the old
      format will continue to use the old format, only new `Cargo.lock` files will
      use the new format.
      [#7579](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7579)
    - 🔥 `cargo install` will now upgrade already installed packages instead of
      failing.
      [#7560](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7560)
    - 🔥 Profile overrides have been added. This allows overriding profiles for
      individual dependencies or build scripts. See [the
      documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#overrides)
      for more.
      [#7591](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7591)
    - Added new documentation for build scripts.
      [#7565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7565)

    ## Cargo 1.40 (2019-12-19)
    [1c6ec66d...5da4b4d4](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/1c6ec66d...5da4b4d4)

    ### Added
    - Added `http.ssl-version` config option to control the version of TLS,
      along with min/max versions.
      [#7308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7308)
    - 🔥 Compiler warnings are now cached on disk. If a build generates warnings,
      re-running the build will now re-display the warnings.
      [#7450](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7450)
    - Added `--filter-platform` option to `cargo metadata` to narrow the nodes
      shown in the resolver graph to only packages included for the given target
      triple.
      [#7376](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7376)

    ### Changed
    - Cargo's "platform" `cfg` parsing has been extracted into a separate crate
      named `cargo-platform`.
      [#7375](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7375)
    - Dependencies extracted into Cargo's cache no longer preserve mtimes to
      reduce syscall overhead.
      [#7465](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7465)
    - Windows: EXE files no longer include a metadata hash in the filename.
      This helps with debuggers correlating the filename with the PDB file.
      [#7400](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7400)
    - Wasm32: `.wasm` files are no longer treated as an "executable", allowing
      `cargo test` and `cargo run` to work properly with the generated `.js` file.
      [#7476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7476)
    - crates.io now supports SPDX 3.6 licenses.
      [#7481](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7481)
    - Improved cyclic dependency error message.
      [#7470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7470)
    - Bare `cargo clean` no longer locks the package cache.
      [#7502](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7502)
    - `cargo publish` now allows dev-dependencies without a version key to be
      published. A git or path-only dev-dependency will be removed from the
      package manifest before uploading.
      [#7333](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7333)
    - `--features` and `--no-default-features` in the root of a virtual workspace
      will now generate an error instead of being ignored.
      [#7507](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7507)
    - Generated files (like `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`) in a package archive
      now have their timestamp set to the current time instead of the epoch.
      [#7523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7523)
    - The `-Z` flag parser is now more strict, rejecting more invalid syntax.
      [#7531](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7531)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed an issue where if a package had an `include` field, and `Cargo.lock`
      in `.gitignore`, and a binary or example target, and the `Cargo.lock` exists
      in the current project, it would fail to publish complaining the
      `Cargo.lock` was dirty.
      [#7448](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7448)
    - Fixed a panic in a particular combination of `[patch]` entries.
      [#7452](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7452)
    - Windows: Better error message when `cargo test` or `rustc` crashes in an
      abnormal way, such as a signal or seg fault.
      [#7535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7535)

    ### Nightly only
    - The `mtime-on-use` feature may now be enabled via the
      `unstable.mtime_on_use` config option.
      [#7411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7411)
    - Added support for named profiles.
      [#6989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6989)
    - Added `-Zpanic-abort-tests` to allow building and running tests with the
      "abort" panic strategy.
      [#7460](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7460)
    - Changed `build-std` to use `--sysroot`.
      [#7421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7421)
    - Various fixes and enhancements to `-Ztimings`.
      [#7395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7395)

      [#7428](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7428)
      [#7429](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7429)
    - Profile overrides have renamed the syntax to be
      `[profile.dev.package.NAME]`.
      [#7504](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7504)
    - Fixed warnings for unused profile overrides in a workspace.
      [#7536](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7536)
  documentationQuestion1: What are the primary purposes of the `http.ssl-version` configuration option in Cargo 1.40, and how does it enhance security?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user filter specific target platforms when using `cargo metadata` with the `--filter-platform` flag, and what is an example command to achieve this?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the `-Zpanic-abort-tests` flag in Cargo's nightly build and how can it be utilized to control test execution behavior?

    ## Cargo 1.39 (2019-11-07)
    [e853aa97...1c6ec66d](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/e853aa97...1c6ec66d)

    ### Added
    - Config files may now use the `.toml` filename extension.
      [#7295](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7295)
    - The `--workspace` flag has been added as an alias for `--all` to help avoid
      confusion about the meaning of "all".
      [#7241](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7241)
    - The `publish` field has been added to `cargo metadata`.
      [#7354](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7354)

    ### Changed
    - Display more information if parsing the output from `rustc` fails.
      [#7236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7236)
    - TOML errors now show the column number.
      [#7248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7248)
    - `cargo vendor` no longer deletes files in the `vendor` directory that starts
      with a `.`.
      [#7242](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7242)
    - `cargo fetch` will now show manifest warnings.
      [#7243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7243)
    - `cargo publish` will now check git submodules if they contain any
      uncommitted changes.
      [#7245](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7245)
    - In a build script, `cargo:rustc-flags` now allows `-l` and `-L` flags
      without spaces.
      [#7257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7257)
    - When `cargo install` replaces an older version of a package it will now
      delete any installed binaries that are no longer present in the newly
      installed version.
      [#7246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7246)
    - A git dependency may now also specify a `version` key when published. The
      `git` value will be stripped from the uploaded crate, matching the behavior
      of `path` dependencies.
      [#7237](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7237)
    - The behavior of workspace default-members has changed. The default-members
      now only applies when running Cargo in the root of the workspace. Previously
      it would always apply regardless of which directory Cargo is running in.
      [#7270](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7270)
    - libgit2 updated pulling in all upstream changes.
      [#7275](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7275)
    - Bump `home` dependency for locating home directories.
      [#7277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7277)
    - zsh completions have been updated.
      [#7296](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7296)
    - SSL connect errors are now retried.
      [#7318](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7318)
    - The jobserver has been changed to acquire N tokens (instead of N-1), and
      then immediately acquires the extra token. This was changed to accommodate
      the `cc` crate on Windows to allow it to release its implicit token.
      [#7344](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7344)
    - The scheduling algorithm for choosing which crate to build next has been
      changed. It now chooses the crate with the greatest number of transitive
      crates waiting on it. Previously it used a maximum topological depth.
      [#7390](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7390)
    - RUSTFLAGS are no longer incorporated in the metadata and filename hash,
      reversing the change from 1.33 that added it. This means that any change to
      RUSTFLAGS will cause a recompile, and will not affect symbol munging.
      [#7459](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7459)

    ### Fixed
    - Git dependencies with submodules with shorthand SSH URLs (like
      `git@github.com/user/repo.git`) should now work.
      [#7238](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7238)
    - Handle broken symlinks when creating `.dSYM` symlinks on macOS.
      [#7268](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7268)
    - Fixed issues with multiple versions of the same crate in a `[patch]` table.
      [#7303](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7303)
    - Fixed issue with custom target `.json` files where a substring of the name
      matches an unsupported crate type (like "bin").
      [#7363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7363)
    - Fixed issues with generating documentation for proc-macro crate types.
      [#7159](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7159)
    - Fixed hang if Cargo panics within a build thread.
      [#7366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7366)
    - Fixed rebuild detection if a `build.rs` script issues different `rerun-if`
      directives between builds. Cargo was erroneously causing a rebuild after the
      change.
      [#7373](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7373)
    - Properly handle canonical URLs for `[patch]` table entries, preventing
      the patch from working after the first time it is used.
      [#7368](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7368)
    - Fixed an issue where integration tests were waiting for the package binary
      to finish building before starting their own build. They now may build
      concurrently.
      [#7394](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7394)
    - Fixed accidental change in the previous release on how `--features a b` flag
      is interpreted, restoring the original behavior where this is interpreted as
      `--features a` along with the argument `b` passed to the command. To pass
      multiple features, use quotes around the features to pass multiple features
      like `--features "a b"`, or use commas, or use multiple `--features` flags.
      [#7419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7419)

    ### Nightly only
    - Basic support for building the standard library directly from Cargo has been
      added.

      [#7216](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7216)
    - Added `-Ztimings` feature to generate an HTML report on the time spent on
      individual compilation steps. This also may output completion steps on the
      console and JSON data.
      ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#timings))
      [#7311](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7311)
    - Added ability to cross-compile doctests.
      ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#doctest-xcompile))

    ## Cargo 1.38 (2019-09-26)
    [4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e)

    ### Added
    - 🔥 Cargo build pipelining has been enabled by default to leverage more idle CPU
      parallelism during builds.
      [#7143](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7143)
    - The `--message-format` option to Cargo can now be specified multiple times and
      accepts a comma-separated list of values. In addition to the previous values
      it also now accepts `json-diagnostic-short` and
      `json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi` which configures the output coming from rustc
      in `json` message mode.
      [#7214](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7214)
    - Cirrus CI badges are now supported on crates.io.
      [#7119](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7119)
    - A new format for `Cargo.lock` has been introduced. This new format is
      intended to avoid source-control merge conflicts more often, and to
      generally make it safer to merge changes. This new format is *not* enabled
      at this time, though Cargo will use it if it sees it. At some point in the
      future, it is intended that this will become the default.
      [#7070](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7070)
    - Progress bar support added for FreeBSD.
      [#7222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7222)

    ### Changed
    - The `-q` flag will no longer suppress the root error message for an error
      from Cargo itself.
      [#7116](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7116)
    - The Cargo Book is now published with mdbook 0.3 providing a number of
      formatting fixes and improvements.
      [#7140](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7140)
    - The `--features` command-line flag can now be specified multiple times.
      The list of features from all the flags are joined together.
      [#7084](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7084)
    - Package include/exclude glob-vs-gitignore warnings have been removed.
      Packages may now use gitignore-style matching without producing any
      warnings.
      [#7170](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7170)
    - Cargo now shows the command and output when parsing `rustc` output fails
      when querying `rustc` for information like `cfg` values.
      [#7185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7185)
    - `cargo package`/`cargo publish` now allows a symbolic link to a git
      submodule to include that submodule.
      [#6817](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6817)
    - Improved the error message when a version requirement does not
      match any versions, but there are pre-release versions available.
      [#7191](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7191)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed using the wrong directory when updating git repositories when using
      the `git-fetch-with-cli` config option, and the `GIT_DIR` environment
      variable is set. This may happen when running cargo from git callbacks.
      [#7082](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7082)
    - Fixed dep-info files being overwritten for targets that have separate debug
      outputs. For example, binaries on `-apple-` targets with `.dSYM` directories
      would overwrite the `.d` file.
      [#7057](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7057)
    - Fix `[patch]` table not preserving "one major version per source" rule.
      [#7118](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7118)
    - Ignore `--remap-path-prefix` flags for the metadata hash in the `cargo
      rustc` command. This was causing the remap settings to inadvertently affect
      symbol names.
      [#7134](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7134)
    - Fixed cycle detection in `[patch]` dependencies.
      [#7174](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7174)
    - Fixed `cargo new` leaving behind a symlink on Windows when `core.symlinks`
      git config is true. Also adds a number of fixes and updates from upstream
      libgit2.
      [#7176](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7176)
    - macOS: Fixed setting the flag to mark the `target` directory to be excluded
      from backups.
      [#7192](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7192)
    - Fixed `cargo fix` panicking under some situations involving multi-byte
      characters.
      [#7221](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7221)

    ### Nightly only
    - Added `cargo fix --clippy` which will apply machine-applicable fixes from
      Clippy.
      [#7069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7069)
    - Added `-Z binary-dep-depinfo` flag to add change tracking for binary
      dependencies like the standard library.
      [#7137](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7137)
      [#7219](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7219)
    - `cargo clippy-preview` will always run, even if no changes have been made.
      [#7157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7157)
    - Fixed exponential blowup when using `CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING`.
      [#7062](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7062)
    - Fixed passing args to clippy in `cargo clippy-preview`.
      [#7162](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7162)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the Cargo build pipelining feature introduced in version 1.38?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user specify multiple message formats for Cargo using the `--message-format` option, and what are some of the new formats available?

    ## Cargo 1.37 (2019-08-15)
    [c4fcfb72...9edd0891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/c4fcfb72...9edd0891)

    ### Added
    - Added `doctest` field to `cargo metadata` to determine if a target's
      documentation is tested.
      [#6953](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6953)
      [#6965](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6965)
    - 🔥 The [`cargo
      vendor`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-vendor.html)
      command is now built-in to Cargo. This command may be used to create a local
      copy of the sources of all dependencies.
      [#6869](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6869)
    - 🔥 The "publish lockfile" feature is now stable. This feature will
      automatically include the `Cargo.lock` file when a package is published if
      it contains a binary executable target. By default, Cargo will ignore
      `Cargo.lock` when installing a package. To force Cargo to use the
      `Cargo.lock` file included in the published package, use `cargo install
      --locked`. This may be useful to ensure that `cargo install` consistently
      reproduces the same result. It may also be useful when a semver-incompatible
      change is accidentally published to a dependency, providing a way to fall
      back to a version that is known to work.
      [#7026](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7026)
    - 🔥 The `default-run` feature has been stabilized. This feature allows you to
      specify which binary executable to run by default with `cargo run` when a
      package includes multiple binaries. Set the `default-run` key in the
      `[package]` table in `Cargo.toml` to the name of the binary to use by
      default.
      [#7056](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7056)

    ### Changed
    - `cargo package` now verifies that build scripts do not create empty
      directories.
      [#6973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6973)
    - A warning is now issued if `cargo doc` generates duplicate outputs, which
      causes files to be randomly stomped on. This may happen for a variety of
      reasons (renamed dependencies, multiple versions of the same package,
      packages with renamed libraries, etc.). This is a known bug, which needs
      more work to handle correctly.
      [#6998](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6998)
    - Enabling a dependency's feature with `--features foo/bar` will no longer
      compile the current crate with the `foo` feature if `foo` is not an optional
      dependency.
      [#7010](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7010)
    - If `--remap-path-prefix` is passed via RUSTFLAGS, it will no longer affect
      the filename metadata hash.
      [#6966](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6966)
    - libgit2 has been updated to 0.28.2, which Cargo uses to access git
      repositories. This brings in hundreds of changes and fixes since it was last
      updated in November.
      [#7018](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7018)
    - Cargo now supports absolute paths in the dep-info files generated by rustc.
      This is laying the groundwork for [tracking
      binaries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61727), such as libstd, for
      rebuild detection. (Note: this contains a known bug.)
      [#7030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7030)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed how zsh completions fetch the list of commands.
      [#6956](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6956)
    - "+ debuginfo" is no longer printed in the build summary when `debug` is set
      to 0.
      [#6971](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6971)
    - Fixed `cargo doc` with an example configured with `doc = true` to document
      correctly.
      [#7023](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7023)
    - Don't fail if a read-only lock cannot be acquired in CARGO_HOME. This helps
      when CARGO_HOME doesn't exist, but `--locked` is used which means CARGO_HOME
      is not needed.
      [#7149](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7149)
    - Reverted a change in 1.35 which released jobserver tokens when Cargo blocked
      on a lock file. It caused a deadlock in some situations.
      [#7204](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7204)

    ### Nightly only
    - Added [compiler message
      caching](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#cache-messages).
      The `-Z cache-messages` flag makes cargo cache the compiler output so that
      future runs can redisplay previous warnings.
      [#6933](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6933)
    - `-Z mtime-on-use` no longer touches intermediate artifacts.
      [#7050](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7050)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `cargo vendor` command introduced in Cargo 1.37?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user configure the default binary to run with `cargo run` when a package contains multiple binaries?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the purpose of the `--locked` flag in the `cargo install` command, and how can it be used to ensure consistent installations?

    ## Cargo 1.36 (2019-07-04)
    [6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72)

    ### Added
    - Added more detailed documentation on target auto-discovery.
      [#6898](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6898)
    - 🔥 Stabilize the `--offline` flag which allows using cargo without a network
      connection.
      [#6934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6934)
      [#6871](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6871)

    ### Changed
    - `publish = ["crates-io"]` may be added to the manifest to restrict
      publishing to crates.io only.
      [#6838](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6838)
    - macOS: Only include the default paths if `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` is not
      set. Also, remove `/lib` from the default set.
      [#6856](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6856)
    - `cargo publish` will now exit early if the login token is not available.
      [#6854](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6854)
    - HTTP/2 stream errors are now considered "spurious" and will cause a retry.
      [#6861](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6861)
    - Setting a feature on a dependency where that feature points to a *required*
      dependency is now an error. Previously it was a warning.
      [#6860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6860)
    - The `registry.index` config value now supports relative `file:` URLs.
      [#6873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6873)
    - macOS: The `.dSYM` directory is now symbolically linked next to example
      binaries without the metadata hash so that debuggers can find it.
      [#6891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6891)
    - The default `Cargo.toml` template for now projects now includes a comment
      providing a link to the documentation.
      [#6881](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6881)
    - Some improvements to the wording of the crate download summary.
      [#6916](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6916)
      [#6920](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6920)
    - ✨ Changed `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `CARGO_LOG` so that user code
      that uses the `log` crate will not display cargo's debug output.
      [#6918](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6918)
    - `Cargo.toml` is now always included when packaging, even if it is not listed
      in `package.include`.
      [#6925](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6925)
    - Package include/exclude values now use gitignore patterns instead of glob
      patterns. [#6924](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6924)
    - Provide a better error message when crates.io times out. Also improve error
      messages with other HTTP response codes.
      [#6936](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6936)

    ### Performance
    - Resolver performance improvements for some cases.
      [#6853](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6853)
    - Optimized how cargo reads the index JSON files by caching the results.
      [#6880](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6880)
      [#6912](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6912)
      [#6940](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6940)
    - Various performance improvements.
      [#6867](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6867)

    ### Fixed
    - More carefully track the on-disk fingerprint information for dependencies.
      This can help in some rare cases where the build is interrupted and
      restarted. [#6832](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6832)
    - `cargo run` now correctly passes non-UTF8 arguments to the child process.
      [#6849](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6849)
    - Fixed bash completion to run on bash 3.2, the stock version in macOS.
      [#6905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6905)
    - Various fixes and improvements to zsh completion.
      [#6926](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6926)
      [#6929](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6929)
    - Fix `cargo update` ignoring `-p` arguments if the `Cargo.lock` file was
      missing.
      [#6904](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6904)

    ### Nightly only
    - Added [`-Z install-upgrade`
      feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#install-upgrade)
      to track details about installed crates and to update them if they are
      out-of-date. [#6798](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6798)
    - Added the [`public-dependency`
      feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#public-dependency)
      which allows tracking public versus private dependencies.
      [#6772](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6772)
    - Added build pipelining via the `build.pipelining` config
      option (`CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING` env var).
      [#6883](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6883)
    - The `publish-lockfile` feature has had some significant changes. The default
      is now `true`, the `Cargo.lock` will always be published for binary crates.
      The `Cargo.lock` is now regenerated during publishing. `cargo install` now
      ignores the `Cargo.lock` file by default, and requires `--locked` to use the
      lock file. Warnings have been added if yanked dependencies are detected.
      [#6840](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6840)
  documentationQuestion1: What are the main purposes of the `--offline` flag in Cargo 1.36 and how does it impact the development workflow?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a developer use the `publish = ["crates-io"]` configuration in their Cargo.toml to control publishing behavior?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the change to use gitignore patterns instead of glob patterns for package include/exclude values in Cargo 1.36?

    ## Cargo 1.35 (2019-05-23)
    [6789d8a0...6f3e9c36](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/6789d8a0...6f3e9c36)

    ### Added
    - Added the `rustc-cdylib-link-arg` key for build scripts to specify linker
      arguments for cdylib crates.
      [#6298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6298)

    ### Changed
    - When passing a test filter, such as `cargo test foo`, don't build examples
      (unless they set `test = true`).
      [#6683](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6683)
    - Forward the `--quiet` flag from `cargo test` to the libtest harness so that
      tests are actually quiet.
      [#6358](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6358)
    - The verification step in `cargo package` that checks if any files are
      modified is now stricter. It uses a hash of the contents instead of checking
      filesystem mtimes. It also checks *all* files in the package.
      [#6740](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6740)
    - Jobserver tokens are now released whenever Cargo blocks on a file lock.
      [#6748](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6748)
    - Issue a warning for a previous bug in the TOML parser that allowed multiple
      table headers with the same name.
      [#6761](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6761)
    - Removed the `CARGO_PKG_*` environment variables from the metadata hash and
      added them to the fingerprint instead. This means that when these values
      change, stale artifacts are not left behind. Also added the "repository"
      value to the fingerprint.
      [#6785](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6785)
    - `cargo metadata` no longer shows a `null` field for a dependency without a
      library in `resolve.nodes.deps`. The dependency is no longer shown.
      [#6534](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6534)
    - `cargo new` will no longer include an email address in the `authors` field
      if it is set to the empty string.
      [#6802](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6802)
    - `cargo doc --open` now works when documenting multiple packages.
      [#6803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6803)
    - `cargo install --path P` now loads the `.cargo/config` file from the
      directory P. [#6805](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6805)
    - Using semver metadata in a version requirement (such as `1.0.0+1234`) now
      issues a warning that it is ignored.
      [#6806](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6806)
    - `cargo install` now rejects certain combinations of flags where some flags
      would have been ignored.
      [#6801](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6801)
    - Resolver performance improvements for some cases.
      [#6776](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6776)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed running separate commands (such as `cargo build` then `cargo test`)
      where the second command could use stale results from a build script.
      [#6720](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6720)
    - Fixed `cargo fix` not working properly if a `.gitignore` file that matched
      the root package directory.
      [#6767](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6767)
    - Fixed accidentally compiling a lib multiple times if `panic=unwind` was set
      in a profile. [#6781](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6781)
    - Paths to JSON files in `build.target` config value are now canonicalized to
      fix building dependencies.
      [#6778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6778)
    - Fixed re-running a build script if its compilation was interrupted (such as
      if it is killed). [#6782](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6782)
    - Fixed `cargo new` initializing a fossil repo.
      [#6792](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6792)
    - Fixed supporting updating a git repo that has a force push when using the
      `git-fetch-with-cli` feature. `git-fetch-with-cli` also shows more error
      information now when it fails.
      [#6800](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6800)
    - `--example` binaries built for the WASM target are fixed to no longer
      include a metadata hash in the filename, and are correctly emitted in the
      `compiler-artifact` JSON message.
      [#6812](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6812)

    ### Nightly only
    - `cargo clippy-preview` is now a built-in cargo command.
      [#6759](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6759)
    - The `build-override` profile setting now includes proc-macros and their
      dependencies.
      [#6811](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6811)
    - Optional and target dependencies now work better with `-Z offline`.
      [#6814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6814)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `rustc-cdylib-link-arg` key in Cargo 1.35?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user configure `cargo test` to run only specific tests and suppress output using the new `--quiet` flag?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the effect of the change in Cargo 1.35 that removes `CARGO_PKG_*` environment variables from the metadata hash and adds them to the fingerprint?

      [#6264](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6264)
    - Added a warning if `--exclude` flag specifies an unknown package.
      [#6679](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6679)

    ### Changed
    - `cargo test --doc --no-run` doesn't do anything, so it now displays an error
      to that effect. [#6628](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6628)
    - Various updates to bash completion: add missing options and commands,
      support libtest completions, use rustup for `--target` completion, fallback
      to filename completion, fix editing the command line.
      [#6644](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6644)
    - Publishing a crate with a `[patch]` section no longer generates an error.
      The `[patch]` section is removed from the manifest before publishing.
      [#6535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6535)
    - `build.incremental = true` config value is now treated the same as
      `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`, previously it was ignored.
      [#6688](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6688)
    - Errors from a registry are now always displayed regardless of the HTTP
      response code. [#6771](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6771)

    ### Fixed
    - Fixed bash completion for `cargo run --example`.
      [#6578](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6578)
    - Fixed a race condition when using a *local* registry and running multiple
      cargo commands at the same time that build the same crate.
      [#6591](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6591)
    - Fixed some flickering and excessive updates of the progress bar.
      [#6615](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6615)
    - Fixed a hang when using a git credential helper that returns incorrect
      credentials. [#6681](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6681)
    - Fixed resolving yanked crates with a local registry.
      [#6750](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6750)

    ### Nightly only
    - Added `-Z mtime-on-use` flag to cause the mtime to be updated on the
      filesystem when a crate is used. This is intended to be able to track stale
      artifacts in the future for cleaning up unused files.
      [#6477](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6477)
      [#6573](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6573)

    [8610973a...f099fe94](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/8610973a...f099fe94)

    ### Added
    - `compiler-artifact` JSON messages now include an `"executable"` key which
      includes the path to the executable that was built.
      [#6363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6363)
    - The man pages have been rewritten, and are now published with the web
      documentation. [#6405](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6405)
    - `cargo login` now displays a confirmation after saving the token.
      [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
    - A warning is now emitted if a `[patch]` entry does not match any package.
      [#6470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6470)
    - `cargo metadata` now includes the `links` key for a package.

    - `--example`, `--bin`, `--bench`, or `--test` without an argument now lists
      the available targets for those options.
      [#6505](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6505)
    - Windows: If a process fails with an extended status exit code, a
      human-readable name for the code is now displayed.
      [#6532](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6532)
    - Added `--features`, `--no-default-features`, and `--all-features` flags to
      the `cargo package` and `cargo publish` commands to use the given features
      when verifying the package.
      [#6453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6453)

    ### Changed
    - If `cargo fix` fails to compile the fixed code, the rustc errors are now
      displayed on the console.
      [#6419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6419)
    - Hide the `--host` flag from `cargo login`, it is unused.
      [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
    - Build script fingerprints now include the rustc version.
      [#6473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6473)

    - `RUSTFLAGS` is now included in the metadata hash, meaning that changing
      the flags will not overwrite previously built files.
      [#6503](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6503)
    - When updating the crate graph, unrelated yanked crates were erroneously
      removed. They are now kept at their original version if possible. This was
      causing unrelated packages to be downgraded during `cargo update -p
      somecrate`. [#5702](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5702)
    - TOML files now support the [0.5 TOML
      syntax](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#050--2018-07-11).

    ### Fixed
    - `cargo fix` will now ignore suggestions that modify multiple files.
      [#6402](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6402)
    - `cargo fix` will now only fix one target at a time, to deal with targets
      which share the same source files.
      [#6434](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6434)
    - Fixed bash completion showing the list of cargo commands.
      [#6461](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6461)
    - `cargo init` will now avoid creating duplicate entries in `.gitignore`
      files. [#6521](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6521)
    - Builds now attempt to detect if a file is modified in the middle of a
      compilation, allowing you to build again and pick up the new changes. This
      is done by keeping track of when the compilation *starts* not when it
      finishes. Also, [#5919](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5919) was
      reverted, meaning that cargo does *not* treat equal filesystem mtimes as
      requiring a rebuild. [#6484](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6484)

    ### Nightly only
    - Allow using registry *names* in `[patch]` tables instead of just URLs.
      [#6456](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6456)
    - `cargo metadata` added the `registry` key for dependencies.
      [#6500](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6500)
    - Registry names are now restricted to the same style as
      package names (alphanumeric, `-` and `_` characters).
      [#6469](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6469)
    - `cargo login` now displays the `/me` URL from the registry config.
      [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
    - `cargo login --registry=NAME` now supports interactive input for the token.
      [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
    - Registries may now elide the `api` key from `config.json` to indicate they
      do not support API access.
      [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
    - Fixed panic when using `--message-format=json` with metabuild.
      [#6432](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6432)
    - Fixed detection of publishing to crates.io when using alternate registries.
      [#6525](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6525)
  documentationQuestion1: What are the primary purposes of the `--features`, `--no-default-features`, and `--all-features` flags added to `cargo package` and `cargo publish` commands in Cargo 1.33?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a developer use the `--example`, `--bin`, `--bench`, or `--test` flags without arguments to list available targets in a Cargo project?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the `executable` key added to `compiler-artifact` JSON messages in Cargo 1.33, and how can it be utilized in a build script?

    ## Cargo 1.32 (2019-01-17)
    [339d9f9c...8610973a](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/339d9f9c...8610973a)

    ### Added
    - Registries may now display warnings after a successful publish.
      [#6303](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6303)
    - Added a [glossary](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html)
      to the documentation. [#6321](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6321)
    - Added the alias `c` for `cargo check`.
      [#6218](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6218)

    ### Changed
    - 🔥 HTTP/2 multiplexing is now enabled by default. The `http.multiplexing`
      config value may be used to disable it.
      [#6271](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6271)
    - Use ANSI escape sequences to clear lines instead of spaces.
      [#6233](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6233)
    - Disable git templates when checking out git dependencies, which can cause
      problems. [#6252](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6252)
    - Include the `--update-head-ok` git flag when using the
      `net.git-fetch-with-cli` option. This can help prevent failures when
      fetching some repositories.
      [#6250](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6250)
    - When extracting a crate during the verification step of `cargo package`, the
      filesystem mtimes are no longer set, which was failing on some rare
      filesystems. [#6257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6257)
    - `crate-type = ["proc-macro"]` is now treated the same as `proc-macro = true`
      in `Cargo.toml`. [#6256](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6256)
    - An error is raised if `dependencies`, `features`, `target`, or `badges` is
      set in a virtual workspace. Warnings are displayed if `replace` or `patch`
      is used in a workspace member.
      [#6276](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6276)
    - Improved performance of the resolver in some cases.
      [#6283](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6283)
      [#6366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6366)
    - `.rmeta` files are no longer hard-linked into the base target directory
      (`target/debug`). [#6292](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6292)
    - A warning is issued if multiple targets are built with the same output
      filenames. [#6308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6308)
    - When using `cargo build` (without `--release`) benchmarks are now built
      using the "test" profile instead of "bench". This makes it easier to debug
      benchmarks, and avoids confusing behavior.
      [#6309](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6309)
    - User aliases may now override built-in aliases (`b`, `r`, `t`, and `c`).
      [#6259](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6259)
    - Setting `autobins=false` now disables auto-discovery of inferred targets.
      [#6329](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6329)
    - `cargo verify-project` will now fail on stable if the project uses unstable
      features. [#6326](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6326)
    - Platform targets with an internal `.` within the name are now allowed.
      [#6255](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6255)
    - `cargo clean --release` now only deletes the release directory.
      [#6349](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6349)

    ### Fixed
    - Avoid adding extra angle brackets in email address for `cargo new`.
      [#6243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6243)
    - The progress bar is disabled if the CI environment variable is set.
      [#6281](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6281)
    - Avoid retaining all rustc output in memory.
      [#6289](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6289)
    - If JSON parsing fails, and rustc exits nonzero, don't lose the parse failure
      message. [#6290](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6290)
    - Fixed renaming a project directory with build scripts.
      [#6328](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6328)
    - Fixed `cargo run --example NAME` to work correctly if the example sets
      `crate_type = ["bin"]`.
      [#6330](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6330)
    - Fixed issue with `cargo package` git discovery being too aggressive. The
      `--allow-dirty` now completely disables the git repo checks.
      [#6280](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6280)
    - Fixed build change tracking for `[patch]` deps which resulted in `cargo
      build` rebuilding when it shouldn't.
      [#6493](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6493)

    ### Nightly only
    - Allow usernames in registry URLs.
      [#6242](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6242)
    - Added `"compile_mode"` key to the build-plan JSON structure to be able to
      distinguish running a custom build script versus compiling the build script.
      [#6331](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6331)
    - `--out-dir` no longer copies over build scripts.
      [#6300](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6300)
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the HTTP/2 multiplexing feature introduced in Cargo 1.32?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user configure Cargo to use the `http.multiplexing` setting to disable HTTP/2 multiplexing, and what is the effect of this configuration?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the purpose of the new `c` alias for `cargo check`, and how does it improve user experience?

    - When creating a package, provide more detail with `-v` when failing to
      discover if files are dirty in a git repository. Also fix a problem with
      discovery on Windows. [#5858](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5858)
    - Filters like `--bin`, `--test`, `--example`, `--bench`, or `--lib` can be

    - Added `required-features` to `cargo metadata`.
      [#5902](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5902)

    - Switched to the `opener` crate to open a web browser with `cargo doc
      --open`. This should more reliably select the system-preferred browser on
      all platforms. [#5888](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5888)
    - Equal file mtimes now cause a target to be rebuilt. Previously only if files

    - `cargo fix` now always runs, even if it was run previously.
      [#5944](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5944)
    - Windows: Attempt to more reliably detect terminal width. msys-based
      terminals are forced to 60 characters wide.
      [#6010](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6010)
    - Allow multiple target flags with `cargo doc --document-private-items`.
      [6022](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6022)

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `faq page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Is the plan to use GitHub as a package repository?\n\nNo. The plan for Cargo is to use [crates.io], like npm or Rubygems do with\n[npmjs.com][1] and [rubygems.org][3].\n\nWe plan to support git repositories as a source of packages forever,\nbecause they can be used for early development and temporary patches,\neven when people use the registry as the primary source of packages.\n\n## Why build crates.io rather than use GitHub as a registry?\n\nWe think that it’s very important to support multiple ways to download\npackages, including downloading from GitHub and copying packages into\nyour package itself.\n\nThat said, we think that [crates.io] offers a number of important benefits, and\nwill likely become the primary way that people download packages in Cargo.\n\nFor precedent, both Node.js’s [npm][1] and Ruby’s [bundler][2] support both a\ncentral registry model as well as a Git-based model, and most packages\nare downloaded through the registry in those ecosystems, with an\nimportant minority of packages making use of git-based packages.\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com\n[2]: https://bundler.io\n[3]: https://rubygems.org\n\nSome of the advantages that make a central registry popular in other\nlanguages include:\n\n* **Discoverability**. A central registry provides an easy place to look\n  for existing packages. Combined with tagging, this also makes it\n  possible for a registry to provide ecosystem-wide information, such as a\n  list of the most popular or most-depended-on packages.\n* **Speed**. A central registry makes it possible to easily fetch just\n  the metadata for packages quickly and efficiently, and then to\n  efficiently download just the published package, and not other bloat\n  that happens to exist in the repository. This adds up to a significant\n  improvement in the speed of dependency resolution and fetching. As\n  dependency graphs scale up, downloading all of the git repositories bogs\n  down fast. Also remember that not everybody has a high-speed,\n  low-latency Internet connection.\n\n## Will Cargo work with C code (or other languages)?\n\nYes!\n\nCargo handles compiling Rust code, but we know that many Rust packages\nlink against C code. We also know that there are decades of tooling\nbuilt up around compiling languages other than Rust.\n\nOur solution: Cargo allows a package to [specify a script](reference/build-scripts.md)\n(written in Rust) to run before invoking `rustc`. Rust is leveraged to\nimplement platform-specific configuration and refactor out common build\nfunctionality among packages.\n\n## Can Cargo be used inside of `make` (or `ninja`, or ...)\n\nIndeed. While we intend Cargo to be useful as a standalone way to\ncompile Rust packages at the top-level, we know that some people will\nwant to invoke Cargo from other build tools.\n\nWe have designed Cargo to work well in those contexts, paying attention\nto things like error codes and machine-readable output modes. We still\nhave some work to do on those fronts, but using Cargo in the context of\nconventional scripts is something we designed for from the beginning and\nwill continue to prioritize.\n\n## Does Cargo handle multi-platform packages or cross-compilation?\n\nRust itself provides facilities for configuring sections of code based\non the platform. Cargo also supports [platform-specific\ndependencies][target-deps], and we plan to support more per-platform\nconfiguration in `Cargo.toml` in the future.\n\n[target-deps]: reference/specifying-dependencies.md#platform-specific-dependencies\n\nIn the longer-term, we’re looking at ways to conveniently cross-compile\npackages using Cargo.\n\n## Does Cargo support environments, like `production` or `test`?\n\nWe support environments through the use of [profiles] to support:\n\n[profiles]: reference/profiles.md\n\n* environment-specific flags (like `-g --opt-level=0` for development\n  and `--opt-level=3` for production).\n* environment-specific dependencies (like `hamcrest` for test assertions).\n* environment-specific `#[cfg]`\n* a `cargo test` command\n\n## Does Cargo work on Windows?\n\nYes!\n\nAll commits to Cargo are required to pass the local test suite on Windows.\nIf you encounter an issue while running on Windows, we consider it a bug, so [please file an\nissue][cargo-issues].\n\n[cargo-issues]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues\n\n## Why have `Cargo.lock` in version control?\n\nWhile [`cargo new`] defaults to tracking `Cargo.lock` in version control,\nwhether you do is dependent on the needs of your package.\n\nThe purpose of a `Cargo.lock` lockfile is to describe the state of the world at\nthe time of a successful build.\nCargo uses the lockfile to provide deterministic builds at different times and\non different systems,\nby ensuring that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as when the\n`Cargo.lock` file was originally generated.\n\nDeterministic builds help with\n- Running `git bisect` to find the root cause of a bug\n- Ensuring CI only fails due to new commits and not external factors\n- Reducing confusion when contributors see different behavior as compared to\n  other contributors or CI\n\nHaving this snapshot of dependencies can also help when projects need to be\nverified against consistent versions of dependencies, like when\n- Verifying a minimum-supported Rust version (MSRV) that is less than the latest\n  version of a dependency supports\n- Verifying human readable output which won't have compatibility guarantees\n  (e.g. snapshot testing error messages to ensure they are \"understandable\", a\n  metric too fuzzy to automate)\n\nHowever, this determinism can give a false sense of security because\n`Cargo.lock` does not affect the consumers of your package, only `Cargo.toml` does that.\nFor example:\n- [`cargo install`] will select the latest dependencies unless\n[`--locked`](commands/cargo.html#option-cargo---locked) is passed in.\n- New dependencies, like those added with [`cargo add`], will be locked to the latest version\n\nThe lockfile can also be a source of merge conflicts.\n\nFor strategies to verify newer versions of dependencies via CI,\nsee [Verifying Latest Dependencies](guide/continuous-integration.md#verifying-latest-dependencies).\n\n[`cargo new`]: commands/cargo-new.md\n[`cargo add`]: commands/cargo-add.md\n[`cargo install`]: commands/cargo-install.md\n\n## Can libraries use `*` as a version for their dependencies?\n\n**As of January 22nd, 2016, [crates.io] rejects all packages (not just libraries)\nwith wildcard dependency constraints.**\n\nWhile libraries _can_, strictly speaking, they should not. A version requirement\nof `*` says “This will work with every version ever”, which is never going\nto be true. Libraries should always specify the range that they do work with,\neven if it’s something as general as “every 1.x.y version”.\n\n## Why `Cargo.toml`?\n\nAs one of the most frequent interactions with Cargo, the question of why the\nconfiguration file is named `Cargo.toml` arises from time to time. The leading\ncapital-`C` was chosen to ensure that the manifest was grouped with other\nsimilar configuration files in directory listings. Sorting files often puts\ncapital letters before lowercase letters, ensuring files like `Makefile` and\n`Cargo.toml` are placed together. The trailing `.toml` was chosen to emphasize\nthe fact that the file is in the [TOML configuration\nformat](https://toml.io/).\n\nCargo does not allow other names such as `cargo.toml` or `Cargofile` to\nemphasize the ease of how a Cargo repository can be identified. An option of\nmany possible names has historically led to confusion where one case was handled\nbut others were accidentally forgotten.\n\n[crates.io]: https://crates.io/\n\n## How can Cargo work offline?\n\nThe [`--offline`](commands/cargo.html#option-cargo---offline) or\n [`--frozen`](commands/cargo.html#option-cargo---frozen) flags tell Cargo to not\n touch the network. It returns an error in case it would access the network. \nYou can use [`cargo fetch`] in one project to download\ndependencies before going offline, and then use those same dependencies in\nanother project. Refer to [configuration value][offline config]) to set via\nCargo configuration.\n\n\n\nVendoring is also related, for more information see documentation on [source\nreplacement][replace].\n\n[replace]: reference/source-replacement.md\n[`cargo fetch`]: commands/cargo-fetch.md\n[offline config]: reference/config.md#netoffline\n\n## Why is Cargo rebuilding my code?\n\nCargo is responsible for incrementally compiling crates in your project. This\nmeans that if you type `cargo build` twice the second one shouldn't rebuild your\ncrates.io dependencies, for example. Nevertheless bugs arise and Cargo can\nsometimes rebuild code when you're not expecting it!\n\nWe've long [wanted to provide better diagnostics about\nthis](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2904) but unfortunately haven't\nbeen able to make progress on that issue in quite some time. In the meantime,\nhowever, you can debug a rebuild at least a little by setting the `CARGO_LOG`\nenvironment variable:\n\n```sh\n$ CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=info cargo build\n```\n\nThis will cause Cargo to print out a lot of information about diagnostics and\nrebuilding. This can often contain clues as to why your project is getting\nrebuilt, although you'll often need to connect some dots yourself since this\noutput isn't super easy to read just yet. Note that the `CARGO_LOG` needs to be\nset for the command that rebuilds when you think it should not. Unfortunately\nCargo has no way right now of after-the-fact debugging \"why was that rebuilt?\"\n\nSome issues we've seen historically which can cause crates to get rebuilt are:\n\n* A build script prints `cargo::rerun-if-changed=foo` where `foo` is a file that\n  doesn't exist and nothing generates it. In this case Cargo will keep running\n  the build script thinking it will generate the file but nothing ever does. The\n  fix is to avoid printing `rerun-if-changed` in this scenario.\n\n* Two successive Cargo builds may differ in the set of features enabled for some\n  dependencies. For example if the first build command builds the whole\n  workspace and the second command builds only one crate, this may cause a\n  dependency on crates.io to have a different set of features enabled, causing\n  it and everything that depends on it to get rebuilt. There's unfortunately not\n  really a great fix for this, although if possible it's best to have the set of\n  features enabled on a crate constant regardless of what you're building in\n  your workspace.\n\n* Some filesystems exhibit unusual behavior around timestamps. Cargo primarily\n  uses timestamps on files to govern whether rebuilding needs to happen, but if\n  you're using a nonstandard filesystem it may be affecting the timestamps\n  somehow (e.g. truncating them, causing them to drift, etc). In this scenario,\n  feel free to open an issue and we can see if we can accommodate the filesystem\n  somehow.\n\n* A concurrent build process is either deleting artifacts or modifying files.\n  Sometimes you might have a background process that either tries to build or\n  check your project. These background processes might surprisingly delete some\n  build artifacts or touch files (or maybe just by accident), which can cause\n  rebuilds to look spurious! The best fix here would be to wrangle the\n  background process to avoid clashing with your work.\n\nIf after trying to debug your issue, however, you're still running into problems\nthen feel free to [open an\nissue](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/new)!\n\n## What does \"version conflict\" mean and how to resolve it?\n\n> failed to select a version for `x` which could resolve this conflict\n\nHave you seen the error message above?\n\nThis is one of the most annoying error messages for Cargo users. There are several\nsituations which may lead to a version conflict. Below we'll walk through possible\ncauses and provide diagnostic techniques to help you out there:\n\n- The project and its dependencies use [links] to repeatedly link the local\n  library. Cargo forbids linking two packages with the same native library, so\n  even with multiple layers of dependencies it is not allowed. In this case, the\n  error message will prompt: `Only one package in the dependency graph may specify\n  the same links value`, you may need to manually check and delete duplicate link\n  values. The community also have [conventions in place] to alleviate this.\n\n- When depending on different crates in the project, if these crates use the same\n  dependent library, but the version used is restricted, making it impossible to\n  determine the correct version, it will also cause conflicts. The error message\n  will prompt: `all possible versions conflict with previously selected packages`.\n  You may need to modify the version requirements to make them consistent.\n\n- If there are multiple versions of dependencies in the project, when using\n  [`direct-minimal-versions`], the minimum version requirements cannot be met,\n  which will cause conflicts. You may need to modify version requirements of your\n  direct dependencies to meet the minimum SemVer version accordingly.\n\n- If the dependent crate does not have the features you choose, it will also\n  cause conflicts. At this time, you need to check the dependent version and its\n  features.\n\n- Conflicts may occur when merging branches or PRs, if there are non-trivial\n  conflicts, you can reset all \"yours\" changes, fix all other conflicts in the\n  branch, and then run some cargo command (like `cargo tree` or `cargo check`),\n  which should re-update the lockfile with your own local changes. If you previously\n  ran some `cargo update` commands in your branch, you can re-run them that this\n  time. The community has been looking to resolve merge conflicts with `Cargo.lock`\n  and `Cargo.toml` using a [custom merge tool].\n\n\n[links]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links\n[conventions in place]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages\n[`direct-minimal-versions`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#direct-minimal-versions\n[custom merge tool]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1818"

    # First Steps with Cargo

    This section provides a quick sense for the `cargo` command line tool. We
    demonstrate its ability to generate a new [***package***][def-package] for us,
    its ability to compile the [***crate***][def-crate] within the package, and
    its ability to run the resulting program.

    To start a new package with Cargo, use `cargo new`:

    ```console
    $ cargo new hello_world
    ```

    Cargo defaults to `--bin` to make a binary program. To make a library, we
    would pass `--lib`, instead.

    Let’s check out what Cargo has generated for us:

    ```console
    $ cd hello_world
    $ tree .
    .
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs

    1 directory, 2 files
    ```

    This is all we need to get started. First, let’s check out `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"

    [dependencies]
    ```

    This is called a [***manifest***][def-manifest], and it contains all of the
    metadata that Cargo needs to compile your package.

    Here’s what’s in `src/main.rs`:

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

    Cargo generated a “hello world” program for us, otherwise known as a
    [***binary crate***][def-crate]. Let’s compile it:

    ```console
    $ cargo build
       Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/package/hello_world)
    ```

    And then run it:

    ```console
    $ ./target/debug/hello_world
    Hello, world!
    ```

    We can also use `cargo run` to compile and then run it, all in one step:

    ```console
    $ cargo run
         Fresh hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/package/hello_world)
       Running `target/hello_world`
    Hello, world!
    ```

    # Installation

    ## Install Rust and Cargo

    The easiest way to get Cargo is to install the current stable release of [Rust]
    by using [rustup]. Installing Rust using `rustup` will also install `cargo`.

    On Linux and macOS systems, this is done as follows:

    ```console
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

    It will download a script, and start the installation. If everything goes well,
    you’ll see this appear:

    ```console
    Rust is installed now. Great!
    ```

    On Windows, download and run [rustup-init.exe]. It will start the installation
    in a console and present the above message on success.

    After this, you can use the `rustup` command to also install `beta` or `nightly`
    channels for Rust and Cargo.

    For other installation options and information, visit the
    [install][install-rust] page of the Rust website.

    ## Build and Install Cargo from Source

    Alternatively, you can [build Cargo from source][compiling-from-source].

Create a `.crate` file by following the steps in [cargo-package(1)](cargo-package.html).\n3. Upload the crate to the registry. The server will perform additional\n   checks on the crate. \n4. The client will poll waiting for the package to appear in the index,\n   and may timeout. In that case, you will need to check for completion\n   manually.

    Documentation text:

    # cargo-metadata(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-metadata --- Machine-readable metadata about the current package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo metadata` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Output JSON to stdout containing information about the workspace members and
    resolved dependencies of the current package.

    The output format is subject to change in future versions of Cargo. It
    is recommended to include the `--format-version` flag to future-proof your code
    and ensure the output is in the format you are expecting. For more on the
    expectations, see ["Compatibility"](#compatibility).

    See the [cargo_metadata crate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo_metadata)
    for a Rust API for reading the metadata.

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT

    ### Compatibility

    Within the same output format version, the compatibility is maintained, except
    some scenarios. The following is a non-exhaustive list of changes that are not
    considered as incompatible:

    * **Adding new fields** — New fields will be added when needed. Reserving this
      helps Cargo evolve without bumping the format version too often.
    * **Adding new values for enum-like fields** — Same as adding new fields. It
      keeps metadata evolving without stagnation.
    * **Changing opaque representations** — The inner representations of some
      fields are implementation details. For example, fields related to
      "Source ID" are treated as opaque identifiers to differentiate packages or
      sources. Consumers shouldn't rely on those representations unless specified.

    ### JSON format

    The JSON output has the following format:

    ```javascript
    {
        /* Array of all packages in the workspace.
           It also includes all feature-enabled dependencies unless --no-deps is used.
        */
        "packages": [
            {
                /* The name of the package. */
                "name": "my-package",
                /* The version of the package. */
                "version": "0.1.0",
                /* The Package ID for referring to the
                   package within the document and as the `--package` argument to many commands
                */
                "id": "file:///path/to/my-package#0.1.0",
                /* The license value from the manifest, or null. */
                "license": "MIT/Apache-2.0",
                /* The license-file value from the manifest, or null. */
                "license_file": "LICENSE",
                /* The description value from the manifest, or null. */
                "description": "Package description.",
                /* The source ID of the package, an "opaque" identifier representing
                   where a package is retrieved from. See "Compatibility" above for
                   the stability guarantee.

                   This is null for path dependencies and workspace members.

                   For other dependencies, it is a string with the format:
                   - "registry+URL" for registry-based dependencies.
                     Example: "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
                   - "git+URL" for git-based dependencies.
                     Example: "git+https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo?rev=5e85ba14aaa20f8133863373404cb0af69eeef2c#5e85ba14aaa20f8133863373404cb0af69eeef2c"
                   - "sparse+URL" for dependencies from a sparse registry
                     Example: "sparse+https://my-sparse-registry.org"

                   The value after the `+` is not explicitly defined, and may change
                   between versions of Cargo and may not directly correlate to other
                   things, such as registry definitions in a config file. New source
                   kinds may be added in the future which will have different `+`
                   prefixed identifiers.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `cargo-install page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# cargo-install(1)\n## NAME\n\ncargo-install --- Build and install a Rust binary\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n`cargo install` [_options_] _crate_[@_version_]...\\\n`cargo install` [_options_] `--path` _path_\\\n`cargo install` [_options_] `--git` _url_ [_crate_...]\\\n`cargo install` [_options_] `--list`\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nThis command manages Cargo's local set of installed binary crates. Only\npackages which have executable `[[bin]]` or `[[example]]` targets can be\ninstalled, and all executables are installed into the installation root's\n`bin` folder. By default only binaries, not examples, are installed.\n\nThe installation root is determined, in order of precedence:\n\n- `--root` option\n- `CARGO_INSTALL_ROOT` environment variable\n- `install.root` Cargo [config value](../reference/config.html)\n- `CARGO_HOME` environment variable\n- `$HOME/.cargo`\n\nThere are multiple sources from which a crate can be installed. The default\nsource location is crates.io but the `--git`, `--path`, and `--registry` flags\ncan change this source. If the source contains more than one package (such as\ncrates.io or a git repository with multiple crates) the _crate_ argument is\nrequired to indicate which crate should be installed.\n\nCrates from crates.io can optionally specify the version they wish to install\nvia the `--version` flags, and similarly packages from git repositories can\noptionally specify the branch, tag, or revision that should be installed. If a\ncrate has multiple binaries, the `--bin` argument can selectively install only\none of them, and if you'd rather install examples the `--example` argument can\nbe used as well.\n\nIf the package is already installed, Cargo will reinstall it if the installed\nversion does not appear to be up-to-date. If any of the following values\nchange, then Cargo will reinstall the package:\n\n- The package version and source.\n- The set of binary names installed.\n- The chosen features.\n- The profile (`--profile`).\n- The target (`--target`).\n\nInstalling with `--path` will always build and install, unless there are\nconflicting binaries from another package. The `--force` flag may be used to\nforce Cargo to always reinstall the package.\n\nIf the source is crates.io or `--git` then by default the crate will be built\nin a temporary target directory. To avoid this, the target directory can be\nspecified by setting the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` environment variable to a relative\npath. In particular, this can be useful for caching build artifacts on\ncontinuous integration systems.\n\n### Dealing with the Lockfile\n\nBy default, the `Cargo.lock` file that is included with the package will be\nignored. This means that Cargo will recompute which versions of dependencies\nto use, possibly using newer versions that have been released since the\npackage was published. The `--locked` flag can be used to force Cargo to use\nthe packaged `Cargo.lock` file if it is available. This may be useful for\nensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact same set of dependencies that\nwere available when the package was published. It may also be useful if a\nnewer version of a dependency is published that no longer builds on your\nsystem, or has other problems. The downside to using `--locked` is that you\nwill not receive any fixes or updates to any dependency. Note that Cargo did\nnot start publishing `Cargo.lock` files until version 1.37, which means\npackages published with prior versions will not have a `Cargo.lock` file\navailable.\n\n### Configuration Discovery\n\nThis command operates on system or user level, not project level.\nThis means that the local [configuration discovery] is ignored.\nInstead, the configuration discovery begins at `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml`. \nIf the package is installed with `--path $PATH`, the local configuration \nwill be used, beginning discovery at `$PATH/.cargo/config.toml`.\n\n[configuration discovery]: ../reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure"

    # cargo-login(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-login --- Log in to a registry

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo login` [_options_] [`--` _args_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will run a credential provider to save a token so that commands
    that require authentication, such as [cargo-publish(1)](cargo-publish.html), will be
    automatically authenticated.

    All the arguments following the two dashes (`--`) are passed to the credential provider.

    For the default `cargo:token` credential provider, the token is saved
    in `$CARGO_HOME/credentials.toml`. `CARGO_HOME` defaults to `.cargo`
    in your home directory.

    If a registry has a credential-provider specified, it will be used. Otherwise,
    the providers from the config value `registry.global-credential-providers` will
    be attempted, starting from the end of the list.

    The _token_ will be read from stdin.

    The API token for crates.io may be retrieved from <https://crates.io/me>.

    Take care to keep the token secret, it should not be shared with anyone else.

    # cargo-pkgid(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-pkgid --- Print a fully qualified package specification

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo pkgid` [_options_] [_spec_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Given a _spec_ argument, print out the fully qualified package ID specifier
    for a package or dependency in the current workspace. This command will
    generate an error if _spec_ is ambiguous as to which package it refers to in
    the dependency graph. If no _spec_ is given, then the specifier for the local
    package is printed.

    This command requires that a lockfile is available and dependencies have been
    fetched.

    A package specifier consists of a name, version, and source URL. You are
    allowed to use partial specifiers to succinctly match a specific package as
    long as it matches only one package. This specifier is also used by other parts
    in Cargo, such as [cargo-metadata(1)](cargo-metadata.html) and [JSON messages] emitted by Cargo.

    The format of a _spec_ can be one of the following:

    SPEC Structure             | Example SPEC
    ---------------------------|--------------
    _name_                     | `bitflags`
    _name_`@`_version_         | `bitflags@1.0.4`
    _url_                      | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo`
    _url_`#`_version_          | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#0.33.0`
    _url_`#`_name_             | `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index#bitflags`
    _url_`#`_name_`@`_version_ | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#crates-io@0.21.0`

    The specification grammar can be found in chapter [Package ID Specifications].

    # cargo-init(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-init --- Create a new Cargo package in an existing directory

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo init` [_options_] [_path_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will create a new Cargo manifest in the current directory. Give a
    path as an argument to create in the given directory.

    If there are typically-named Rust source files already in the directory, those
    will be used. If not, then a sample `src/main.rs` file will be created, or
    `src/lib.rs` if `--lib` is passed.

    If the directory is not already in a VCS repository, then a new repository
    is created (see `--vcs` below).

    See [cargo-new(1)](cargo-new.html) for a similar command which will create a new package in
    a new directory.

    `cargo add` [_options_] `--path` _path_\
    `cargo add` [_options_] `--git` _url_ [_crate_...]


    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command can add or modify dependencies.

    The source for the dependency can be specified with:

    * _crate_`@`_version_: Fetch from a registry with a version constraint of "_version_"
    * `--path` _path_: Fetch from the specified _path_
    * `--git` _url_: Pull from a git repo at _url_

    If no source is specified, then a best effort will be made to select one, including:

    * Existing dependencies in other tables (like `dev-dependencies`)
    * Workspace members
    * Latest release in the registry

    When you add a package that is already present, the existing entry will be updated with the flags specified.

    Upon successful invocation, the enabled (`+`) and disabled (`-`) [features] of the specified
    dependency will be listed in the command's output.

If\nyou are passing arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after `--` go\nto the binary, the ones before go to Cargo. For details about libtest's\narguments see the output of `cargo bench -- --help` and check out the rustc\nbook's chapter on how tests work at\n<https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html>.\n\nAs an example, this will run only the benchmark named `foo` (and skip other\nsimilarly named benchmarks like `foobar`):\n\n    cargo bench -- foo --exact\n\nBenchmarks are built with the `--test` option to `rustc` which creates a\nspecial executable by linking your code with libtest. The executable\nautomatically runs all functions annotated with the `#[bench]` attribute.\nCargo passes the `--bench` flag to the test harness to tell it to run\nonly benchmarks, regardless of whether the harness is libtest or a custom harness.\n\nThe libtest harness may be disabled by setting `harness = false` in the target\nmanifest settings, in which case your code will need to provide its own `main`\nfunction to handle running benchmarks.\n\n> **Note**: The\n> [`#[bench]` attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/library-features/test.html)\n> is currently unstable and only available on the\n> [nightly channel](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html).\n> There are some packages available on\n> [crates.io](https://crates.io/keywords/benchmark) that may help with\n> running benchmarks on the stable channel, such as\n> [Criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion).\n\nBy default, `cargo bench` uses the [`bench` profile], which enables\noptimizations and disables debugging information. If you need to debug a\nbenchmark, you can use the `--profile=dev` command-line option to switch to\nthe dev profile. You can then run the debug-enabled benchmark within a\ndebugger.\n\n[`bench` profile]: ../reference/profiles.html#bench\n\n### Working directory of benchmarks\n\nThe working directory of every benchmark is set to the root directory of the \npackage the benchmark belongs to.\nSetting the working directory of benchmarks to the package's root directory \nmakes it possible for benchmarks to reliably access the package's files using \nrelative paths, regardless from where `cargo bench` was executed from."

    as a whole.</dd>


    </dl>

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    ### Feature Selection

    The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When no
    feature options are given, the `default` feature is activated for every
    selected package.

    See [the features documentation](../reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options)
    for more details.

    ### Compilation Options

    <dl>

    list of supported targets. This flag may be specified multiple times.</p>
    <p>This may also be specified with the <code>build.target</code>
    <a href="../reference/config.html">config value</a>.</p>
    <p>Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode where the
    target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See the
    <a href="../reference/build-cache.html">build cache</a> documentation for more details.</dd>


    <dt class="option-term" id="option-cargo-bench---profile"><a class="option-anchor" href="#option-cargo-bench---profile"></a><code>--profile</code> <em>name</em></dt>
    <dd class="option-desc">Benchmark with the given profile.

    formats; <code>--timings</code> without an argument will default to <code>--timings=html</code>.
    Specifying an output format (rather than the default) is unstable and requires
    <code>-Zunstable-options</code>. Valid output formats:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>html</code> (unstable, requires <code>-Zunstable-options</code>): Write a human-readable file <code>cargo-timing.html</code> to the
    <code>target/cargo-timings</code> directory with a report of the compilation. Also write
    a report to the same directory with a timestamp in the filename if you want
    to look at older runs. HTML output is suitable for human consumption only,
    and does not provide machine-readable timing data.</li>
    <li><code>json</code> (unstable, requires <code>-Zunstable-options</code>): Emit machine-readable JSON
    information about timing information.</li>

    ### Display Options

    By default the Rust test harness hides output from benchmark execution to keep
    results readable. Benchmark output can be recovered (e.g., for debugging) by
    passing `--nocapture` to the benchmark binaries:

        cargo bench -- --nocapture

    <code>--lockfile-path</code> will ignore existing lockfile at the default path, and instead will
    either use the lockfile from <em>PATH</em>, or write a new lockfile into the provided <em>PATH</em> if it doesn’t exist.
    This flag can be used to run most commands in read-only directories, writing lockfile into the provided <em>PATH</em>.</p>

    for more information about how toolchain overrides work.</dd>


    <dt class="option-term" id="option-cargo-bench---config"><a class="option-anchor" href="#option-cargo-bench---config"></a><code>--config</code> <em>KEY=VALUE</em> or <em>PATH</em></dt>
    <dd class="option-desc">Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in TOML syntax of <code>KEY=VALUE</code>,

    ### Miscellaneous Options

    The `--jobs` argument affects the building of the benchmark executable but
    does not affect how many threads are used when running the benchmarks. The
    Rust test harness runs benchmarks serially in a single thread.

    <dl>
    <dt class="option-term" id="option-cargo-bench--j"><a class="option-anchor" href="#option-cargo-bench--j"></a><code>-j</code> <em>N</em></dt>

    <dd class="option-desc">Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
    <code>build.jobs</code> <a href="../reference/config.html">config value</a>. Defaults to
    the number of logical CPUs. If negative, it sets the maximum number of
    parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus provided value. If
    a string <code>default</code> is provided, it sets the value back to defaults.
    Should not be 0.</dd>

    </dl>

    While `cargo bench` involves compilation, it does not provide a `--keep-going`
    flag. Use `--no-fail-fast` to run as many benchmarks as possible without
    stopping at the first failure. To "compile" as many benchmarks as possible, use
    `--benches` to build benchmark binaries separately. For example:

        cargo build --benches --release --keep-going
        cargo bench --no-fail-fast

    ## ENVIRONMENT

    See [the reference](../reference/environment-variables.html) for
    details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

    ## EXIT STATUS

    * `0`: Cargo succeeded.
    * `101`: Cargo failed to complete.

    ## EXAMPLES

    1. Build and execute all the benchmarks of the current package:

           cargo bench

    2. Run only a specific benchmark within a specific benchmark target:

           cargo bench --bench bench_name -- modname::some_benchmark

    # cargo-rustc(1)
    ## NAME

    cargo-rustc --- Compile the current package, and pass extra options to the compiler

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo rustc` [_options_] [`--` _args_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    The specified target for the current package (or package specified by `-p` if
    provided) will be compiled along with all of its dependencies. The specified
    _args_ will all be passed to the final compiler invocation, not any of the
    dependencies. Note that the compiler will still unconditionally receive
    arguments such as `-L`, `--extern`, and `--crate-type`, and the specified
    _args_ will simply be added to the compiler invocation.

    See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html> for documentation on rustc
    flags.

    This command requires that only one target is being compiled when additional
    arguments are provided. If more than one target is available for the current
    package the filters of `--lib`, `--bin`, etc, must be used to select which
    target is compiled.

    To pass flags to all compiler processes spawned by Cargo, use the `RUSTFLAGS`
    [environment variable](../reference/environment-variables.html) or the
    `build.rustflags` [config value](../reference/config.html).

    ## ENVIRONMENT

    See [the reference](../reference/environment-variables.html) for
    details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

    ## EXIT STATUS

    * `0`: Cargo succeeded.
    * `101`: Cargo failed to complete.

    ## EXAMPLES

    1. Check if your package (not including dependencies) uses unsafe code:

           cargo rustc --lib -- -D unsafe-code

    2. Try an experimental flag on the nightly compiler, such as this which prints
       the size of every type:

           cargo rustc --lib -- -Z print-type-sizes

    3. Override `crate-type` field in Cargo.toml with command-line option:

    # cargo-tree(1)
    ## NAME

    cargo-tree --- Display a tree visualization of a dependency graph

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo tree` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will display a tree of dependencies to the terminal. An example
    of a simple project that depends on the "rand" package:

    ```
    myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
    └── rand v0.7.3
        ├── getrandom v0.1.14
        │   ├── cfg-if v0.1.10
        │   └── libc v0.2.68
        ├── libc v0.2.68 (*)
        ├── rand_chacha v0.2.2
        │   ├── ppv-lite86 v0.2.6
        │   └── rand_core v0.5.1
        │       └── getrandom v0.1.14 (*)
        └── rand_core v0.5.1 (*)
    [build-dependencies]
    └── cc v1.0.50
    ```

    Packages marked with `(*)` have been "de-duplicated". The dependencies for the
    package have already been shown elsewhere in the graph, and so are not
    repeated. Use the `--no-dedupe` option to repeat the duplicates.

    The `-e` flag can be used to select the dependency kinds to display. The
    "features" kind changes the output to display the features enabled by
    each dependency. For example, `cargo tree -e features`:

    ```
    myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
    └── log feature "serde"
        └── log v0.4.8
            ├── serde v1.0.106
            └── cfg-if feature "default"
                └── cfg-if v0.1.10
    ```

    In this tree, `myproject` depends on `log` with the `serde` feature. `log` in
    turn depends on `cfg-if` with "default" features. When using `-e features` it
    can be helpful to use `-i` flag to show how the features flow into a package.
    See the examples below for more detail.

    ### Feature Unification

    This command shows a graph much closer to a feature-unified graph Cargo will
    build, rather than what you list in `Cargo.toml`. For instance, if you specify
    the same dependency in both `[dependencies]` and `[dev-dependencies]` but with
    different features on. This command may merge all features and show a `(*)` on
    one of the dependency to indicate the duplicate.

    As a result, for a mostly equivalent overview of what `cargo build` does,
    `cargo tree -e normal,build` is pretty close; for a mostly equivalent overview
    of what `cargo test` does, `cargo tree` is pretty close. However, it doesn't
    guarantee the exact equivalence to what Cargo is going to build, since a
    compilation is complex and depends on lots of different factors.

    To learn more about feature unification, check out this
    [dedicated section](../reference/features.html#feature-unification).

  documentationQuestion2: How can you display the dependency tree of a Cargo project including feature dependencies, and what flags are required for this?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the significance of the `(*)` notation in the output of `cargo tree`, and how can you modify the output to show all duplicate dependencies instead of deduplicating them?

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    Documentation text:

    ## ENVIRONMENT

    See [the reference](../reference/environment-variables.html) for
    details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

    ## EXIT STATUS

    * `0`: Cargo succeeded.
    * `101`: Cargo failed to complete.

    ## EXAMPLES

    1. Display the tree for the package in the current directory:

           cargo tree

    2. Display all the packages that depend on the `syn` package:

           cargo tree -i syn

    3. Show the features enabled on each package:

           cargo tree --format "{p} {f}"

    4. Show all packages that are built multiple times. This can happen if multiple
       semver-incompatible versions appear in the tree (like 1.0.0 and 2.0.0).

           cargo tree -d

    5. Explain why features are enabled for the `syn` package:

           cargo tree -e features -i syn

       The `-e features` flag is used to show features. The `-i` flag is used to
       invert the graph so that it displays the packages that depend on `syn`. An
       example of what this would display:

       ```
       syn v1.0.17
       ├── syn feature "clone-impls"
       │   └── syn feature "default"
       │       └── rustversion v1.0.2
       │           └── rustversion feature "default"
       │               └── myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
       │                   └── myproject feature "default" (command-line)
       ├── syn feature "default" (*)
       ├── syn feature "derive"
       │   └── syn feature "default" (*)
       ├── syn feature "full"
       │   └── rustversion v1.0.2 (*)
       ├── syn feature "parsing"
       │   └── syn feature "default" (*)
       ├── syn feature "printing"
       │   └── syn feature "default" (*)
       ├── syn feature "proc-macro"
       │   └── syn feature "default" (*)
       └── syn feature "quote"
           ├── syn feature "printing" (*)
           └── syn feature "proc-macro" (*)
       ```

       To read this graph, you can follow the chain for each feature from the root
       to see why it is included. For example, the "full" feature is added by the
       `rustversion` crate which is included from `myproject` (with the default
       features), and `myproject` is the package selected on the command-line. All
       of the other `syn` features are added by the "default" feature ("quote" is
       added by "printing" and "proc-macro", both of which are default features).

       If you're having difficulty cross-referencing the de-duplicated `(*)`
       entries, try with the `--no-dedupe` flag to get the full output.

    # cargo-owner(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-owner --- Manage the owners of a crate on the registry

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo owner` [_options_] `--add` _login_ [_crate_]\
    `cargo owner` [_options_] `--remove` _login_ [_crate_]\
    `cargo owner` [_options_] `--list` [_crate_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will modify the owners for a crate on the registry. Owners of a
    crate can upload new versions and yank old versions. Non-team owners can also
    modify the set of owners, so take care!

    This command requires you to be authenticated with either the `--token` option
    or using [cargo-login(1)](cargo-login.html).

    If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from the
    current directory.

    See [the reference](../reference/publishing.html#cargo-owner) for more
    information about owners and publishing.

    # cargo-rustdoc(1)
    ## NAME

    cargo-rustdoc --- Build a package's documentation, using specified custom flags

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo rustdoc` [_options_] [`--` _args_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    The specified target for the current package (or package specified by `-p` if
    provided) will be documented with the specified _args_ being passed to the
    final rustdoc invocation. Dependencies will not be documented as part of this
    command. Note that rustdoc will still unconditionally receive arguments such
    as `-L`, `--extern`, and `--crate-type`, and the specified _args_ will simply
    be added to the rustdoc invocation.

    See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html> for documentation on rustdoc
    flags.

    This command requires that only one target is being compiled when additional
    arguments are provided. If more than one target is available for the current
    package the filters of `--lib`, `--bin`, etc, must be used to select which
    target is compiled.

    To pass flags to all rustdoc processes spawned by Cargo, use the
    `RUSTDOCFLAGS` [environment variable](../reference/environment-variables.html)
    or the `build.rustdocflags` [config value](../reference/config.html).

    ## NAME

    cargo-new --- Create a new Cargo package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo new` [_options_] _path_

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will create a new Cargo package in the given directory. This
    includes a simple template with a `Cargo.toml` manifest, sample source file,
    and a VCS ignore file. If the directory is not already in a VCS repository,
    then a new repository is created (see `--vcs` below).

    See [cargo-init(1)](cargo-init.html) for a similar command which will create a new manifest
    in an existing directory.

    ## NAME

    cargo-check --- Check the current package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo check` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Check a local package and all of its dependencies for errors. This will
    essentially compile the packages without performing the final step of code
    generation, which is faster than running `cargo build`. The compiler will save
    metadata files to disk so that future runs will reuse them if the source has
    not been modified. Some diagnostics and errors are only emitted during code
    generation, so they inherently won't be reported with `cargo check`.

  documentationQuestion3: What is the benefit of using `cargo check` over `cargo build` when performing routine package validation?

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    # cargo-update(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-update --- Update dependencies as recorded in the local lock file

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo update` [_options_] _spec_

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will update dependencies in the `Cargo.lock` file to the latest
    version. If the `Cargo.lock` file does not exist, it will be created with the
    latest available versions.

    # cargo-generate-lockfile(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-generate-lockfile --- Generate the lockfile for a package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo generate-lockfile` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will create the `Cargo.lock` lockfile for the current package or
    workspace. If the lockfile already exists, it will be rebuilt with the latest
    available version of every package.

    See also [cargo-update(1)](cargo-update.html) which is also capable of creating a `Cargo.lock`
    lockfile and has more options for controlling update behavior.

    # cargo-uninstall(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-uninstall --- Remove a Rust binary

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo uninstall` [_options_] [_spec_...]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command removes a package installed with [cargo-install(1)](cargo-install.html). The _spec_
    argument is a package ID specification of the package to remove (see
    [cargo-pkgid(1)](cargo-pkgid.html)).

    By default all binaries are removed for a crate but the `--bin` and
    `--example` flags can be used to only remove particular binaries.

    The installation root is determined, in order of precedence:

    - `--root` option
    - `CARGO_INSTALL_ROOT` environment variable
    - `install.root` Cargo [config value](../reference/config.html)
    - `CARGO_HOME` environment variable
    - `$HOME/.cargo`

    # cargo-logout(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-logout --- Remove an API token from the registry locally

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo logout` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will run a credential provider to remove a saved token.

    For the default `cargo:token` credential provider, credentials are stored
    in `$CARGO_HOME/credentials.toml` where `$CARGO_HOME` defaults to `.cargo`
    in your home directory.

    If a registry has a credential-provider specified, it will be used. Otherwise,
    the providers from the config value `registry.global-credential-providers` will
    be attempted, starting from the end of the list.

    If `--registry` is not specified, then the credentials for the default
    registry will be removed (configured by
    [`registry.default`](../reference/config.html#registrydefault), which defaults
    to <https://crates.io/>).

    This will not revoke the token on the server. If you need to revoke the token,
    visit the registry website and follow its instructions (see
    <https://crates.io/me> to revoke the token for <https://crates.io/>).

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    glob patterns like <code>*</code>, <code>?</code> and <code>[]</code>. However, to avoid your shell accidentally
    expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single quotes or
    double quotes around each pattern.</dd>

    accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use
    single quotes or double quotes around each pattern.</dd>


    </dl>

    ### Target Selection

    When no target selection options are given, `cargo doc` will document all
    binary and library targets of the selected package. The binary will be skipped
    if its name is the same as the lib target. Binaries are skipped if they have
    `required-features` that are missing.

    The default behavior can be changed by setting `doc = false` for the target in
    the manifest settings. Using target selection options will ignore the `doc`
    flag and will always document the given target.

    selected package.

    # cargo-fix(1)
    ## NAME

    cargo-fix --- Automatically fix lint warnings reported by rustc

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo fix` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This Cargo subcommand will automatically take rustc's suggestions from
    diagnostics like warnings and apply them to your source code. This is intended
    to help automate tasks that rustc itself already knows how to tell you to fix!

    Executing `cargo fix` will under the hood execute [cargo-check(1)](cargo-check.html). Any warnings
    applicable to your crate will be automatically fixed (if possible) and all
    remaining warnings will be displayed when the check process is finished. For
    example if you'd like to apply all fixes to the current package, you can run:

        cargo fix

    which behaves the same as `cargo check --all-targets`.

    `cargo fix` is only capable of fixing code that is normally compiled with
    `cargo check`. If code is conditionally enabled with optional features, you
    will need to enable those features for that code to be analyzed:

        cargo fix --features foo

    Similarly, other `cfg` expressions like platform-specific code will need to
    pass `--target` to fix code for the given target.

        cargo fix --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

    If you encounter any problems with `cargo fix` or otherwise have any questions
    or feature requests please don't hesitate to file an issue at
    <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo>.

    ### Edition migration

    The `cargo fix` subcommand can also be used to migrate a package from one
    [edition] to the next. The general procedure is:

    1. Run `cargo fix --edition`. Consider also using the `--all-features` flag if
       your project has multiple features. You may also want to run `cargo fix
       --edition` multiple times with different `--target` flags if your project
       has platform-specific code gated by `cfg` attributes.
    2. Modify `Cargo.toml` to set the [edition field] to the new edition.
    3. Run your project tests to verify that everything still works. If new
       warnings are issued, you may want to consider running `cargo fix` again
       (without the `--edition` flag) to apply any suggestions given by the
       compiler.

    And hopefully that's it! Just keep in mind of the caveats mentioned above that
    `cargo fix` cannot update code for inactive features or `cfg` expressions.
    Also, in some rare cases the compiler is unable to automatically migrate all
    code to the new edition, and this may require manual changes after building
    with the new edition.

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    # cargo-package(1)
    ## NAME

    cargo-package --- Assemble the local package into a distributable tarball

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo package` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will create a distributable, compressed `.crate` file with the
    source code of the package in the current directory. The resulting file will be
    stored in the `target/package` directory. This performs the following steps:

    1. Load and check the current workspace, performing some basic checks.
        - Path dependencies are not allowed unless they have a version key. Cargo
          will ignore the path key for dependencies in published packages.
          `dev-dependencies` do not have this restriction.
    2. Create the compressed `.crate` file.
        - The original `Cargo.toml` file is rewritten and normalized.
        - `[patch]`, `[replace]`, and `[workspace]` sections are removed from the
          manifest.
        - `Cargo.lock` is always included. When missing, a new lock file will be
          generated unless the `--exclude-lockfile` flag is used. [cargo-install(1)](cargo-install.html)
          will use the packaged lock file if the `--locked` flag is used.
        - A `.cargo_vcs_info.json` file is included that contains information
          about the current VCS checkout hash if available, as well as a flag if the
          worktree is dirty.
        - Symlinks are flattened to their target files.
        - Files and directories are included or excluded based on rules mentioned in
          [the `[include]` and `[exclude]` fields](../reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields).

    3. Extract the `.crate` file and build it to verify it can build.
        - This will rebuild your package from scratch to ensure that it can be
          built from a pristine state. The `--no-verify` flag can be used to skip
          this step.
    4. Check that build scripts did not modify any source files.

    The list of files included can be controlled with the `include` and `exclude`
    fields in the manifest.

    See [the reference](../reference/publishing.html) for more details about
    packaging and publishing.

    ### .cargo_vcs_info.json format

    Will generate a `.cargo_vcs_info.json` in the following format

    ```javascript
    {
     "git": {
       "sha1": "aac20b6e7e543e6dd4118b246c77225e3a3a1302",
       "dirty": true
     },
     "path_in_vcs": ""
    }
    ```

    `dirty` indicates that the Git worktree was dirty when the package
    was built.

    `path_in_vcs` will be set to a repo-relative path for packages
    in subdirectories of the version control repository.

    The compatibility of this file is maintained under the same policy
    as the JSON output of [cargo-metadata(1)](cargo-metadata.html).

    Note that this file provides a best-effort snapshot of the VCS information.
    However, the provenance of the package is not verified.
    There is no guarantee that the source code in the tarball matches the VCS information.

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    # cargo-locate-project(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-locate-project --- Print a JSON representation of a Cargo.toml file's location

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo locate-project` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This command will print a JSON object to stdout with the full path to the manifest. The
    manifest is found by searching upward for a file named `Cargo.toml` starting from the current
    working directory.

    If the project happens to be a part of a workspace, the manifest of the project, rather than
    the workspace root, is output. This can be overridden by the `--workspace` flag. The root
    workspace is found by traversing further upward or by using the field `package.workspace` after
    locating the manifest of a workspace member.

    # cargo-fetch(1)
    ## NAME

    cargo-fetch --- Fetch dependencies of a package from the network

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo fetch` [_options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    If a `Cargo.lock` file is available, this command will ensure that all of the
    git dependencies and/or registry dependencies are downloaded and locally
    available. Subsequent Cargo commands will be able to run offline after a `cargo
    fetch` unless the lock file changes.

    If the lock file is not available, then this command will generate the lock
    file before fetching the dependencies.

    If `--target` is not specified, then all target dependencies are fetched.

    See also the [cargo-prefetch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-prefetch)
    plugin which adds a command to download popular crates. This may be useful if
    you plan to use Cargo without a network with the `--offline` flag.

    # cargo-vendor(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-vendor --- Vendor all dependencies locally

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo vendor` [_options_] [_path_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    This cargo subcommand will vendor all crates.io and git dependencies for a
    project into the specified directory at `<path>`. After this command completes
    the vendor directory specified by `<path>` will contain all remote sources from
    dependencies specified. Additional manifests beyond the default one can be
    specified with the `-s` option.

    The configuration necessary to use the vendored sources would be printed to
    stdout after `cargo vendor` completes the vendoring process.
    You will need to add or redirect it to your Cargo configuration file,
    which is usually `.cargo/config.toml` locally for the current package.

    Cargo treats vendored sources as read-only as it does to registry and git sources.
    If you intend to modify a crate from a remote source,
    use `[patch]` or a `path` dependency pointing to a local copy of that crate.
    Cargo will then correctly handle the crate on incremental rebuilds,
    as it knows that it is no longer a read-only dependency.

    # cargo-test(1)
    ## NAME

    cargo-test --- Execute unit and integration tests of a package

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo test` [_options_] [_testname_] [`--` _test-options_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    Compile and execute unit, integration, and documentation tests.

    The test filtering argument `TESTNAME` and all the arguments following the two
    dashes (`--`) are passed to the test binaries and thus to _libtest_ (rustc's
    built in unit-test and micro-benchmarking framework).  If you're passing
    arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after `--` go to the binary,
    the ones before go to Cargo.  For details about libtest's arguments see the
    output of `cargo test -- --help` and check out the rustc book's chapter on
    how tests work at <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html>.

    As an example, this will filter for tests with `foo` in their name and run them
    on 3 threads in parallel:

        cargo test foo -- --test-threads 3

    Tests are built with the `--test` option to `rustc` which creates a special
    executable by linking your code with libtest. The executable automatically
    runs all functions annotated with the `#[test]` attribute in multiple threads.
    `#[bench]` annotated functions will also be run with one iteration to verify
    that they are functional.

    If the package contains multiple test targets, each target compiles to a
    special executable as aforementioned, and then is run serially.

    The libtest harness may be disabled by setting `harness = false` in the target
    manifest settings, in which case your code will need to provide its own `main`
    function to handle running tests.

    ### Documentation tests

    Documentation tests are also run by default, which is handled by `rustdoc`. It
    extracts code samples from documentation comments of the library target, and
    then executes them.

    Different from normal test targets, each code block compiles to a doctest
    executable on the fly with `rustc`. These executables run in parallel in
    separate processes. The compilation of a code block is in fact a part of test
    function controlled by libtest, so some options such as `--jobs` might not
    take effect. Note that this execution model of doctests is not guaranteed
    and may change in the future; beware of depending on it.

    See the [rustdoc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/) for more information
    on writing doc tests.

    ### Working directory of tests

    The working directory when running each unit and integration test is set to the
    root directory of the package the test belongs to.
    Setting the working directory of tests to the package's root directory makes it
    possible for tests to reliably access the package's files using relative paths,
    regardless from where `cargo test` was executed from.

    For documentation tests, the working directory when invoking `rustdoc` is set to
    the workspace root directory, and is also the directory `rustdoc` uses as the
    compilation directory of each documentation test.
    The working directory when running each documentation test is set to the root
    directory of the package the test belongs to, and is controlled via `rustdoc`'s
    `--test-run-directory` option.

  documentationQuestion2: How can a user run tests with specific names and configure the number of test threads using `cargo test`?

    ## OPTIONS

    ### Test Options

    <dl>

    <dt class="option-term" id="option-cargo-test---no-run"><a class="option-anchor" href="#option-cargo-test---no-run"></a><code>--no-run</code></dt>
    <dd class="option-desc">Compile, but don’t run tests.</dd>


    <dt class="option-term" id="option-cargo-test---no-fail-fast"><a class="option-anchor" href="#option-cargo-test---no-fail-fast"></a><code>--no-fail-fast</code></dt>
    <dd class="option-desc">Run all tests regardless of failure. Without this flag, Cargo will exit
    after the first executable fails. The Rust test harness will run all tests
    within the executable to completion, this flag only applies to the executable
    as a whole.</dd>


    </dl>

    ### Package Selection

    By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
    depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
    `--manifest-path` is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
    the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
    by the manifest will be selected.

    The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
    `workspace.default-members` key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
    virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
    `--workspace`), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

    While `cargo test` involves compilation, it does not provide a `--keep-going`

    # cargo-yank(1)

    ## NAME

    cargo-yank --- Remove a pushed crate from the index

    ## SYNOPSIS

    `cargo yank` [_options_] _crate_@_version_\
    `cargo yank` [_options_] `--version` _version_ [_crate_]

    ## DESCRIPTION

    The yank command removes a previously published crate's version from the
    server's index. This command does not delete any data, and the crate will
    still be available for download via the registry's download link.

    Cargo will not use a yanked version for any new project or checkout without a
    pre-existing lockfile, and will generate an error if there are no longer
    any compatible versions for your crate.

    This command requires you to be authenticated with either the `--token` option
    or using [cargo-login(1)](cargo-login.html).

    If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from the
    current directory.

    ### How yank works

    For example, the `foo` crate published version `1.5.0` and another crate `bar`
    declared a dependency on version `foo = "1.5"`. Now `foo` releases a new, but
    not semver compatible, version `2.0.0`, and finds a critical issue with `1.5.0`.
    If `1.5.0` is yanked, no new project or checkout without an existing lockfile
    will be able to use crate `bar` as it relies on `1.5`.

    In this case, the maintainers of `foo` should first publish a semver compatible
    version such as `1.5.1` prior to yanking `1.5.0` so that `bar` and all projects
    that depend on `bar` will continue to work.

    As another example, consider a crate `bar` with published versions `1.5.0`,
    `1.5.1`, `1.5.2`, `2.0.0` and `3.0.0`. The following table identifies the
    versions cargo could use in the absence of a lockfile for different SemVer
    requirements, following a given release being yanked:

    | Yanked Version / SemVer requirement | `bar = "1.5.0"`                         | `bar = "=1.5.0"` | `bar = "2.0.0"`  |
    |-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
    | `1.5.0`                             | Use either `1.5.1` or `1.5.2`           | **Return Error** | Use `2.0.0`      |
    | `1.5.1`                             | Use either `1.5.0` or `1.5.2`           | Use `1.5.0`      | Use `2.0.0`      |
    | `2.0.0`                             | Use either `1.5.0`, `1.5.1` or `1.5.2`  | Use `1.5.0`      | **Return Error** |

    ### When to yank

    Crates should only be yanked in exceptional circumstances, for example, an
    accidental publish, an unintentional SemVer breakages, or a significantly
    broken and unusable crate. In the case of security vulnerabilities, [RustSec]
    is typically a less disruptive mechanism to inform users and encourage them
    to upgrade, and avoids the possibility of significant downstream disruption
    irrespective of susceptibility to the vulnerability in question.

    A common workflow is to yank a crate having already published a semver
    compatible version, to reduce the probability of preventing dependent
    crates from compiling.

    When addressing copyright, licensing, or personal data issues with a published
    crate, simply yanking it may not suffice. In such cases, contact the maintainers
    of the registry you used. For crates.io, refer to their [policies] and contact
    them at <help@crates.io>.

    If credentials have been leaked, the recommended course of action is to revoke
    them immediately. Once a crate has been published, it is impossible to determine
    if the leaked credentials have been copied. Yanking the crate only prevents new
    users from downloading it, but cannot stop those who have already downloaded it
    from keeping or even spreading the leaked credentials.

    # Dependency Resolution

    One of Cargo's primary tasks is to determine the versions of dependencies to
    use based on the version requirements specified in each package. This process
    is called "dependency resolution" and is performed by the "resolver". The
    result of the resolution is stored in the `Cargo.lock` file which "locks" the
    dependencies to specific versions, and keeps them fixed over time.
    The [`cargo tree`] command can be used to visualize the result of the
    resolver.

    [dependency specifications]: specifying-dependencies.md
    [dependency specification]: specifying-dependencies.md
    [`cargo tree`]: ../commands/cargo-tree.md

    ## Constraints and Heuristics

    In many cases there is no single "best" dependency resolution.
    The resolver operates under various constraints and heuristics to find a generally applicable resolution.
    To understand how these interact, it is helpful to have a coarse understanding of how dependency resolution works.

    This pseudo-code approximates what Cargo's resolver does:
    ```rust
    pub fn resolve(workspace: &[Package], policy: Policy) -> Option<ResolveGraph> {
        let dep_queue = Queue::new(workspace);
        let resolved = ResolveGraph::new();
        resolve_next(pkq_queue, resolved, policy)
    }

    fn resolve_next(dep_queue: Queue, resolved: ResolveGraph, policy: Policy) -> Option<ResolveGraph> {
        let Some(dep_spec) = policy.pick_next_dep(dep_queue) else {
            // Done
            return Some(resolved);
        };

        if let Some(resolved) = policy.try_unify_version(dep_spec, resolved.clone()) {
            return Some(resolved);
        }

        let dep_versions = dep_spec.lookup_versions()?;
        let mut dep_versions = policy.filter_versions(dep_spec, dep_versions);
        while let Some(dep_version) = policy.pick_next_version(&mut dep_versions) {
            if policy.needs_version_unification(dep_version, &resolved) {
                continue;
            }

            let mut dep_queue = dep_queue.clone();
            dep_queue.enqueue(dep_version.dependencies);
            let mut resolved = resolved.clone();
            resolved.register(dep_version);
            if let Some(resolved) = resolve_next(dep_queue, resolved) {
                return Some(resolved);
            }
        }

        // No valid solution found, backtrack and `pick_next_version`
        None
    }
    ```

    Key steps:
    - Walking dependencies (`pick_next_dep`):
      The order dependencies are walked can affect
      how related version requirements for the same dependency get resolved, see unifying versions,
      and how much the resolver backtracks, affecting resolver performance,
    - Unifying versions (`try_unify_version`, `needs_version_unification`):
      Cargo reuses versions where possible to reduce build times and allow types from common dependencies to be passed between APIs.
      If multiple versions would have been unified if it wasn't for conflicts in their [dependency specifications], Cargo will backtrack, erroring if no solution is found, rather than selecting multiple versions.
      A [dependency specification] or Cargo may decide that a version is undesirable,
      preferring to backtrack or error rather than use it.
    - Preferring versions (`pick_next_version`):
      Cargo may decide that it should prefer a specific version,
      falling back to the next version when backtracking.

    ### Version numbers

    Generally, Cargo prefers the highest version currently available.

    For example, if you had a package in the resolve graph with:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bitflags = "*"
    ```
    If at the time the `Cargo.lock` file is generated, the greatest version of
    `bitflags` is `1.2.1`, then the package will use `1.2.1`.

    For an example of a possible exception, see [Rust version](#rust-version).

    ### Version requirements

    Package specify what versions they support, rejecting all others, through
    [version requirements].

    For example, if you had a package in the resolve graph with:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bitflags = "1.0"  # meaning `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`
    ```
    If at the time the `Cargo.lock` file is generated, the greatest version of
    `bitflags` is `1.2.1`, then the package will use `1.2.1` because it is the
    greatest within the compatibility range. If `2.0.0` is published, it will
    still use `1.2.1` because `2.0.0` is considered incompatible.

    [version requirements]: specifying-dependencies.md#version-requirement-syntax

    ### SemVer compatibility

    Cargo assumes packages follow [SemVer] and will unify dependency versions if they are
    [SemVer] compatible according to the [Caret version requirements].
    If two compatible versions cannot be unified because of conflicting version requirements,
    Cargo will error.

    See the [SemVer Compatibility] chapter for guidance on what is considered a
    "compatible" change.

    Examples:

    The following two packages will have their dependencies on `bitflags` unified because any version picked will be compatible with each other.
    ```toml
    # Package A
    [dependencies]
    bitflags = "1.0"  # meaning `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`

    # Package B
    [dependencies]
    bitflags = "1.1"  # meaning `>=1.1.0,<2.0.0`
    ```

    The following packages will error because the version requirements conflict, selecting two distinct compatible versions.
    ```toml
    # Package A
    [dependencies]
    log = "=0.4.11"

    # Package B
    [dependencies]
    log = "=0.4.8"
    ```

    The following two packages will not have their dependencies on `rand` unified because only incompatible versions are available for each.
    Instead, two different versions (e.g. 0.6.5 and 0.7.3) will be resolved and built.
    This can lead to potential problems, see the [Version-incompatibility hazards] section for more details.
    ```toml
    # Package A
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.7"  # meaning `>=0.7.0,<0.8.0`

    # Package B
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.6"  # meaning `>=0.6.0,<0.7.0`
    ```

    Generally, the following two packages will not have their dependencies unified because incompatible versions are available that satisfy the version requirements:
    Instead, two different versions (e.g. 0.6.5 and 0.7.3) will be resolved and built.
    The application of other constraints or heuristics may cause these to be unified,
    picking one version (e.g. 0.6.5).
    ```toml
    # Package A
    [dependencies]
    rand = ">=0.6,<0.8.0"

    # Package B
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.6"  # meaning `>=0.6.0,<0.7.0`
    ```

    #### Version-incompatibility hazards

    When multiple versions of a crate appear in the resolve graph, this can cause
    problems when types from those crates are exposed by the crates using them.
    This is because the types and items are considered different by the Rust
    compiler, even if they have the same name. Libraries should take care when
    publishing a SemVer-incompatible version (for example, publishing `2.0.0`
    after `1.0.0` has been in use), particularly for libraries that are widely
    used.

    The "[semver trick]" is a workaround for this problem of publishing a breaking
    change while retaining compatibility with older versions. The linked page goes
    into detail about what the problem is and how to address it. In short, when a
    library wants to publish a SemVer-breaking release, publish the new release,
    and also publish a point release of the previous version that reexports the
    types from the newer version.

    These incompatibilities usually manifest as a compile-time error, but
    sometimes they will only appear as a runtime misbehavior. For example, let's
    say there is a common library named `foo` that ends up appearing with both
    version `1.0.0` and `2.0.0` in the resolve graph. If [`downcast_ref`] is used
    on an object created by a library using version `1.0.0`, and the code calling
    `downcast_ref` is downcasting to a type from version `2.0.0`, the downcast
    will fail at runtime.

    It is important to make sure that if you have multiple versions of a library
    that you are properly using them, especially if it is ever possible for the
    types from different versions to be used together. The [`cargo tree
    -d`][`cargo tree`] command can be used to identify duplicate versions and
    where they come from. Similarly, it is important to consider the impact on the
    ecosystem if you publish a SemVer-incompatible version of a popular library.

    ### Rust version

    To support developing software with a minimum supported [Rust version],
    the resolver can take into account a dependency version's compatibility with your Rust version.
    This is controlled by the config field [`resolver.incompatible-rust-versions`].

    With the `fallback` setting, the resolver will prefer packages with a Rust version that is
    less than or equal to your own Rust version.
    For example, you are using Rust 1.85 to develop the following package:
    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-cli"
    rust-version = "1.62"

    [dependencies]
    clap = "4.0"  # resolves to 4.0.32
    ```
    The resolver would pick version 4.0.32 because it has a Rust version of 1.60.0.
    - 4.0.0 is not picked because it is a [lower version number](#version-numbers) despite it also having a Rust version of 1.60.0.
    - 4.5.20 is not picked because it is incompatible with `my-cli`'s Rust version of 1.62 despite having a much [higher version](#version-numbers) and it has a Rust version of 1.74.0 which is compatible with your 1.85 toolchain.

    If a version requirement does not include a Rust version compatible dependency version,
    the resolver won't error but will instead pick a version, even if its potentially suboptimal.
    For example, you change the dependency on `clap`:
    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-cli"
    rust-version = "1.62"

    [dependencies]
    clap = "4.2"  # resolves to 4.5.20
    ```
    No version of `clap` matches that [version requirement](#version-requirements)
    that is compatible with Rust version 1.62.
    The resolver will then pick an incompatible version, like 4.5.20 despite it having a Rust version of 1.74.

    When the resolver selects a dependency version of a package,
    it does not know all the workspace members that will eventually have a transitive dependency on that version
    and so it cannot take into account only the Rust versions relevant for that dependency.
    The resolver has heuristics to find a "good enough" solution when workspace members have different Rust versions.
    This applies even for packages in a workspace without a Rust version.

    When a workspace has members with different Rust versions,
    the resolver may pick a lower dependency version than necessary.
    For example, you have the following workspace members:
    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "a"
    rust-version = "1.62"

    [package]
    name = "b"

    [dependencies]
    clap = "4.2"  # resolves to 4.5.20
    ```
    Though package `b` does not have a Rust version and could use a higher version like 4.5.20,
    4.0.32 will be selected because of package `a`'s Rust version of 1.62.

    Or the resolver may pick too high of a version.
    For example, you have the following workspace members:
    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "a"
    rust-version = "1.62"

    [dependencies]
    clap = "4.2"  # resolves to 4.5.20

    [package]
    name = "b"

    [dependencies]
    clap = "4.5"  # resolves to 4.5.20
    ```
    Though each package has a version requirement for `clap` that would meet its own Rust version,
    because of [version unification](#version-numbers),
    the resolver will need to pick one version that works in both cases and that would be a version like 4.5.20.

    [`resolver.incompatible-rust-versions`]: config.md#resolverincompatible-rust-versions

    ### Features

    For the purpose of generating `Cargo.lock`, the resolver builds the dependency
    graph as-if all [features] of all [workspace] members are enabled. This
    ensures that any optional dependencies are available and properly resolved
    with the rest of the graph when features are added or removed with the
    [`--features` command-line flag](features.md#command-line-feature-options).
    The resolver runs a second time to determine the actual features used when
    *compiling* a crate, based on the features selected on the command-line.

    Dependencies are resolved with the union of all features enabled on them. For
    example, if one package depends on the [`im`] package with the [`serde`
    dependency] enabled and another package depends on it with the [`rayon`
    dependency] enabled, then `im` will be built with both features enabled, and
    the `serde` and `rayon` crates will be included in the resolve graph. If no
    packages depend on `im` with those features, then those optional dependencies
    will be ignored, and they will not affect resolution.

    When building multiple packages in a workspace (such as with `--workspace` or
    multiple `-p` flags), the features of the dependencies of all of those
    packages are unified. If you have a circumstance where you want to avoid that
    unification for different workspace members, you will need to build them via
    separate `cargo` invocations.

    The resolver will skip over versions of packages that are missing required
    features. For example, if a package depends on version `^1` of [`regex`] with
    the [`perf` feature], then the oldest version it can select is `1.3.0`,
    because versions prior to that did not contain the `perf` feature. Similarly,
    if a feature is removed from a new release, then packages that require that
    feature will be stuck on the older releases that contain that feature. It is
    discouraged to remove features in a SemVer-compatible release. Beware that
    optional dependencies also define an implicit feature, so removing an optional
    dependency or making it non-optional can cause problems, see [removing an
    optional dependency].

    #### Feature resolver version 2

    When `resolver = "2"` is specified in `Cargo.toml` (see [resolver
    versions](#resolver-versions) below), a different feature resolver is used
    which uses a different algorithm for unifying features. The version `"1"`
    resolver will unify features for a package no matter where it is specified.
    The version `"2"` resolver will avoid unifying features in the following
    situations:

    * Features for target-specific dependencies are not enabled if the target is
      not currently being built. For example:

      ```toml
      [dependencies.common]
      version = "1.0"
      features = ["f1"]

      [target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies.common]
      version = "1.0"
      features = ["f2"]
      ```

      When building this example for a non-Windows platform, the `f2` feature will
      *not* be enabled.

    * Features enabled on [build-dependencies] or proc-macros will not be unified
      when those same dependencies are used as a normal dependency. For example:

      ```toml
      [dependencies]
      log = "0.4"

      [build-dependencies]
      log = {version = "0.4", features=['std']}
      ```

      When building the build script, the `log` crate will be built with the `std`
      feature. When building the library of your package, it will not enable the
      feature.

    * Features enabled on [dev-dependencies] will not be unified when those same
      dependencies are used as a normal dependency, unless those dev-dependencies
      are currently being built. For example:

      ```toml
      [dependencies]
      serde = {version = "1.0", default-features = false}

      [dev-dependencies]
      serde = {version = "1.0", features = ["std"]}
      ```

      In this example, the library will normally link against `serde` without the
      `std` feature. However, when built as a test or example, it will include the
      `std` feature. For example, `cargo test` or `cargo build --all-targets` will
      unify these features. Note that dev-dependencies in dependencies are always
      ignored, this is only relevant for the top-level package or workspace
      members.

    [build-dependencies]: specifying-dependencies.md#build-dependencies
    [dev-dependencies]: specifying-dependencies.md#development-dependencies
    [resolver-field]: features.md#resolver-versions

    ### `links`

    The [`links` field] is used to ensure only one copy of a native library is
    linked into a binary. The resolver will attempt to find a graph where there is
    only one instance of each `links` name. If it is unable to find a graph that
    satisfies that constraint, it will return an error.

    For example, it is an error if one package depends on [`libgit2-sys`] version
    `0.11` and another depends on `0.12`, because Cargo is unable to unify those,
    but they both link to the `git2` native library. Due to this requirement, it
    is encouraged to be very careful when making SemVer-incompatible releases with
    the `links` field if your library is in common use.

    [`links` field]: manifest.md#the-links-field
    [`libgit2-sys`]: https://crates.io/crates/libgit2-sys

    ### Yanked versions

    [Yanked releases][yank] are those that are marked that they should not be
    used. When the resolver is building the graph, it will ignore all yanked
    releases unless they already exist in the `Cargo.lock` file or are explicitly
    requested by the [`--precise`] flag of `cargo update` (nightly only).

    Documentation text:

    ## Dependency updates

    Dependency resolution is automatically performed by all Cargo commands that
    need to know about the dependency graph. For example, [`cargo build`] will run
    the resolver to discover all the dependencies to build. After the first time
    it runs, the result is stored in the `Cargo.lock` file. Subsequent commands
    will run the resolver, keeping dependencies locked to the versions in
    `Cargo.lock` *if it can*.

    If the dependency list in `Cargo.toml` has been modified, for example changing
    the version of a dependency from `1.0` to `2.0`, then the resolver will select
    a new version for that dependency that matches the new requirements. If that
    new dependency introduces new requirements, those new requirements may also
    trigger additional updates. The `Cargo.lock` file will be updated with the new
    result. The `--locked` or `--frozen` flags can be used to change this behavior
    to prevent automatic updates when requirements change, and return an error
    instead.

    [`cargo update`] can be used to update the entries in `Cargo.lock` when new
    versions are published. Without any options, it will attempt to update all
    packages in the lock file. The `-p` flag can be used to target the update for
    a specific package, and other flags such as `--recursive` or `--precise` can
    be used to control how versions are selected.

    ## Overrides

    Cargo has several mechanisms to override dependencies within the graph. The
    [Overriding Dependencies] chapter goes into detail on how to use overrides.
    The overrides appear as an overlay to a registry, replacing the patched
    version with the new entry. Otherwise, resolution is performed like normal.

    [Overriding Dependencies]: overriding-dependencies.md

    ## Dependency kinds

    There are three kinds of dependencies in a package: normal, [build], and
    [dev][dev-dependencies]. For the most part these are all treated the same from
    the perspective of the resolver. One difference is that dev-dependencies for
    non-workspace members are always ignored, and do not influence resolution.

    [Platform-specific dependencies] with the `[target]` table are resolved as-if
    all platforms are enabled. In other words, the resolver ignores the platform
    or `cfg` expression.

    [build]: specifying-dependencies.md#build-dependencies
    [dev-dependencies]: specifying-dependencies.md#development-dependencies
    [Platform-specific dependencies]: specifying-dependencies.md#platform-specific-dependencies

    ### dev-dependency cycles

    Usually the resolver does not allow cycles in the graph, but it does allow
    them for [dev-dependencies]. For example, project "foo" has a dev-dependency
    on "bar", which has a normal dependency on "foo" (usually as a "path"
    dependency). This is allowed because there isn't really a cycle from the
    perspective of the build artifacts. In this example, the "foo" library is
    built (which does not need "bar" because "bar" is only used for tests), and
    then "bar" can be built depending on "foo", then the "foo" tests can be built
    linking to "bar".

    Beware that this can lead to confusing errors. In the case of building library
    unit tests, there are actually two copies of the library linked into the final
    test binary: the one that was linked with "bar", and the one built that
    contains the unit tests. Similar to the issues highlighted in the
    [Version-incompatibility hazards] section, the types between the two are not
    compatible. Be careful when exposing types of "foo" from "bar" in this
    situation, since the "foo" unit tests won't treat them the same as the local
    types.

    If possible, try to split your package into multiple packages and restructure
    it so that it remains strictly acyclic.

    ## Resolver versions

    Different resolver behavior can be specified through the resolver
    version in `Cargo.toml` like this:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-package"
    version = "1.0.0"
    resolver = "2"
    ```
    - `"1"` (default)
    - `"2"` ([`edition = "2021"`](manifest.md#the-edition-field) default): Introduces changes in [feature
    unification](#features). See the [features chapter][features-2] for more
    details.
    - `"3"` ([`edition = "2024"`](manifest.md#the-edition-field) default, requires Rust 1.84+): Change the default for [`resolver.incompatible-rust-versions`] from `allow` to `fallback`

    The resolver is a global option that affects the entire workspace. The
    `resolver` version in dependencies is ignored, only the value in the top-level
    package will be used. If using a [virtual workspace], the version should be
    specified in the `[workspace]` table, for example:

    ```toml
    [workspace]
    members = ["member1", "member2"]
    resolver = "2"
    ```

    ## Recommendations

    The following are some recommendations for setting the version within your
    package, and for specifying dependency requirements. These are general
    guidelines that should apply to common situations, but of course some
    situations may require specifying unusual requirements.

    * Follow the [SemVer guidelines] when deciding how to update your version
      number, and whether or not you will need to make a SemVer-incompatible
      version change.
    * Use caret requirements for dependencies, such as `"1.2.3"`, for most
      situations. This ensures that the resolver can be maximally flexible in
      choosing a version while maintaining build compatibility.
      * Specify all three components with the version you are currently using.
        This helps set the minimum version that will be used, and ensures that
        other users won't end up with an older version of the dependency that
        might be missing something that your package requires.
      * Avoid `*` requirements, as they are not allowed on [crates.io], and they
        can pull in SemVer-breaking changes during a normal `cargo update`.
      * Avoid overly broad version requirements. For example, `>=2.0.0` can pull
        in any SemVer-incompatible version, like version `5.0.0`, which can result
        in broken builds in the future.
      * Avoid overly narrow version requirements if possible. For example, if you
        specify a tilde requirement like `bar="~1.3"`, and another package
        specifies a requirement of `bar="1.4"`, this will fail to resolve, even
        though minor releases should be compatible.
    * Try to keep the dependency versions up-to-date with the actual minimum
      versions that your library requires. For example, if you have a requirement
      of `bar="1.0.12"`, and then in a future release you start using new features
      added in the `1.1.0` release of "bar", update your dependency requirement to
      `bar="1.1.0"`.

      If you fail to do this, it may not be immediately obvious because Cargo can
      opportunistically choose the newest version when you run a blanket `cargo
      update`. However, if another user depends on your library, and runs `cargo
      update your-library`, it will *not* automatically update "bar" if it is
      locked in their `Cargo.lock`. It will only update "bar" in that situation if
      the dependency declaration is also updated. Failure to do so can cause
      confusing build errors for the user using `cargo update your-library`.
    * If two packages are tightly coupled, then an `=` dependency requirement may
      help ensure that they stay in sync. For example, a library with a companion
      proc-macro library will sometimes make assumptions between the two libraries
      that won't work well if the two are out of sync (and it is never expected to
      use the two libraries independently). The parent library can use an `=`
      requirement on the proc-macro, and re-export the macros for easy access.
    * `0.0.x` versions can be used for packages that are permanently unstable.

    In general, the stricter you make the dependency requirements, the more likely
    it will be for the resolver to fail. Conversely, if you use requirements that
    are too loose, it may be possible for new versions to be published that will
    break the build.

    ## Troubleshooting

    The following illustrates some problems you may experience, and some possible
    solutions.

    ### Why was a dependency included?

    Say you see dependency `rand` in the `cargo check` output but don't think it's needed and want to understand why it's being pulled in.

    You can run
    ```console
    $ cargo tree --workspace --target all --all-features --invert rand
    rand v0.8.5
    └── ...

    rand v0.8.5
    └── ...
    ```

    ### Why was that feature on this dependency enabled?

    You might identify that it was an activated feature that caused `rand` to show up.  **To figure out which package activated the feature, you can add the `--edges features`**
    ```console
    $ cargo tree --workspace --target all --all-features --edges features --invert rand
    rand v0.8.5
    └── ...

    rand v0.8.5
    └── ...
    ```

    ### Unexpected dependency duplication

    You see multiple instances of `rand` when you run
    ```console
    $ cargo tree --workspace --target all --all-features --duplicates
    rand v0.7.3
    └── ...

    rand v0.8.5
    └── ...
    ```

    The resolver algorithm has converged on a solution that includes two copies of a
    dependency when one would suffice. For example:

    ```toml
    # Package A
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.7"

    # Package B
    [dependencies]
    rand = ">=0.6"  # note: open requirements such as this are discouraged
    ```

    In this example, Cargo may build two copies of the `rand` crate, even though a
    single copy at version `0.7.3` would meet all requirements. This is because the
    resolver's algorithm favors building the latest available version of `rand` for
    Package B, which is `0.8.5` at the time of this writing, and that is
    incompatible with Package A's specification. The resolver's algorithm does not
    currently attempt to "deduplicate" in this situation.

    The use of open-ended version requirements like `>=0.6` is discouraged in Cargo.
    But, if you run into this situation, the [`cargo update`] command with the
    `--precise` flag can be used to manually remove such duplications.

    [`cargo update`]: ../commands/cargo-update.md

    ### Why wasn't a newer version selected?

    Say you noticed that the latest version of a dependency wasn't selected when you ran:
    ```console
    $ cargo update
    ```
    You can enable some extra logging to see why this happened:
    ```console
    $ env CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::resolver=trace cargo update
    ```
    **Note:** Cargo log targets and levels may change over time.

    ### SemVer-breaking patch release breaks the build

    Sometimes a project may inadvertently publish a point release with a
    SemVer-breaking change. When users update with `cargo update`, they will pick
    up this new release, and then their build may break. In this situation, it is
    recommended that the project should [yank] the release, and either remove the
    SemVer-breaking change, or publish it as a new SemVer-major version increase.

    If the change happened in a third-party project, if possible try to
    (politely!) work with the project to resolve the issue.

    While waiting for the release to be yanked, some workarounds depend on the
    circumstances:

    * If your project is the end product (such as a binary executable), just avoid
      updating the offending package in `Cargo.lock`. This can be done with the
      `--precise` flag in [`cargo update`].
    * If you publish a binary on [crates.io], then you can temporarily add an `=`
      requirement to force the dependency to a specific good version.
      * Binary projects can alternatively recommend users to use the `--locked`
        flag with [`cargo install`] to use the original `Cargo.lock` that contains
        the known good version.
    * Libraries may also consider publishing a temporary new release with stricter
      requirements that avoid the troublesome dependency. You may want to consider
      using range requirements (instead of `=`) to avoid overly-strict
      requirements that may conflict with other packages using the same
      dependency. Once the problem has been resolved, you can publish another
      point release that relaxes the dependency back to a caret requirement.
    * If it looks like the third-party project is unable or unwilling to yank the
      release, then one option is to update your code to be compatible with the
      changes, and update the dependency requirement to set the minimum version to
      the new release. You will also need to consider if this is a SemVer-breaking
      change of your own library, for example if it exposes types from the
      dependency.

    # Package ID Specifications

    ## Package ID specifications

    Subcommands of Cargo frequently need to refer to a particular package within a
    dependency graph for various operations like updating, cleaning, building, etc.
    To solve this problem, Cargo supports *Package ID Specifications*. A specification
    is a string which is used to uniquely refer to one package within a graph of
    packages.

    The specification may be fully qualified, such as
    `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index#regex@1.4.3` or it may be
    abbreviated, such as `regex`. The abbreviated form may be used as long as it
    uniquely identifies a single package in the dependency graph. If there is
    ambiguity, additional qualifiers can be added to make it unique. For example,
    if there are two versions of the `regex` package in the graph, then it can be
    qualified with a version to make it unique, such as `regex@1.4.3`.

    ### Specification grammar

    The formal grammar for a Package Id Specification is:

    ```notrust
    spec := pkgname |
            [ kind "+" ] proto "://" hostname-and-path [ "?" query] [ "#" ( pkgname | semver ) ]
    query = ( "branch" | "tag" | "rev" ) "=" ref
    pkgname := name [ ("@" | ":" ) semver ]
    semver := digits [ "." digits [ "." digits [ "-" prerelease ] [ "+" build ]]]

    kind = "registry" | "git" | "path"
    proto := "http" | "git" | "file" | ...
    ```

    Here, brackets indicate that the contents are optional.

    The URL form can be used for git dependencies, or to differentiate packages
    that come from different sources such as different registries.

    ### Example specifications

    The following are references to the `regex` package on `crates.io`:

    | Spec                                                              | Name    | Version |
    |:------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|
    | `regex`                                                           | `regex` | `*`     |
    | `regex@1.4`                                                       | `regex` | `1.4.*` |
    | `regex@1.4.3`                                                     | `regex` | `1.4.3` |
    | `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index#regex`              | `regex` | `*`     |
    | `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index#regex@1.4.3`        | `regex` | `1.4.3` |
    | `registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index#regex@1.4.3` | `regex` | `1.4.3` |

    The following are some examples of specs for several different git dependencies:

    | Spec                                                       | Name             | Version  |
    |:-----------------------------------------------------------|:----------------:|:--------:|
    | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#0.52.0`                | `cargo`          | `0.52.0` |
    | `https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#cargo-platform@0.1.2`  | <nobr>`cargo-platform`</nobr> | `0.1.2`  |
    | `ssh://git@github.com/rust-lang/regex.git#regex@1.4.3`     | `regex`          | `1.4.3`  |
    | `git+ssh://git@github.com/rust-lang/regex.git#regex@1.4.3` | `regex`          | `1.4.3`  |
    | `git+ssh://git@github.com/rust-lang/regex.git?branch=dev#regex@1.4.3` | `regex`          | `1.4.3`  |

    Local packages on the filesystem can use `file://` URLs to reference them:

    | Spec                                        | Name  | Version |
    |:--------------------------------------------|:-----:|:-------:|
    | `file:///path/to/my/project/foo`            | `foo` | `*`     |
    | `file:///path/to/my/project/foo#1.1.8`      | `foo` | `1.1.8` |
    | `path+file:///path/to/my/project/foo#1.1.8` | `foo` | `1.1.8` |

    ### Brevity of specifications

    The goal of this is to enable both succinct and exhaustive syntaxes for
    referring to packages in a dependency graph. Ambiguous references may refer to
    one or more packages. Most commands generate an error if more than one package
    could be referred to with the same specification.

    # Lints

    Note: [Cargo's linting system is unstable](unstable.md#lintscargo) and can only be used on nightly toolchains

    ## Warn-by-default

    These lints are all set to the 'warn' level by default.
    - [`unknown_lints`](#unknown_lints)

    ## `unknown_lints`
    Set to `warn` by default

    ### What it does

    ### Why it is bad
    - The lint name could be misspelled, leading to confusion as to why it is
      not working as expected
    - The unknown lint could end up causing an error if `cargo` decides to make
      a lint with the same name in the future

    # Publishing on crates.io

    Once you've got a library that you'd like to share with the world, it's time to
    publish it on [crates.io]! Publishing a crate is when a specific
    version is uploaded to be hosted on [crates.io].

    Take care when publishing a crate, because a publish is **permanent**. The
    version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted. There is no
    limit to the number of versions which can be published, however.

    ## Before your first publish

    First things first, you’ll need an account on [crates.io] to acquire
    an API token. To do so, [visit the home page][crates.io] and log in via a GitHub
    account (required for now). You will also need to provide and verify your email
    address on the [Account Settings](https://crates.io/settings/profile) page. Once
    that is done [create an API token](https://crates.io/settings/tokens), make sure
    you copy it. Once you leave the page you will not be able to see it again.

    Then run the [`cargo login`] command.

    ```console
    $ cargo login
    ```

    Then at the prompt put in the token specified.
    ```console
    please paste the API Token found on https://crates.io/me below
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
    ```

    This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in your
    `~/.cargo/credentials.toml`. Note that this token is a **secret** and should not be
    shared with anyone else. If it leaks for any reason, you should revoke it
    immediately.

    > **Note**: The [`cargo logout`] command can be used to remove the token from
    > `credentials.toml`. This can be useful if you no longer need it stored on
    > the local machine.

    ## Before publishing a new crate

    Keep in mind that crate names on [crates.io] are allocated on a first-come-first-serve
    basis. Once a crate name is taken, it cannot be used for another crate.

    Check out the [metadata you can specify](manifest.md) in `Cargo.toml` to
    ensure your crate can be discovered more easily! Before publishing, make sure
    you have filled out the following fields:

    - [`license` or `license-file`]
    - [`description`]
    - [`homepage`]
    - [`repository`]
    - [`readme`]

    It would also be a good idea to include some [`keywords`] and [`categories`],
    though they are not required.

    If you are publishing a library, you may also want to consult the [Rust API
    Guidelines].

    ### Packaging a crate

    The next step is to package up your crate and upload it to [crates.io]. For
    this we’ll use the [`cargo publish`] subcommand. This command performs the following
    steps:

    1. Perform some verification checks on your package.
    2. Compress your source code into a `.crate` file.
    3. Extract the `.crate` file into a temporary directory and verify that it
       compiles.
    4. Upload the `.crate` file to [crates.io].
    5. The registry will perform some additional checks on the uploaded package
       before adding it.

    It is recommended that you first run `cargo publish --dry-run` (or [`cargo
    package`] which is equivalent) to ensure there aren't any warnings or errors
    before publishing. This will perform the first three steps listed above.

    ```console
    $ cargo publish --dry-run
    ```

    You can inspect the generated `.crate` file in the `target/package` directory.
    [crates.io] currently has a 10MB size limit on the `.crate` file. You may want
    to check the size of the `.crate` file to ensure you didn't accidentally
    package up large assets that are not required to build your package, such as
    test data, website documentation, or code generation. You can check which
    files are included with the following command:

    ```console
    $ cargo package --list
    ```

    Cargo will automatically ignore files ignored by your version control system
    when packaging, but if you want to specify an extra set of files to ignore you
    can use the [`exclude` key](manifest.md#the-exclude-and-include-fields) in the
    manifest:

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    exclude = [
        "public/assets/*",
        "videos/*",
    ]
    ```

    If you’d rather explicitly list the files to include, Cargo also supports an
    [`include` key](manifest.md#the-exclude-and-include-fields), which if set, overrides the `exclude` key:

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    include = [
        "**/*.rs",
    ]
    ```

    ## Uploading the crate

    When you are ready to publish, use the [`cargo publish`] command
    to upload to [crates.io]:

    ```console
    $ cargo publish
    ```

    And that’s it, you’ve now published your first crate!

    ## Publishing a new version of an existing crate

    In order to release a new version, change [the `version` value](manifest.md#the-version-field) specified in your `Cargo.toml` manifest.
    Keep in mind [the SemVer rules](semver.md) which provide guidelines on what is a compatible change.
    Then run [`cargo publish`] as described above to upload the new version.

    > **Recommendation:** Consider the full release process and automate what you can.
    >
    > Each version should include:
    > - A changelog entry, preferably [manually curated](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) though a generated one is better than nothing
    > - A [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) pointing to the published commit
    >
    > Examples of third-party tools that are representative of different workflows include (in alphabetical order):
    > - [cargo-release](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release)
    > - [cargo-smart-release](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-smart-release)
    > - [release-plz](https://crates.io/crates/release-plz)
    >
    > For more, see [crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=cargo%20release).

    ## Managing a crates.io-based crate

    Management of crates is primarily done through the command line `cargo` tool
    rather than the [crates.io] web interface. For this, there are a few subcommands
    to manage a crate.

    ### `cargo yank`

    Occasions may arise where you publish a version of a crate that actually ends up
    being broken for one reason or another (syntax error, forgot to include a file,
    etc.). For situations such as this, Cargo supports a “yank” of a version of a
    crate.

    ```console
    $ cargo yank --version 1.0.1
    $ cargo yank --version 1.0.1 --undo
    ```

    A yank **does not** delete any code. This feature is not intended for deleting
    accidentally uploaded secrets, for example. If that happens, you must reset
    those secrets immediately.

    The semantics of a yanked version are that no new dependencies can be created
    against that version, but all existing dependencies continue to work. One of the
    major goals of [crates.io] is to act as a permanent archive of crates that does
    not change over time, and allowing deletion of a version would go against this
    goal. Essentially a yank means that all packages with a `Cargo.lock` will not
    break, while any future `Cargo.lock` files generated will not list the yanked
    version.

    ### `cargo owner`

    A crate is often developed by more than one person, or the primary maintainer
    may change over time! The owner of a crate is the only person allowed to publish
    new versions of the crate, but an owner may designate additional owners.

    ```console
    $ cargo owner --add github-handle
    $ cargo owner --remove github-handle
    $ cargo owner --add github:rust-lang:owners
    $ cargo owner --remove github:rust-lang:owners
    ```

    The owner IDs given to these commands must be GitHub user names or GitHub teams.

    If a user name is given to `--add`, that user is invited as a “named” owner, with
    full rights to the crate. In addition to being able to publish or yank versions
    of the crate, they have the ability to add or remove owners, *including* the
    owner that made *them* an owner. Needless to say, you shouldn’t make people you
    don’t fully trust into a named owner. In order to become a named owner, a user
    must have logged into [crates.io] previously.

    If a team name is given to `--add`, that team is invited as a “team” owner, with
    restricted right to the crate. While they have permission to publish or yank
    versions of the crate, they *do not* have the ability to add or remove owners.
    In addition to being more convenient for managing groups of owners, teams are
    just a bit more secure against owners becoming malicious.

    The syntax for teams is currently `github:org:team` (see examples above).
    In order to invite a team as an owner one must be a member of that team. No
    such restriction applies to removing a team as an owner.

    ## GitHub permissions

    Team membership is not something GitHub provides simple public access to, and it
    is likely for you to encounter the following message when working with them:

    > It looks like you don’t have permission to query a necessary property from
    GitHub to complete this request. You may need to re-authenticate on [crates.io]
    to grant permission to read GitHub org memberships.

    This is basically a catch-all for “you tried to query a team, and one of the
    five levels of membership access control denied this”. That is not an
    exaggeration. GitHub’s support for team access control is Enterprise Grade.

    The most likely cause of this is simply that you last logged in before this
    feature was added. We originally requested *no* permissions from GitHub when
    authenticating users, because we didn’t actually ever use the user’s token for
    anything other than logging them in. However to query team membership on your
    behalf, we now require [the `read:org` scope][oauth-scopes].

    You are free to deny us this scope, and everything that worked before teams
    were introduced will keep working. However you will never be able to add a team
    as an owner, or publish a crate as a team owner. If you ever attempt to do this,
    you will get the error above. You may also see this error if you ever try to
    publish a crate that you don’t own at all, but otherwise happens to have a team.

    If you ever change your mind, or just aren’t sure if [crates.io] has sufficient
    permission, you can always go to <https://crates.io/> and re-authenticate,
    which will prompt you for permission if [crates.io] doesn’t have all the scopes
    it would like to.

    An additional barrier to querying GitHub is that the organization may be
    actively denying third party access. To check this, you can go to:

    ```text
    https://github.com/organizations/:org/settings/oauth_application_policy
    ```

    where `:org` is the name of the organization (e.g., `rust-lang`). You may see
    something like:

    ![Organization Access Control](../images/org-level-acl.png)

    Where you may choose to explicitly remove [crates.io] from your organization’s
    blacklist, or simply press the “Remove Restrictions” button to allow all third
    party applications to access this data.

    Alternatively, when [crates.io] requested the `read:org` scope, you could have
    explicitly whitelisted [crates.io] querying the org in question by pressing
    the “Grant Access” button next to its name:

    ![Authentication Access Control](../images/auth-level-acl.png)

    ### Troubleshooting GitHub team access errors

    When trying to add a GitHub team as crate owner, you may see an error like:

    ```text
    error: failed to invite owners to crate <crate_name>: api errors (status 200 OK): could not find the github team org/repo
    ```
    In that case, you should go to [the GitHub Application settings page] and
    check if crates.io is listed in the `Authorized OAuth Apps` tab.
    If it isn't, you should go to <https://crates.io/> and authorize it.
    Then go back to the Application Settings page on GitHub, click on the
    crates.io application in the list, and make sure you or your organization is
    listed in the "Organization access" list with a green check mark. If there's
    a button labeled `Grant` or `Request`, you should grant the access or
    request the org owner to do so.

    # Environment Variables

    Cargo sets and reads a number of environment variables which your code can detect
    or override. Here is a list of the variables Cargo sets, organized by when it interacts
    with them:

    ## Environment variables Cargo reads

    You can override these environment variables to change Cargo's behavior on your
    system:

    * `CARGO_LOG` --- Cargo uses the [`tracing`] crate to display debug log messages.
      The `CARGO_LOG` environment variable can be set to enable debug logging,
      with a value such as `trace`, `debug`, or `warn`.
      Usually it is only used during debugging. For more details refer to the
      [Debug logging].
    * `CARGO_HOME` --- Cargo maintains a local cache of the registry index and of
      git checkouts of crates. By default these are stored under `$HOME/.cargo`
      (`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo` on Windows), but this variable overrides the
      location of this directory. Once a crate is cached it is not removed by the
      clean command.
      For more details refer to the [guide](../guide/cargo-home.md).
    * `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` --- Location of where to place all generated artifacts,
      relative to the current working directory. See [`build.target-dir`] to set
      via config.
    * `CARGO` --- If set, Cargo will forward this value instead of setting it
      to its own auto-detected path when it builds crates and when it
      executes build scripts and external subcommands. This value is not
      directly executed by Cargo, and should always point at a command that
      behaves exactly like `cargo`, as that's what users of the variable
      will be expecting.
    * `RUSTC` --- Instead of running `rustc`, Cargo will execute this specified
      compiler instead. See [`build.rustc`] to set via config.
    * `RUSTC_WRAPPER` --- Instead of simply running `rustc`, Cargo will execute this
      specified wrapper, passing as its command-line arguments the rustc
      invocation, with the first argument being the path to the actual rustc.
      Useful to set up a build cache tool such as `sccache`. See
      [`build.rustc-wrapper`] to set via config. Setting this to the empty string
      overwrites the config and resets cargo to not use a wrapper.
    * `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` --- Instead of simply running `rustc`, for workspace members Cargo will
      execute this specified wrapper, passing as its command-line arguments the rustc invocation, with
      the first argument being the path to the actual rustc. When building a single-package project
      without workspaces, that package is considered to be the workspace. It affects the filename hash
      so that artifacts produced by the wrapper are cached separately. See
      [`build.rustc-workspace-wrapper`] to set via config. Setting this to the empty string overwrites
      the config and resets cargo to not use a wrapper for workspace members. If both `RUSTC_WRAPPER`
      and `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` are set, then they will be nested: the final invocation is
      `$RUSTC_WRAPPER $RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER $RUSTC`.
    * `RUSTDOC` --- Instead of running `rustdoc`, Cargo will execute this specified
      `rustdoc` instance instead. See [`build.rustdoc`] to set via config.
    * `RUSTDOCFLAGS` --- A space-separated list of custom flags to pass to all `rustdoc`
      invocations that Cargo performs. In contrast with [`cargo rustdoc`], this is
      useful for passing a flag to *all* `rustdoc` instances. See
      [`build.rustdocflags`] for some more ways to set flags. This string is
      split by whitespace; for a more robust encoding of multiple arguments,
      see `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTDOCFLAGS`.
    * `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTDOCFLAGS` ---  A list of custom flags separated by `0x1f`
      (ASCII Unit Separator) to pass to all `rustdoc` invocations that Cargo performs.
    * `RUSTFLAGS` --- A space-separated list of custom flags to pass to all compiler
      invocations that Cargo performs. In contrast with [`cargo rustc`], this is
      useful for passing a flag to *all* compiler instances. See
      [`build.rustflags`] for some more ways to set flags. This string is
      split by whitespace; for a more robust encoding of multiple arguments,
      see `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`.
    * `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` --- A list of custom flags separated by `0x1f`
      (ASCII Unit Separator) to pass to all compiler invocations that Cargo performs.
    * `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` --- If this is set to 1 then Cargo will force [incremental
      compilation] to be enabled for the current compilation, and when set to 0 it
      will force disabling it. If this env var isn't present then cargo's defaults
      will otherwise be used. See also [`build.incremental`] config value.

    Documentation text:

    ## Environment variables Cargo sets for crates

    Cargo exposes these environment variables to your crate when it is compiled.
    Note that this applies for running binaries with `cargo run` and `cargo test`
    as well. To get the value of any of these variables in a Rust program, do
    this:

    ```rust,ignore
    let version = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");
    ```

    `version` will now contain the value of `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.

    Note that if one of these values is not provided in the manifest, the
    corresponding environment variable is set to the empty string, `""`.

    * `CARGO` --- Path to the `cargo` binary performing the build.
    * `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` --- The directory containing the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_MANIFEST_PATH` --- The path to the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` --- The full version of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MAJOR` --- The major version of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MINOR` --- The minor version of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PATCH` --- The patch version of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE` --- The pre-release version of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_AUTHORS` --- Colon separated list of authors from the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_NAME` --- The name of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_DESCRIPTION` --- The description from the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_HOMEPAGE` --- The home page from the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_REPOSITORY` --- The repository from the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE` --- The license from the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE_FILE` --- The license file from the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_PKG_RUST_VERSION` --- The Rust version from the manifest of your package.
      Note that this is the minimum Rust version supported by the package, not the
      current Rust version.
    * `CARGO_PKG_README` --- Path to the README file of your package.
    * `CARGO_CRATE_NAME` --- The name of the crate that is currently being compiled. It is the name of the [Cargo target] with `-` converted to `_`, such as the name of the library, binary, example, integration test, or benchmark.
    * `CARGO_BIN_NAME` --- The name of the binary that is currently being compiled.
      Only set for [binaries] or binary [examples]. This name does not include any
      file extension, such as `.exe`.
    * `OUT_DIR` --- If the package has a build script, this is set to the folder
      where the build script should place its output. See below for more information.
      (Only set during compilation.)
    * `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` --- The absolute path to a binary target's executable.
      This is only set when building an [integration test] or benchmark. This may
      be used with the [`env` macro] to find the executable to run for testing
      purposes. The `<name>` is the name of the binary target, exactly as-is. For
      example, `CARGO_BIN_EXE_my-program` for a binary named `my-program`.
      Binaries are automatically built when the test is built, unless the binary
      has required features that are not enabled.
    * `CARGO_PRIMARY_PACKAGE` --- This environment variable will be set if the
      package being built is primary. Primary packages are the ones the user
      selected on the command-line, either with `-p` flags or the defaults based
      on the current directory and the default workspace members.
      This variable will not be set when building dependencies,
      unless a dependency is also a workspace member that was also selected on the command-line.
      This is only set when compiling the package (not when running binaries or tests).
    * `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR` --- Only set when building [integration test] or benchmark code.
      This is a path to a directory inside the target directory
      where integration tests or benchmarks are free to put any data needed by
      the tests/benches. Cargo initially creates this directory but doesn't
      manage its content in any way, this is the responsibility of the test code.

    [binaries]: cargo-targets.md#binaries
    [examples]: cargo-targets.md#examples
    [integration test]: cargo-targets.md#integration-tests
    [`env` macro]: ../../std/macro.env.html

    ### Dynamic library paths

    Cargo also sets the dynamic library path when compiling and running binaries
    with commands like `cargo run` and `cargo test`. This helps with locating
    shared libraries that are part of the build process. The variable name depends
    on the platform:

    * Windows: `PATH`
    * macOS: `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`
    * Unix: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
    * AIX: `LIBPATH`

    The value is extended from the existing value when Cargo starts. macOS has
    special consideration where if `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` is not already
    set, it will add the default `$HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib`.

    Cargo includes the following paths:

    * Search paths included from any build script with the [`rustc-link-search`
      instruction](build-scripts.md#rustc-link-search). Paths outside of the
      `target` directory are removed. It is the responsibility of the user running
      Cargo to properly set the environment if additional libraries on the system
      are needed in the search path.
    * The base output directory, such as `target/debug`, and the "deps" directory.
      This is mostly for support of proc-macros.
    * The rustc sysroot library path. This generally is not important to most
      users.

    Documentation text:

    ## Environment variables Cargo sets for build scripts

    Cargo sets several environment variables when build scripts are run. Because these variables
    are not yet set when the build script is compiled, the above example using `env!` won't work
    and instead you'll need to retrieve the values when the build script is run:

    ```rust,ignore
    use std::env;
    let out_dir = env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap();
    ```

    `out_dir` will now contain the value of `OUT_DIR`.

    * `CARGO` --- Path to the `cargo` binary performing the build.
    * `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` --- The directory containing the manifest for the package
      being built (the package containing the build script). Also note that this is
      the value of the current working directory of the build script when it starts.
    * `CARGO_MANIFEST_PATH` --- The path to the manifest of your package.
    * `CARGO_MANIFEST_LINKS` --- the manifest `links` value.
    * `CARGO_MAKEFLAGS` --- Contains parameters needed for Cargo's [jobserver]
      implementation to parallelize subprocesses. Rustc or cargo invocations from
      build.rs can already read `CARGO_MAKEFLAGS`, but GNU Make requires the flags
      to be specified either directly as arguments, or through the `MAKEFLAGS`
      environment variable. Currently Cargo doesn't set the `MAKEFLAGS` variable,
      but it's free for build scripts invoking GNU Make to set it to the contents
      of `CARGO_MAKEFLAGS`.
    * `CARGO_FEATURE_<name>` --- For each activated feature of the package being built,
      this environment variable will be present where `<name>` is the name of the
      feature uppercased and having `-` translated to `_`.
    * `CARGO_CFG_<cfg>` --- For each [configuration option][configuration] of the
      package being built, this environment variable will contain the value of the
      configuration, where `<cfg>` is the name of the configuration uppercased and
      having `-` translated to `_`. Boolean configurations are present if they are
      set, and not present otherwise. Configurations with multiple values are
      joined to a single variable with the values delimited by `,`. This includes
      values built-in to the compiler (which can be seen with `rustc --print=cfg`)
      and values set by build scripts and extra flags passed to `rustc` (such as
      those defined in `RUSTFLAGS`). Some examples of what these variables are:
        * `CARGO_CFG_FEATURE` --- Each activated feature of the package being built.
        * `CARGO_CFG_UNIX` --- Set on [unix-like platforms].
        * `CARGO_CFG_WINDOWS` --- Set on [windows-like platforms].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FAMILY=unix,wasm` --- The [target family].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS=macos` --- The [target operating system].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` --- The CPU [target architecture].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_VENDOR=apple` --- The [target vendor].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ENV=gnu` --- The [target environment] ABI.
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ABI=eabihf` --- The [target ABI].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_POINTER_WIDTH=64` --- The CPU [pointer width].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ENDIAN=little` --- The CPU [target endianness].
        * `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE=mmx,sse` --- List of CPU [target features] enabled.
      > Note that different [target triples][Target Triple] have different sets of `cfg` values,
      > hence variables present in one target triple might not be available in the other.
      >
      > Some cfg values like `debug_assertions` and `test` are not available.
    * `OUT_DIR` --- the folder in which all output and intermediate artifacts should
      be placed. This folder is inside the build directory for the package being built,
      and it is unique for the package in question.
    * `TARGET` --- the target triple that is being compiled for. Native code should be
      compiled for this triple. See the [Target Triple] description for more information.
    * `HOST` --- the host triple of the Rust compiler.
    * `NUM_JOBS` --- the parallelism specified as the top-level parallelism. This can
      be useful to pass a `-j` parameter to a system like `make`. Note that care
      should be taken when interpreting this environment variable. For historical
      purposes this is still provided but recent versions of Cargo, for example, do
      not need to run `make -j`, and instead can set the `MAKEFLAGS` env var to the
      content of `CARGO_MAKEFLAGS` to activate the use of Cargo's GNU Make compatible
      [jobserver] for sub-make invocations.
    * `OPT_LEVEL`, `DEBUG` --- values of the corresponding variables for the profile currently being built.
    * `PROFILE` --- `release` for release builds, `debug` for other builds. This is
      determined based on if the [profile] inherits from the [`dev`] or
      [`release`] profile. Using this environment variable is not recommended.
      Using other environment variables like `OPT_LEVEL` provide a more correct
      view of the actual settings being used.
    * `DEP_<name>_<key>` --- For more information about this set of environment variables,
      see build script documentation about [`links`][links].
    * `RUSTC`, `RUSTDOC` --- the compiler and documentation generator that Cargo has
      resolved to use, passed to the build script so it might use it as well.
    * `RUSTC_WRAPPER` --- the `rustc` wrapper, if any, that Cargo is using. See [`build.rustc-wrapper`].
    * `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` --- the `rustc` wrapper, if any, that Cargo is using
      for workspace members. See [`build.rustc-workspace-wrapper`].
    * `RUSTC_LINKER` --- The path to the linker binary that Cargo has resolved to use
      for the current target, if specified. The linker can be changed by editing
      `.cargo/config.toml`; see the documentation about [cargo configuration][cargo-config]
      for more information.
    * `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` --- extra flags that Cargo invokes `rustc` with,
      separated by a `0x1f` character (ASCII Unit Separator). See
      [`build.rustflags`]. Note that since Rust 1.55, `RUSTFLAGS` is removed from
      the environment; scripts should use `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` instead.
    * `CARGO_PKG_<var>` --- The package information variables, with the same names and values as are [provided during crate building][variables set for crates].

    ## Environment variables Cargo sets for 3rd party subcommands

    Cargo exposes this environment variable to 3rd party subcommands
    (ie. programs named `cargo-foobar` placed in `$PATH`):

    * `CARGO` --- Path to the `cargo` binary performing the build.
    * `CARGO_MAKEFLAGS` --- Contains parameters needed for Cargo's [jobserver]
      implementation to parallelize subprocesses.
      This is set only when Cargo detects the existence of a jobserver.

    For extended information about your environment you may run `cargo metadata`.

    # Build Scripts

    Some packages need to compile third-party non-Rust code, for example C
    libraries. Other packages need to link to C libraries which can either be
    located on the system or possibly need to be built from source. Others still
    need facilities for functionality such as code generation before building (think
    parser generators).

    Cargo does not aim to replace other tools that are well-optimized for these
    tasks, but it does integrate with them with custom build scripts. Placing a
    file named `build.rs` in the root of a package will cause Cargo to compile
    that script and execute it just before building the package.

    ```rust,ignore
    // Example custom build script.
    fn main() {
        // Tell Cargo that if the given file changes, to rerun this build script.
        println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=src/hello.c");
        // Use the `cc` crate to build a C file and statically link it.
        cc::Build::new()
            .file("src/hello.c")
            .compile("hello");
    }
    ```

    Some example use cases of build scripts are:

    * Building a bundled C library.
    * Finding a C library on the host system.
    * Generating a Rust module from a specification.
    * Performing any platform-specific configuration needed for the crate.

    The sections below describe how build scripts work, and the [examples
    chapter](build-script-examples.md) shows a variety of examples on how to write
    scripts.

    > Note: The [`package.build` manifest key](manifest.md#the-build-field) can be
    > used to change the name of the build script, or disable it entirely.

    ## Life Cycle of a Build Script

    Just before a package is built, Cargo will compile a build script into an
    executable (if it has not already been built). It will then run the script,
    which may perform any number of tasks. The script may communicate with Cargo
    by printing specially formatted commands prefixed with `cargo::` to stdout.

    The build script will be rebuilt if any of its source files or dependencies
    change.

    By default, Cargo will re-run the build script if any of the files in the
    package changes. Typically it is best to use the `rerun-if` commands,
    described in the [change detection](#change-detection) section below, to
    narrow the focus of what triggers a build script to run again.

    Once the build script successfully finishes executing, the rest of the package
    will be compiled. Scripts should exit with a non-zero exit code to halt the
    build if there is an error, in which case the build script's output will be
    displayed on the terminal.

    ## Inputs to the Build Script

    When the build script is run, there are a number of inputs to the build script,
    all passed in the form of [environment variables][build-env].

    In addition to environment variables, the build script’s current directory is
    the source directory of the build script’s package.

Scripts\nshould not modify any files outside of that directory.\n\nBuild scripts communicate with Cargo by printing to stdout. Cargo will\ninterpret each line that starts with `cargo::` as an instruction that will\ninfluence compilation of the package. All other lines are ignored.\n\n> The order of `cargo::` instructions printed by the build script *may*\n> affect the order of arguments that `cargo` passes to `rustc`.

If you would like to see the output directly in your terminal,\ninvoke Cargo as \"very verbose\" with the `-vv` flag. This only happens when the\nbuild script is run. If Cargo determines nothing has changed, it will not\nre-run the script, see [change detection](#change-detection) below for more.\n\nAll the lines printed to stdout by a build script are written to a file like\n`target/debug/build/<pkg>/output` (the precise location may depend on your\nconfiguration). The stderr output is also saved in that same directory.\n\nThe following is a summary of the instructions that Cargo recognizes, with each\none detailed below.\n\n* [`cargo::rerun-if-changed=PATH`](#rerun-if-changed) --- Tells Cargo when to\n  re-run the script.\n* [`cargo::rerun-if-env-changed=VAR`](#rerun-if-env-changed) --- Tells Cargo when\n  to re-run the script.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-arg=FLAG`](#rustc-link-arg) --- Passes custom flags to a\n  linker for benchmarks, binaries, `cdylib` crates, examples, and tests.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-arg-cdylib=FLAG`](#rustc-cdylib-link-arg) --- Passes custom\n  flags to a linker for cdylib crates.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-arg-bin=BIN=FLAG`](#rustc-link-arg-bin) --- Passes custom\n  flags to a linker for the binary `BIN`.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-arg-bins=FLAG`](#rustc-link-arg-bins) --- Passes custom\n  flags to a linker for binaries.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-arg-tests=FLAG`](#rustc-link-arg-tests) --- Passes custom\n  flags to a linker for tests.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-arg-examples=FLAG`](#rustc-link-arg-examples) --- Passes custom\n  flags to a linker for examples.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-arg-benches=FLAG`](#rustc-link-arg-benches) --- Passes custom\n  flags to a linker for benchmarks.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-lib=LIB`](#rustc-link-lib) --- Adds a library to\n  link.\n* [`cargo::rustc-link-search=[KIND=]PATH`](#rustc-link-search) --- Adds to the\n  library search path.\n* [`cargo::rustc-flags=FLAGS`](#rustc-flags) --- Passes certain flags to the\n  compiler.\n* [`cargo::rustc-cfg=KEY[=\"VALUE\"]`](#rustc-cfg) --- Enables compile-time `cfg`\n  settings.\n* [`cargo::rustc-check-cfg=CHECK_CFG`](#rustc-check-cfg) -- Register custom `cfg`s as\n  expected for compile-time checking of configs. \n* [`cargo::rustc-env=VAR=VALUE`](#rustc-env) --- Sets an environment variable.\n- [`cargo::error=MESSAGE`](#cargo-error) --- Displays an error on the terminal.\n* [`cargo::warning=MESSAGE`](#cargo-warning) --- Displays a warning on the\n  terminal.\n* [`cargo::metadata=KEY=VALUE`](#the-links-manifest-key) --- Metadata, used by `links`\n  scripts.\n\n> **MSRV:** 1.77 is required for `cargo::KEY=VALUE` syntax.\n> To support older versions, use the `cargo:KEY=VALUE` syntax.\n\n### `cargo::rustc-link-arg=FLAG` {#rustc-link-arg}\n\nThe `rustc-link-arg` instruction tells Cargo to pass the [`-C link-arg=FLAG`\noption][link-arg] to the compiler, but only when building supported targets\n(benchmarks, binaries, `cdylib` crates, examples, and tests).

Its usage is highly platform specific. It is useful\nto set the shared library version or the runtime-path.\n\nFor historical reasons, the `cargo::rustc-cdylib-link-arg` form is an alias\nfor `cargo::rustc-link-arg-cdylib`, and has the same meaning.\n\n### `cargo::rustc-link-arg-bin=BIN=FLAG` {#rustc-link-arg-bin}\n\nThe `rustc-link-arg-bin` instruction tells Cargo to pass the [`-C\nlink-arg=FLAG` option][link-arg] to the compiler, but only when building\nthe binary target with name `BIN`. Its usage is highly platform specific. It is useful\nto set a linker script or other linker options.\n\n### `cargo::rustc-link-arg-bins=FLAG` {#rustc-link-arg-bins}\n\nThe `rustc-link-arg-bins` instruction tells Cargo to pass the [`-C\nlink-arg=FLAG` option][link-arg] to the compiler, but only when building a\nbinary target.

This is typically used to link a\nnative library using [FFI].\n\nThe `LIB` string is passed directly to rustc, so it supports any syntax that\n`-l` does. \\\nCurrently the fully supported syntax for `LIB` is `[KIND[:MODIFIERS]=]NAME[:RENAME]`.\n\nThe `-l` flag is only passed to the library target of the package, unless\nthere is no library target, in which case it is passed to all targets. This is\ndone because all other targets have an implicit dependency on the library\ntarget, and the given library to link should only be included once. This means\nthat if a package has both a library and a binary target, the *library* has\naccess to the symbols from the given lib, and the binary should access them\nthrough the library target's public API.\n\nThe optional `KIND` may be one of `dylib`, `static`, or `framework`. See the\n[rustc book][option-link] for more detail.\n\n[option-link]: ../../rustc/command-line-arguments.md#option-l-link-lib\n[FFI]: ../../nomicon/ffi.md\n\n### `cargo::rustc-link-search=[KIND=]PATH` {#rustc-link-search}\n\nThe `rustc-link-search` instruction tells Cargo to pass the [`-L`\nflag][option-search] to the compiler to add a directory to the library search\npath.\n\nThe optional `KIND` may be one of `dependency`, `crate`, `native`,\n`framework`, or `all`. See the [rustc book][option-search] for more detail.\n\nThese paths are also added to the [dynamic library search path environment\nvariable](environment-variables.md#dynamic-library-paths) if they are within\nthe `OUT_DIR`. Depending on this behavior is discouraged since this makes it\ndifficult to use the resulting binary. In general, it is best to avoid\ncreating dynamic libraries in a build script (using existing system libraries\nis fine).\n\n[option-search]: ../../rustc/command-line-arguments.md#option-l-search-path\n\n### `cargo::rustc-flags=FLAGS` {#rustc-flags}\n\nThe `rustc-flags` instruction tells Cargo to pass the given space-separated\nflags to the compiler. This only allows the `-l` and `-L` flags, and is\nequivalent to using [`rustc-link-lib`](#rustc-link-lib) and\n[`rustc-link-search`](#rustc-link-search).\n\n### `cargo::rustc-cfg=KEY[=\"VALUE\"]` {#rustc-cfg}\n\nThe `rustc-cfg` instruction tells Cargo to pass the given value to the\n[`--cfg` flag][option-cfg] to the compiler. This may be used for compile-time\ndetection of features to enable [conditional compilation]. Custom cfgs\nmust either be expected using the [`cargo::rustc-check-cfg`](#rustc-check-cfg)\ninstruction or usage will need to allow the [`unexpected_cfgs`][unexpected-cfgs]\nlint to avoid unexpected cfgs warnings.\n\nNote that this does *not* affect Cargo's dependency resolution. This cannot be\nused to enable an optional dependency, or enable other Cargo features.\n\nBe aware that [Cargo features] use the form `feature=\"foo\"`. `cfg` values\npassed with this flag are not restricted to that form, and may provide just a\nsingle identifier, or any arbitrary key/value pair. For example, emitting\n`cargo::rustc-cfg=abc` will then allow code to use `#[cfg(abc)]` (note the lack\nof `feature=`). Or an arbitrary key/value pair may be used with an `=` symbol\nlike `cargo::rustc-cfg=my_component=\"foo\"`. The key should be a Rust\nidentifier, the value should be a string.\n\n[cargo features]: features.md\n[conditional compilation]: ../../reference/conditional-compilation.md\n[option-cfg]: ../../rustc/command-line-arguments.md#option-cfg\n[unexpected-cfgs]: ../../rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.md#unexpected-cfgs\n\n### `cargo::rustc-check-cfg=CHECK_CFG` {#rustc-check-cfg}\n\nAdd to the list of expected config names and values that is used when checking\nthe _reachable_ cfg expressions with the [`unexpected_cfgs`][unexpected-cfgs] lint.\n\nThe syntax of `CHECK_CFG` mirrors the `rustc` [`--check-cfg` flag][option-check-cfg], see\n[Checking conditional configurations][checking-conditional-configurations] for more details.\n\nThe instruction can be used like this:\n\n```rust,no_run\n// build.rs\nprintln!(\"cargo::rustc-check-cfg=cfg(foo, values(\\\"bar\\\"))\");\nif foo_bar_condition {\n    println!(\"cargo::rustc-cfg=foo=\\\"bar\\\"\");\n}\n```\n\nNote that all possible cfgs should be defined, regardless of which cfgs are\ncurrently enabled. This includes all possible values of a given cfg name.\n\nIt is recommended to group the `cargo::rustc-check-cfg` and\n[`cargo::rustc-cfg`][option-cfg] instructions as closely as possible in order to\navoid typos, missing check-cfg, stale cfgs...\n\nSee also the\n[conditional compilation][conditional-compilation-example] example.\n\n> **MSRV:** Respected as of 1.80\n\n[checking-conditional-configurations]: ../../rustc/check-cfg.html\n[option-check-cfg]: ../../rustc/command-line-arguments.md#option-check-cfg\n[conditional-compilation-example]: build-script-examples.md#conditional-compilation\n\n### `cargo::rustc-env=VAR=VALUE` {#rustc-env}\n\nThe `rustc-env` instruction tells Cargo to set the given environment variable\nwhen compiling the package.

    ## Build Dependencies

    Build scripts are also allowed to have dependencies on other Cargo-based crates.
    Dependencies are declared through the `build-dependencies` section of the
    manifest.

    ```toml
    [build-dependencies]
    cc = "1.0.46"
    ```

    The build script **does not** have access to the dependencies listed in the
    `dependencies` or `dev-dependencies` section (they’re not built yet!). Also,
    build dependencies are not available to the package itself unless also
    explicitly added in the `[dependencies]` table.

    It is recommended to carefully consider each dependency you add, weighing
    against the impact on compile time, licensing, maintenance, etc. Cargo will
    attempt to reuse a dependency if it is shared between build dependencies and
    normal dependencies. However, this is not always possible, for example when
    cross-compiling, so keep that in consideration of the impact on compile time.

    ## Change Detection

    When rebuilding a package, Cargo does not necessarily know if the build script
    needs to be run again. By default, it takes a conservative approach of always
    re-running the build script if any file within the package is changed (or the
    list of files controlled by the [`exclude` and `include` fields]). For most
    cases, this is not a good choice, so it is recommended that every build script
    emit at least one of the `rerun-if` instructions (described below). If these
    are emitted, then Cargo will only re-run the script if the given value has
    changed. If Cargo is re-running the build scripts of your own crate or a
    dependency and you don't know why, see ["Why is Cargo rebuilding my code?" in the
    FAQ](../faq.md#why-is-cargo-rebuilding-my-code).

    [`exclude` and `include` fields]: manifest.md#the-exclude-and-include-fields

    ### `cargo::rerun-if-changed=PATH` {#rerun-if-changed}

    The `rerun-if-changed` instruction tells Cargo to re-run the build script if
    the file at the given path has changed. Currently, Cargo only uses the
    filesystem last-modified "mtime" timestamp to determine if the file has
    changed. It compares against an internal cached timestamp of when the build
    script last ran.

    If the path points to a directory, it will scan the entire directory for
    any modifications.

    If the build script inherently does not need to re-run under any circumstance,
    then emitting `cargo::rerun-if-changed=build.rs` is a simple way to prevent it
    from being re-run (otherwise, the default if no `rerun-if` instructions are
    emitted is to scan the entire package directory for changes). Cargo
    automatically handles whether or not the script itself needs to be recompiled,
    and of course the script will be re-run after it has been recompiled.
    Otherwise, specifying `build.rs` is redundant and unnecessary.

    ### `cargo::rerun-if-env-changed=NAME` {#rerun-if-env-changed}

    The `rerun-if-env-changed` instruction tells Cargo to re-run the build script
    if the value of an environment variable of the given name has changed.

    Note that the environment variables here are intended for global environment
    variables like `CC` and such, it is not possible to use this for environment
    variables like `TARGET` that [Cargo sets for build scripts][build-env]. The
    environment variables in use are those received by `cargo` invocations, not
    those received by the executable of the build script.

    As of 1.46, using [`env!`][env-macro] and [`option_env!`][option-env-macro] in
    source code will automatically detect changes and trigger rebuilds.
    `rerun-if-env-changed` is no longer needed for variables already referenced by
    these macros.

    ## `*-sys` Packages

    Some Cargo packages that link to system libraries have a naming convention of
    having a `-sys` suffix. Any package named `foo-sys` should provide two major
    pieces of functionality:

    * The library crate should link to the native library `libfoo`. This will often
      probe the current system for `libfoo` before resorting to building from
      source.
    * The library crate should provide **declarations** for types and functions in
      `libfoo`, but **not** higher-level abstractions.

    The set of `*-sys` packages provides a common set of dependencies for linking
    to native libraries. There are a number of benefits earned from having this
    convention of native-library-related packages:

    * Common dependencies on `foo-sys` alleviates the rule about one package per
      value of `links`.
    * Other `-sys` packages can take advantage of the `DEP_NAME_KEY=value`
      environment variables to better integrate with other packages. See the
      ["Using another `sys` crate"][using-another-sys] example.
    * A common dependency allows centralizing logic on discovering `libfoo` itself
      (or building it from source).
    * These dependencies are easily [overridable](#overriding-build-scripts).

    It is common to have a companion package without the `-sys` suffix that
    provides a safe, high-level abstractions on top of the sys package. For
    example, the [`git2` crate] provides a high-level interface to the
    [`libgit2-sys` crate].

    ## Overriding Build Scripts

    If a manifest contains a `links` key, then Cargo supports overriding the build
    script specified with a custom library. The purpose of this functionality is to
    prevent running the build script in question altogether and instead supply the
    metadata ahead of time.

    To override a build script, place the following configuration in any acceptable [`config.toml`](config.md) file.

    ```toml
    [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.foo]
    rustc-link-lib = ["foo"]
    rustc-link-search = ["/path/to/foo"]
    rustc-flags = "-L /some/path"
    rustc-cfg = ['key="value"']
    rustc-env = {key = "value"}
    rustc-cdylib-link-arg = ["…"]
    metadata_key1 = "value"
    metadata_key2 = "value"
    ```

    With this configuration, if a package declares that it links to `foo` then the
    build script will **not** be compiled or run, and the metadata specified will
    be used instead.

    The `warning`, `rerun-if-changed`, and `rerun-if-env-changed` keys should not
    be used and will be ignored.

    ## Jobserver

    Cargo and `rustc` use the [jobserver protocol], developed for GNU make, to
    coordinate concurrency across processes. It is essentially a semaphore that
    controls the number of jobs running concurrently. The concurrency may be set
    with the `--jobs` flag, which defaults to the number of logical CPUs.

    Each build script inherits one job slot from Cargo, and should endeavor to
    only use one CPU while it runs. If the script wants to use more CPUs in
    parallel, it should use the [`jobserver` crate] to coordinate with Cargo.

    As an example, the [`cc` crate] may enable the optional `parallel` feature
    which will use the jobserver protocol to attempt to build multiple C files
    at the same time.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `profiles page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Profiles\n\nProfiles provide a way to alter the compiler settings, influencing things like\noptimizations and debugging symbols.\n\nCargo has 4 built-in profiles: `dev`, `release`, `test`, and `bench`. The\nprofile is automatically chosen based on which command is being run if a\nprofile is not specified on the command-line. In addition to the built-in\nprofiles, custom user-defined profiles can also be specified.\n\nProfile settings can be changed in [`Cargo.toml`](manifest.md) with the\n`[profile]` table. Within each named profile, individual settings can be changed\nwith key/value pairs like this:\n\n```toml\n[profile.dev]\nopt-level = 1               # Use slightly better optimizations.\noverflow-checks = false     # Disable integer overflow checks.\n```\n\nCargo only looks at the profile settings in the `Cargo.toml` manifest at the\nroot of the workspace. Profile settings defined in dependencies will be\nignored.\n\nAdditionally, profiles can be overridden from a [config] definition.\nSpecifying a profile in a config file or environment variable will override\nthe settings from `Cargo.toml`.\n\n[config]: config.md\n\n## Profile settings\n\nThe following is a list of settings that can be controlled in a profile.\n\n### opt-level\n\nThe `opt-level` setting controls the [`-C opt-level` flag] which controls the level\nof optimization. Higher optimization levels may produce faster runtime code at\nthe expense of longer compiler times. Higher levels may also change and\nrearrange the compiled code which may make it harder to use with a debugger.\n\nThe valid options are:\n\n* `0`: no optimizations\n* `1`: basic optimizations\n* `2`: some optimizations\n* `3`: all optimizations\n* `\"s\"`: optimize for binary size\n* `\"z\"`: optimize for binary size, but also turn off loop vectorization.\n\nIt is recommended to experiment with different levels to find the right\nbalance for your project. There may be surprising results, such as level `3`\nbeing slower than `2`, or the `\"s\"` and `\"z\"` levels not being necessarily\nsmaller. You may also want to reevaluate your settings over time as newer\nversions of `rustc` change optimization behavior.\n\nSee also [Profile Guided Optimization] for more advanced optimization\ntechniques.\n\n[`-C opt-level` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#opt-level\n[Profile Guided Optimization]: ../../rustc/profile-guided-optimization.html\n\n### debug\n\nThe `debug` setting controls the [`-C debuginfo` flag] which controls the\namount of debug information included in the compiled binary.\n\nThe valid options are:\n\n* `0`, `false`, or `\"none\"`: no debug info at all, default for [`release`](#release)\n* `\"line-directives-only\"`: line info directives only. For the nvptx* targets this enables [profiling]. For other use cases, `line-tables-only` is the better, more compatible choice.\n* `\"line-tables-only\"`: line tables only. Generates the minimal amount of debug info for backtraces with filename/line number info, but not anything else, i.e. no variable or function parameter info.\n* `1` or `\"limited\"`: debug info without type or variable-level information. Generates more detailed module-level info than `line-tables-only`.\n* `2`, `true`, or `\"full\"`: full debug info, default for [`dev`](#dev)\n\nFor more information on what each option does see `rustc`'s docs on [debuginfo].\n\nYou may wish to also configure the [`split-debuginfo`](#split-debuginfo) option\ndepending on your needs as well.\n\n> **MSRV:** 1.71 is required for `none`, `limited`, `full`, `line-directives-only`, and `line-tables-only`\n\n[`-C debuginfo` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#debuginfo\n[debuginfo]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#debuginfo\n[profiling]: https://reviews.llvm.org/D46061\n\n### split-debuginfo\n\nThe `split-debuginfo` setting controls the [`-C split-debuginfo` flag] which\ncontrols whether debug information, if generated, is either placed in the\nexecutable itself or adjacent to it.\n\nThis option is a string and acceptable values are the same as those the\n[compiler accepts][`-C split-debuginfo` flag]. The default value for this option\nis `unpacked` on macOS for profiles that have debug information otherwise\nenabled. Otherwise the default for this option is [documented with rustc][`-C\nsplit-debuginfo` flag] and is platform-specific. Some options are only\navailable on the [nightly channel]. The Cargo default may change in the future\nonce more testing has been performed, and support for DWARF is stabilized.\n\nBe aware that Cargo and rustc have different defaults for this option. This\noption exists to allow Cargo to experiment on different combinations of flags\nthus providing better debugging and developer experience.\n\n[nightly channel]: ../../book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html\n[`-C split-debuginfo` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#split-debuginfo\n\n### strip\n\nThe `strip` option controls the [`-C strip` flag], which directs rustc to\nstrip either symbols or debuginfo from a binary. This can be enabled like so:\n\n```toml\n[package]\n# ...\n\n[profile.release]\nstrip = \"debuginfo\"\n```\n\nPossible string values of `strip` are `\"none\"`, `\"debuginfo\"`, and `\"symbols\"`.\nThe default is `\"none\"`.\n\nYou can also configure this option with the boolean values `true` or `false`.\n`strip = true` is equivalent to `strip = \"symbols\"`. `strip = false` is\nequivalent to `strip = \"none\"` and disables `strip` completely.\n\n[`-C strip` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#strip\n\n### debug-assertions\n\nThe `debug-assertions` setting controls the [`-C debug-assertions` flag] which\nturns `cfg(debug_assertions)` [conditional compilation] on or off. Debug\nassertions are intended to include runtime validation which is only available\nin debug/development builds. These may be things that are too expensive or\notherwise undesirable in a release build. Debug assertions enables the\n[`debug_assert!` macro] in the standard library.\n\nThe valid options are:\n\n* `true`: enabled\n* `false`: disabled\n\n[`-C debug-assertions` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#debug-assertions\n[conditional compilation]: ../../reference/conditional-compilation.md#debug_assertions\n[`debug_assert!` macro]: ../../std/macro.debug_assert.html\n\n### overflow-checks\n\nThe `overflow-checks` setting controls the [`-C overflow-checks` flag] which\ncontrols the behavior of [runtime integer overflow]. When overflow-checks are\nenabled, a panic will occur on overflow.\n\nThe valid options are:\n\n* `true`: enabled\n* `false`: disabled\n\n[`-C overflow-checks` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#overflow-checks\n[runtime integer overflow]: ../../reference/expressions/operator-expr.md#overflow\n\n### lto\n\nThe `lto` setting controls `rustc`'s [`-C lto`], [`-C linker-plugin-lto`], and\n[`-C embed-bitcode`] options, which control LLVM's [link time optimizations].\nLTO can produce better optimized code, using whole-program analysis, at the cost\nof longer linking time.\n\nThe valid options are:\n\n* `false`: Performs \"thin local LTO\" which performs \"thin\" LTO on the local\n  crate only across its [codegen units](#codegen-units). No LTO is performed\n  if codegen units is 1 or [opt-level](#opt-level) is 0.\n* `true` or `\"fat\"`: Performs \"fat\" LTO which attempts to perform\n  optimizations across all crates within the dependency graph.\n* `\"thin\"`: Performs [\"thin\" LTO]. This is similar to \"fat\", but takes\n  substantially less time to run while still achieving performance gains\n  similar to \"fat\".\n* `\"off\"`: Disables LTO.\n\nSee the [linker-plugin-lto chapter] if you are interested in cross-language LTO.\nThis is not yet supported natively in Cargo, but can be performed via\n`RUSTFLAGS`.\n\n[`-C lto`]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#lto\n[link time optimizations]: https://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html\n[`-C linker-plugin-lto`]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-plugin-lto\n[`-C embed-bitcode`]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#embed-bitcode\n[linker-plugin-lto chapter]: ../../rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html\n[\"thin\" LTO]: http://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/thinlto-scalable-and-incremental-lto.html\n\n### panic\n\nThe `panic` setting controls the [`-C panic` flag] which controls which panic\nstrategy to use.\n\nThe valid options are:\n\n* `\"unwind\"`: Unwind the stack upon panic.\n* `\"abort\"`: Terminate the process upon panic.\n\nWhen set to `\"unwind\"`, the actual value depends on the default of the target\nplatform. For example, the NVPTX platform does not support unwinding, so it\nalways uses `\"abort\"`.\n\nTests, benchmarks, build scripts, and proc macros ignore the `panic` setting.\nThe `rustc` test harness currently requires `unwind` behavior. See the\n[`panic-abort-tests`] unstable flag which enables `abort` behavior.\n\nAdditionally, when using the `abort` strategy and building a test, all of the\ndependencies will also be forced to build with the `unwind` strategy.\n\n[`-C panic` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#panic\n[`panic-abort-tests`]: unstable.md#panic-abort-tests\n\n### incremental\n\nThe `incremental` setting controls the [`-C incremental` flag] which controls\nwhether or not incremental compilation is enabled. Incremental compilation\ncauses `rustc` to save additional information to disk which will be reused\nwhen recompiling the crate, improving re-compile times. The additional\ninformation is stored in the `target` directory.\n\nThe valid options are:\n\n* `true`: enabled\n* `false`: disabled\n\nIncremental compilation is only used for workspace members and \"path\"\ndependencies.\n\nThe incremental value can be overridden globally with the `CARGO_INCREMENTAL`\n[environment variable] or the [`build.incremental`] config variable.\n\n[`-C incremental` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#incremental\n[environment variable]: environment-variables.md\n[`build.incremental`]: config.md#buildincremental\n\n### codegen-units\n\nThe `codegen-units` setting controls the [`-C codegen-units` flag] which\ncontrols how many \"code generation units\" a crate will be split into. More\ncode generation units allows more of a crate to be processed in parallel\npossibly reducing compile time, but may produce slower code.\n\nThis option takes an integer greater than 0.\n\nThe default is 256 for [incremental](#incremental) builds, and 16 for\nnon-incremental builds.\n\n[`-C codegen-units` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#codegen-units\n\n### rpath\n\nThe `rpath` setting controls the [`-C rpath` flag] which controls\nwhether or not [`rpath`] is enabled.\n\n[`-C rpath` flag]: ../../rustc/codegen-options/index.html#rpath\n[`rpath`]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath\n\n## Default profiles\n\n### dev\n\nThe `dev` profile is used for normal development and debugging. It is the\ndefault for build commands like [`cargo build`], and is used for `cargo install --debug`.\n\nThe default settings for the `dev` profile are:\n\n```toml\n[profile.dev]\nopt-level = 0\ndebug = true\nsplit-debuginfo = '...'  # Platform-specific.\nstrip = \"none\"\ndebug-assertions = true\noverflow-checks = true\nlto = false\npanic = 'unwind'\nincremental = true\ncodegen-units = 256\nrpath = false\n```\n\n### release\n\nThe `release` profile is intended for optimized artifacts used for releases\nand in production. This profile is used when the `--release` flag is used, and\nis the default for [`cargo install`].\n\nThe default settings for the `release` profile are:\n\n```toml\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 3\ndebug = false\nsplit-debuginfo = '...'  # Platform-specific.\nstrip = \"none\"\ndebug-assertions = false\noverflow-checks = false\nlto = false\npanic = 'unwind'\nincremental = false\ncodegen-units = 16\nrpath = false\n```\n\n### test\n\nThe `test` profile is the default profile used by [`cargo test`].\nThe `test` profile inherits the settings from the [`dev`](#dev) profile.\n\n### bench\n\nThe `bench` profile is the default profile used by [`cargo bench`].\nThe `bench` profile inherits the settings from the [`release`](#release) profile.\n\n### Build Dependencies\n\nTo compile quickly, all profiles, by default, do not optimize build\ndependencies (build scripts, proc macros, and their dependencies), and avoid\ncomputing debug info when a build dependency is not used as a runtime\ndependency. The default settings for build overrides are:\n\n```toml\n[profile.dev.build-override]\nopt-level = 0\ncodegen-units = 256\ndebug = false # when possible\n\n[profile.release.build-override]\nopt-level = 0\ncodegen-units = 256\n```\n\nHowever, if errors occur while running build dependencies, turning full debug\ninfo on will improve backtraces and debuggability when needed:\n\n```toml\ndebug = true\n```\n\nBuild dependencies otherwise inherit settings from the active profile in use, as\ndescribed in [Profile selection](#profile-selection).\n\n## Custom profiles\n\nIn addition to the built-in profiles, additional custom profiles can be\ndefined. These may be useful for setting up multiple workflows and build\nmodes. When defining a custom profile, you must specify the `inherits` key to\nspecify which profile the custom profile inherits settings from when the\nsetting is not specified.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to compare a normal release build with a\nrelease build with [LTO](#lto) optimizations, you can specify something like\nthe following in `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[profile.release-lto]\ninherits = \"release\"\nlto = true\n```\n\nThe `--profile` flag can then be used to choose this custom profile:\n\n```console\ncargo build --profile release-lto\n```\n\nThe output for each profile will be placed in a directory of the same name\nas the profile in the [`target` directory]. As in the example above, the\noutput would go into the `target/release-lto` directory.\n\n[`target` directory]: build-cache.md\n\n## Profile selection\n\nThe profile used depends on the command, the command-line flags like\n`--release` or `--profile`, and the package (in the case of\n[overrides](#overrides)). The default profile if none is specified is:\n\n| Command | Default Profile |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| [`cargo run`], [`cargo build`],<br>[`cargo check`], [`cargo rustc`] | [`dev` profile](#dev) |\n| [`cargo test`] | [`test` profile](#test)\n| [`cargo bench`] | [`bench` profile](#bench)\n| [`cargo install`] | [`release` profile](#release)\n\nYou can switch to a different profile using the `--profile=NAME` option which will used the given profile.\nThe `--release` flag is equivalent to `--profile=release`.\n\nThe selected profile applies to all Cargo targets, \nincluding [library](./cargo-targets.md#library),\n[binary](./cargo-targets.md#binaries), \n[example](./cargo-targets.md#examples), \n[test](./cargo-targets.md#tests), \nand [benchmark](./cargo-targets.md#benchmarks).\n\nThe profile for specific packages can be specified with\n[overrides](#overrides), described below.\n\n[`cargo bench`]: ../commands/cargo-bench.md\n[`cargo build`]: ../commands/cargo-build.md\n[`cargo check`]: ../commands/cargo-check.md\n[`cargo install`]: ../commands/cargo-install.md\n[`cargo run`]: ../commands/cargo-run.md\n[`cargo rustc`]: ../commands/cargo-rustc.md\n[`cargo test`]: ../commands/cargo-test.md\n\n## Overrides\n\nProfile settings can be overridden for specific packages and build-time\ncrates. To override the settings for a specific package, use the `package`\ntable to change the settings for the named package:\n\n```toml\n# The `foo` package will use the -Copt-level=3 flag.\n[profile.dev.package.foo]\nopt-level = 3\n```\n\nThe package name is actually a [Package ID Spec](pkgid-spec.md), so you can\ntarget individual versions of a package with syntax such as\n`[profile.dev.package.\"foo:2.1.0\"]`.\n\nTo override the settings for all dependencies (but not any workspace member),\nuse the `\"*\"` package name:\n\n```toml\n# Set the default for dependencies.\n[profile.dev.package.\"*\"]\nopt-level = 2\n```\n\nTo override the settings for build scripts, proc macros, and their\ndependencies, use the `build-override` table:\n\n```toml\n# Set the settings for build scripts and proc-macros.\n[profile.dev.build-override]\nopt-level = 3\n```\n\n> Note: When a dependency is both a normal dependency and a build dependency,\n> Cargo will try to only build it once when `--target` is not specified. When\n> using `build-override`, the dependency may need to be built twice, once as a\n> normal dependency and once with the overridden build settings. This may\n> increase initial build times.\n\nThe precedence for which value is used is done in the following order (first\nmatch wins):\n\n1. `[profile.dev.package.name]` --- A named package.\n2. `[profile.dev.package.\"*\"]` --- For any non-workspace member.\n3. `[profile.dev.build-override]` --- Only for build scripts, proc macros, and\n   their dependencies.\n4. `[profile.dev]` --- Settings in `Cargo.toml`.\n5. Default values built-in to Cargo.\n\nOverrides cannot specify the `panic`, `lto`, or `rpath` settings.\n\n### Overrides and generics\n\nThe location where generic code is instantiated will influence the\noptimization settings used for that generic code. This can cause subtle\ninteractions when using profile overrides to change the optimization level of\na specific crate. If you attempt to raise the optimization level of a\ndependency which defines generic functions, those generic functions may not be\noptimized when used in your local crate. This is because the code may be\ngenerated in the crate where it is instantiated, and thus may use the\noptimization settings of that crate.\n\nFor example, [nalgebra] is a library which defines vectors and matrices making\nheavy use of generic parameters. If your local code defines concrete nalgebra\ntypes like `Vector4<f64>` and uses their methods, the corresponding nalgebra\ncode will be instantiated and built within your crate. Thus, if you attempt to\nincrease the optimization level of `nalgebra` using a profile override, it may\nnot result in faster performance.\n\nFurther complicating the issue, `rustc` has some optimizations where it will\nattempt to share monomorphized generics between crates. If the opt-level is 2\nor 3, then a crate will not use monomorphized generics from other crates, nor\nwill it export locally defined monomorphized items to be shared with other\ncrates. When experimenting with optimizing dependencies for development,\nconsider trying opt-level 1, which will apply some optimizations while still\nallowing monomorphized items to be shared.\n\n[nalgebra]: https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra"

    # Specifying Dependencies

    Your crates can depend on other libraries from [crates.io] or other
    registries, `git` repositories, or subdirectories on your local file system.
    You can also temporarily override the location of a dependency --- for example,
    to be able to test out a bug fix in the dependency that you are working on
    locally. You can have different dependencies for different platforms, and
    dependencies that are only used during development. Let's take a look at how
    to do each of these.

    ## Specifying dependencies from crates.io

    Cargo is configured to look for dependencies on [crates.io] by default. Only
    the name and a version string are required in this case. In [the cargo
    guide](../guide/index.md), we specified a dependency on the `time` crate:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    time = "0.1.12"
    ```

    The version string `"0.1.12"` is called a [version requirement](#version-requirement-syntax).
    It specifies a range of versions that can be selected from when [resolving dependencies](resolver.md).
    In this case, `"0.1.12"` represents the version range `>=0.1.12, <0.2.0`.
    An update is allowed if it is within that range.
    In this case, if we ran `cargo update time`, cargo should
    update us to version `0.1.13` if it is the latest `0.1.z` release, but would not
    update us to `0.2.0`.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of specifying dependencies in a Cargo.toml file according to the documentation?
  documentationQuestion2: How can you specify a dependency on a crate from crates.io in a Cargo.toml file, and what is the significance of the version requirement syntax?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the effect of using a version requirement like "0.1.12" when specifying a dependency in Cargo.toml?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `specifying-dependencies page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n## Version requirement syntax\n\n### Default requirements\n\n**Default requirements** specify a minimum version with the ability to update to [SemVer] compatible versions.\nVersions are considered compatible if their left-most non-zero major/minor/patch component is the same.\nThis is different from [SemVer] which considers all pre-1.0.0 packages to be incompatible.\n\n`1.2.3` is an example of a default requirement.\n\n```notrust\n1.2.3  :=  >=1.2.3, <2.0.0\n1.2    :=  >=1.2.0, <2.0.0\n1      :=  >=1.0.0, <2.0.0\n0.2.3  :=  >=0.2.3, <0.3.0\n0.2    :=  >=0.2.0, <0.3.0\n0.0.3  :=  >=0.0.3, <0.0.4\n0.0    :=  >=0.0.0, <0.1.0\n0      :=  >=0.0.0, <1.0.0\n```\n\n### Caret requirements\n\n**Caret requirements** are the default version requirement strategy. \nThis version strategy allows [SemVer] compatible updates.\nThey are specified as version requirements with a leading caret (`^`).\n\n`^1.2.3` is an example of a caret requirement.\n\nLeaving off the caret is a simplified equivalent syntax to using caret requirements.\nWhile caret requirements are the default, it is recommended to use the\nsimplified syntax when possible.\n\n`log = \"^1.2.3\"` is exactly equivalent to `log = \"1.2.3\"`.\n\n### Tilde requirements\n\n**Tilde requirements** specify a minimal version with some ability to update.\nIf you specify a major, minor, and patch version or only a major and minor\nversion, only patch-level changes are allowed. If you only specify a major\nversion, then minor- and patch-level changes are allowed.\n\n`~1.2.3` is an example of a tilde requirement.\n\n```notrust\n~1.2.3  := >=1.2.3, <1.3.0\n~1.2    := >=1.2.0, <1.3.0\n~1      := >=1.0.0, <2.0.0\n```\n\n### Wildcard requirements\n\n**Wildcard requirements** allow for any version where the wildcard is\npositioned.\n\n`*`, `1.*` and `1.2.*` are examples of wildcard requirements.\n\n```notrust\n*     := >=0.0.0\n1.*   := >=1.0.0, <2.0.0\n1.2.* := >=1.2.0, <1.3.0\n```\n\n> **Note**: [crates.io] does not allow bare `*` versions.\n\n### Comparison requirements\n\n**Comparison requirements** allow manually specifying a version range or an\nexact version to depend on.\n\nHere are some examples of comparison requirements:\n\n```notrust\n>= 1.2.0\n> 1\n< 2\n= 1.2.3\n```\n\n<span id=\"multiple-requirements\"></span>\n### Multiple version requirements\n\nAs shown in the examples above, multiple version requirements can be\nseparated with a comma, e.g., `>= 1.2, < 1.5`.\n\n### Pre-releases\n\nVersion requirements exclude [pre-release versions](manifest.md#the-version-field), such as `1.0.0-alpha`,\nunless specifically asked for.\nFor example, if `1.0.0-alpha` of package\n`foo` is published, then a requirement of `foo = \"1.0\"` will *not* match, and\nwill return an error. The pre-release must be specified, such as `foo =\n\"1.0.0-alpha\"`.\nSimilarly [`cargo install`] will avoid pre-releases unless\nexplicitly asked to install one.\n\nCargo allows \"newer\" pre-releases to be used automatically. For example, if\n`1.0.0-beta` is published, then a requirement `foo = \"1.0.0-alpha\"` will allow\nupdating to the `beta` version.

    ## Specifying path dependencies

    Over time, our `hello_world` package from [the guide](../guide/index.md) has
    grown significantly in size! It’s gotten to the point that we probably want to
    split out a separate crate for others to use. To do this Cargo supports **path
    dependencies** which are typically sub-crates that live within one repository.
    Let’s start by making a new crate inside of our `hello_world` package:

    ```console
    # inside of hello_world/
    $ cargo new hello_utils
    ```

    This will create a new folder `hello_utils` inside of which a `Cargo.toml` and
    `src` folder are ready to be configured. To tell Cargo about this, open
    up `hello_world/Cargo.toml` and add `hello_utils` to your dependencies:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    hello_utils = { path = "hello_utils" }
    ```

    This tells Cargo that we depend on a crate called `hello_utils` which is found
    in the `hello_utils` folder, relative to the `Cargo.toml` file it’s written in.

    The next `cargo build` will automatically build `hello_utils` and
    all of its dependencies.

    ### No local path traversal

    The local paths must point to the exact folder with the dependency's `Cargo.toml`.
    Unlike with `git` dependencies, Cargo does not traverse local paths.
    For example, if `regex-lite` and `regex-syntax` are members of a
    locally cloned `rust-lang/regex` repo, they have to be referred to by the full path:

    ```toml
    # git key accepts the repo root URL and Cargo traverses the tree to find the crate
    [dependencies]
    regex-lite   = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git" }
    regex-syntax = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git" }

    # path key requires the member name to be included in the local path
    [dependencies]
    regex-lite   = { path = "../regex/regex-lite" }
    regex-syntax = { path = "../regex/regex-syntax" }
    ```

    ### Local paths in published crates

    Crates that use dependencies specified with only a path are not
    permitted on [crates.io].

    If we wanted to publish our `hello_world` crate,
    we would need to publish a version of `hello_utils` to [crates.io] as a separate crate
    and specify its version in the dependencies line of `hello_world`:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    hello_utils = { path = "hello_utils", version = "0.1.0" }
    ```

    The use of `path` and `version` keys together is explained in the [Multiple locations](#multiple-locations) section.

    > **Note**: [crates.io] does not allow packages to be published with
    > dependencies on code outside of [crates.io], except for [dev-dependencies].
    > See the [Multiple locations](#multiple-locations) section
    > for a fallback alternative for `git` and `path` dependencies.

    Documentation text:

    ## Multiple locations

    It is possible to specify both a registry version and a `git` or `path`
    location. The `git` or `path` dependency will be used locally (in which case
    the `version` is checked against the local copy), and when published to a
    registry like [crates.io], it will use the registry version. Other
    combinations are not allowed. Examples:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    # Uses `my-bitflags` when used locally, and uses
    # version 1.0 from crates.io when published.
    bitflags = { path = "my-bitflags", version = "1.0" }

    # Uses the given git repo when used locally, and uses
    # version 1.0 from crates.io when published.
    smallvec = { git = "https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec.git", version = "1.0" }

    # Note: if a version doesn't match, Cargo will fail to compile!
    ```

    One example where this can be useful is when you have split up a library into
    multiple packages within the same workspace. You can then use `path`
    dependencies to point to the local packages within the workspace to use the
    local version during development, and then use the [crates.io] version once it
    is published. This is similar to specifying an
    [override](overriding-dependencies.md), but only applies to this one
    dependency declaration.

    ## Platform specific dependencies

    Platform-specific dependencies take the same format, but are listed under a
    `target` section. Normally Rust-like [`#[cfg]`
    syntax](../../reference/conditional-compilation.html) will be used to define
    these sections:

    ```toml
    [target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]
    winhttp = "0.4.0"

    [target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]
    openssl = "1.0.1"

    [target.'cfg(target_arch = "x86")'.dependencies]
    native-i686 = { path = "native/i686" }

    [target.'cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")'.dependencies]
    native-x86_64 = { path = "native/x86_64" }
    ```

    Like with Rust, the syntax here supports the `not`, `any`, and `all` operators
    to combine various cfg name/value pairs.

    If you want to know which cfg targets are available on your platform, run
    `rustc --print=cfg` from the command line. If you want to know which `cfg`
    targets are available for another platform, such as 64-bit Windows,
    run `rustc --print=cfg --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

    Unlike in your Rust source code, you cannot use
    `[target.'cfg(feature = "fancy-feature")'.dependencies]` to add dependencies
    based on optional features. Use [the `[features]` section](features.md)
    instead:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    foo = { version = "1.0", optional = true }
    bar = { version = "1.0", optional = true }

    [features]
    fancy-feature = ["foo", "bar"]
    ```

    The same applies to `cfg(debug_assertions)`, `cfg(test)` and `cfg(proc_macro)`.
    These values will not work as expected and will always have the default value
    returned by `rustc --print=cfg`.
    There is currently no way to add dependencies based on these configuration values.

    In addition to `#[cfg]` syntax, Cargo also supports listing out the full target
    the dependencies would apply to:

    ```toml
    [target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.dependencies]
    winhttp = "0.4.0"

    [target.i686-unknown-linux-gnu.dependencies]
    openssl = "1.0.1"
    ```

    ### Custom target specifications

    If you’re using a custom target specification (such as `--target
    foo/bar.json`), use the base filename without the `.json` extension:

    ```toml
    [target.bar.dependencies]
    winhttp = "0.4.0"

    [target.my-special-i686-platform.dependencies]
    openssl = "1.0.1"
    native = { path = "native/i686" }
    ```

    > **Note**: Custom target specifications are not usable on the stable channel.

    ## Development dependencies

    You can add a `[dev-dependencies]` section to your `Cargo.toml` whose format
    is equivalent to `[dependencies]`:

    ```toml
    [dev-dependencies]
    tempdir = "0.3"
    ```

    Dev-dependencies are not used when compiling
    a package for building, but are used for compiling tests, examples, and
    benchmarks.

    These dependencies are *not* propagated to other packages which depend on this
    package.

    You can also have target-specific development dependencies by using
    `dev-dependencies` in the target section header instead of `dependencies`. For
    example:

    ```toml
    [target.'cfg(unix)'.dev-dependencies]
    mio = "0.0.1"
    ```

    > **Note**: When a package is published, only dev-dependencies that specify a
    > `version` will be included in the published crate. For most use cases,
    > dev-dependencies are not needed when published, though some users (like OS
    > packagers) may want to run tests within a crate, so providing a `version` if
    > possible can still be beneficial.

    ## Build dependencies

    You can depend on other Cargo-based crates for use in your build scripts.
    Dependencies are declared through the `build-dependencies` section of the
    manifest:

    ```toml
    [build-dependencies]
    cc = "1.0.3"
    ```


    You can also have target-specific build dependencies by using
    `build-dependencies` in the target section header instead of `dependencies`. For
    example:

    ```toml
    [target.'cfg(unix)'.build-dependencies]
    cc = "1.0.3"
    ```

    In this case, the dependency will only be built when the host platform matches the
    specified target.

    The build script **does not** have access to the dependencies listed
    in the `dependencies` or `dev-dependencies` section. Build
    dependencies will likewise not be available to the package itself
    unless listed under the `dependencies` section as well. A package
    itself and its build script are built separately, so their
    dependencies need not coincide. Cargo is kept simpler and cleaner by
    using independent dependencies for independent purposes.

    ## Choosing features

    If a package you depend on offers conditional features, you can
    specify which to use:

    ```toml
    [dependencies.awesome]
    version = "1.3.5"
    default-features = false # do not include the default features, and optionally
                             # cherry-pick individual features
    features = ["secure-password", "civet"]
    ```

    More information about features can be found in the [features
    chapter](features.md#dependency-features).

    ## Renaming dependencies in `Cargo.toml`

    When writing a `[dependencies]` section in `Cargo.toml` the key you write for a
    dependency typically matches up to the name of the crate you import from in the
    code. For some projects, though, you may wish to reference the crate with a
    different name in the code regardless of how it's published on crates.io. For
    example you may wish to:

    * Avoid the need to  `use foo as bar` in Rust source.
    * Depend on multiple versions of a crate.
    * Depend on crates with the same name from different registries.

    To support this Cargo supports a `package` key in the `[dependencies]` section
    of which package should be depended on:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "mypackage"
    version = "0.0.1"

    [dependencies]
    foo = "0.1"
    bar = { git = "https://github.com/example/project.git", package = "foo" }
    baz = { version = "0.1", registry = "custom", package = "foo" }
    ```

    In this example, three crates are now available in your Rust code:

    ```rust,ignore
    extern crate foo; // crates.io
    extern crate bar; // git repository
    extern crate baz; // registry `custom`
    ```

    All three of these crates have the package name of `foo` in their own
    `Cargo.toml`, so we're explicitly using the `package` key to inform Cargo that
    we want the `foo` package even though we're calling it something else locally.
    The `package` key, if not specified, defaults to the name of the dependency
    being requested.

    Note that if you have an optional dependency like:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bar = { version = "0.1", package = 'foo', optional = true }
    ```

    you're depending on the crate `foo` from crates.io, but your crate has a `bar`
    feature instead of a `foo` feature. That is, names of features take after the
    name of the dependency, not the package name, when renamed.

    Enabling transitive dependencies works similarly, for example we could add the
    following to the above manifest:

    ```toml
    [features]
    log-debug = ['bar/log-debug'] # using 'foo/log-debug' would be an error!
    ```

    ## Inheriting a dependency from a workspace

    Dependencies can be inherited from a workspace by specifying the
    dependency in the workspace's [`[workspace.dependencies]`][workspace.dependencies] table.
    After that, add it to the `[dependencies]` table with `workspace = true`.

    Along with the `workspace` key, dependencies can also include these keys:
    - [`optional`][optional]: Note that the`[workspace.dependencies]` table is not allowed to specify `optional`.
    - [`features`][features]: These are additive with the features declared in the `[workspace.dependencies]`

    Other than `optional` and `features`, inherited dependencies cannot use any other
    dependency key (such as `version` or `default-features`).

    Dependencies in the `[dependencies]`, `[dev-dependencies]`, `[build-dependencies]`, and
    `[target."...".dependencies]` sections support the ability to reference the
    `[workspace.dependencies]` definition of dependencies.

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "bar"
    version = "0.2.0"

    [dependencies]
    regex = { workspace = true, features = ["unicode"] }

Here is some text copied from the `workspaces page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Workspaces\n\nA *workspace* is a collection of one or more packages, called *workspace\nmembers*, that are managed together.\n\nThe key points of workspaces are:\n\n* Common commands can run across all workspace members, like `cargo check --workspace`.\n* All packages share a common [`Cargo.lock`] file which resides in the\n  *workspace root*.\n* All packages share a common [output directory], which defaults to a\n  directory named `target` in the *workspace root*.\n* Sharing package metadata, like with [`workspace.package`](#the-package-table).\n* The [`[patch]`][patch], [`[replace]`][replace] and [`[profile.*]`][profiles]\n  sections in `Cargo.toml` are only recognized in the *root* manifest, and\n  ignored in member crates' manifests.\n\nThe root `Cargo.toml` of a workspace supports the following sections:\n\n* [`[workspace]`](#the-workspace-section) --- Defines a workspace.\n  * [`resolver`](resolver.md#resolver-versions) --- Sets the dependency resolver to use.\n  * [`members`](#the-members-and-exclude-fields) --- Packages to include in the workspace.\n  * [`exclude`](#the-members-and-exclude-fields) --- Packages to exclude from the workspace.\n  * [`default-members`](#the-default-members-field) --- Packages to operate on when a specific package wasn't selected.\n  * [`package`](#the-package-table) --- Keys for inheriting in packages.\n  * [`dependencies`](#the-dependencies-table) --- Keys for inheriting in package dependencies.\n  * [`lints`](#the-lints-table) --- Keys for inheriting in package lints.\n  * [`metadata`](#the-metadata-table) --- Extra settings for external tools.\n* [`[patch]`](overriding-dependencies.md#the-patch-section) --- Override dependencies.\n* [`[replace]`](overriding-dependencies.md#the-replace-section) --- Override dependencies (deprecated).\n* [`[profile]`](profiles.md) --- Compiler settings and optimizations.\n\n## The `[workspace]` section\n\nTo create a workspace, you add the `[workspace]` table to a `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[workspace]\n# ...\n```\n\nAt minimum, a workspace has to have a member, either with a root package or as\na virtual manifest.\n\n### Root package\n\nIf the [`[workspace]` section](#the-workspace-section) is added to a\n`Cargo.toml` that already defines a `[package]`, the package is\nthe *root package* of the workspace. The *workspace root* is the directory\nwhere the workspace's `Cargo.toml` is located.\n\n```toml\n[workspace]\n\n[package]\nname = \"hello_world\" # the name of the package\nversion = \"0.1.0\"    # the current version, obeying semver\n```\n\n### Virtual workspace\n\nAlternatively, a `Cargo.toml` file can be created with a `[workspace]` section\nbut without a [`[package]` section][package]. This is called a *virtual\nmanifest*. This is typically useful when there isn't a \"primary\" package, or\nyou want to keep all the packages organized in separate directories.\n\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/Cargo.toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"hello_world\"]\nresolver = \"3\"\n```\n\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/hello_world/Cargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"hello_world\" # the name of the package\nversion = \"0.1.0\"    # the current version, obeying semver\nedition = \"2024\"     # the edition, will have no effect on a resolver used in the workspace\n```\n\nBy having a workspace without a root package,\n\n- [`resolver`](resolver.md#resolver-versions) must be\n  set explicitly in virtual workspaces as they have no\n  [`package.edition`][package-edition] to infer it from\n  [resolver version](resolver.md#resolver-versions).\n- Commands run in the workspace root will run against all workspace\n  members by default, see [`default-members`](#the-default-members-field).\n\n## The `members` and `exclude` fields \n\nThe `members` and `exclude` fields define which packages are members of\nthe workspace:\n\n```toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"member1\", \"path/to/member2\", \"crates/*\"]\nexclude = [\"crates/foo\", \"path/to/other\"]\n```\n\nAll [`path` dependencies] residing in the workspace directory automatically\nbecome members. Additional members can be listed with the `members` key, which\nshould be an array of strings containing directories with `Cargo.toml` files.\n\nThe `members` list also supports [globs] to match multiple paths, using\ntypical filename glob patterns like `*` and `?`.\n\nThe `exclude` key can be used to prevent paths from being included in a\nworkspace. This can be useful if some path dependencies aren't desired to be\nin the workspace at all, or using a glob pattern and you want to remove a\ndirectory.\n\nWhen inside a subdirectory within the workspace, Cargo will automatically\nsearch the parent directories for a `Cargo.toml` file with a `[workspace]`\ndefinition to determine which workspace to use. The [`package.workspace`]\nmanifest key can be used in member crates to point at a workspace's root to\noverride this automatic search. The manual setting can be useful if the member\nis not inside a subdirectory of the workspace root.\n\n### Package selection\n\nIn a workspace, package-related Cargo commands like [`cargo build`] can use\nthe `-p` / `--package` or `--workspace` command-line flags to determine which\npackages to operate on. If neither of those flags are specified, Cargo will\nuse the package in the current working directory. However, if the current directory is\na workspace root, the [`default-members`](#the-default-members-field) will be used.\n\n## The `default-members` field\n\nThe `default-members` field specifies paths of [members](#the-members-and-exclude-fields) to\noperate on when in the workspace root and the package selection flags are not\nused:\n\n```toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"path/to/member1\", \"path/to/member2\", \"path/to/member3/*\"]\ndefault-members = [\"path/to/member2\", \"path/to/member3/foo\"]\n```\n\n> Note: when a [root package](#root-package) is present,\n> you can only operate on it using `--package` and `--workspace` flags.\n\nWhen unspecified, the [root package](#root-package) will be used.\nIn the case of a [virtual workspace](#virtual-workspace), all members will be used\n(as if `--workspace` were specified on the command-line).\n\n## The `package` table\n\nThe `workspace.package` table is where you define keys that can be\ninherited by members of a workspace. These keys can be inherited by\ndefining them in the member package with `{key}.workspace = true`.\n\nKeys that are supported:\n\n|                |                 |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| `authors`      | `categories`    |\n| `description`  | `documentation` |\n| `edition`      | `exclude`       |\n| `homepage`     | `include`       |\n| `keywords`     | `license`       |\n| `license-file` | `publish`       |\n| `readme`       | `repository`    |\n| `rust-version` | `version`       |\n\n- `license-file` and `readme` are relative to the workspace root\n- `include` and `exclude` are relative to your package root\n\nExample:\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/Cargo.toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"bar\"]\n\n[workspace.package]\nversion = \"1.2.3\"\nauthors = [\"Nice Folks\"]\ndescription = \"A short description of my package\"\ndocumentation = \"https://example.com/bar\"\n```\n\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/bar/Cargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"bar\"\nversion.workspace = true\nauthors.workspace = true\ndescription.workspace = true\ndocumentation.workspace = true\n```\n\n> **MSRV:** Requires 1.64+\n\n## The `dependencies` table\n\nThe `workspace.dependencies` table is where you define dependencies to be\ninherited by members of a workspace.\n\nSpecifying a workspace dependency is similar to [package dependencies][specifying-dependencies] except:\n- Dependencies from this table cannot be declared as `optional`\n- [`features`][features] declared in this table are additive with the `features` from `[dependencies]`\n\nYou can then [inherit the workspace dependency as a package dependency][inheriting-a-dependency-from-a-workspace]\n\nExample:\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/Cargo.toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"bar\"]\n\n[workspace.dependencies]\ncc = \"1.0.73\"\nrand = \"0.8.5\"\nregex = { version = \"1.6.0\", default-features = false, features = [\"std\"] }\n```\n\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/bar/Cargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"bar\"\nversion = \"0.2.0\"\n\n[dependencies]\nregex = { workspace = true, features = [\"unicode\"] }\n\n[build-dependencies]\ncc.workspace = true\n\n[dev-dependencies]\nrand.workspace = true\n```\n\n> **MSRV:** Requires 1.64+\n\n## The `lints` table\n\nThe `workspace.lints` table is where you define lint configuration to be inherited by members of a workspace.\n\nSpecifying a workspace lint configuration is similar to [package lints](manifest.md#the-lints-section).\n\nExample:\n\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/Cargo.toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"crates/*\"]\n\n[workspace.lints.rust]\nunsafe_code = \"forbid\"\n```\n\n```toml\n# [PROJECT_DIR]/crates/bar/Cargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"bar\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\n\n[lints]\nworkspace = true\n```\n\n> **MSRV:** Respected as of 1.74\n\n## The `metadata` table\n\nThe `workspace.metadata` table is ignored by Cargo and will not be warned\nabout. This section can be used for tools that would like to store workspace\nconfiguration in `Cargo.toml`. For example:\n\n```toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\"member1\", \"member2\"]\n\n[workspace.metadata.webcontents]\nroot = \"path/to/webproject\"\ntool = [\"npm\", \"run\", \"build\"]\n# ...\n```\n\nThere is a similar set of tables at the package level at\n[`package.metadata`][package-metadata]. While cargo does not specify a\nformat for the content of either of these tables, it is suggested that\nexternal tools may wish to use them in a consistent fashion, such as referring\nto the data in `workspace.metadata` if data is missing from `package.metadata`,\nif that makes sense for the tool in question.\n\n[package]: manifest.md#the-package-section\n[`Cargo.lock`]: ../guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.md\n[package-metadata]: manifest.md#the-metadata-table\n[package-edition]: manifest.md#the-edition-field\n[output directory]: build-cache.md\n[patch]: overriding-dependencies.md#the-patch-section\n[replace]: overriding-dependencies.md#the-replace-section\n[profiles]: profiles.md\n[`path` dependencies]: specifying-dependencies.md#specifying-path-dependencies\n[`package.workspace`]: manifest.md#the-workspace-field\n[globs]: https://docs.rs/glob/0.3.0/glob/struct.Pattern.html\n[`cargo build`]: ../commands/cargo-build.md\n[specifying-dependencies]: specifying-dependencies.md\n[features]: features.md\n[inheriting-a-dependency-from-a-workspace]: specifying-dependencies.md#inheriting-a-dependency-from-a-workspace\n\n<script>\n(function() {\n    var fragments = {\n        \"#virtual-manifest\": \"workspaces.html#virtual-workspace\",\n    };\n    var target = fragments[window.location.hash];\n    if (target) {\n        var url = window.location.toString();\n        var base = url.substring(0, url.lastIndexOf('/'));\n        window.location.replace(base + \"/\" + target);\n    }\n})();\n</script>"

    # Overriding Dependencies

    The desire to override a dependency can arise through a number of scenarios.
    Most of them, however, boil down to the ability to work with a crate before
    it's been published to [crates.io]. For example:

    * A crate you're working on is also used in a much larger application you're
      working on, and you'd like to test a bug fix to the library inside of the
      larger application.
    * An upstream crate you don't work on has a new feature or a bug fix on the
      master branch of its git repository which you'd like to test out.
    * You're about to publish a new major version of your crate, but you'd like to
      do integration testing across an entire package to ensure the new major
      version works.
    * You've submitted a fix to an upstream crate for a bug you found, but you'd
      like to immediately have your application start depending on the fixed
      version of the crate to avoid blocking on the bug fix getting merged.

    These scenarios can be solved with the [`[patch]` manifest
    section](#the-patch-section).

    This chapter walks through a few different use cases, and includes details
    on the different ways to override a dependency.

    ## Testing a bugfix

    Let's say you're working with the [`uuid` crate] but while you're working on it
    you discover a bug. You are, however, quite enterprising so you decide to also
    try to fix the bug! Originally your manifest will look like:

    [`uuid` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/uuid

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-library"
    version = "0.1.0"

    [dependencies]
    uuid = "1.0"
    ```

    First thing we'll do is to clone the [`uuid` repository][uuid-repository]
    locally via:

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid.git
    ```

    Next we'll edit the manifest of `my-library` to contain:

    ```toml
    [patch.crates-io]
    uuid = { path = "../path/to/uuid" }
    ```

    Here we declare that we're *patching* the source `crates-io` with a new
    dependency. This will effectively add the local checked out version of `uuid` to
    the crates.io registry for our local package.

    Next up we need to ensure that our lock file is updated to use this new version
    of `uuid` so our package uses the locally checked out copy instead of one from
    crates.io. The way `[patch]` works is that it'll load the dependency at
    `../path/to/uuid` and then whenever crates.io is queried for versions of `uuid`
    it'll *also* return the local version.

    This means that the version number of the local checkout is significant and will
    affect whether the patch is used. Our manifest declared `uuid = "1.0"` which
    means we'll only resolve to `>= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0`, and Cargo's greedy resolution
    algorithm also means that we'll resolve to the maximum version within that
    range. Typically this doesn't matter as the version of the git repository will
    already be greater or match the maximum version published on crates.io, but it's
    important to keep this in mind!

    In any case, typically all you need to do now is:

    ```console
    $ cargo build
       Compiling uuid v1.0.0 (.../uuid)
       Compiling my-library v0.1.0 (.../my-library)
        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
    ```

    And that's it! You're now building with the local version of `uuid` (note the
    path in parentheses in the build output). If you don't see the local path version getting
    built then you may need to run `cargo update uuid --precise $version` where
    `$version` is the version of the locally checked out copy of `uuid`.

    Once you've fixed the bug you originally found the next thing you'll want to do
    is to likely submit that as a pull request to the `uuid` crate itself. Once
    you've done this then you can also update the `[patch]` section. The listing
    inside of `[patch]` is just like the `[dependencies]` section, so once your pull
    request is merged you could change your `path` dependency to:

    ```toml
    [patch.crates-io]
    uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid.git' }
    ```

    [uuid-repository]: https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid

    ## Working with an unpublished minor version

    Let's now shift gears a bit from bug fixes to adding features. While working on
    `my-library` you discover that a whole new feature is needed in the `uuid`
    crate. You've implemented this feature, tested it locally above with `[patch]`,
    and submitted a pull request. Let's go over how you continue to use and test it
    before it's actually published.

    Let's also say that the current version of `uuid` on crates.io is `1.0.0`, but
    since then the master branch of the git repository has updated to `1.0.1`. This
    branch includes your new feature you submitted previously. To use this
    repository we'll edit our `Cargo.toml` to look like

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-library"
    version = "0.1.0"

    [dependencies]
    uuid = "1.0.1"

    [patch.crates-io]
    uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid.git' }
    ```

    Note that our local dependency on `uuid` has been updated to `1.0.1` as it's
    what we'll actually require once the crate is published. This version doesn't
    exist on crates.io, though, so we provide it with the `[patch]` section of the
    manifest.

    Now when our library is built it'll fetch `uuid` from the git repository and
    resolve to 1.0.1 inside the repository instead of trying to download a version
    from crates.io. Once 1.0.1 is published on crates.io the `[patch]` section can
    be deleted.

    It's also worth noting that `[patch]` applies *transitively*. Let's say you use
    `my-library` in a larger package, such as:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-binary"
    version = "0.1.0"

    [dependencies]
    my-library = { git = 'https://example.com/git/my-library' }
    uuid = "1.0"

    [patch.crates-io]
    uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid.git' }
    ```

    Remember that `[patch]` is applicable *transitively* but can only be defined at
    the *top level* so we consumers of `my-library` have to repeat the `[patch]` section
    if necessary. Here, though, the new `uuid` crate applies to *both* our dependency on
    `uuid` and the `my-library -> uuid` dependency. The `uuid` crate will be resolved to
    one version for this entire crate graph, 1.0.1, and it'll be pulled from the git
    repository.

    ### Overriding repository URL

    In case the dependency you want to override isn't loaded from `crates.io`,
    you'll have to change a bit how you use `[patch]`. For example, if the
    dependency is a git dependency, you can override it to a local path with:

    ```toml
    [patch."https://github.com/your/repository"]
    my-library = { path = "../my-library/path" }
    ```

    And that's it!

    ## Prepublishing a breaking change

    Let's take a look at working with a new major version of a crate, typically
    accompanied with breaking changes. Sticking with our previous crates, this
    means that we're going to be creating version 2.0.0 of the `uuid` crate. After
    we've submitted all changes upstream we can update our manifest for
    `my-library` to look like:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    uuid = "2.0"

    [patch.crates-io]
    uuid = { git = "https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid.git", branch = "2.0.0" }
    ```

    And that's it! Like with the previous example the 2.0.0 version doesn't actually
    exist on crates.io but we can still put it in through a git dependency through
    the usage of the `[patch]` section. As a thought exercise let's take another
    look at the `my-binary` manifest from above again as well:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-binary"
    version = "0.1.0"

    [dependencies]
    my-library = { git = 'https://example.com/git/my-library' }
    uuid = "1.0"

    [patch.crates-io]
    uuid = { git = 'https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid.git', branch = '2.0.0' }
    ```

    Note that this will actually resolve to two versions of the `uuid` crate. The
    `my-binary` crate will continue to use the 1.x.y series of the `uuid` crate but
    the `my-library` crate will use the `2.0.0` version of `uuid`. This will allow you
    to gradually roll out breaking changes to a crate through a dependency graph
    without being forced to update everything all at once.

    ## Using `[patch]` with multiple versions

    You can patch in multiple versions of the same crate with the `package` key
    used to rename dependencies. For example let's say that the `serde` crate has
    a bugfix that we'd like to use to its `1.*` series but we'd also like to
    prototype using a `2.0.0` version of serde we have in our git repository. To
    configure this we'd do:

    ```toml
    [patch.crates-io]
    serde = { git = 'https://github.com/serde-rs/serde.git' }
    serde2 = { git = 'https://github.com/example/serde.git', package = 'serde', branch = 'v2' }
    ```

    The first `serde = ...` directive indicates that serde `1.*` should be used
    from the git repository (pulling in the bugfix we need) and the second `serde2
    = ...` directive indicates that the `serde` package should also be pulled from
    the `v2` branch of `https://github.com/example/serde`. We're assuming here
    that `Cargo.toml` on that branch mentions version `2.0.0`.

    Note that when using the `package` key the `serde2` identifier here is actually
    ignored. We simply need a unique name which doesn't conflict with other patched
    crates.

    ## The `[patch]` section

    The `[patch]` section of `Cargo.toml` can be used to override dependencies
    with other copies. The syntax is similar to the
    [`[dependencies]`][dependencies] section:

    ```toml
    [patch.crates-io]
    foo = { git = 'https://github.com/example/foo.git' }
    bar = { path = 'my/local/bar' }

    [dependencies.baz]
    git = 'https://github.com/example/baz.git'

    [patch.'https://github.com/example/baz']
    baz = { git = 'https://github.com/example/patched-baz.git', branch = 'my-branch' }
    ```

    > **Note**: The `[patch]` table can also be specified as a [configuration
    > option](config.md), such as in a `.cargo/config.toml` file or a CLI option
    > like `--config 'patch.crates-io.rand.path="rand"'`. This can be useful for
    > local-only changes that you don't want to commit, or temporarily testing a
    > patch.

    The `[patch]` table is made of dependency-like sub-tables. Each key after
    `[patch]` is a URL of the source that is being patched, or the name of a
    registry. The name `crates-io` may be used to override the default registry
    [crates.io]. The first `[patch]` in the example above demonstrates overriding
    [crates.io], and the second `[patch]` demonstrates overriding a git source.

    Each entry in these tables is a normal dependency specification, the same as
    found in the `[dependencies]` section of the manifest. The dependencies listed
    in the `[patch]` section are resolved and used to patch the source at the
    URL specified. The above manifest snippet patches the `crates-io` source (e.g.
    crates.io itself) with the `foo` crate and `bar` crate. It also
    patches the `https://github.com/example/baz` source with a `my-branch` that
    comes from elsewhere.

    Sources can be patched with versions of crates that do not exist, and they can
    also be patched with versions of crates that already exist. If a source is
    patched with a crate version that already exists in the source, then the
    source's original crate is replaced.

    Cargo only looks at the patch settings in the `Cargo.toml` manifest at the
    root of the workspace. Patch settings defined in dependencies will be
    ignored.

    ## The `[replace]` section

    > **Note**: `[replace]` is deprecated. You should use the
    > [`[patch]`](#the-patch-section) table instead.

    This section of Cargo.toml can be used to override dependencies with other
    copies. The syntax is similar to the `[dependencies]` section:

    ```toml
    [replace]
    "foo:0.1.0" = { git = 'https://github.com/example/foo.git' }
    "bar:1.0.2" = { path = 'my/local/bar' }
    ```

    Each key in the `[replace]` table is a [package ID
    specification](pkgid-spec.md), which allows arbitrarily choosing a node in the
    dependency graph to override (the 3-part version number is required). The
    value of each key is the same as the `[dependencies]` syntax for specifying
    dependencies, except that you can't specify features. Note that when a crate
    is overridden the copy it's overridden with must have both the same name and
    version, but it can come from a different source (e.g., git or a local path).

    Cargo only looks at the replace settings in the `Cargo.toml` manifest at the
    root of the workspace. Replace settings defined in dependencies will be
    ignored.

    ## `paths` overrides

    Sometimes you're only temporarily working on a crate and you don't want to have
    to modify `Cargo.toml` like with the `[patch]` section above. For this use
    case Cargo offers a much more limited version of overrides called **path
    overrides**.

    Path overrides are specified through [`.cargo/config.toml`](config.md) instead of
    `Cargo.toml`. Inside of `.cargo/config.toml` you'll specify a key called `paths`:

    ```toml
    paths = ["/path/to/uuid"]
    ```

    This array should be filled with directories that contain a `Cargo.toml`. In
    this instance, we’re just adding `uuid`, so it will be the only one that’s
    overridden. This path can be either absolute or relative to the directory that
    contains the `.cargo` folder.

    Path overrides are more restricted than the `[patch]` section, however, in
    that they cannot change the structure of the dependency graph. When a
    path replacement is used then the previous set of dependencies
    must all match exactly to the new `Cargo.toml` specification. For example this
    means that path overrides cannot be used to test out adding a dependency to a
    crate. Instead, `[patch]` must be used in that situation. As a result, usage of a
    path override is typically isolated to quick bug fixes rather than larger
    changes.

    > **Note**: using a local configuration to override paths will only work for
    > crates that have been published to [crates.io]. You cannot use this feature
    > to tell Cargo how to find local unpublished crates.

    Documentation text:

    # Registries

    Cargo installs crates and fetches dependencies from a "registry". The default
    registry is [crates.io]. A registry contains an "index" which contains a
    searchable list of available crates. A registry may also provide a web API to
    support publishing new crates directly from Cargo.

    > Note: If you are interested in mirroring or vendoring an existing registry,
    > take a look at [Source Replacement].

    If you are implementing a registry server, see [Running a Registry] for more
    details about the protocol between Cargo and a registry.

    If you're using a registry that requires authentication, see [Registry Authentication].
    If you are implementing a credential provider, see [Credential Provider Protocol]
    for details.

    ## Using an Alternate Registry

    To use a registry other than [crates.io], the name and index URL of the
    registry must be added to a [`.cargo/config.toml` file][config]. The `registries`
    table has a key for each registry, for example:

    ```toml
    [registries]
    my-registry = { index = "https://my-intranet:8080/git/index" }
    ```

    The `index` key should be a URL to a git repository with the registry's index or a
    Cargo sparse registry URL with the `sparse+` prefix.

    A crate can then depend on a crate from another registry by specifying the
    `registry` key and a value of the registry's name in that dependency's entry
    in `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    # Sample Cargo.toml
    [package]
    name = "my-project"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"

    [dependencies]
    other-crate = { version = "1.0", registry = "my-registry" }
    ```

    As with most config values, the index may be specified with an environment
    variable instead of a config file. For example, setting the following
    environment variable will accomplish the same thing as defining a config file:

    ```ignore
    CARGO_REGISTRIES_MY_REGISTRY_INDEX=https://my-intranet:8080/git/index
    ```

    > Note: [crates.io] does not accept packages that depend on crates from other
    > registries.

    ## Publishing to an Alternate Registry

    If the registry supports web API access, then packages can be published
    directly to the registry from Cargo. Several of Cargo's commands such as
    [`cargo publish`] take a `--registry` command-line flag to indicate which
    registry to use. For example, to publish the package in the current directory:

    1. `cargo login --registry=my-registry`

        This only needs to be done once. You must enter the secret API token
        retrieved from the registry's website. Alternatively the token may be
        passed directly to the `publish` command with the `--token` command-line
        flag or an environment variable with the name of the registry such as
        `CARGO_REGISTRIES_MY_REGISTRY_TOKEN`.

    2. `cargo publish --registry=my-registry`

    Instead of always passing the `--registry` command-line option, the default
    registry may be set in [`.cargo/config.toml`][config] with the `registry.default`
    key. For example:

    ```toml
    [registry]
    default = "my-registry"
    ```

    Setting the `package.publish` key in the `Cargo.toml` manifest restricts which
    registries the package is allowed to be published to. This is useful to
    prevent accidentally publishing a closed-source package to [crates.io]. The
    value may be a list of registry names, for example:

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    publish = ["my-registry"]
    ```

    The `publish` value may also be `false` to restrict all publishing, which is
    the same as an empty list.

    The authentication information saved by [`cargo login`] is stored in the
    `credentials.toml` file in the Cargo home directory (default `$HOME/.cargo`). It
    has a separate table for each registry, for example:

    ```toml
    [registries.my-registry]
    token = "854DvwSlUwEHtIo3kWy6x7UCPKHfzCmy"
    ```

    ## Registry Protocols
    Cargo supports two remote registry protocols: `git` and `sparse`. If the registry
    index URL starts with `sparse+`, Cargo uses the sparse protocol. Otherwise
    Cargo uses the `git` protocol.

    The `git` protocol stores index metadata in a git repository and requires Cargo to clone
    the entire repo.

    The `sparse` protocol fetches individual metadata files using plain HTTP requests.
    Since Cargo only downloads the metadata for relevant crates, the `sparse` protocol can
    save significant time and bandwidth.

    The [crates.io] registry supports both protocols. The protocol for crates.io is
    controlled via the [`registries.crates-io.protocol`] config key.

    Documentation text:

    # Build cache

    Cargo stores the output of a build into the "target" directory. By default,
    this is the directory named `target` in the root of your
    [*workspace*][def-workspace]. To change the location, you can set the
    `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` [environment variable], the [`build.target-dir`] config
    value, or the `--target-dir` command-line flag.

    The directory layout depends on whether or not you are using the `--target`
    flag to build for a specific platform. If `--target` is not specified, Cargo
    runs in a mode where it builds for the host architecture. The output goes into
    the root of the target directory, with each [profile] stored in a separate
    subdirectory:

    Directory | Description
    ----------|------------
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/debug/</code> | Contains output for the `dev` profile.
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/release/</code> | Contains output for the `release` profile (with the `--release` option).
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/foo/</code> | Contains build output for the `foo` profile (with the `--profile=foo` option).

    For historical reasons, the `dev` and `test` profiles are stored in the
    `debug` directory, and the `release` and `bench` profiles are stored in the
    `release` directory. User-defined profiles are stored in a directory with the
    same name as the profile.

    When building for another target with `--target`, the output is placed in a
    directory with the name of the [target]:

    Directory | Example
    ----------|--------
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/&lt;triple&gt;/debug/</code> | <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/</code>
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/&lt;triple&gt;/release/</code> | <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/</code>

    > **Note**: When not using `--target`, this has a consequence that Cargo will
    > share your dependencies with build scripts and proc macros. [`RUSTFLAGS`]
    > will be shared with every `rustc` invocation. With the `--target` flag,
    > build scripts and proc macros are built separately (for the host
    > architecture), and do not share `RUSTFLAGS`.

    Within the profile directory (such as `debug` or `release`), artifacts are
    placed into the following directories:

    Directory | Description
    ----------|------------
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/debug/</code> | Contains the output of the package being built (the [binary executables] and [library targets]).
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/debug/examples/</code> | Contains [example targets].

    Some commands place their output in dedicated directories in the top level of
    the `target` directory:

    Directory | Description
    ----------|------------
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/doc/</code> | Contains rustdoc documentation ([`cargo doc`]).
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/package/</code> | Contains the output of the [`cargo package`] and [`cargo publish`] commands.

    Cargo also creates several other directories and files needed for the build
    process. Their layout is considered internal to Cargo, and is subject to
    change. Some of these directories are:

    Directory | Description
    ----------|------------
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/debug/deps/</code> | Dependencies and other artifacts.
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/debug/incremental/</code> | `rustc` [incremental output], a cache used to speed up subsequent builds.
    <code style="white-space: nowrap">target/debug/build/</code> | Output from [build scripts].

    ## Dep-info files

    Next to each compiled artifact is a file called a "dep info" file with a `.d`
    suffix. This file is a Makefile-like syntax that indicates all of the file
    dependencies required to rebuild the artifact. These are intended to be used
    with external build systems so that they can detect if Cargo needs to be
    re-executed. The paths in the file are absolute by default. See the
    [`build.dep-info-basedir`] config option to use relative paths.

    ```Makefile
    # Example dep-info file found in target/debug/foo.d
    /path/to/myproj/target/debug/foo: /path/to/myproj/src/lib.rs /path/to/myproj/src/main.rs
    ```

    ## Shared cache

    A third party tool, [sccache], can be used to share built dependencies across
    different workspaces.

    To setup `sccache`, install it with `cargo install sccache` and set
    `RUSTC_WRAPPER` environment variable to `sccache` before invoking Cargo. If
    you use bash, it makes sense to add `export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` to
    `.bashrc`. Alternatively, you can set [`build.rustc-wrapper`] in the [Cargo
    configuration][config]. Refer to sccache documentation for more details.

    Documentation text:

    # Credential Provider Protocol
    This document describes information for building a Cargo credential provider. For information on
    setting up or using a credential provider, see [Registry Authentication](registry-authentication.md).

    When using an external credential provider, Cargo communicates with the credential
    provider using stdin/stdout messages passed as single lines of JSON.

    Cargo will always execute the credential provider with the `--cargo-plugin` argument.
    This enables a credential provider executable to have additional functionality beyond
    what Cargo needs. Additional arguments are included in the JSON via the `args` field.

    ## JSON messages
    The JSON messages in this document have newlines added for readability.
    Actual messages must not contain newlines.

    ### Credential hello
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: used to identify the supported protocols on process startup
    ```javascript
    {
        "v":[1]
    }
    ```

    Requests sent by Cargo will include a `v` field set to one of the versions listed here.
    If Cargo does not support any of the versions offered by the credential provider, it will issue an
    error and shut down the credential process.

    ### Registry information
    * Sent by: Cargo
    Not a message by itself. Included in all messages sent by Cargo as the `registry` field.
    ```javascript
    {
        // Index URL of the registry
        "index-url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index",
        // Name of the registry in configuration (optional)
        "name": "crates-io",
        // HTTP headers received from attempting to access an authenticated registry (optional)
        "headers": ["WWW-Authenticate: cargo"]
    }
    ```

    ### Login request
    * Sent by: Cargo
    * Purpose: collect and store credentials
    ```javascript
    {
        // Protocol version
        "v":1,
        // Action to perform: login
        "kind":"login",
        // Registry information (see Registry information)
        "registry":{"index-url":"sparse+https://registry-url/index/", "name": "my-registry"},
        // User-specified token from stdin or command line (optional)
        "token": "<the token value>",
        // URL that the user could visit to get a token (optional)
        "login-url": "http://registry-url/login",
        // Additional command-line args (optional)
        "args":[]
    }
    ```

    If the `token` field is set, then the credential provider should use the token provided. If
    the `token` is not set, then the credential provider should prompt the user for a token.

    In addition to the arguments that may be passed to the credential provider in
    configuration, `cargo login` also supports passing additional command line args
    via `cargo login -- <additional args>`. These additional arguments will be included
    in the `args` field after any args from Cargo configuration.

    ### Read request
    * Sent by: Cargo
    * Purpose: Get the credential for reading crate information
    ```javascript
    {
        // Protocol version
        "v":1,
        // Request kind: get credentials
        "kind":"get",
        // Action to perform: read crate information
        "operation":"read",
        // Registry information (see Registry information)
        "registry":{"index-url":"sparse+https://registry-url/index/", "name": "my-registry"},
        // Additional command-line args (optional)
        "args":[]
    }
    ```

    ### Publish request
    * Sent by: Cargo
    * Purpose: Get the credential for publishing a crate
    ```javascript
    {
        // Protocol version
        "v":1,
        // Request kind: get credentials
        "kind":"get",
        // Action to perform: publish crate
        "operation":"publish",
        // Crate name
        "name":"sample",
        // Crate version
        "vers":"0.1.0",
        // Crate checksum
        "cksum":"...",
        // Registry information (see Registry information)
        "registry":{"index-url":"sparse+https://registry-url/index/", "name": "my-registry"},
        // Additional command-line args (optional)
        "args":[]
    }
    ```

    ### Get success response
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: Gives the credential to Cargo
    ```javascript
    {"Ok":{
        // Response kind: this was a get request
        "kind":"get",
        // Token to send to the registry
        "token":"...",
        // Cache control. Can be one of the following:
        // * "never": do not cache
        // * "session": cache for the current cargo session
        // * "expires": cache for the current cargo session until expiration
        "cache":"expires",
        // Unix timestamp (only for "cache": "expires")
        "expiration":1693942857,
        // Is the token operation independent?
        "operation_independent":true
    }}
    ```

    The `token` will be sent to the registry as the value of the `Authorization` HTTP header.

    `operation_independent` indicates whether the token can be cached across different
    operations (such as publishing or fetching). In general, this should be `true` unless
    the provider wants to generate tokens that are scoped to specific operations.

    ### Login success response
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: Indicates the login was successful
    ```javascript
    {"Ok":{
        // Response kind: this was a login request
        "kind":"login"
    }}
    ```

    ### Logout success response
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: Indicates the logout was successful
    ```javascript
    {"Ok":{
        // Response kind: this was a logout request
        "kind":"logout"
    }}
    ```

    ### Failure response (URL not supported)
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: Gives error information to Cargo
    ```javascript
    {"Err":{
        "kind":"url-not-supported"
    }}
    ```
    Sent if the credential provider is designed
    to only handle specific registry URLs and the given URL
    is not supported. Cargo will attempt another provider if
    available.

    ### Failure response (not found)
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: Gives error information to Cargo
    ```javascript
    {"Err":{
        // Error: The credential could not be found in the provider.
        "kind":"not-found"
    }}
    ```
    Sent if the credential could not be found. This is expected for
    `get` requests where the credential is not available, or `logout`
    requests where there is nothing found to erase.

    ### Failure response (operation not supported)
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: Gives error information to Cargo
    ```javascript
    {"Err":{
        // Error: The credential could not be found in the provider.
        "kind":"operation-not-supported"
    }}
    ```
    Sent if the credential provider does not support the requested operation.
    If a provider only supports `get` and a `login` is requested, the
    provider should respond with this error.

    ### Failure response (other)
    * Sent by: credential provider
    * Purpose: Gives error information to Cargo
    ```javascript
    {"Err":{
        // Error: something else has failed
        "kind":"other",
        // Error message string to be displayed
        "message": "free form string error message",
        // Detailed cause chain for the error (optional)
        "caused-by": ["cause 1", "cause 2"]
    }}
    ```

    ## Example communication to request a token for reading:
    1. Cargo spawns the credential process, capturing stdin and stdout.
    2. Credential process sends the Hello message to Cargo
        ```javascript
        { "v": [1] }
       ```
    3. Cargo sends the CredentialRequest message to the credential process (newlines added for readability).
        ```javascript
        {
            "v": 1,
            "kind": "get",
            "operation": "read",
            "registry":{"index-url":"sparse+https://registry-url/index/"}
        }
        ```
    4. Credential process sends the CredentialResponse to Cargo (newlines added for readability).
        ```javascript
        {
            "token": "...",
            "cache": "session",
            "operation_independent": true
        }
        ```
    5. Cargo closes the stdin pipe to the credential provider and it exits.
    6. Cargo uses the token for the remainder of the session (until Cargo exits) when interacting with this registry.

    Documentation text:

    # External tools

    One of the goals of Cargo is simple integration with third-party tools, like
    IDEs and other build systems. To make integration easier, Cargo has several
    facilities:

    * a [`cargo metadata`] command, which outputs package structure and dependencies
      information in JSON,

    * a `--message-format` flag, which outputs information about a particular build,
      and

    * support for custom subcommands.


    ## Information about package structure

    You can use [`cargo metadata`] command to get information about package
    structure and dependencies. See the [`cargo metadata`] documentation
    for details on the format of the output.

    The format is stable and versioned. When calling `cargo metadata`, you should
    pass `--format-version` flag explicitly to avoid forward incompatibility
    hazard.

    If you are using Rust, the [cargo_metadata] crate can be used to parse the
    output.

    [cargo_metadata]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo_metadata
    [`cargo metadata`]: ../commands/cargo-metadata.md

    ## JSON messages

    When passing `--message-format=json`, Cargo will output the following
    information during the build:

    * compiler errors and warnings,

    * produced artifacts,

    * results of the build scripts (for example, native dependencies).

    The output goes to stdout in the JSON object per line format. The `reason` field
    distinguishes different kinds of messages.
    The `package_id` field is a unique identifier for referring to the package, and
    as the `--package` argument to many commands. The syntax grammar can be found in
    chapter [Package ID Specifications].

    > **Note:** `--message-format=json` only controls Cargo and Rustc's output.
    > This cannot control the output of other tools,
    > e.g. `cargo run --message-format=json`,
    > or arbitrary output from procedural macros.
    > A possible workaround in these situations is to only interpret a line as JSON if it starts with `{`.

    The `--message-format` option can also take additional formatting values which
    alter the way the JSON messages are computed and rendered. See the description
    of the `--message-format` option in the [build command documentation] for more
    details.

    If you are using Rust, the [cargo_metadata] crate can be used to parse these
    messages.

    > **MSRV:** 1.77 is required for `package_id` to be a Package ID Specification. Before that, it was opaque.

    ### Compiler messages

    The "compiler-message" message includes output from the compiler, such as
    warnings and errors. See the [rustc JSON chapter](../../rustc/json.md) for
    details on `rustc`'s message format, which is embedded in the following
    structure:

    ```javascript
    {
        /* The "reason" indicates the kind of message. */
        "reason": "compiler-message",
        /* The Package ID, a unique identifier for referring to the package. */

            "crate_types": [
                "lib"
            ],
            /* The name of the target.

        },
        /* The message emitted by the compiler.

        See https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/json.html for details.
        */
        "message": {
            /* ... */
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Artifact messages

    For every compilation step, a "compiler-artifact" message is emitted with the
    following structure:

    ```javascript
    {
        /* The "reason" indicates the kind of message. */
        "reason": "compiler-artifact",
        /* The Package ID, a unique identifier for referring to the package. */
        "package_id": "file:///path/to/my-package#0.1.0",
        /* Absolute path to the package manifest. */
        "manifest_path": "/path/to/my-package/Cargo.toml",
        /* The Cargo target (lib, bin, example, etc.) that generated the artifacts.
           See the definition above for `compiler-message` for details.
        */
        "target": {
            "kind": [
                "lib"
            ],
            "crate_types": [
                "lib"
            ],
            "name": "my_package",
            "src_path": "/path/to/my-package/src/lib.rs",
            "edition": "2018",
            "doc": true,
            "doctest": true,
            "test": true
        },
        /* The profile indicates which compiler settings were used. */
        "profile": {
            /* The optimization level. */
            "opt_level": "0",
            /* The debug level, an integer of 0, 1, or 2, or a string
               "line-directives-only" or "line-tables-only". If `null`, it implies
               rustc's default of 0.
            */
            "debuginfo": 2,
            /* Whether or not debug assertions are enabled. */
            "debug_assertions": true,
            /* Whether or not overflow checks are enabled. */
            "overflow_checks": true,
            /* Whether or not the `--test` flag is used. */
            "test": false
        },
        /* Array of features enabled. */
        "features": ["feat1", "feat2"],
        /* Array of files generated by this step. */
        "filenames": [
            "/path/to/my-package/target/debug/libmy_package.rlib",
            "/path/to/my-package/target/debug/deps/libmy_package-be9f3faac0a26ef0.rmeta"
        ],
        /* A string of the path to the executable that was created, or null if
           this step did not generate an executable.
        */
        "executable": null,
        /* Whether or not this step was actually executed.
           When `true`, this means that the pre-existing artifacts were
           up-to-date, and `rustc` was not executed. When `false`, this means that
           `rustc` was run to generate the artifacts.
        */
        "fresh": true
    }

    ```

    ### Build script output

    The "build-script-executed" message includes the parsed output of a build
    script. Note that this is emitted even if the build script is not run; it will
    display the previously cached value. More details about build script output
    may be found in [the chapter on build scripts](build-scripts.md).

    ```javascript
    {
        /* The "reason" indicates the kind of message. */
        "reason": "build-script-executed",
        /* The Package ID, a unique identifier for referring to the package. */
        "package_id": "file:///path/to/my-package#0.1.0",
        /* Array of libraries to link, as indicated by the `cargo::rustc-link-lib`
           instruction. Note that this may include a "KIND=" prefix in the string
           where KIND is the library kind.
        */
        "linked_libs": ["foo", "static=bar"],
        /* Array of paths to include in the library search path, as indicated by
           the `cargo::rustc-link-search` instruction. Note that this may include a
           "KIND=" prefix in the string where KIND is the library kind.
        */
        "linked_paths": ["/some/path", "native=/another/path"],
        /* Array of cfg values to enable, as indicated by the `cargo::rustc-cfg`
           instruction.
        */
        "cfgs": ["cfg1", "cfg2=\"string\""],
        /* Array of [KEY, VALUE] arrays of environment variables to set, as
           indicated by the `cargo::rustc-env` instruction.
        */
        "env": [
            ["SOME_KEY", "some value"],
            ["ANOTHER_KEY", "another value"]
        ],
        /* An absolute path which is used as a value of `OUT_DIR` environmental
           variable when compiling current package.
        */
        "out_dir": "/some/path/in/target/dir"
    }
    ```

    ### Build finished

    The "build-finished" message is emitted at the end of the build.

    ```javascript
    {
        /* The "reason" indicates the kind of message. */
        "reason": "build-finished",
        /* Whether or not the build finished successfully. */
        "success": true,
    }
    ````

    This message can be helpful for tools to know when to stop reading JSON
    messages. Commands such as `cargo test` or `cargo run` can produce additional
    output after the build has finished. This message lets a tool know that Cargo
    will not produce additional JSON messages, but there may be additional output
    that may be generated afterwards (such as the output generated by the program
    executed by `cargo run`).

    > Note: There is experimental nightly-only support for JSON output for tests,
    > so additional test-specific JSON messages may begin arriving after the
    > "build-finished" message if that is enabled.

    ## Custom subcommands

    Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
    Cargo itself. This is achieved by translating a cargo invocation of the form
    cargo `(?<command>[^ ]+)` into an invocation of an external tool
    `cargo-${command}`. The external tool must be present in one of the user's
    `$PATH` directories.

    > **Note**: Cargo defaults to prioritizing external tools in `$CARGO_HOME/bin`
    > over `$PATH`. Users can override this precedence by adding `$CARGO_HOME/bin`
    > to `$PATH`.

    When Cargo invokes a custom subcommand, the first argument to the subcommand
    will be the filename of the custom subcommand, as usual. The second argument
    will be the subcommand name itself. For example, the second argument would be
    `${command}` when invoking `cargo-${command}`. Any additional arguments on the
    command line will be forwarded unchanged.

    Cargo can also display the help output of a custom subcommand with `cargo help
    ${command}`. Cargo assumes that the subcommand will print a help message if its
    third argument is `--help`. So, `cargo help ${command}` would invoke
    `cargo-${command} ${command} --help`.

    Custom subcommands may use the `CARGO` environment variable to call back to
    Cargo. Alternatively, it can link to `cargo` crate as a library, but this
    approach has drawbacks:

    * Cargo as a library is unstable: the  API may change without deprecation
    * versions of the linked Cargo library may be different from the Cargo binary

    Instead, it is encouraged to use the CLI interface to drive Cargo. The [`cargo
    metadata`] command can be used to obtain information about the current project
    (the [`cargo_metadata`] crate provides a Rust interface to this command).

    # Features Examples

    The following illustrates some real-world examples of features in action.

    ## Minimizing build times and file sizes

    Some packages use features so that if the features are not enabled, it reduces
    the size of the crate and reduces compile time. Some examples are:

    * [`syn`] is a popular crate for parsing Rust code. Since it is so popular, it
      is helpful to reduce compile times since it affects so many projects. It has
      a [clearly documented list][syn-features] of features which can be used to
      minimize the amount of code it contains.
    * [`regex`] has a [several features][regex-features] that are [well
      documented][regex-docs]. Cutting out Unicode support can reduce the
      resulting file size as it can remove some large tables.
    * [`winapi`] has [a large number][winapi-features] of features that
      limit which Windows API bindings it supports.
    * [`web-sys`] is another example similar to `winapi` that provides a [huge
      surface area][web-sys-features] of API bindings that are limited by using
      features.

    [winapi-features]: https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs/blob/0.3.9/Cargo.toml#L25-L431

    [regex-docs]: https://docs.rs/regex/1.4.2/regex/#crate-features
    [`web-sys`]: https://crates.io/crates/web-sys
    [web-sys-features]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/blob/0.2.69/crates/web-sys/Cargo.toml#L32-L1395

    ## Extending behavior

    The [`serde_json`] package has a [`preserve_order` feature][serde_json-preserve_order]
    which [changes the behavior][serde_json-code] of JSON maps to preserve the
    order that keys are inserted. Notice that it enables an optional dependency
    [`indexmap`] to implement the new behavior.

    When changing behavior like this, be careful to make sure the changes are
    [SemVer compatible]. That is, enabling the feature should not break code that
    usually builds with the feature off.

    [`serde_json`]: https://crates.io/crates/serde_json
    [serde_json-preserve_order]: https://github.com/serde-rs/json/blob/v1.0.60/Cargo.toml#L53-L56
    [SemVer compatible]: features.md#semver-compatibility
    [serde_json-code]: https://github.com/serde-rs/json/blob/v1.0.60/src/map.rs#L23-L26
    [`indexmap`]: https://crates.io/crates/indexmap

    ## `no_std` support

    Some packages want to support both [`no_std`] and `std` environments. This is
    useful for supporting embedded and resource-constrained platforms, but still
    allowing extended capabilities for platforms that support the full standard
    library.

    The [`wasm-bindgen`] package defines a [`std` feature][wasm-bindgen-std] that
    is [enabled by default][wasm-bindgen-default]. At the top of the library, it
    [unconditionally enables the `no_std` attribute][wasm-bindgen-no_std]. This
    ensures that `std` and the [`std` prelude] are not automatically in scope.
    Then, in various places in the code ([example1][wasm-bindgen-cfg1],
    [example2][wasm-bindgen-cfg2]), it uses `#[cfg(feature = "std")]` attributes
    to conditionally enable extra functionality that requires `std`.

    [wasm-bindgen-cfg2]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/blob/0.2.69/src/lib.rs#L67-L75

    ## Re-exporting dependency features

    It can be convenient to re-export the features from a dependency. This allows
    the user depending on the crate to control those features without needing to
    specify those dependencies directly. For example, [`regex`] [re-exports the
    features][regex-re-export] from the [`regex_syntax`][regex_syntax-features]
    package. Users of `regex` don't need to know about the `regex_syntax` package,
    but they can still access the features it contains.

    [regex-re-export]: https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/1.4.2/Cargo.toml#L65-L89
    [regex_syntax-features]: https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/1.4.2/regex-syntax/Cargo.toml#L17-L32

    ## Vendoring of C libraries

    Some packages provide bindings to common C libraries (sometimes referred to as
    ["sys" crates][sys]). Sometimes these packages give you the choice to use the
    C library installed on the system, or to build it from source. For example,
    the [`openssl`] package has a [`vendored` feature][openssl-vendored] which
    enables the corresponding `vendored` feature of [`openssl-sys`]. The
    `openssl-sys` build script has some [conditional logic][openssl-sys-cfg] which
    causes it to build from a local copy of the OpenSSL source code instead of
    using the version from the system.

    The [`curl-sys`] package is another example where the [`static-curl`
    feature][curl-sys-static] causes it to build libcurl from source. Notice that
    it also has a [`force-system-lib-on-osx`][curl-sys-macos] feature which forces
    it [to use the system libcurl][curl-sys-macos-code], overriding the
    static-curl setting.

    [curl-sys-macos-code]: https://github.com/alexcrichton/curl-rust/blob/0.4.34/curl-sys/build.rs#L15-L20

    ## Feature precedence

    Some packages may have mutually-exclusive features. One option to handle this
    is to prefer one feature over another. The [`log`] package is an example. It
    has [several features][log-features] for choosing the maximum logging level at
    compile-time described [here][log-docs]. It uses [`cfg-if`] to [choose a
    precedence][log-cfg-if]. If multiple features are enabled, the higher "max"
    levels will be preferred over the lower levels.

    [`log`]: https://crates.io/crates/log
    [log-features]: https://github.com/rust-lang/log/blob/0.4.11/Cargo.toml#L29-L42
    [log-docs]: https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/#compile-time-filters
    [log-cfg-if]: https://github.com/rust-lang/log/blob/0.4.11/src/lib.rs#L1422-L1448
    [`cfg-if`]: https://crates.io/crates/cfg-if

    ## Proc-macro companion package

    Some packages have a proc-macro that is intimately tied with it. However, not
    all users will need to use the proc-macro. By making the proc-macro an
    optional-dependency, this allows you to conveniently choose whether or not it
    is included. This is helpful, because sometimes the proc-macro version must
    stay in sync with the parent package, and you don't want to force the users to
    have to specify both dependencies and keep them in sync.

    An example is [`serde`] which has a [`derive`][serde-derive] feature which
    enables the [`serde_derive`] proc-macro. The `serde_derive` crate is very
    tightly tied to `serde`, so it uses an [equals version
    requirement][serde-equals] to ensure they stay in sync.

    [`serde`]: https://crates.io/crates/serde
    [`serde_derive`]: https://crates.io/crates/serde_derive
    [serde-derive]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/blob/v1.0.118/serde/Cargo.toml#L34-L35
    [serde-equals]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/blob/v1.0.118/serde/Cargo.toml#L17

    ## Nightly-only features

    Some packages want to experiment with APIs or language features that are only
    available on the Rust [nightly channel]. However, they may not want to require
    their users to also use the nightly channel. An example is [`wasm-bindgen`]
    which has a [`nightly` feature][wasm-bindgen-nightly] which enables an
    [extended API][wasm-bindgen-unsize] that uses the [`Unsize`] marker trait that
    is only available on the nightly channel at the time of this writing.

    Note that at the root of the crate it uses [`cfg_attr` to enable the nightly
    feature][wasm-bindgen-cfg_attr]. Keep in mind that the [`feature` attribute]
    is unrelated to Cargo features, and is used to opt-in to experimental language
    features.

    The [`simd_support` feature][rand-simd_support] of the [`rand`] package is another example,
    which relies on a dependency that only builds on the nightly channel.

    ## Experimental features

    Some packages have new functionality that they may want to experiment with,
    without having to commit to the stability of those APIs. The features are
    usually documented that they are experimental, and thus may change or break in
    the future, even during a minor release. An example is the [`async-std`]
    package, which has an [`unstable` feature][async-std-unstable], which [gates
    new APIs][async-std-gate] that people can opt-in to using, but may not be
    completely ready to be relied upon.

    # Configuration

    This document explains how Cargo’s configuration system works, as well as
    available keys or configuration. For configuration of a package through its
    manifest, see the [manifest format](manifest.md).

    ## Hierarchical structure

    Cargo allows local configuration for a particular package as well as global
    configuration. It looks for configuration files in the current directory and
    all parent directories. If, for example, Cargo were invoked in
    `/projects/foo/bar/baz`, then the following configuration files would be
    probed for and unified in this order:

    * `/projects/foo/bar/baz/.cargo/config.toml`
    * `/projects/foo/bar/.cargo/config.toml`
    * `/projects/foo/.cargo/config.toml`
    * `/projects/.cargo/config.toml`
    * `/.cargo/config.toml`
    * `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml` which defaults to:
        * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\config.toml`
        * Unix: `$HOME/.cargo/config.toml`

    With this structure, you can specify configuration per-package, and even
    possibly check it into version control. You can also specify personal defaults
    with a configuration file in your home directory.

    If a key is specified in multiple config files, the values will get merged
    together. Numbers, strings, and booleans will use the value in the deeper
    config directory taking precedence over ancestor directories, where the
    home directory is the lowest priority. Arrays will be joined together
    with higher precedence items being placed later in the merged array.

    At present, when being invoked from a workspace, Cargo does not read config
    files from crates within the workspace. i.e. if a workspace has two crates in
    it, named `/projects/foo/bar/baz/mylib` and `/projects/foo/bar/baz/mybin`, and
    there are Cargo configs at `/projects/foo/bar/baz/mylib/.cargo/config.toml`
    and `/projects/foo/bar/baz/mybin/.cargo/config.toml`, Cargo does not read
    those configuration files if it is invoked from the workspace root
    (`/projects/foo/bar/baz/`).

    > **Note:** Cargo also reads config files without the `.toml` extension, such as
    > `.cargo/config`. Support for the `.toml` extension was added in version 1.39
    > and is the preferred form. If both files exist, Cargo will use the file
    > without the extension.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of Cargo's hierarchical configuration system as described in the documentation?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user specify a custom configuration file for Cargo without using the default locations, and what is the syntax for doing so?
  documentationQuestion3: In a multi-crate workspace, how does Cargo handle configuration files located within individual crates, and why might this behavior be intentional?

    ## Configuration format

    Configuration files are written in the [TOML format][toml] (like the
    manifest), with simple key-value pairs inside of sections (tables). The
    following is a quick overview of all settings, with detailed descriptions
    found below.

    ## Environment variables

    Cargo can also be configured through environment variables in addition to the
    TOML configuration files. For each configuration key of the form `foo.bar` the
    environment variable `CARGO_FOO_BAR` can also be used to define the value.
    Keys are converted to uppercase, dots and dashes are converted to underscores.
    For example the `target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.runner` key can also be
    defined by the `CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_RUNNER` environment
    variable.

    Environment variables will take precedence over TOML configuration files.
    Currently only integer, boolean, string and some array values are supported to
    be defined by environment variables. [Descriptions below](#configuration-keys)
    indicate which keys support environment variables and otherwise they are not
    supported due to [technical issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5416).

    In addition to the system above, Cargo recognizes a few other specific
    [environment variables][env].

    ## Command-line overrides

    Cargo also accepts arbitrary configuration overrides through the
    `--config` command-line option. The argument should be in TOML syntax of
    `KEY=VALUE` or provided as a path to an extra configuration file:

    ```console
    # With `KEY=VALUE` in TOML syntax
    cargo --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true fetch

    # With a path to a configuration file
    cargo --config ./path/to/my/extra-config.toml fetch
    ```

    The `--config` option may be specified multiple times, in which case the
    values are merged in left-to-right order, using the same merging logic
    that is used when multiple configuration files apply. Configuration
    values specified this way take precedence over environment variables,
    which take precedence over configuration files.

    When the `--config` option is provided as an extra configuration file,
    The configuration file loaded this way follow the same precedence rules
    as other options specified directly with `--config`.

    Some examples of what it looks like using Bourne shell syntax:

    ```console
    # Most shells will require escaping.
    cargo --config http.proxy=\"http://example.com\" …

    # Spaces may be used.
    cargo --config "net.git-fetch-with-cli = true" …

    # TOML array example. Single quotes make it easier to read and write.
    cargo --config 'build.rustdocflags = ["--html-in-header", "header.html"]' …

    # Example of a complex TOML key.
    cargo --config "target.'cfg(all(target_arch = \"arm\", target_os = \"none\"))'.runner = 'my-runner'" …

    # Example of overriding a profile setting.
    cargo --config profile.dev.package.image.opt-level=3 …
    ```

    ## Config-relative paths

    Paths in config files may be absolute, relative, or a bare name without any path separators.
    Paths for executables without a path separator will use the `PATH` environment variable to search for the executable.
    Paths for non-executables will be relative to where the config value is defined.

    In particular, rules are:

    * For environment variables, paths are relative to the current working directory.
    * For config values loaded directly from the [`--config KEY=VALUE`](#command-line-overrides) option,
      paths are relative to the current working directory.
    * For config files, paths are relative to the parent directory of the directory where the config files were defined,
      no matter those files are from either the [hierarchical probing](#hierarchical-structure)
      or the [`--config <path>`](#command-line-overrides) option.

    > **Note:** To maintain consistency with existing `.cargo/config.toml` probing behavior,
    > it is by design that a path in a config file passed via `--config <path>`
    > is also relative to two levels up from the config file itself.
    >
    > To avoid unexpected results, the rule of thumb is putting your extra config files
    > at the same level of discovered `.cargo/config.toml` in your project.
    > For instance, given a project `/my/project`,
    > it is recommended to put config files under `/my/project/.cargo`
    > or a new directory at the same level, such as `/my/project/.config`.

    ```toml
    # Relative path examples.

    [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
    runner = "foo"  # Searches `PATH` for `foo`.

    [source.vendored-sources]
    # Directory is relative to the parent where `.cargo/config.toml` is located.
    # For example, `/my/project/.cargo/config.toml` would result in `/my/project/vendor`.
    directory = "vendor"

    ## Executable paths with arguments

    Some Cargo commands invoke external programs, which can be configured as a path
    and some number of arguments.

    The value may be an array of strings like `['/path/to/program', 'somearg']` or
    a space-separated string like `'/path/to/program somearg'`. If the path to the
    executable contains a space, the list form must be used.

    If Cargo is passing other arguments to the program such as a path to open or
    run, they will be passed after the last specified argument in the value of an
    option of this format. If the specified program does not have path separators,
    Cargo will search `PATH` for its executable.

    ## Credentials

    Configuration values with sensitive information are stored in the
    `$CARGO_HOME/credentials.toml` file. This file is automatically created and updated
    by [`cargo login`] and [`cargo logout`] when using the [`cargo:token`] credential provider.

    Tokens are used by some Cargo commands such as [`cargo publish`] for
    authenticating with remote registries. Care should be taken to protect the
    tokens and to keep them secret.

    It follows the same format as Cargo config files.

    ```toml
    [registry]
    token = "…"   # Access token for crates.io

    [registries.<name>]
    token = "…"   # Access token for the named registry
    ```

    As with most other config values, tokens may be specified with environment
    variables. The token for [crates.io] may be specified with the
    `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` environment variable. Tokens for other registries may
    be specified with environment variables of the form
    `CARGO_REGISTRIES_<name>_TOKEN` where `<name>` is the name of the registry in
    all capital letters.

    > **Note:** Cargo also reads and writes credential files without the `.toml`
    > extension, such as `.cargo/credentials`. Support for the `.toml` extension
    > was added in version 1.39. In version 1.68, Cargo writes to the file with the
    > extension by default. However, for backward compatibility reason, when both
    > files exist, Cargo will read and write the file without the extension.

    ## Configuration keys

    This section documents all configuration keys. The description for keys with
    variable parts are annotated with angled brackets like `target.<triple>` where
    the `<triple>` part can be any [target triple] like
    `target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

    ### `paths`
    * Type: array of strings (paths)
    * Default: none
    * Environment: not supported

    An array of paths to local packages which are to be used as overrides for
    dependencies. For more information see the [Overriding Dependencies
    guide](overriding-dependencies.md#paths-overrides).

    ### `[alias]`
    * Type: string or array of strings
    * Default: see below
    * Environment: `CARGO_ALIAS_<name>`

    The `[alias]` table defines CLI command aliases. For example, running `cargo
    b` is an alias for running `cargo build`. Each key in the table is the
    subcommand, and the value is the actual command to run. The value may be an
    array of strings, where the first element is the command and the following are
    arguments. It may also be a string, which will be split on spaces into
    subcommand and arguments. The following aliases are built-in to Cargo:

    ```toml
    [alias]
    b = "build"
    c = "check"
    d = "doc"
    t = "test"
    r = "run"
    rm = "remove"
    ```

    Aliases are not allowed to redefine existing built-in commands.

    Aliases are recursive:

    ```toml
    [alias]
    rr = "run --release"
    recursive_example = "rr --example recursions"
    ```

    ### `[build]`

    The `[build]` table controls build-time operations and compiler settings.

    #### `build.jobs`
    * Type: integer or string
    * Default: number of logical CPUs
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`

    Sets the maximum number of compiler processes to run in parallel. If negative,
    it sets the maximum number of compiler processes to the number of logical CPUs
    plus provided value. Should not be 0. If a string `default` is provided, it sets
    the value back to defaults.

    Can be overridden with the `--jobs` CLI option.

    #### `build.rustc`
    * Type: string (program path)
    * Default: `"rustc"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTC` or `RUSTC`

    Sets the executable to use for `rustc`.

    #### `build.rustc-wrapper`
    * Type: string (program path)
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTC_WRAPPER` or `RUSTC_WRAPPER`

    Sets a wrapper to execute instead of `rustc`. The first argument passed to the
    wrapper is the path to the actual executable to use
    (i.e., `build.rustc`, if that is set, or `"rustc"` otherwise).

    #### `build.rustc-workspace-wrapper`
    * Type: string (program path)
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` or `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`

    Sets a wrapper to execute instead of `rustc`, for workspace members only. When building a
    single-package project without workspaces, that package is considered to be the workspace. The first
    argument passed to the wrapper is the path to the actual executable to use (i.e., `build.rustc`, if
    that is set, or `"rustc"` otherwise). It affects the filename hash so that artifacts produced by the
    wrapper are cached separately.

    If both `rustc-wrapper` and `rustc-workspace-wrapper` are set, then they will be nested:
    the final invocation is `$RUSTC_WRAPPER $RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER $RUSTC`.

    #### `build.rustdoc`
    * Type: string (program path)
    * Default: `"rustdoc"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTDOC` or `RUSTDOC`

    Sets the executable to use for `rustdoc`.

    #### `build.target`
    * Type: string or array of strings
    * Default: host platform
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`

    The default [target platform triples][target triple] to compile to.

    This allows passing either a string or an array of strings. Each string value
    is a target platform triple. The selected build targets will be built for each
    of the selected architectures.

    The string value may also be a relative path to a `.json` target spec file.

    Can be overridden with the `--target` CLI option.

    ```toml
    [build]
    target = ["x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu", "i686-unknown-linux-gnu"]
    ```

    #### `build.target-dir`
    * Type: string (path)
    * Default: `"target"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET_DIR` or `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`

    The path to where all compiler output is placed. The default if not specified
    is a directory named `target` located at the root of the workspace.

    Can be overridden with the `--target-dir` CLI option.

    #### `build.rustflags`
    * Type: string or array of strings
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS` or `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` or `RUSTFLAGS`

    Extra command-line flags to pass to `rustc`. The value may be an array of
    strings or a space-separated string.

    There are four mutually exclusive sources of extra flags. They are checked in
    order, with the first one being used:

    1. `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` environment variable.
    2. `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable.
    3. All matching `target.<triple>.rustflags` and `target.<cfg>.rustflags`
       config entries joined together.
    4. `build.rustflags` config value.

    Additional flags may also be passed with the [`cargo rustc`] command.

    If the `--target` flag (or [`build.target`](#buildtarget)) is used, then the
    flags will only be passed to the compiler for the target. Things being built
    for the host, such as build scripts or proc macros, will not receive the args.
    Without `--target`, the flags will be passed to all compiler invocations
    (including build scripts and proc macros) because dependencies are shared. If
    you have args that you do not want to pass to build scripts or proc macros and
    are building for the host, pass `--target` with the [host triple][target triple].

    It is not recommended to pass in flags that Cargo itself usually manages. For
    example, the flags driven by [profiles](profiles.md) are best handled by setting the
    appropriate profile setting.

    > **Caution**: Due to the low-level nature of passing flags directly to the
    > compiler, this may cause a conflict with future versions of Cargo which may
    > issue the same or similar flags on its own which may interfere with the
    > flags you specify. This is an area where Cargo may not always be backwards
    > compatible.

    #### `build.rustdocflags`
    * Type: string or array of strings
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTDOCFLAGS` or `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTDOCFLAGS` or `RUSTDOCFLAGS`

    Extra command-line flags to pass to `rustdoc`. The value may be an array of
    strings or a space-separated string.

    There are four mutually exclusive sources of extra flags. They are checked in
    order, with the first one being used:

    1. `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTDOCFLAGS` environment variable.
    2. `RUSTDOCFLAGS` environment variable.
    3. All matching `target.<triple>.rustdocflags` config entries joined together.
    4. `build.rustdocflags` config value.

    Additional flags may also be passed with the [`cargo rustdoc`] command.

    > **Caution**: Due to the low-level nature of passing flags directly to the
    > compiler, this may cause a conflict with future versions of Cargo which may

    > flags you specify. This is an area where Cargo may not always be backwards
    > compatible.

    #### `build.incremental`
    * Type: bool
    * Default: from profile
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_INCREMENTAL` or `CARGO_INCREMENTAL`

    Whether or not to perform [incremental compilation]. The default if not set is
    to use the value from the [profile](profiles.md#incremental). Otherwise this overrides the setting of
    all profiles.

    The `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` environment variable can be set to `1` to force enable
    incremental compilation for all profiles, or `0` to disable it. This env var
    overrides the config setting.

    #### `build.dep-info-basedir`
    * Type: string (path)
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_BUILD_DEP_INFO_BASEDIR`

    Strips the given path prefix from [dep
    info](../reference/build-cache.md#dep-info-files) file paths. This config setting
    is intended to convert absolute paths to relative paths for tools that require
    relative paths.

    The setting itself is a config-relative path. So, for example, a value of
    `"."` would strip all paths starting with the parent directory of the `.cargo`
    directory.

    #### `build.pipelining`

    This option is deprecated and unused. Cargo always has pipelining enabled.

    ### `[credential-alias]`
    * Type: string or array of strings
    * Default: empty
    * Environment: `CARGO_CREDENTIAL_ALIAS_<name>`

    The `[credential-alias]` table defines credential provider aliases.
    These aliases can be referenced as an element of the `registry.global-credential-providers`
    array, or as a credential provider for a specific registry
    under `registries.<NAME>.credential-provider`.

    If specified as a string, the value will be split on spaces into path and arguments.

    For example, to define an alias called `my-alias`:

    ```toml
    [credential-alias]
    my-alias = ["/usr/bin/cargo-credential-example", "--argument", "value", "--flag"]
    ```
    See [Registry Authentication](registry-authentication.md) for more information.

    ### `[doc]`

    The `[doc]` table defines options for the [`cargo doc`] command.

    #### `doc.browser`

    * Type: string or array of strings ([program path with args])
    * Default: `BROWSER` environment variable, or, if that is missing,
      opening the link in a system specific way

    This option sets the browser to be used by [`cargo doc`], overriding the
    `BROWSER` environment variable when opening documentation with the `--open`
    option.

    ### `[cargo-new]`

    The `[cargo-new]` table defines defaults for the [`cargo new`] command.

    #### `cargo-new.name`

    This option is deprecated and unused.

    #### `cargo-new.email`

    This option is deprecated and unused.

    #### `cargo-new.vcs`
    * Type: string
    * Default: `"git"` or `"none"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_CARGO_NEW_VCS`

    Specifies the source control system to use for initializing a new repository.
    Valid values are `git`, `hg` (for Mercurial), `pijul`, `fossil` or `none` to
    disable this behavior. Defaults to `git`, or `none` if already inside a VCS
    repository. Can be overridden with the `--vcs` CLI option.

    ### `[env]`

    The `[env]` section allows you to set additional environment variables for
    build scripts, rustc invocations, `cargo run` and `cargo build`.

    ```toml
    [env]
    OPENSSL_DIR = "/opt/openssl"
    ```

    By default, the variables specified will not override values that already exist
    in the environment. This behavior can be changed by setting the `force` flag.

    Setting the `relative` flag evaluates the value as a config-relative path that
    is relative to the parent directory of the `.cargo` directory that contains the
    `config.toml` file. The value of the environment variable will be the full
    absolute path.

    ```toml
    [env]
    TMPDIR = { value = "/home/tmp", force = true }
    OPENSSL_DIR = { value = "vendor/openssl", relative = true }

    ### `[future-incompat-report]`

    The `[future-incompat-report]` table controls setting for [future incompat reporting](future-incompat-report.md)

    #### `future-incompat-report.frequency`
    * Type: string
    * Default: `"always"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_FUTURE_INCOMPAT_REPORT_FREQUENCY`

    Controls how often we display a notification to the terminal when a future incompat report is available. Possible values:

    * `always` (default): Always display a notification when a command (e.g. `cargo build`) produces a future incompat report
    * `never`: Never display a notification

    ### `[cache]`

    The `[cache]` table defines settings for cargo's caches.

    #### Global caches

    When running `cargo` commands, Cargo will automatically track which files you are using within the global cache.
    Periodically, Cargo will delete files that have not been used for some period of time.
    It will delete files that have to be downloaded from the network if they have not been used in 3 months. Files that can be generated without network access will be deleted if they have not been used in 1 month.

    The automatic deletion of files only occurs when running commands that are already doing a significant amount of work, such as all of the build commands (`cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo check`, etc.), and `cargo fetch`.

    Automatic deletion is disabled if cargo is offline such as with `--offline` or `--frozen` to avoid deleting artifacts that may need to be used if you are offline for a long period of time.

    > **Note**: This tracking is currently only implemented for the global cache in Cargo's home directory.
    > This includes registry indexes and source files downloaded from registries and git dependencies.
    > Support for tracking build artifacts is not yet implemented, and tracked in [cargo#13136](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/13136).
    >
    > Additionally, there is an unstable feature to support *manually* triggering cache cleaning, and to further customize the configuration options.
    > See the [Unstable chapter](unstable.md#gc) for more information.

    #### `cache.auto-clean-frequency`
    * Type: string
    * Default: `"1 day"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_CACHE_AUTO_CLEAN_FREQUENCY`

    This option defines how often Cargo will automatically delete unused files in the global cache.
    This does *not* define how old the files must be, those thresholds are described [above](#global-caches).

    It supports the following settings:

    * `"never"` --- Never deletes old files.
    * `"always"` --- Checks to delete old files every time Cargo runs.
    * An integer followed by "seconds", "minutes", "hours", "days", "weeks", or "months" --- Checks to delete old files at most the given time frame.

    ### `[http]`

    The `[http]` table defines settings for HTTP behavior. This includes fetching
    crate dependencies and accessing remote git repositories.

    #### `http.debug`
    * Type: boolean
    * Default: false
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_DEBUG`

    If `true`, enables debugging of HTTP requests. The debug information can be
    seen by setting the `CARGO_LOG=network=debug` environment
    variable (or use `network=trace` for even more information).

    Be wary when posting logs from this output in a public location. The output
    may include headers with authentication tokens which you don't want to leak!
    Be sure to review logs before posting them.

    #### `http.proxy`
    * Type: string
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy` or `http_proxy`

    Sets an HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. The format is in [libcurl format] as in
    `[protocol://]host[:port]`. If not set, Cargo will also check the `http.proxy`
    setting in your global git configuration. If none of those are set, the
    `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy` environment variables set the proxy for HTTPS
    requests, and `http_proxy` sets it for HTTP requests.

    #### `http.timeout`
    * Type: integer
    * Default: 30
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_TIMEOUT` or `HTTP_TIMEOUT`

    Sets the timeout for each HTTP request, in seconds.

    #### `http.cainfo`
    * Type: string (path)
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_CAINFO`

    Path to a Certificate Authority (CA) bundle file, used to verify TLS
    certificates. If not specified, Cargo attempts to use the system certificates.

    #### `http.check-revoke`
    * Type: boolean
    * Default: true (Windows) false (all others)
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_CHECK_REVOKE`

    This determines whether or not TLS certificate revocation checks should be
    performed. This only works on Windows.

    #### `http.ssl-version`
    * Type: string or min/max table
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_SSL_VERSION`

    This sets the minimum TLS version to use. It takes a string, with one of the
    possible values of `"default"`, `"tlsv1"`, `"tlsv1.0"`, `"tlsv1.1"`, `"tlsv1.2"`, or
    `"tlsv1.3"`.

    This may alternatively take a table with two keys, `min` and `max`, which each
    take a string value of the same kind that specifies the minimum and maximum
    range of TLS versions to use.

    The default is a minimum version of `"tlsv1.0"` and a max of the newest version
    supported on your platform, typically `"tlsv1.3"`.

    #### `http.low-speed-limit`
    * Type: integer
    * Default: 10
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT`

    This setting controls timeout behavior for slow connections. If the average
    transfer speed in bytes per second is below the given value for
    [`http.timeout`](#httptimeout) seconds (default 30 seconds), then the
    connection is considered too slow and Cargo will abort and retry.

    #### `http.multiplexing`
    * Type: boolean
    * Default: true
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_MULTIPLEXING`

    When `true`, Cargo will attempt to use the HTTP2 protocol with multiplexing.
    This allows multiple requests to use the same connection, usually improving
    performance when fetching multiple files. If `false`, Cargo will use HTTP 1.1
    without pipelining.

    #### `http.user-agent`
    * Type: string
    * Default: Cargo's version
    * Environment: `CARGO_HTTP_USER_AGENT`

    Specifies a custom user-agent header to use. The default if not specified is a
    string that includes Cargo's version.

    ### `[install]`

    The `[install]` table defines defaults for the [`cargo install`] command.

    #### `install.root`
    * Type: string (path)
    * Default: Cargo's home directory
    * Environment: `CARGO_INSTALL_ROOT`

    Sets the path to the root directory for installing executables for [`cargo
    install`]. Executables go into a `bin` directory underneath the root.

    To track information of installed executables, some extra files, such as
    `.crates.toml` and `.crates2.json`, are also created under this root.

    The default if not specified is Cargo's home directory (default `.cargo` in
    your home directory).

    Can be overridden with the `--root` command-line option.

    ### `[net]`

    The `[net]` table controls networking configuration.

    #### `net.retry`
    * Type: integer
    * Default: 3
    * Environment: `CARGO_NET_RETRY`

    Number of times to retry possibly spurious network errors.

    #### `net.git-fetch-with-cli`
    * Type: boolean
    * Default: false
    * Environment: `CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI`

    If this is `true`, then Cargo will use the `git` executable to fetch registry
    indexes and git dependencies. If `false`, then it uses a built-in `git`
    library.

    Setting this to `true` can be helpful if you have special authentication
    requirements that Cargo does not support. See [Git
    Authentication](../appendix/git-authentication.md) for more information about
    setting up git authentication.

    #### `net.offline`
    * Type: boolean
    * Default: false
    * Environment: `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE`

    If this is `true`, then Cargo will avoid accessing the network, and attempt to
    proceed with locally cached data. If `false`, Cargo will access the network as
    needed, and generate an error if it encounters a network error.

    Can be overridden with the `--offline` command-line option.

    #### `net.ssh`

    The `[net.ssh]` table contains settings for SSH connections.

    #### `net.ssh.known-hosts`
    * Type: array of strings
    * Default: see description
    * Environment: not supported

    The `known-hosts` array contains a list of SSH host keys that should be
    accepted as valid when connecting to an SSH server (such as for SSH git
    dependencies). Each entry should be a string in a format similar to OpenSSH
    `known_hosts` files. Each string should start with one or more hostnames
    separated by commas, a space, the key type name, a space, and the
    base64-encoded key. For example:

    ```toml
    [net.ssh]
    known-hosts = [
        "example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIFO4Q5T0UV0SQevair9PFwoxY9dl4pQl3u5phoqJH3cF"
    ]
    ```

    Cargo will attempt to load known hosts keys from common locations supported in
    OpenSSH, and will join those with any listed in a Cargo configuration file.
    If any matching entry has the correct key, the connection will be allowed.

    Cargo comes with the host keys for [github.com][github-keys] built-in. If
    those ever change, you can add the new keys to the config or known_hosts file.

    See [Git Authentication](../appendix/git-authentication.md#ssh-known-hosts)
    for more details.

    ### `[patch]`

    Just as you can override dependencies using [`[patch]` in
    `Cargo.toml`](overriding-dependencies.md#the-patch-section), you can
    override them in the cargo configuration file to apply those patches to
    any affected build. The format is identical to the one used in
    `Cargo.toml`.

    Since `.cargo/config.toml` files are not usually checked into source
    control, you should prefer patching using `Cargo.toml` where possible to
    ensure that other developers can compile your crate in their own
    environments. Patching through cargo configuration files is generally
    only appropriate when the patch section is automatically generated by an
    external build tool.

    If a given dependency is patched both in a cargo configuration file and
    a `Cargo.toml` file, the patch in the configuration file is used. If
    multiple configuration files patch the same dependency, standard cargo
    configuration merging is used, which prefers the value defined closest
    to the current directory, with `$HOME/.cargo/config.toml` taking the
    lowest precedence.

    Relative `path` dependencies in such a `[patch]` section are resolved
    relative to the configuration file they appear in.

    ### `[profile]`

    The `[profile]` table can be used to globally change profile settings, and
    override settings specified in `Cargo.toml`. It has the same syntax and
    options as profiles specified in `Cargo.toml`. See the [Profiles chapter] for
    details about the options.

    ### `[resolver]`

    The `[resolver]` table overrides [dependency resolution behavior](resolver.md) for local development (e.g. excludes `cargo install`).

    #### `resolver.incompatible-rust-versions`
    * Type: string
    * Default: See [`resolver`](resolver.md#resolver-versions) docs
    * Environment: `CARGO_RESOLVER_INCOMPATIBLE_RUST_VERSIONS`

    When resolving which version of a dependency to use, select how versions with incompatible `package.rust-version`s are treated.
    Values include:
    - `allow`: treat `rust-version`-incompatible versions like any other version
    - `fallback`: only consider `rust-version`-incompatible versions if no other version matched

    Can be overridden with
    - `--ignore-rust-version` CLI option
    - Setting the dependency's version requirement higher than any version with a compatible `rust-version`
    - Specifying the version to `cargo update` with `--precise`

    See the [resolver](resolver.md#rust-version) chapter for more details.

    > **MSRV:**
    > - `allow` is supported on any version
    > - `fallback` is respected as of 1.84

    ### `[registries]`

    The `[registries]` table is used for specifying additional [registries]. It
    consists of a sub-table for each named registry.

    #### `registries.<name>.index`
    * Type: string (url)
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRIES_<name>_INDEX`

    Specifies the URL of the index for the registry.

    #### `registries.<name>.token`
    * Type: string
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRIES_<name>_TOKEN`

    Specifies the authentication token for the given registry. This value should
    only appear in the [credentials](#credentials) file. This is used for registry
    commands like [`cargo publish`] that require authentication.

    Can be overridden with the `--token` command-line option.

    #### `registries.<name>.credential-provider`
    * Type: string or array of path and arguments
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRIES_<name>_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER`

    Specifies the credential provider for the given registry. If not set, the
    providers in [`registry.global-credential-providers`](#registryglobal-credential-providers)
    will be used.

    If specified as a string, path and arguments will be split on spaces. For
    paths or arguments that contain spaces, use an array.

    If the value exists in the [`[credential-alias]`](#credential-alias) table, the alias will be used.

    See [Registry Authentication](registry-authentication.md) for more information.

    #### `registries.crates-io.protocol`
    * Type: string
    * Default: `"sparse"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRIES_CRATES_IO_PROTOCOL`

    Specifies the protocol used to access crates.io. Allowed values are `git` or `sparse`.

    `git` causes Cargo to clone the entire index of all packages ever published to [crates.io] from <https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index/>.
    This can have performance implications due to the size of the index.
    `sparse` is a newer protocol which uses HTTPS to download only what is necessary from <https://index.crates.io/>.
    This can result in a significant performance improvement for resolving new dependencies in most situations.

    More information about registry protocols may be found in the [Registries chapter](registries.md).

    ### `[registry]`

    The `[registry]` table controls the default registry used when one is not
    specified.

    #### `registry.index`

    This value is no longer accepted and should not be used.

    #### `registry.default`
    * Type: string
    * Default: `"crates-io"`
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRY_DEFAULT`

    The name of the registry (from the [`registries` table](#registries)) to use
    by default for registry commands like [`cargo publish`].

    Can be overridden with the `--registry` command-line option.

    #### `registry.credential-provider`
    * Type: string or array of path and arguments
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRY_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER`

    Specifies the credential provider for [crates.io]. If not set, the
    providers in [`registry.global-credential-providers`](#registryglobal-credential-providers)
    will be used.

    If specified as a string, path and arguments will be split on spaces. For
    paths or arguments that contain spaces, use an array.

    If the value exists in the `[credential-alias]` table, the alias will be used.

    See [Registry Authentication](registry-authentication.md) for more information.

    #### `registry.token`
    * Type: string
    * Default: none
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`

    Specifies the authentication token for [crates.io]. This value should only
    appear in the [credentials](#credentials) file. This is used for registry
    commands like [`cargo publish`] that require authentication.

    Can be overridden with the `--token` command-line option.

    #### `registry.global-credential-providers`
    * Type: array
    * Default: `["cargo:token"]`
    * Environment: `CARGO_REGISTRY_GLOBAL_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDERS`

    Specifies the list of global credential providers. If credential provider is not set
    for a specific registry using `registries.<name>.credential-provider`, Cargo will use
    the credential providers in this list. Providers toward the end of the list have precedence.

    Path and arguments are split on spaces. If the path or arguments contains spaces, the credential
    provider should be defined in the [`[credential-alias]`](#credential-alias) table and
    referenced here by its alias.

    See [Registry Authentication](registry-authentication.md) for more information.

    ### `[source]`

    The `[source]` table defines the registry sources available. See [Source
    Replacement] for more information. It consists of a sub-table for each named
    source. A source should only define one kind (directory, registry,
    local-registry, or git).

    #### `source.<name>.replace-with`
    * Type: string
    * Default: none

    # SemVer Compatibility

    This chapter provides details on what is conventionally considered a
    compatible or breaking SemVer change for new releases of a package. See the
    [SemVer compatibility] section for details on what SemVer is, and how Cargo
    uses it to ensure compatibility of libraries.

    These are only *guidelines*, and not necessarily hard-and-fast rules that all
    projects will obey. The [Change categories] section details how this guide
    classifies the level and severity of a change. Most of this guide focuses on
    changes that will cause `cargo` and `rustc` to fail to build something that
    previously worked. Almost every change carries some risk that it will
    negatively affect the runtime behavior, and for those cases it is usually a
    judgment call by the project maintainers whether or not it is a
    SemVer-incompatible change.

    [Change categories]: #change-categories
    [SemVer compatibility]: resolver.md#semver-compatibility

    ## Change categories

    All of the policies listed below are categorized by the level of change:

    * **Major change**: a change that requires a major SemVer bump.
    * **Minor change**: a change that requires only a minor SemVer bump.
    * **Possibly-breaking change**: a change that some projects may consider major
      and others consider minor.

    The "Possibly-breaking" category covers changes that have the *potential* to
    break during an update, but may not necessarily cause a breakage. The impact
    of these changes should be considered carefully. The exact nature will depend
    on the change and the principles of the project maintainers.

    Some projects may choose to only bump the patch number on a minor change. It
    is encouraged to follow the SemVer spec, and only apply bug fixes in patch
    releases. However, a bug fix may require an API change that is marked as a
    "minor change", and shouldn't affect compatibility. This guide does not take a
    stance on how each individual "minor change" should be treated, as the
    difference between minor and patch changes are conventions that depend on the
    nature of the change.

    Some changes are marked as "minor", even though they carry the potential risk
    of breaking a build. This is for situations where the potential is extremely
    low, and the potentially breaking code is unlikely to be written in idiomatic
    Rust, or is specifically discouraged from use.

    This guide uses the terms "major" and "minor" assuming this relates to a
    "1.0.0" release or later. Initial development releases starting with "0.y.z"
    can treat changes in "y" as a major release, and "z" as a minor release.
    "0.0.z" releases are always major changes. This is because Cargo uses the
    convention that only changes in the left-most non-zero component are
    considered incompatible.

    ## API compatibility

    All of the examples below contain three parts: the original code, the code
    after it has been modified, and an example usage of the code that could appear
    in another project. In a minor change, the example usage should successfully
    build with both the before and after versions.

    ### Major: renaming/moving/removing any public items {#item-remove}

    The absence of a publicly exposed [item][items] will cause any uses of that item to
    fail to compile.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    // ... item has been removed

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    fn main() {
        updated_crate::foo(); // Error: cannot find function `foo`
    }
    ```

    This includes adding any sort of [`cfg` attribute] which can change which
    items or behavior is available based on [conditional compilation].

    Mitigating strategies:
    * Mark items to be removed as [deprecated], and then remove them at a later
      date in a SemVer-breaking release.
    * Mark renamed items as [deprecated], and use a [`pub use`] item to re-export
      to the old name.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the SemVer (Semantic Versioning) guidelines described in the Cargo documentation for API compatibility?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user ensure that their code remains compatible with both the old and new versions of a crate during a major API change, as demonstrated in the example?
  documentationQuestion3: What mitigation strategies are recommended in the Cargo documentation to handle the removal or renaming of public items during a SemVer-breaking change?

    Documentation text:

    ### Minor: adding new public items {#item-new}

    Adding new, public [items] is a minor change.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    // ... absence of item

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    // `foo` is not used since it didn't previously exist.
    ```

    Note that in some rare cases this can be a **breaking change** due to glob
    imports. For example, if you add a new trait, and a project has used a glob
    import that brings that trait into scope, and the new trait introduces an
    associated item that conflicts with any types it is implemented on, this can
    cause a compile-time error due to the ambiguity. Example:

    ```rust,ignore
    // Breaking change example

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    // ... absence of trait

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub trait NewTrait {
        fn foo(&self) {}
    }

    impl NewTrait for i32 {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::*;

    pub trait LocalTrait {
        fn foo(&self) {}
    }

    impl LocalTrait for i32 {}

    fn main() {
        123i32.foo(); // Error:  multiple applicable items in scope
    }
    ```

    This is not considered a major change because conventionally glob imports are
    a known forwards-compatibility hazard. Glob imports of items from external
    crates should be avoided.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the minor version increment in Rust crates according to the Cargo documentation?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user avoid potential breaking changes when adding a new public trait with glob imports in Rust?
  documentationQuestion3: Provide an example of a scenario where adding a new public function in a Rust crate would be considered a minor version change.

    ### Major: Changing the alignment, layout, or size of a well-defined type {#type-layout}

    It is a breaking change to change the alignment, layout, or size of a type that was previously well-defined.

    In general, types that use the [the default representation] do not have a well-defined alignment, layout, or size.
    The compiler is free to alter the alignment, layout, or size, so code should not make any assumptions about it.

    > **Note**: It may be possible for external crates to break if they make assumptions about the alignment, layout, or size of a type even if it is not well-defined.
    > This is not considered a SemVer breaking change since those assumptions should not be made.

    Some examples of changes that are not a breaking change are (assuming no other rules in this guide are violated):

    * Adding, removing, reordering, or changing fields of a default representation struct, union, or enum in such a way that the change follows the other rules in this guide (for example, using `non_exhaustive` to allow those changes, or changes to private fields that are already private).
      See [struct-add-private-field-when-public](#struct-add-private-field-when-public), [struct-add-public-field-when-no-private](#struct-add-public-field-when-no-private), [struct-private-fields-with-private](#struct-private-fields-with-private), [enum-fields-new](#enum-fields-new).
    * Adding variants to a default representation enum, if the enum uses `non_exhaustive`.
      This may change the alignment or size of the enumeration, but those are not well-defined.
      See [enum-variant-new](#enum-variant-new).
    * Adding, removing, reordering, or changing private fields of a `repr(C)` struct, union, or enum, following the other rules in this guide (for example, using `non_exhaustive`, or adding private fields when other private fields already exist).
      See [repr-c-private-change](#repr-c-private-change).
    * Adding variants to a `repr(C)` enum, if the enum uses `non_exhaustive`.
      See [repr-c-enum-variant-new](#repr-c-enum-variant-new).
    * Adding `repr(C)` to a default representation struct, union, or enum.
      See [repr-c-add](#repr-c-add).
    * Adding `repr(<int>)` [primitive representation] to an enum.
      See [repr-int-enum-add](#repr-int-enum-add).
    * Adding `repr(transparent)` to a default representation struct or enum.
      See [repr-transparent-add](#repr-transparent-add).

    Types that use the [`repr` attribute] can be said to have an alignment and layout that is defined in some way that code may make some assumptions about that may break as a result of changing that type.

    In some cases, types with a `repr` attribute may not have an alignment, layout, or size that is well-defined.
    In these cases, it may be safe to make changes to the types, though care should be exercised.
    For example, types with private fields that do not otherwise document their alignment, layout, or size guarantees cannot be relied upon by external crates since the public API does not fully define the alignment, layout, or size of the type.

    A common example where a type with *private* fields is well-defined is a type with a single private field with a generic type, using `repr(transparent)`,
    and the prose of the documentation discusses that it is transparent to the generic type.
    For example, see [`UnsafeCell`].

    Some examples of breaking changes are:

    * Adding `repr(packed)` to a struct or union.
      See [repr-packed-add](#repr-packed-add).
    * Adding `repr(align)` to a struct, union, or enum.
      See [repr-align-add](#repr-align-add).
    * Removing `repr(packed)` from a struct or union.
      See [repr-packed-remove](#repr-packed-remove).
    * Changing the value N of `repr(packed(N))` if that changes the alignment or layout.
      See [repr-packed-n-change](#repr-packed-n-change).
    * Changing the value N of `repr(align(N))` if that changes the alignment.
      See [repr-align-n-change](#repr-align-n-change).
    * Removing `repr(align)` from a struct, union, or enum.
      See [repr-align-remove](#repr-align-remove).
    * Changing the order of public fields of a `repr(C)` type.
      See [repr-c-shuffle](#repr-c-shuffle).
    * Removing `repr(C)` from a struct, union, or enum.
      See [repr-c-remove](#repr-c-remove).
    * Removing `repr(<int>)` from an enum.
      See [repr-int-enum-remove](#repr-int-enum-remove).
    * Changing the primitive representation of a `repr(<int>)` enum.
      See [repr-int-enum-change](#repr-int-enum-change).
    * Removing `repr(transparent)` from a struct or enum.
      See [repr-transparent-remove](#repr-transparent-remove).

    Documentation text:

    #### Minor: `repr(C)` add, remove, or change a private field {#repr-c-private-change}

    It is usually safe to add, remove, or change a private field of a `repr(C)` struct, union, or enum, assuming it follows the other guidelines in this guide (see [struct-add-private-field-when-public](#struct-add-private-field-when-public), [struct-add-public-field-when-no-private](#struct-add-public-field-when-no-private), [struct-private-fields-with-private](#struct-private-fields-with-private), [enum-fields-new](#enum-fields-new)).

    For example, adding private fields can only be done if there are already other private fields, or it is `non_exhaustive`.
    Public fields may be added if there are private fields, or it is `non_exhaustive`, and the addition does not alter the layout of the other fields.

    However, this may change the size and alignment of the type.
    Care should be taken if the size or alignment changes.
    Code should not make assumptions about the size or alignment of types with private fields or `non_exhaustive` unless it has a documented size or alignment.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[derive(Default)]
    #[repr(C)]
    pub struct Example {
        pub f1: i32,
        f2: i32, // a private field
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[derive(Default)]
    #[repr(C)]
    pub struct Example {
        pub f1: i32,
        f2: i32,
        f3: i32, // a new field
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    fn main() {
        // NOTE: Users should not make assumptions about the size or alignment
        // since they are not documented.
        let f = updated_crate::Example::default();
    }
    ```

    #### Minor: `repr(C)` add enum variant {#repr-c-enum-variant-new}

    It is usually safe to add variants to a `repr(C)` enum, if the enum uses `non_exhaustive`.
    See [enum-variant-new](#enum-variant-new) for more discussion.

    Note that this may be a breaking change since it changes the size and alignment of the type.
    See [repr-c-private-change](#repr-c-private-change) for similar concerns.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[repr(C)]
    #[non_exhaustive]
    pub enum Example {
        Variant1 { f1: i16 },
        Variant2 { f1: i32 },
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(C)]
    #[non_exhaustive]
    pub enum Example {
        Variant1 { f1: i16 },
        Variant2 { f1: i32 },
        Variant3 { f1: i64 }, // added
    }

    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    fn main() {
        // NOTE: Users should not make assumptions about the size or alignment
        // since they are not specified. For example, this raised the size from 8
        // to 16 bytes.
        let f = updated_crate::Example::Variant2 { f1: 123 };
    }
    ```

    #### Minor: Adding `repr(C)` to a default representation {#repr-c-add}

    It is safe to add `repr(C)` to a struct, union, or enum with [the default representation].
    This is safe because users should not make assumptions about the alignment, layout, or size of types with the default representation.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Example {
        pub f1: i32,
        pub f2: i16,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(C)] // added
    pub struct Example {
        pub f1: i32,
        pub f2: i16,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    fn main() {
        let f = updated_crate::Example { f1: 123, f2: 456 };
    }
    ```

    #### Minor: Adding `repr(<int>)` to an enum {#repr-int-enum-add}

    It is safe to add `repr(<int>)` [primitive representation] to an enum with [the default representation].
    This is safe because users should not make assumptions about the alignment, layout, or size of an enum with the default representation.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub enum E {
        Variant1,
        Variant2(i32),
        Variant3 { f1: f64 },
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(i32)] // added
    pub enum E {
        Variant1,
        Variant2(i32),
        Variant3 { f1: f64 },
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    fn main() {
        let x = updated_crate::E::Variant3 { f1: 1.23 };
    }
    ```

    #### Minor: Adding `repr(transparent)` to a default representation struct or enum {#repr-transparent-add}

    It is safe to add `repr(transparent)` to a struct or enum with [the default representation].
    This is safe because users should not make assumptions about the alignment, layout, or size of a struct or enum with the default representation.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct Example<T>(T);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[derive(Default)]
    #[repr(transparent)] // added
    pub struct Example<T>(T);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    fn main() {
        let x = updated_crate::Example::<i32>::default();
    }
    ```

    #### Major: Adding `repr(packed)` to a struct or union {#repr-packed-add}

    It is a breaking change to add `repr(packed)` to a struct or union.
    Making a type `repr(packed)` makes changes that can break code, such as being invalid to take a reference to a field, or causing truncation of disjoint closure captures.

    <!-- TODO: If all fields are private, should this be safe to do? -->

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Example {
        pub f1: u8,
        pub f2: u16,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(packed)] // added
    pub struct Example {
        pub f1: u8,
        pub f2: u16,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    fn main() {
        let f = updated_crate::Example { f1: 1, f2: 2 };
        let x = &f.f2; // Error: reference to packed field is unaligned
    }
    ```

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Example(pub i32, pub i32);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(packed)]
    pub struct Example(pub i32, pub i32);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    fn main() {
        let mut f = updated_crate::Example(123, 456);
        let c = || {
            // Without repr(packed), the closure precisely captures `&f.0`.
            // With repr(packed), the closure captures `&f` to avoid undefined behavior.
            let a = f.0;
        };
        f.1 = 789; // Error: cannot assign to `f.1` because it is borrowed
        c();
    }
    ```

    #### Major: Adding `repr(align)` to a struct, union, or enum {#repr-align-add}

    It is a breaking change to add `repr(align)` to a struct, union, or enum.
    Making a type `repr(align)` would break any use of that type in a `repr(packed)` type because that combination is not allowed.

    <!-- TODO: This seems like it should be extraordinarily rare. Should there be any exceptions carved out for this? -->

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Aligned {
        pub a: i32,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(align(8))] // added
    pub struct Aligned {
        pub a: i32,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::Aligned;

    #[repr(packed)]
    pub struct Packed { // Error: packed type cannot transitively contain a `#[repr(align)]` type
        f1: Aligned,
    }

    fn main() {
        let p = Packed {
            f1: Aligned { a: 123 },
        };
    }
    ```

    #### Major: Removing `repr(packed)` from a struct or union {#repr-packed-remove}

    It is a breaking change to remove `repr(packed)` from a struct or union.
    This may change the alignment or layout that extern crates are relying on.

    If any fields are public, then removing `repr(packed)` may change the way disjoint closure captures work.
    In some cases, this can cause code to break, similar to those outlined in the [edition guide][edition-closures].

    [edition-closures]: ../../edition-guide/rust-2021/disjoint-capture-in-closures.html

    ```rust,ignore

        // Some assumption about the size of the type.
        // Without `packed`, this fails since the size is 4.
        const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<Packed>() == 3); // Error: evaluation of constant value failed
    }
    ```

    }
    unsafe impl Send for Packed {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(C)] // removed packed
    pub struct Packed {
        pub a: *mut i32,
        pub b: i32,
    }
    unsafe impl Send for Packed {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::Packed;

    fn main() {
        let mut x = 123;

        let p = Packed {
            a: &mut x as *mut i32,
            b: 456,
        };

        // When the structure was packed, the closure captures `p` which is Send.
        // When `packed` is removed, this ends up capturing `p.a` which is not Send.
        std::thread::spawn(move || unsafe {
            *(p.a) += 1; // Error: cannot be sent between threads safely
        });
    }
    ```

    #### Major: Changing the value N of `repr(packed(N))` if that changes the alignment or layout {#repr-packed-n-change}

    It is a breaking change to change the value of N of `repr(packed(N))` if that changes the alignment or layout.
    This may change the alignment or layout that external crates are relying on.

    If the value `N` is lowered below the alignment of a public field, then that would break any code that attempts to take a reference of that field.

    Note that some changes to `N` may not change the alignment or layout, for example increasing it when the current value is already equal to the natural alignment of the type.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[repr(packed(4))]
    pub struct Packed {

        pub b: u32,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(packed(2))] // changed to 2

    fn main() {
        let p = Packed { a: 1, b: 2 };
        let x = &p.b; // Error: reference to packed field is unaligned
    }
    ```

    #### Major: Changing the value N of `repr(align(N))` if that changes the alignment {#repr-align-n-change}

    It is a breaking change to change the value `N` of `repr(align(N))` if that changes the alignment.
    This may change the alignment that external crates are relying on.

    This change should be safe to make if the type is not well-defined as discussed in [type layout](#type-layout) (such as having any private fields and having an undocumented alignment or layout).

    Note that some changes to `N` may not change the alignment or layout, for example decreasing it when the current value is already equal to or less than the natural alignment of the type.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[repr(align(8))]
    pub struct Packed {
        pub a: u8,
        pub b: u32,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[repr(align(4))] // changed to 4
    pub struct Packed {
        pub a: u8,
        pub b: u32,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::Packed;

    fn main() {
        let p = Packed { a: 1, b: 2 };
        // Some assumption about the size of the type.
        // The alignment has changed from 8 to 4.
        const _: () = assert!(std::mem::align_of::<Packed>() == 8); // Error: evaluation of constant value failed
    }
    ```

    #### Major: Removing `repr(align)` from a struct, union, or enum {#repr-align-remove}

    It is a breaking change to remove `repr(align)` from a struct, union, or enum, if their layout was well-defined.
    This may change the alignment or layout that external crates are relying on.

    This change should be safe to make if the type is not well-defined as discussed in [type layout](#type-layout) (such as having any private fields and having an undocumented alignment).

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before

    ### Major: adding a private struct field when all current fields are public {#struct-add-private-field-when-public}

    When a private field is added to a struct that previously had all public fields,
    this will break any code that attempts to construct it with a [struct literal].

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    fn main() {
        let x = updated_crate::Foo { f1: 123 }; // Error: cannot construct `Foo`
    }
    ```

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Do not add new fields to all-public field structs.
    * Mark structs as [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] when first introducing

    ### Major: adding a public field when no private field exists {#struct-add-public-field-when-no-private}

    When a public field is added to a struct that has all public fields, this will
    break any code that attempts to construct it with a [struct literal].

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    fn main() {
        let x = updated_crate::Foo { f1: 123 }; // Error: missing field `f2`

    * Mark structs as [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] when first introducing
      a struct to prevent users from using struct literal syntax, and instead
      provide a constructor method and/or [Default] implementation.

    ### Minor: adding or removing private fields when at least one already exists {#struct-private-fields-with-private}

    It is safe to add or remove private fields from a struct when the struct
    already has at least one private field.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct Foo {

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct Foo {
        f2: f64,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    fn main() {
        // Cannot access private fields.
        let x = updated_crate::Foo::default();
    }
    ```

    This is safe because existing code cannot use a [struct literal] to construct
    it, nor exhaustively match its contents.

    Note that for tuple structs, this is a **major change** if the tuple contains
    public fields, and the addition or removal of a private field changes the
    index of any public field.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct Foo(pub i32, i32);

    This is safe because existing code cannot use a [struct literal] to construct
    it, nor match its contents.

    ### Major: adding new enum variants (without `non_exhaustive`) {#enum-variant-new}

    It is a breaking change to add a new enum variant if the enum does not use the
    [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] attribute.

    Mitigation strategies:
    * When introducing the enum, mark the variant as [`non_exhaustive`][non_exhaustive]
      so that it cannot be constructed or matched without wildcards.
      ```rust,ignore,skip

          #[non_exhaustive]
          Variant1{f1: i32}
      }

    * When introducing the enum, use an explicit struct as a value, where you can
      have control over the field visibility.

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Introduce new items with default implementations to cover the new

    ### Possibly-breaking: adding a defaulted trait item {#trait-new-default-item}

    It is usually safe to add a defaulted trait item. However, this can sometimes
    cause a compile error. For example, this can introduce an ambiguity if a
    method of the same name exists in another trait.

    fn main() {
        let x = Foo;
        x.foo(); // Error: multiple applicable items in scope
    }
    ```

    Note that this ambiguity does *not* exist for name collisions on [inherent
    implementations], as they take priority over trait items.

    See [trait-object-safety](#trait-object-safety) for a special case to consider
    when adding trait items.

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Some projects may deem this acceptable breakage, particularly if the new
      item name is unlikely to collide with any existing code. Choose names
      carefully to help avoid these collisions. Additionally, it may be acceptable
      to require downstream users to add [disambiguation syntax] to select the
      correct function when updating the dependency.

    ### Possibly-breaking change: adding any inherent items {#impl-item-new}

    Usually adding inherent items to an implementation should be safe because
    inherent items take priority over trait items. However, in some cases the
    collision can cause problems if the name is the same as an implemented trait
    item with a different signature.

    ```rust,ignore
    // Breaking change example

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Foo;

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub struct Foo;

    impl Foo {
        pub fn foo(&self) {}
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::Foo;

    trait Trait {
        fn foo(&self, x: i32) {}
    }

    impl Trait for Foo {}

    fn main() {
        let x = Foo;
        x.foo(1); // Error: this method takes 0 arguments but 1 argument was supplied
    }
    ```

    Note that if the signatures match, there would not be a compile-time error,
    but possibly a silent change in runtime behavior (because it is now executing
    a different function).

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Some projects may deem this acceptable breakage, particularly if the new
      item name is unlikely to collide with any existing code. Choose names
      carefully to help avoid these collisions. Additionally, it may be acceptable
      to require downstream users to add [disambiguation syntax] to select the
      correct function when updating the dependency.

    ### Major: tightening generic bounds {#generic-bounds-tighten}

    It is a breaking change to tighten generic bounds on a type since this can
    break users expecting the looser bounds.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Foo<A> {
        pub f1: A,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub struct Foo<A: Eq> {
        pub f1: A,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::Foo;

    fn main() {
        let s = Foo { f1: 1.23 }; // Error: the trait bound `{float}: Eq` is not satisfied
    }
    ```

    ### Minor: loosening generic bounds {#generic-bounds-loosen}

    It is safe to loosen the generic bounds on a type, as it only expands what is
    allowed.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Foo<A: Clone> {
        pub f1: A,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub struct Foo<A> {
        pub f1: A,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    use updated_crate::Foo;

    fn main() {
        let s = Foo { f1: 123 };
    }
    ```

    ### Minor: adding defaulted type parameters {#generic-new-default}

    It is safe to add a type parameter to a type as long as it has a default. All
    existing references will use the default without needing to specify the
    parameter.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct Foo {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct Foo<A = i32> {
        f1: A,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    use updated_crate::Foo;

    fn main() {
        let s: Foo = Default::default();
    }
    ```

    ### Minor: generalizing a type to use generics (with identical types) {#generic-generalize-identical}

    A struct or enum field can change from a concrete type to a generic type
    parameter, provided that the change results in an identical type for all
    existing use cases. For example, the following change is permitted:

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Foo(pub u8);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub struct Foo<T = u8>(pub T);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    use updated_crate::Foo;

    fn main() {
        let s: Foo = Foo(123);
    }
    ```

    because existing uses of `Foo` are shorthand for `Foo<u8>` which yields the
    identical field type.

    ### Major: generalizing a type to use generics (with possibly different types) {#generic-generalize-different}

    Changing a struct or enum field from a concrete type to a generic type
    parameter can break if the type can change.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Foo<T = u8>(pub T, pub u8);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub struct Foo<T = u8>(pub T, pub T);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::Foo;

    fn main() {
        let s: Foo<f32> = Foo(3.14, 123); // Error: mismatched types
    }
    ```

    ### Minor: changing a generic type to a more generic type {#generic-more-generic}

    It is safe to change a generic type to a more generic one. For example, the
    following adds a generic parameter that defaults to the original type, which
    is safe because all existing users will be using the same type for both
    fields, the defaulted parameter does not need to be specified.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Foo<T>(pub T, pub T);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub struct Foo<T, U = T>(pub T, pub U);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    use updated_crate::Foo;

    fn main() {
        let s: Foo<f32> = Foo(1.0, 2.0);
    }
    ```

    ### Major: capturing more generic parameters in RPIT {#generic-rpit-capture}

    It is a breaking change to capture additional generic parameters in an [RPIT] (return-position impl trait).

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn f<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> impl Iterator<Item = char> + use<'a> {
        x.chars()
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn f<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> impl Iterator<Item = char> + use<'a, 'b> {
        x.chars().chain(y.chars())
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    fn main() {
        let a = String::new();
        let b = String::new();
        let iter = updated_crate::f(&a, &b);
        drop(b); // Error: cannot move out of `b` because it is borrowed
    }
    ```

    Adding generic parameters to an RPIT places additional constraints on how the resulting type may be used.

    Note that there are implicit captures when the `use<>` syntax is not specified. In Rust 2021 and earlier editions, the lifetime parameters are only captured if they appear syntactically within a bound in the RPIT type signature. Starting in Rust 2024, all lifetime parameters are unconditionally captured. This means that starting in Rust 2024, the default is maximally compatible, requiring you to be explicit when you want to capture less, which is a SemVer commitment.

    See the [edition guide][rpit-capture-guide] and the [reference][rpit-reference] for more information on RPIT capturing.

    It is a minor change to capture fewer generic parameters in an RPIT.

    > Note: All in-scope type and const generic parameters must be either implicitly captured (no `+ use<…>` specified) or explicitly captured (must be listed in `+ use<…>`), and thus currently it is not allowed to change what is captured of those kinds of generics.

    [rpit-capture-guide]: ../../edition-guide/rust-2024/rpit-lifetime-capture.html
    [rpit-reference]: ../../reference/types/impl-trait.md#capturing

    ### Major: adding/removing function parameters {#fn-change-arity}

    Changing the arity of a function is a breaking change.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn foo(x: i32) {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    fn main() {
        updated_crate::foo(); // Error: this function takes 1 argument
    }
    ```

    Mitigating strategies:
    * Introduce a new function with the new signature and possibly
      [deprecate][deprecated] the old one.
    * Introduce functions that take a struct argument, where the struct is built
      with the builder pattern. This allows new fields to be added to the struct
      in the future.

    ### Possibly-breaking: introducing a new function type parameter {#fn-generic-new}

    Usually, adding a non-defaulted type parameter is safe, but in some
    cases it can be a breaking change:

    ```rust,ignore
    // Breaking change example

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn foo<T>() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn foo<T, U>() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::foo;

    fn main() {
        foo::<u8>(); // Error: function takes 2 generic arguments but 1 generic argument was supplied
    }
    ```

    However, such explicit calls are rare enough (and can usually be written in
    other ways) that this breakage is usually acceptable. One should take into
    account how likely it is that the function in question is being called with
    explicit type arguments.

    ### Minor: generalizing a function to use generics (supporting original type) {#fn-generalize-compatible}

    The type of a parameter to a function, or its return value, can be
    *generalized* to use generics, including by introducing a new type parameter,
    as long as it can be instantiated to the original type. For example, the
    following changes are allowed:

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn foo(x: u8) -> u8 {
        x
    }
    pub fn bar<T: Iterator<Item = u8>>(t: T) {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    use std::ops::Add;
    pub fn foo<T: Add>(x: T) -> T {
        x
    }
    pub fn bar<T: IntoIterator<Item = u8>>(t: T) {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    use updated_crate::{bar, foo};

    fn main() {
        foo(1);
        bar(vec![1, 2, 3].into_iter());
    }
    ```

    because all existing uses are instantiations of the new signature.

    Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, generalization applies to trait objects as
    well, given that every trait implements itself:

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub trait Trait {}
    pub fn foo(t: &dyn Trait) {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub trait Trait {}
    pub fn foo<T: Trait + ?Sized>(t: &T) {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.
    use updated_crate::{foo, Trait};

    struct Foo;
    impl Trait for Foo {}

    fn main() {
        let obj = Foo;
        foo(&obj);
    }
    ```

    (The use of `?Sized` is essential; otherwise you couldn't recover the original
    signature.)

    Introducing generics in this way can potentially create type inference
    failures. These are usually rare, and may be acceptable breakage for some
    projects, as this can be fixed with additional type annotations.

    ```rust,ignore
    // Breaking change example

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn foo() -> i32 {
        0
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn foo<T: Default>() -> T {
        Default::default()
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::foo;

    fn main() {
        let x = foo(); // Error: type annotations needed
    }
    ```

    ### Major: generalizing a function to use generics with type mismatch {#fn-generalize-mismatch}

    It is a breaking change to change a function parameter or return type if the
    generic type constrains or changes the types previously allowed. For example,
    the following adds a generic constraint that may not be satisfied by existing
    code:

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn foo(x: Vec<u8>) {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn foo<T: Copy + IntoIterator<Item = u8>>(x: T) {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::foo;

    fn main() {
        foo(vec![1, 2, 3]); // Error: `Copy` is not implemented for `Vec<u8>`
    }
    ```

    ### Minor: making an `unsafe` function safe {#fn-unsafe-safe}

    A previously `unsafe` function can be made safe without breaking code.

    Note however that it may cause the [`unused_unsafe`][unused_unsafe] lint to
    trigger as in the example below, which will cause local crates that have
    specified `#![deny(warnings)]` to stop compiling. Per [introducing new
    lints](#new-lints), it is allowed for updates to introduce new warnings.

    Going the other way (making a safe function `unsafe`) is a breaking change.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub unsafe fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will trigger a lint.
    use updated_crate::foo;

    unsafe fn bar(f: unsafe fn()) {
        f()
    }

    fn main() {
        unsafe { foo() }; // The `unused_unsafe` lint will trigger here
        unsafe { bar(foo) };
    }
    ```

    Making a previously `unsafe` associated function or method on structs / enums
    safe is also a minor change, while the same is not true for associated
    function on traits (see [any change to trait item signatures](#trait-item-signature)).

    ### Major: switching from `no_std` support to requiring `std` {#attr-no-std-to-std}

    If your library specifically supports a [`no_std`] environment, it is a
    breaking change to make a new release that requires `std`.

    ```rust,ignore,skip
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    #![no_std]
    pub fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    pub fn foo() {
        std::time::SystemTime::now();
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    // This will fail to link for no_std targets because they don't have a `std` crate.
    #![no_std]
    use updated_crate::foo;

    fn example() {
        foo();
    }
    ```

    Mitigation strategies:
    * A common idiom to avoid this is to include a `std` [Cargo feature] that
      optionally enables `std` support, and when the feature is off, the library
      can be used in a `no_std` environment.

    ### Major: adding `non_exhaustive` to an existing enum, variant, or struct with no private fields {#attr-adding-non-exhaustive}

    Making items [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] changes how they may
    be used outside the crate where they are defined:

    - Non-exhaustive structs and enum variants cannot be constructed
      using [struct literal] syntax, including [functional update syntax].
    - Pattern matching on non-exhaustive structs requires `..` and
      matching on enums does not count towards exhaustiveness.
    - Casting enum variants to their discriminant with `as` is not allowed.

    Structs with private fields cannot be constructed using [struct literal] syntax
    regardless of whether [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] is used.
    Adding [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] to such a struct is not
    a breaking change.

    ```rust,ignore
    // MAJOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub struct Foo {
        pub bar: usize,
    }

    pub enum Bar {
        X,
        Y(usize),
        Z { a: usize },
    }

    pub enum Quux {
        Var,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[non_exhaustive]
    pub struct Foo {
        pub bar: usize,
    }

    pub enum Bar {
        #[non_exhaustive]
        X,

        #[non_exhaustive]
        Y(usize),

        #[non_exhaustive]
        Z { a: usize },
    }

    #[non_exhaustive]
    pub enum Quux {
        Var,
    }

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example usage that will break.
    use updated_crate::{Bar, Foo, Quux};

    fn main() {
        let foo = Foo { bar: 0 }; // Error: cannot create non-exhaustive struct using struct expression

        let bar_x = Bar::X; // Error: unit variant `X` is private
        let bar_y = Bar::Y(0); // Error: tuple variant `Y` is private
        let bar_z = Bar::Z { a: 0 }; // Error: cannot create non-exhaustive variant using struct expression

        let q = Quux::Var;
        match q {
            Quux::Var => 0,
            // Error: non-exhaustive patterns: `_` not covered
        };
    }
    ```

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Mark structs, enums, and enum variants as
      [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] when first introducing them,
      rather than adding [`#[non_exhaustive]`][non_exhaustive] later on.

    ## Tooling and environment compatibility

    ### Possibly-breaking: changing the minimum version of Rust required {#env-new-rust}

    Introducing the use of new features in a new release of Rust can break
    projects that are using older versions of Rust. This also includes using new
    features in a new release of Cargo, and requiring the use of a nightly-only
    feature in a crate that previously worked on stable.

    It is generally recommended to treat this as a minor change, rather than as
    a major change, for [various reasons][msrv-is-minor]. It
    is usually relatively easy to update to a newer version of Rust. Rust also has
    a rapid 6-week release cycle, and some projects will provide compatibility
    within a window of releases (such as the current stable release plus N
    previous releases). Just keep in mind that some large projects may not be able
    to update their Rust toolchain rapidly.

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Use [Cargo features] to make the new features opt-in.
    * Provide a large window of support for older releases.
    * Copy the source of new standard library items if possible so that you
      can continue to use an older version but take advantage of the new feature.
    * Provide a separate branch of older minor releases that can receive backports
      of important bugfixes.
    * Keep an eye out for the [`[cfg(version(..))]`][cfg-version] and
      [`#[cfg(accessible(..))]`][cfg-accessible] features which provide an opt-in
      mechanism for new features. These are currently unstable and only available
      in the nightly channel.

    ### Possibly-breaking: changing the platform and environment requirements {#env-change-requirements}

    There is a very wide range of assumptions a library makes about the
    environment that it runs in, such as the host platform, operating system
    version, available services, filesystem support, etc. It can be a breaking
    change if you make a new release that restricts what was previously supported,
    for example requiring a newer version of an operating system. These changes
    can be difficult to track, since you may not always know if a change breaks in
    an environment that is not automatically tested.

    Some projects may deem this acceptable breakage, particularly if the breakage
    is unlikely for most users, or the project doesn't have the resources to
    support all environments. Another notable situation is when a vendor
    discontinues support for some hardware or OS, the project may deem it
    reasonable to also discontinue support.

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Document the platforms and environments you specifically support.
    * Test your code on a wide range of environments in CI.

    ### Minor: introducing new lints {#new-lints}

    Some changes to a library may cause new lints to be triggered in users of that library.
    This should generally be considered a compatible change.

    ```rust,ignore,dont-deny
    // MINOR CHANGE

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Before
    pub fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // After
    #[deprecated]
    pub fn foo() {}

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Example use of the library that will safely work.

    fn main() {
        updated_crate::foo(); // Warning: use of deprecated function
    }
    ```

    Beware that it may be possible for this to technically cause a project to fail if they have explicitly denied the warning, and the updated crate is a direct dependency.
    Denying warnings should be done with care and the understanding that new lints may be introduced over time.
    However, library authors should be cautious about introducing new warnings and may want to consider the potential impact on their users.

    The following lints are examples of those that may be introduced when updating a dependency:

    * [`deprecated`][deprecated-lint] --- Introduced when a dependency adds the [`#[deprecated]` attribute][deprecated] to an item you are using.
    * [`unused_must_use`] --- Introduced when a dependency adds the [`#[must_use]` attribute][must-use-attr] to an item where you are not consuming the result.
    * [`unused_unsafe`] --- Introduced when a dependency *removes* the `unsafe` qualifier from a function, and that is the only unsafe function called in an unsafe block.

    Additionally, updating `rustc` to a new version may introduce new lints.

    Transitive dependencies which introduce new lints should not usually cause a failure because Cargo uses [`--cap-lints`](../../rustc/lints/levels.html#capping-lints) to suppress all lints in dependencies.

    Mitigating strategies:
    * If you build with warnings denied, understand you may need to deal with resolving new warnings whenever you update your dependencies.
      If using RUSTFLAGS to pass `-Dwarnings`, also add the `-A` flag to allow lints that are likely to cause issues, such as `-Adeprecated`.
    * Introduce deprecations behind a [feature][Cargo features].
      For example `#[cfg_attr(feature = "deprecated", deprecated="use bar instead")]`.
      Then, when you plan to remove an item in a future SemVer breaking change, you can communicate with your users that they should enable the `deprecated` feature *before* updating to remove the use of the deprecated items.
      This allows users to choose when to respond to deprecations without needing to immediately respond to them.
      A downside is that it can be difficult to communicate to users that they need to take these manual steps to prepare for a major update.

    ### Cargo

    #### Minor: adding a new Cargo feature {#cargo-feature-add}

    It is usually safe to add new [Cargo features]. If the feature introduces new
    changes that cause a breaking change, this can cause difficulties for projects
    that have stricter backwards-compatibility needs. In that scenario, avoid
    adding the feature to the "default" list, and possibly document the
    consequences of enabling the feature.

    ```toml
    # MINOR CHANGE

    ###########################################################
    # Before
    [features]
    # ..empty

    ###########################################################
    # After
    [features]
    std = []
    ```

    #### Major: removing a Cargo feature {#cargo-feature-remove}

    It is usually a breaking change to remove [Cargo features]. This will cause
    an error for any project that enabled the feature.

    ```toml
    # MAJOR CHANGE

    ###########################################################
    # Before
    [features]
    logging = []

    ###########################################################
    # After
    [dependencies]
    # ..logging removed
    ```

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Clearly document your features. If there is an internal or experimental
      feature, mark it as such, so that users know the status of the feature.
    * Leave the old feature in `Cargo.toml`, but otherwise remove its
      functionality. Document that the feature is deprecated, and remove it in a
      future major SemVer release.

    #### Major: removing a feature from a feature list if that changes functionality or public items {#cargo-feature-remove-another}

    If removing a feature from another feature, this can break existing users if
    they are expecting that functionality to be available through that feature.

    ```toml
    # Breaking change example

    ###########################################################
    # Before
    [features]
    default = ["std"]
    std = []

    ###########################################################
    # After
    [features]
    default = []  # This may cause packages to fail if they are expecting std to be enabled.
    std = []
    ```

    #### Possibly-breaking: removing an optional dependency {#cargo-remove-opt-dep}

    Removing an [optional dependency][opt-dep] can break a project using your library because
    another project may be enabling that dependency via [Cargo features].

    When there is an optional dependency, cargo implicitly defines a feature of
    the same name to provide a mechanism to enable the dependency and to check
    when it is enabled. This problem can be avoided by using the `dep:` syntax in
    the `[features]` table, which disables this implicit feature. Using `dep:`
    makes it possible to hide the existence of optional dependencies under more
    semantically-relevant names which can be more safely modified.

    ```toml
    # Breaking change example

    ###########################################################
    # Before
    [dependencies]
    curl = { version = "0.4.31", optional = true }

    ###########################################################
    # After
    [dependencies]
    # ..curl removed
    ```

    ```toml
    # MINOR CHANGE
    #
    # This example shows how to avoid breaking changes with optional dependencies.

    ###########################################################
    # Before
    [dependencies]
    curl = { version = "0.4.31", optional = true }

    [features]
    networking = ["dep:curl"]

    ###########################################################
    # After
    [dependencies]
    # Here, one optional dependency was replaced with another.
    hyper = { version = "0.14.27", optional = true }

    [features]
    networking = ["dep:hyper"]
    ```

    Mitigation strategies:
    * Use the `dep:` syntax in the `[features]` table to avoid exposing optional
      dependencies in the first place. See [optional dependencies][opt-dep] for
      more information.
    * Clearly document your features. If the optional dependency is not included
      in the documented list of features, then you may decide to consider it safe
      to change undocumented entries.
    * Leave the optional dependency, and just don't use it within your library.
    * Replace the optional dependency with a [Cargo feature] that does nothing,
      and document that it is deprecated.
    * Use high-level features which enable optional dependencies, and document
      those as the preferred way to enable the extended functionality. For
      example, if your library has optional support for something like
      "networking", create a generic feature name "networking" that enables the
      optional dependencies necessary to implement "networking". Then document the
      "networking" feature.

    [opt-dep]: features.md#optional-dependencies

    #### Minor: changing dependency features {#cargo-change-dep-feature}

    It is usually safe to change the features on a dependency, as long as the
    feature does not introduce a breaking change.

    ```toml
    # MINOR CHANGE

    ###########################################################
    # Before
    [dependencies]
    rand = { version = "0.7.3", features = ["small_rng"] }


    ###########################################################
    # After
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.7.3"
    ```

    #### Minor: adding dependencies {#cargo-dep-add}

    It is usually safe to add new dependencies, as long as the new dependency
    does not introduce new requirements that result in a breaking change.
    For example, adding a new dependency that requires nightly in a project
    that previously worked on stable is a major change.

    ```toml
    # MINOR CHANGE

    ###########################################################
    # Before
    [dependencies]
    # ..empty

    ###########################################################
    # After
    [dependencies]
    log = "0.4.11"
    ```

    ## Application compatibility

    Cargo projects may also include executable binaries which have their own
    interfaces (such as a CLI interface, OS-level interaction, etc.). Since these
    are part of the Cargo package, they often use and share the same version as
    the package. You will need to decide if and how you want to employ a SemVer
    contract with your users in the changes you make to your application. The
    potential breaking and compatible changes to an application are too numerous
    to list, so you are encouraged to use the spirit of the [SemVer] spec to guide
    your decisions on how to apply versioning to your application, or at least
    document what your commitments are.

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `registry-web-api page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.



    Documentation text:

    # Web API

    A registry may host a web API at the location defined in `config.json` to
    support any of the actions listed below.

    Cargo includes the `Authorization` header for requests that require
    authentication. The header value is the API token. The server should respond
    with a 403 response code if the token is not valid. Users are expected to
    visit the registry's website to obtain a token, and Cargo can store the token
    using the [`cargo login`] command, or by passing the token on the
    command-line.

    Responses use a 2xx response code for success.
    Errors should use an appropriate response code, such as 404.
    Failure
    responses should have a JSON object with the following structure:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Array of errors to display to the user.
        "errors": [
            {
                // The error message as a string.
                "detail": "error message text"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    If the response has this structure Cargo will display the detailed message to the user, even if the response code is 200.
    If the response code indicates an error and the content does not have this structure, Cargo will display to the user a
     message intended to help debugging the server error. A server returning an `errors` object allows a registry to provide a more
    detailed or user-centric error message.

    For backwards compatibility, servers should ignore any unexpected query
    parameters or JSON fields. If a JSON field is missing, it should be assumed to
    be null. The endpoints are versioned with the `v1` component of the path, and
    Cargo is responsible for handling backwards compatibility fallbacks should any
    be required in the future.

    Cargo sets the following headers for all requests:

    - `Content-Type`: `application/json` (for requests with a body payload)
    - `Accept`: `application/json`
    - `User-Agent`: The Cargo version such as `cargo/1.32.0 (8610973aa
      2019-01-02)`. This may be modified by the user in a configuration value.
      Added in 1.29.

    ## Publish

    - Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/new`
    - Method: PUT
    - Authorization: Included

    The publish endpoint is used to publish a new version of a crate. The server
    should validate the crate, make it available for download, and add it to the
    index.

    It is not required for the index to be updated before the successful response is sent.
    After a successful response, Cargo will poll the index for a short period of time to identify that the new crate has been added.
    If the crate does not appear in the index after a short period of time, then Cargo will display a warning letting the user know that the new crate is not yet available.

    The body of the data sent by Cargo is:

    - 32-bit unsigned little-endian integer of the length of JSON data.
    - Metadata of the package as a JSON object.
    - 32-bit unsigned little-endian integer of the length of the `.crate` file.
    - The `.crate` file.

    The following is a commented example of the JSON object. Some notes of some
    restrictions imposed by [crates.io] are included only to illustrate some
    suggestions on types of validation that may be done, and should not be
    considered as an exhaustive list of restrictions [crates.io] imposes.

    ```javascript
    {
        // The name of the package.
        "name": "foo",
        // The version of the package being published.

                // this is the original name. The new package name is stored in

        "links": null,
        // The minimal supported Rust version (optional)
        // This must be a valid version requirement without an operator (e.g. no `=`)
        "rust_version": null
    }
    ```

    A successful response includes the JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Optional object of warnings to display to the user.
        "warnings": {
            // Array of strings of categories that are invalid and ignored.
            "invalid_categories": [],
            // Array of strings of badge names that are invalid and ignored.
            "invalid_badges": [],
            // Array of strings of arbitrary warnings to display to the user.
            "other": []
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Yank

    - Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/{version}/yank`
    - Method: DELETE
    - Authorization: Included

    The yank endpoint will set the `yank` field of the given version of a crate to
    `true` in the index.

    A successful response includes the JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Indicates the yank succeeded, always true.
        "ok": true,
    }
    ```

    ## Unyank

    - Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/{version}/unyank`
    - Method: PUT
    - Authorization: Included

    The unyank endpoint will set the `yank` field of the given version of a crate
    to `false` in the index.

    A successful response includes the JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Indicates the unyank succeeded, always true.
        "ok": true,
    }
    ```

    ## Owners

    Cargo does not have an inherent notion of users and owners, but it does
    provide the `owner` command to assist managing who has authorization to
    control a crate. It is up to the registry to decide exactly how users and
    owners are handled. See the [publishing documentation] for a description of
    how [crates.io] handles owners via GitHub users and teams.

    ### Owners: List

    - Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/owners`
    - Method: GET
    - Authorization: Included

    The owners endpoint returns a list of owners of the crate.

    A successful response includes the JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Array of owners of the crate.
        "users": [
            {
                // Unique unsigned 32-bit integer of the owner.
                "id": 70,
                // The unique username of the owner.
                "login": "github:rust-lang:core",
                // Name of the owner.
                // This is optional and may be null.
                "name": "Core",
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    ### Owners: Add

    - Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/owners`
    - Method: PUT
    - Authorization: Included

    A PUT request will send a request to the registry to add a new owner to a
    crate. It is up to the registry how to handle the request. For example,
    [crates.io] sends an invite to the user that they must accept before being
    added.

    The request should include the following JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Array of `login` strings of owners to add.
        "users": ["login_name"]
    }
    ```

    A successful response includes the JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Indicates the add succeeded, always true.
        "ok": true,
        // A string to be displayed to the user.
        "msg": "user ehuss has been invited to be an owner of crate cargo"
    }
    ```

    ### Owners: Remove

    - Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/owners`
    - Method: DELETE
    - Authorization: Included

    A DELETE request will remove an owner from a crate. The request should include
    the following JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Array of `login` strings of owners to remove.
        "users": ["login_name"]
    }
    ```

    A successful response includes the JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Indicates the remove succeeded, always true.
        "ok": true
        // A string to be displayed to the user. Currently ignored by cargo.
        "msg": "owners successfully removed",
    }
    ```

    ## Search

    - Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates`
    - Method: GET
    - Query Parameters:
        - `q`: The search query string.
        - `per_page`: Number of results, default 10, max 100.

    The search request will perform a search for crates, using criteria defined on
    the server.

    A successful response includes the JSON object:

    ```javascript
    {
        // Array of results.
        "crates": [
            {
                // Name of the crate.
                "name": "rand",
                // The highest version available.
                "max_version": "0.6.1",
                // Textual description of the crate.
                "description": "Random number generators and other randomness functionality.\n",
            }
        ],
        "meta": {
            // Total number of results available on the server.
            "total": 119
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Login

    - Endpoint: `/me`

    The "login" endpoint is not an actual API request. It exists solely for the
    [`cargo login`] command to display a URL to instruct a user to visit in a web
    browser to log in and retrieve an API token.

    # Running a Registry

    A minimal registry can be implemented by having a git repository that contains
    an index, and a server that contains the compressed `.crate` files created by
    [`cargo package`]. Users won't be able to use Cargo to publish to it, but this
    may be sufficient for closed environments. The index format is described in
    [Registry Index].

    A full-featured registry that supports publishing will additionally need to
    have a web API service that conforms to the API used by Cargo. The web API is
    described in [Registry Web API].

    Commercial and community projects are available for building and running a
    registry. See <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-registries>

    # The Manifest Format

    The `Cargo.toml` file for each package is called its *manifest*. It is written
    in the [TOML] format. It contains metadata that is needed to compile the package. Checkout
    the `cargo locate-project` section for more detail on how cargo finds the manifest file.

    Every manifest file consists of the following sections:

    * [`cargo-features`](unstable.md) --- Unstable, nightly-only features.
    * [`[package]`](#the-package-section) --- Defines a package.
      * [`name`](#the-name-field) --- The name of the package.
      * [`version`](#the-version-field) --- The version of the package.
      * [`authors`](#the-authors-field) --- The authors of the package.
      * [`edition`](#the-edition-field) --- The Rust edition.
      * [`rust-version`](rust-version.md) --- The minimal supported Rust version.
      * [`description`](#the-description-field) --- A description of the package.
      * [`documentation`](#the-documentation-field) --- URL of the package documentation.
      * [`readme`](#the-readme-field) --- Path to the package's README file.
      * [`homepage`](#the-homepage-field) --- URL of the package homepage.
      * [`repository`](#the-repository-field) --- URL of the package source repository.
      * [`license`](#the-license-and-license-file-fields) --- The package license.
      * [`license-file`](#the-license-and-license-file-fields) --- Path to the text of the license.
      * [`keywords`](#the-keywords-field) --- Keywords for the package.
      * [`categories`](#the-categories-field) --- Categories of the package.
      * [`workspace`](#the-workspace-field) --- Path to the workspace for the package.
      * [`build`](#the-build-field) --- Path to the package build script.
      * [`links`](#the-links-field) --- Name of the native library the package links with.
      * [`exclude`](#the-exclude-and-include-fields) --- Files to exclude when publishing.
      * [`include`](#the-exclude-and-include-fields) --- Files to include when publishing.
      * [`publish`](#the-publish-field) --- Can be used to prevent publishing the package.
      * [`metadata`](#the-metadata-table) --- Extra settings for external tools.
      * [`default-run`](#the-default-run-field) --- The default binary to run by [`cargo run`].
      * [`autolib`](cargo-targets.md#target-auto-discovery) --- Disables library auto discovery.
      * [`autobins`](cargo-targets.md#target-auto-discovery) --- Disables binary auto discovery.
      * [`autoexamples`](cargo-targets.md#target-auto-discovery) --- Disables example auto discovery.
      * [`autotests`](cargo-targets.md#target-auto-discovery) --- Disables test auto discovery.
      * [`autobenches`](cargo-targets.md#target-auto-discovery) --- Disables bench auto discovery.

    Documentation text:

    ## The `[package]` section

    The first section in a `Cargo.toml` is `[package]`.

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "hello_world" # the name of the package
    version = "0.1.0"    # the current version, obeying semver
    ```

    The only field required by Cargo is [`name`](#the-name-field). If publishing to
    a registry, the registry may require additional fields. See the notes below and
    [the publishing chapter][publishing] for requirements for publishing to
    [crates.io].

    ### The `name` field

    The package name is an identifier used to refer to the package. It is used
    when listed as a dependency in another package, and as the default name of
    inferred lib and bin targets.

    The name must use only [alphanumeric] characters or `-` or `_`, and cannot be empty.

    Note that [`cargo new`] and [`cargo init`] impose some additional restrictions on
    the package name, such as enforcing that it is a valid Rust identifier and not
    a keyword. [crates.io] imposes even more restrictions, such as:

    - Only ASCII characters are allowed.
    - Do not use reserved names.
    - Do not use special Windows names such as "nul".
    - Use a maximum of 64 characters of length.

    [alphanumeric]: ../../std/primitive.char.html#method.is_alphanumeric

    ### The `version` field

    The `version` field is formatted according to the [SemVer] specification:

    Versions must have three numeric parts,
    the major version, the minor version, and the patch version.

    A pre-release part can be added after a dash such as `1.0.0-alpha`.
    The pre-release part may be separated with periods to distinguish separate
    components. Numeric components will use numeric comparison while
    everything else will be compared lexicographically.
    For example, `1.0.0-alpha.11` is higher than `1.0.0-alpha.4`.

    A metadata part can be added after a plus, such as `1.0.0+21AF26D3`.
    This is for informational purposes only and is generally ignored by Cargo.

    Cargo bakes in the concept of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
    so versions are considered [compatible](semver.md) if their left-most non-zero major/minor/patch component is the same.
    See the [Resolver] chapter for more information on how Cargo uses versions to
    resolve dependencies.

    This field is optional and defaults to `0.0.0`.  The field is required for publishing packages.

    > **MSRV:** Before 1.75, this field was required

    [SemVer]: https://semver.org
    [Resolver]: resolver.md
    [SemVer compatibility]: semver.md

    ### The `authors` field

    > **Warning**: This field is deprecated

    The optional `authors` field lists in an array the people or organizations that are considered
    the "authors" of the package. An optional email address may be included within angled brackets at
    the end of each author entry.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    authors = ["Graydon Hoare", "Fnu Lnu <no-reply@rust-lang.org>"]
    ```

    This field is surfaced in package metadata and in the `CARGO_PKG_AUTHORS`
    environment variable within `build.rs` for backwards compatibility.

    ### The `edition` field

    The `edition` key is an optional key that affects which [Rust Edition] your package
    is compiled with. Setting the `edition` key in `[package]` will affect all
    targets/crates in the package, including test suites, benchmarks, binaries,
    examples, etc.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    edition = '2024'
    ```

    Most manifests have the `edition` field filled in automatically by [`cargo new`]
    with the latest stable edition. By default `cargo new` creates a manifest with
    the 2024 edition currently.

    If the `edition` field is not present in `Cargo.toml`, then the 2015 edition is
    assumed for backwards compatibility. Note that all manifests
    created with [`cargo new`] will not use this historical fallback because they
    will have `edition` explicitly specified to a newer value.

    ### The `rust-version` field

    The `rust-version` field tells cargo what version of the
    Rust toolchain you support for your package.
    See [the Rust version chapter](rust-version.md) for more detail.

    ### The `description` field

    The description is a short blurb about the package. [crates.io] will display
    this with your package. This should be plain text (not Markdown).

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    description = "A short description of my package"
    ```

    > **Note**: [crates.io] requires the `description` to be set.

    ### The `documentation` field

    The `documentation` field specifies a URL to a website hosting the crate's
    documentation. If no URL is specified in the manifest file, [crates.io] will
    automatically link your crate to the corresponding [docs.rs] page when the
    documentation has been built and is available (see [docs.rs queue]).

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    documentation = "https://docs.rs/bitflags"
    ```

    [docs.rs queue]: https://docs.rs/releases/queue

    ### The `readme` field

    The `readme` field should be the path to a file in the package root (relative
    to this `Cargo.toml`) that contains general information about the package.
    This file will be transferred to the registry when you publish. [crates.io]
    will interpret it as Markdown and render it on the crate's page.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    readme = "README.md"
    ```

    If no value is specified for this field, and a file named `README.md`,
    `README.txt` or `README` exists in the package root, then the name of that
    file will be used. You can suppress this behavior by setting this field to
    `false`. If the field is set to `true`, a default value of `README.md` will
    be assumed.

    ### The `homepage` field

    The `homepage` field should be a URL to a site that is the home page for your
    package.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    homepage = "https://serde.rs"
    ```

    A value should only be set for `homepage` if there is a dedicated website for
    the crate other than the source repository or API documentation. Do not make
    `homepage` redundant with either the `documentation` or `repository` values.

    ### The `repository` field

    The `repository` field should be a URL to the source repository for your
    package.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    repository = "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo"
    ```

    ### The `license` and `license-file` fields

    The `license` field contains the name of the software license that the package
    is released under. The `license-file` field contains the path to a file
    containing the text of the license (relative to this `Cargo.toml`).

    [crates.io] interprets the `license` field as an [SPDX 2.3 license
    expression][spdx-2.3-license-expressions]. The name must be a known license
    from the [SPDX license list 3.20][spdx-license-list-3.20]. See the [SPDX site]
    for more information.

    SPDX license expressions support AND and OR operators to combine multiple
    licenses.[^slash]

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
    ```

    Using `OR` indicates the user may choose either license. Using `AND` indicates
    the user must comply with both licenses simultaneously. The `WITH` operator
    indicates a license with a special exception. Some examples:

    * `MIT OR Apache-2.0`
    * `LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause`
    * `GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2`

    If a package is using a nonstandard license, then the `license-file` field may
    be specified in lieu of the `license` field.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    license-file = "LICENSE.txt"
    ```

    > **Note**: [crates.io] requires either `license` or `license-file` to be set.

    [^slash]: Previously multiple licenses could be separated with a `/`, but that
    usage is deprecated.

    ### The `keywords` field

    The `keywords` field is an array of strings that describe this package. This
    can help when searching for the package on a registry, and you may choose any
    words that would help someone find this crate.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    keywords = ["gamedev", "graphics"]
    ```

    > **Note**: [crates.io] allows a maximum of 5 keywords. Each keyword must be
    > ASCII text, have at most 20 characters, start with an alphanumeric character,
    > and only contain letters, numbers, `_`, `-` or `+`.

    ### The `categories` field

    The `categories` field is an array of strings of the categories this package
    belongs to.

    ```toml
    categories = ["command-line-utilities", "development-tools::cargo-plugins"]
    ```

    > **Note**: [crates.io] has a maximum of 5 categories. Each category should
    > match one of the strings available at <https://crates.io/category_slugs>, and
    > must match exactly.

    ### The `workspace` field

    The `workspace` field can be used to configure the workspace that this package
    will be a member of. If not specified this will be inferred as the first
    Cargo.toml with `[workspace]` upwards in the filesystem. Setting this is
    useful if the member is not inside a subdirectory of the workspace root.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    workspace = "path/to/workspace/root"
    ```

    This field cannot be specified if the manifest already has a `[workspace]`
    table defined. That is, a crate cannot both be a root crate in a workspace
    (contain `[workspace]`) and also be a member crate of another workspace
    (contain `package.workspace`).

    For more information, see the [workspaces chapter](workspaces.md).

    ### The `build` field

    The `build` field specifies a file in the package root which is a [build
    script] for building native code. More information can be found in the [build
    script guide][build script].

    [build script]: build-scripts.md

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    build = "build.rs"
    ```

    The default is `"build.rs"`, which loads the script from a file named
    `build.rs` in the root of the package. Use `build = "custom_build_name.rs"` to
    specify a path to a different file or `build = false` to disable automatic
    detection of the build script.

    ### The `links` field

    The `links` field specifies the name of a native library that is being linked
    to. More information can be found in the [`links`][links] section of the build
    script guide.

    [links]: build-scripts.md#the-links-manifest-key

    For example, a crate that links a native library called "git2" (e.g. `libgit2.a`
    on Linux) may specify:

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    links = "git2"
    ```

    ### The `exclude` and `include` fields

    The `exclude` and `include` fields can be used to explicitly specify which
    files are included when packaging a project to be [published][publishing],
    and certain kinds of change tracking (described below).
    The patterns specified in the `exclude` field identify a set of files that are
    not included, and the patterns in `include` specify files that are explicitly
    included.
    You may run [`cargo package --list`][`cargo package`] to verify which files will
    be included in the package.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    exclude = ["/ci", "images/", ".*"]
    ```

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    include = ["/src", "COPYRIGHT", "/examples", "!/examples/big_example"]
    ```

    The default if neither field is specified is to include all files from the
    root of the package, except for the exclusions listed below.

    If `include` is not specified, then the following files will be excluded:

    * If the package is not in a git repository, all "hidden" files starting with
      a dot will be skipped.
    * If the package is in a git repository, any files that are ignored by the
      [gitignore] rules of the repository and global git configuration will be
      skipped.

    Regardless of whether `exclude` or `include` is specified, the following files
    are always excluded:

    * Any sub-packages will be skipped (any subdirectory that contains a
      `Cargo.toml` file).
    * A directory named `target` in the root of the package will be skipped.

    The following files are always included:

    * The `Cargo.toml` file of the package itself is always included, it does not
      need to be listed in `include`.
    * A minimized `Cargo.lock` is automatically included.
      See [`cargo package`] for more information.
    * If a [`license-file`](#the-license-and-license-file-fields) is specified, it
      is always included.

    The options are mutually exclusive; setting `include` will override an
    `exclude`. If you need to have exclusions to a set of `include` files, use the
    `!` operator described below.

    The patterns should be [gitignore]-style patterns. Briefly:

    - `foo` matches any file or directory with the name `foo` anywhere in the
      package. This is equivalent to the pattern `**/foo`.
    - `/foo` matches any file or directory with the name `foo` only in the root of
      the package.
    - `foo/` matches any *directory* with the name `foo` anywhere in the package.
    - Common glob patterns like `*`, `?`, and `[]` are supported:
      - `*` matches zero or more characters except `/`.  For example, `*.html`
        matches any file or directory with the `.html` extension anywhere in the
        package.
      - `?` matches any character except `/`. For example, `foo?` matches `food`,
        but not `foo`.
      - `[]` allows for matching a range of characters. For example, `[ab]`
        matches either `a` or `b`. `[a-z]` matches letters a through z.
    - `**/` prefix matches in any directory. For example, `**/foo/bar` matches the
      file or directory `bar` anywhere that is directly under directory `foo`.
    - `/**` suffix matches everything inside. For example, `foo/**` matches all
      files inside directory `foo`, including all files in subdirectories below
      `foo`.
    - `/**/` matches zero or more directories. For example, `a/**/b` matches
      `a/b`, `a/x/b`, `a/x/y/b`, and so on.
    - `!` prefix negates a pattern. For example, a pattern of `src/*.rs` and
      `!foo.rs` would match all files with the `.rs` extension inside the `src`
      directory, except for any file named `foo.rs`.

    The include/exclude list is also used for change tracking in some situations.
    For targets built with `rustdoc`, it is used to determine the list of files to
    track to determine if the target should be rebuilt. If the package has a
    [build script] that does not emit any `rerun-if-*` directives, then the
    include/exclude list is used for tracking if the build script should be re-run
    if any of those files change.

    [gitignore]: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

    ### The `publish` field

    The `publish` field can be used to control which registries names the package
    may be published to:
    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    publish = ["some-registry-name"]
    ```

    To prevent a package from being published to a registry (like crates.io) by mistake,
    for instance to keep a package private in a company,
    you can omit the [`version`](#the-version-field) field.
    If you'd like to be more explicit, you can disable publishing:
    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    publish = false
    ```

    If publish array contains a single registry, `cargo publish` command will use
    it when `--registry` flag is not specified.

    ### The `metadata` table

    Cargo by default will warn about unused keys in `Cargo.toml` to assist in
    detecting typos and such. The `package.metadata` table, however, is completely
    ignored by Cargo and will not be warned about. This section can be used for
    tools which would like to store package configuration in `Cargo.toml`. For
    example:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "..."
    # ...

    # Metadata used when generating an Android APK, for example.
    [package.metadata.android]
    package-name = "my-awesome-android-app"
    assets = "path/to/static"
    ```

    You'll need to look in the documentation for your tool to see how to use this field.
    For Rust Projects that use `package.metadata` tables, see:
    - [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/about/metadata)

    There is a similar table at the workspace level at
    [`workspace.metadata`][workspace-metadata]. While cargo does not specify a
    format for the content of either of these tables, it is suggested that
    external tools may wish to use them in a consistent fashion, such as referring
    to the data in `workspace.metadata` if data is missing from `package.metadata`,
    if that makes sense for the tool in question.

    [workspace-metadata]: workspaces.md#the-metadata-table

    ### The `default-run` field

    The `default-run` field in the `[package]` section of the manifest can be used
    to specify a default binary picked by [`cargo run`]. For example, when there is
    both `src/bin/a.rs` and `src/bin/b.rs`:

    ```toml
    [package]
    default-run = "a"
    ```

    ## The `[lints]` section

    Override the default level of lints from different tools by assigning them to a new level in a
    table, for example:
    ```toml
    [lints.rust]
    unsafe_code = "forbid"
    ```

    This is short-hand for:
    ```toml
    [lints.rust]
    unsafe_code = { level = "forbid", priority = 0 }
    ```

    `level` corresponds to the [lint levels](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html) in `rustc`:
    - `forbid`
    - `deny`
    - `warn`
    - `allow`

    `priority` is a signed integer that controls which lints or lint groups override other lint groups:
    - lower (particularly negative) numbers have lower priority, being overridden
      by higher numbers, and show up first on the command-line to tools like
      `rustc`

    To know which table under `[lints]` a particular lint belongs under, it is the part before `::` in the lint
    name.  If there isn't a `::`, then the tool is `rust`.  For example a warning
    about `unsafe_code` would be `lints.rust.unsafe_code` but a lint about
    `clippy::enum_glob_use` would be `lints.clippy.enum_glob_use`.

    For example:
    ```toml
    [lints.rust]
    unsafe_code = "forbid"

    [lints.clippy]
    enum_glob_use = "deny"
    ```

    Generally, these will only affect local development of the current package.
    Cargo only applies these to the current package and not to dependencies.
    As for dependents, Cargo suppresses lints from non-path dependencies with features like
    [`--cap-lints`](../../rustc/lints/levels.html#capping-lints).

    ## The `[badges]` section

    The `[badges]` section is for specifying status badges that can be displayed
    on a registry website when the package is published.

    [badges]
    # The `maintenance` table indicates the status of the maintenance of
    # the crate. This may be used by a registry, but is currently not
    # used by crates.io. See https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/2437
    # and https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/2438 for more details.
    #
    # The `status` field is required. Available options are:
    # - `actively-developed`: New features are being added and bugs are being fixed.
    # - `passively-maintained`: There are no plans for new features, but the maintainer intends to
    #   respond to issues that get filed.
    # - `as-is`: The crate is feature complete, the maintainer does not intend to continue working on
    #   it or providing support, but it works for the purposes it was designed for.
    # - `experimental`: The author wants to share it with the community but is not intending to meet
    #   anyone's particular use case.
    # - `looking-for-maintainer`: The current maintainer would like to transfer the crate to someone
    #   else.
    # - `deprecated`: The maintainer does not recommend using this crate (the description of the crate
    #   can describe why, there could be a better solution available or there could be problems with
    #   the crate that the author does not want to fix).
    # - `none`: Displays no badge on crates.io, since the maintainer has not chosen to specify
    #   their intentions, potential crate users will need to investigate on their own.

    # Build Script Examples

    The following sections illustrate some examples of writing build scripts.

    Some common build script functionality can be found via crates on [crates.io].
    Check out the [`build-dependencies`
    keyword](https://crates.io/keywords/build-dependencies) to see what is
    available. The following is a sample of some popular crates[^†]:

    * [`bindgen`](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen) --- Automatically generate Rust
      FFI bindings to C libraries.
    * [`cc`](https://crates.io/crates/cc) --- Compiles C/C++/assembly.
    * [`pkg-config`](https://crates.io/crates/pkg-config) --- Detect system
      libraries using the `pkg-config` utility.
    * [`cmake`](https://crates.io/crates/cmake) --- Runs the `cmake` build tool to build a native library.
    * [`autocfg`](https://crates.io/crates/autocfg),
      [`rustc_version`](https://crates.io/crates/rustc_version),
      [`version_check`](https://crates.io/crates/version_check) --- These crates
      provide ways to implement conditional compilation based on the current
      `rustc` such as the version of the compiler.

    [^†]: This list is not an endorsement. Evaluate your dependencies to see which
    is right for your project.

    ## Code generation

    Some Cargo packages need to have code generated just before they are compiled
    for various reasons. Here we’ll walk through a simple example which generates a
    library call as part of the build script.

    First, let’s take a look at the directory structure of this package:

    ```text
    .
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── build.rs
    └── src
        └── main.rs

    1 directory, 3 files
    ```

    Here we can see that we have a `build.rs` build script and our binary in
    `main.rs`. This package has a basic manifest:

    ```toml
    # Cargo.toml

    [package]
    name = "hello-from-generated-code"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"
    ```

    Let’s see what’s inside the build script:

    ```rust,no_run
    // build.rs

    use std::env;
    use std::fs;
    use std::path::Path;

    fn main() {
        let out_dir = env::var_os("OUT_DIR").unwrap();
        let dest_path = Path::new(&out_dir).join("hello.rs");
        fs::write(
            &dest_path,
            "pub fn message() -> &'static str {
                \"Hello, World!\"
            }
            "
        ).unwrap();
        println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=build.rs");
    }
    ```

    There’s a couple of points of note here:

    * The script uses the `OUT_DIR` environment variable to discover where the
      output files should be located. It can use the process’ current working
      directory to find where the input files should be located, but in this case we
      don’t have any input files.
    * In general, build scripts should not modify any files outside of `OUT_DIR`.
      It may seem fine on the first blush, but it does cause problems when you use
      such crate as a dependency, because there's an *implicit* invariant that
      sources in `.cargo/registry` should be immutable. `cargo` won't allow such
      scripts when packaging.
    * This script is relatively simple as it just writes out a small generated file.
      One could imagine that other more complex operations could take place such as
      generating a Rust module from a C header file or another language definition,
      for example.
    * The [`rerun-if-changed` instruction](build-scripts.md#rerun-if-changed)
      tells Cargo that the build script only needs to re-run if the build script
      itself changes. Without this line, Cargo will automatically run the build
      script if any file in the package changes. If your code generation uses some
      input files, this is where you would print a list of each of those files.

    Next, let’s peek at the library itself:

    ```rust,ignore
    // src/main.rs

    include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/hello.rs"));

    fn main() {
        println!("{}", message());
    }
    ```

    This is where the real magic happens. The library is using the rustc-defined
    [`include!` macro][include-macro] in combination with the
    [`concat!`][concat-macro] and [`env!`][env-macro] macros to include the
    generated file (`hello.rs`) into the crate’s compilation.

    Using the structure shown here, crates can include any number of generated files
    from the build script itself.

    [include-macro]: ../../std/macro.include.html
    [concat-macro]: ../../std/macro.concat.html
    [env-macro]: ../../std/macro.env.html

    ## Building a native library

    Sometimes it’s necessary to build some native C or C++ code as part of a
    package. This is another excellent use case of leveraging the build script to
    build a native library before the Rust crate itself. As an example, we’ll create
    a Rust library which calls into C to print “Hello, World!”.

    Like above, let’s first take a look at the package layout:

    ```text
    .
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── build.rs
    └── src
        ├── hello.c
        └── main.rs

    1 directory, 4 files
    ```

    Pretty similar to before! Next, the manifest:

    ```toml
    # Cargo.toml

    [package]
    name = "hello-world-from-c"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"
    ```

    For now we’re not going to use any build dependencies, so let’s take a look at
    the build script now:

    ```rust,no_run
    // build.rs

    use std::process::Command;
    use std::env;
    use std::path::Path;

    fn main() {
        let out_dir = env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap();

        // Note that there are a number of downsides to this approach, the comments
        // below detail how to improve the portability of these commands.
        Command::new("gcc").args(&["src/hello.c", "-c", "-fPIC", "-o"])
                           .arg(&format!("{}/hello.o", out_dir))
                           .status().unwrap();
        Command::new("ar").args(&["crus", "libhello.a", "hello.o"])
                          .current_dir(&Path::new(&out_dir))
                          .status().unwrap();

        println!("cargo::rustc-link-search=native={}", out_dir);
        println!("cargo::rustc-link-lib=static=hello");
        println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=src/hello.c");
    }
    ```

    This build script starts out by compiling our C file into an object file (by
    invoking `gcc`) and then converting this object file into a static library (by
    invoking `ar`). The final step is feedback to Cargo itself to say that our
    output was in `out_dir` and the compiler should link the crate to `libhello.a`
    statically via the `-l static=hello` flag.

    Note that there are a number of drawbacks to this hard-coded approach:

    * The `gcc` command itself is not portable across platforms. For example it’s
      unlikely that Windows platforms have `gcc`, and not even all Unix platforms
      may have `gcc`. The `ar` command is also in a similar situation.
    * These commands do not take cross-compilation into account. If we’re cross
      compiling for a platform such as Android it’s unlikely that `gcc` will produce
      an ARM executable.

    Not to fear, though, this is where a `build-dependencies` entry would help!
    The Cargo ecosystem has a number of packages to make this sort of task much
    easier, portable, and standardized. Let's try the [`cc`
    crate](https://crates.io/crates/cc) from [crates.io]. First, add it to the
    `build-dependencies` in `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [build-dependencies]
    cc = "1.0"
    ```

    And rewrite the build script to use this crate:

    ```rust,ignore
    // build.rs

    fn main() {
        cc::Build::new()
            .file("src/hello.c")
            .compile("hello");
        println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=src/hello.c");
    }
    ```

    The [`cc` crate] abstracts a range of build script requirements for C code:

    * It invokes the appropriate compiler (MSVC for windows, `gcc` for MinGW, `cc`
      for Unix platforms, etc.).
    * It takes the `TARGET` variable into account by passing appropriate flags to
      the compiler being used.
    * Other environment variables, such as `OPT_LEVEL`, `DEBUG`, etc., are all
      handled automatically.
    * The stdout output and `OUT_DIR` locations are also handled by the `cc`
      library.

    Here we can start to see some of the major benefits of farming as much
    functionality as possible out to common build dependencies rather than
    duplicating logic across all build scripts!

    Back to the case study though, let’s take a quick look at the contents of the
    `src` directory:

    ```c
    // src/hello.c

    #include <stdio.h>

    void hello() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
    }
    ```

    ```rust,ignore
    // src/main.rs

    // Note the lack of the `#[link]` attribute. We’re delegating the responsibility
    // of selecting what to link over to the build script rather than hard-coding
    // it in the source file.
    unsafe extern { fn hello(); }

    fn main() {
        unsafe { hello(); }
    }
    ```

    And there we go! This should complete our example of building some C code from a
    Cargo package using the build script itself. This also shows why using a build
    dependency can be crucial in many situations and even much more concise!

    We’ve also seen a brief example of how a build script can use a crate as a
    dependency purely for the build process and not for the crate itself at runtime.

    [`cc` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/cc

    ## Linking to system libraries

    This example demonstrates how to link a system library and how the build
    script is used to support this use case.

    Quite frequently a Rust crate wants to link to a native library provided on
    the system to bind its functionality or just use it as part of an
    implementation detail. This is quite a nuanced problem when it comes to
    performing this in a platform-agnostic fashion. It is best, if possible, to
    farm out as much of this as possible to make this as easy as possible for
    consumers.

    For this example, we will be creating a binding to the system's zlib library.
    This is a library that is commonly found on most Unix-like systems that
    provides data compression. This is already wrapped up in the [`libz-sys`
    crate], but for this example, we'll do an extremely simplified version. Check
    out [the source code][libz-source] for the full example.

    To make it easy to find the location of the library, we will use the
    [`pkg-config` crate]. This crate uses the system's `pkg-config` utility to
    discover information about a library. It will automatically tell Cargo what is
    needed to link the library. This will likely only work on Unix-like systems
    with `pkg-config` installed. Let's start by setting up the manifest:

    ```toml
    # Cargo.toml

    [package]
    name = "libz-sys"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"
    links = "z"

    [build-dependencies]
    pkg-config = "0.3.16"
    ```

    Take note that we included the `links` key in the `package` table. This tells
    Cargo that we are linking to the `libz` library. See ["Using another sys
    crate"](#using-another-sys-crate) for an example that will leverage this.

    The build script is fairly simple:

    ```rust,ignore
    // build.rs

    fn main() {
        pkg_config::Config::new().probe("zlib").unwrap();
        println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=build.rs");
    }
    ```

    Let's round out the example with a basic FFI binding:

    ```rust,ignore
    // src/lib.rs

    use std::os::raw::{c_uint, c_ulong};

    unsafe extern "C" {
        pub fn crc32(crc: c_ulong, buf: *const u8, len: c_uint) -> c_ulong;
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_crc32() {
        let s = "hello";
        unsafe {
            assert_eq!(crc32(0, s.as_ptr(), s.len() as c_uint), 0x3610a686);
        }
    }
    ```

    Run `cargo build -vv` to see the output from the build script. On a system
    with `libz` already installed, it may look something like this:

    ```text
    [libz-sys 0.1.0] cargo::rustc-link-search=native=/usr/lib
    [libz-sys 0.1.0] cargo::rustc-link-lib=z
    [libz-sys 0.1.0] cargo::rerun-if-changed=build.rs
    ```

    Nice! `pkg-config` did all the work of finding the library and telling Cargo
    where it is.

    It is not unusual for packages to include the source for the library, and
    build it statically if it is not found on the system, or if a feature or
    environment variable is set. For example, the real [`libz-sys` crate] checks the
    environment variable `LIBZ_SYS_STATIC` or the `static` feature to build it
    from source instead of using the system library. Check out [the
    source][libz-source] for a more complete example.

    [`libz-sys` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/libz-sys
    [`pkg-config` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/pkg-config
    [libz-source]: https://github.com/rust-lang/libz-sys

    ## Using another `sys` crate

    When using the `links` key, crates may set metadata that can be read by other
    crates that depend on it. This provides a mechanism to communicate information
    between crates. In this example, we'll be creating a C library that makes use
    of zlib from the real [`libz-sys` crate].

    If you have a C library that depends on zlib, you can leverage the [`libz-sys`
    crate] to automatically find it or build it. This is great for cross-platform
    support, such as Windows where zlib is not usually installed. `libz-sys` [sets
    the `include`
    metadata](https://github.com/rust-lang/libz-sys/blob/3c594e677c79584500da673f918c4d2101ac97a1/build.rs#L156)
    to tell other packages where to find the header files for zlib. Our build
    script can read that metadata with the `DEP_Z_INCLUDE` environment variable.
    Here's an example:

    ```toml
    # Cargo.toml

    [package]
    name = "zuser"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"

    [dependencies]
    libz-sys = "1.0.25"

    [build-dependencies]
    cc = "1.0.46"
    ```

    Here we have included `libz-sys` which will ensure that there is only one
    `libz` used in the final library, and give us access to it from our build
    script:

    ```rust,ignore
    // build.rs

    fn main() {
        let mut cfg = cc::Build::new();
        cfg.file("src/zuser.c");
        if let Some(include) = std::env::var_os("DEP_Z_INCLUDE") {
            cfg.include(include);
        }
        cfg.compile("zuser");
        println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=src/zuser.c");
    }
    ```

    With `libz-sys` doing all the heavy lifting, the C source code may now include
    the zlib header, and it should find the header, even on systems where it isn't
    already installed.

    ```c
    // src/zuser.c

    #include "zlib.h"

    // … rest of code that makes use of zlib.
    ```

    ## Conditional compilation

    A build script may emit [`rustc-cfg` instructions] which can enable conditions
    that can be checked at compile time. In this example, we'll take a look at how
    the [`openssl` crate] uses this to support multiple versions of the OpenSSL
    library.

    The [`openssl-sys` crate] implements building and linking the OpenSSL library.
    It supports multiple different implementations (like LibreSSL) and multiple
    versions. It makes use of the `links` key so that it may pass information to
    other build scripts. One of the things it passes is the `version_number` key,
    which is the version of OpenSSL that was detected. The code in the build
    script looks something [like
    this](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/blob/dc72a8e2c429e46c275e528b61a733a66e7877fc/openssl-sys/build/main.rs#L216):

    ```rust,ignore
    println!("cargo::metadata=version_number={openssl_version:x}");
    ```

    This instruction causes the `DEP_OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER` environment variable
    to be set in any crates that directly depend on `openssl-sys`.

    The `openssl` crate, which provides the higher-level interface, specifies
    `openssl-sys` as a dependency. The `openssl` build script can read the
    version information generated by the `openssl-sys` build script with the
    `DEP_OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER` environment variable. It uses this to generate
    some [`cfg`
    values](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/blob/dc72a8e2c429e46c275e528b61a733a66e7877fc/openssl/build.rs#L18-L36):

    ```rust,ignore
    // (portion of build.rs)

    println!("cargo::rustc-check-cfg=cfg(ossl101,ossl102)");
    println!("cargo::rustc-check-cfg=cfg(ossl110,ossl110g,ossl111)");

    if let Ok(version) = env::var("DEP_OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER") {
        let version = u64::from_str_radix(&version, 16).unwrap();

        if version >= 0x1_00_01_00_0 {
            println!("cargo::rustc-cfg=ossl101");
        }
        if version >= 0x1_00_02_00_0 {
            println!("cargo::rustc-cfg=ossl102");
        }
        if version >= 0x1_01_00_00_0 {
            println!("cargo::rustc-cfg=ossl110");
        }
        if version >= 0x1_01_00_07_0 {
            println!("cargo::rustc-cfg=ossl110g");
        }
        if version >= 0x1_01_01_00_0 {
            println!("cargo::rustc-cfg=ossl111");
        }
    }
    ```

    These `cfg` values can then be used with the [`cfg` attribute] or the [`cfg`
    macro] to conditionally include code. For example, SHA3 support was added in
    OpenSSL 1.1.1, so it is [conditionally
    excluded](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/blob/dc72a8e2c429e46c275e528b61a733a66e7877fc/openssl/src/hash.rs#L67-L85)
    for older versions:

    ```rust,ignore
    // (portion of openssl crate)

    #[cfg(ossl111)]
    pub fn sha3_224() -> MessageDigest {
        unsafe { MessageDigest(ffi::EVP_sha3_224()) }
    }
    ```

    Of course, one should be careful when using this, since it makes the resulting
    binary even more dependent on the build environment. In this example, if the
    binary is distributed to another system, it may not have the exact same shared
    libraries, which could cause problems.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `registry-index page of the documentation provided by Cargo`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Index Format\n\nThe following defines the format of the index. New features are occasionally\nadded, which are only understood starting with the version of Cargo that\nintroduced them. Older versions of Cargo may not be able to use packages that\nmake use of new features. However, the format for older packages should not\nchange, so older versions of Cargo should be able to use them.\n\n## Index Configuration\nThe root of the index contains a file named `config.json` which contains JSON\ninformation used by Cargo for accessing the registry. This is an example of\nwhat the [crates.io] config file looks like:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"dl\": \"https://crates.io/api/v1/crates\",\n    \"api\": \"https://crates.io\"\n}\n```\n\nThe keys are:\n- `dl`: This is the URL for downloading crates listed in the index. The value\n  may have the following markers which will be replaced with their\n  corresponding value:\n\n  - `{crate}`: The name of crate.\n  - `{version}`: The crate version.\n  - `{prefix}`: A directory prefix computed from the crate name. For example,\n    a crate named `cargo` has a prefix of `ca/rg`. See below for details.\n  - `{lowerprefix}`: Lowercase variant of `{prefix}`.\n  - `{sha256-checksum}`: The crate's sha256 checksum.\n\n  If none of the markers are present, then the value\n  `/{crate}/{version}/download` is appended to the end.\n- `api`: This is the base URL for the web API. This key is optional, but if it\n  is not specified, commands such as [`cargo publish`] will not work. The web\n  API is described below.\n- `auth-required`: indicates whether this is a private registry that requires\n  all operations to be authenticated including API requests, crate downloads\n  and sparse index updates.\n\n\n## Download Endpoint\nThe download endpoint should send the `.crate` file for the requested package.\nCargo supports https, http, and file URLs, HTTP redirects, HTTP1 and HTTP2.\nThe exact specifics of TLS support depend on the platform that Cargo is\nrunning on, the version of Cargo, and how it was compiled.\n\nIf `auth-required: true` is set in `config.json`, the `Authorization` header\nwill be included with http(s) download requests.\n\n## Index files\nThe rest of the index repository contains one file for each package, where the\nfilename is the name of the package in lowercase. Each version of the package\nhas a separate line in the file. The files are organized in a tier of\ndirectories:\n\n- Packages with 1 character names are placed in a directory named `1`.\n- Packages with 2 character names are placed in a directory named `2`.\n- Packages with 3 character names are placed in the directory\n  `3/{first-character}` where `{first-character}` is the first character of\n  the package name.\n- All other packages are stored in directories named\n  `{first-two}/{second-two}` where the top directory is the first two\n  characters of the package name, and the next subdirectory is the third and\n  fourth characters of the package name. For example, `cargo` would be stored\n  in a file named `ca/rg/cargo`.\n\n> Note: Although the index filenames are in lowercase, the fields that contain\n> package names in `Cargo.toml` and the index JSON data are case-sensitive and\n> may contain upper and lower case characters.\n\nThe directory name above is calculated based on the package name converted to\nlowercase; it is represented by the marker `{lowerprefix}`.  When the original\npackage name is used without case conversion, the resulting directory name is\nrepresented by the marker `{prefix}`.  For example, the package `MyCrate` would\nhave a `{prefix}` of `My/Cr` and a `{lowerprefix}` of `my/cr`.  In general,\nusing `{prefix}` is recommended over `{lowerprefix}`, but there are pros and\ncons to each choice.  Using `{prefix}` on case-insensitive filesystems results\nin (harmless-but-inelegant) directory aliasing.  For example, `crate` and\n`CrateTwo` have `{prefix}` values of `cr/at` and `Cr/at`; these are distinct on\nUnix machines but alias to the same directory on Windows.  Using directories\nwith normalized case avoids aliasing, but on case-sensitive filesystems it's\nharder to support older versions of Cargo that lack `{prefix}`/`{lowerprefix}`.\nFor example, nginx rewrite rules can easily construct `{prefix}` but can't\nperform case-conversion to construct `{lowerprefix}`.\n\n## Name restrictions\n\nRegistries should consider enforcing limitations on package names added to\ntheir index. Cargo itself allows names with any [alphanumeric], `-`, or `_`\ncharacters. [crates.io] imposes its own limitations, including the following:\n\n- Only allows ASCII characters.\n- Only alphanumeric, `-`, and `_` characters.\n- First character must be alphabetic.\n- Case-insensitive collision detection.\n- Prevent differences of `-` vs `_`.\n- Under a specific length (max 64).\n- Rejects reserved names, such as Windows special filenames like \"nul\".\n\nRegistries should consider incorporating similar restrictions, and consider\nthe security implications, such as [IDN homograph\nattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack) and other\nconcerns in [UTR36](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/) and\n[UTS39](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/).\n\n## Version uniqueness\n\nIndexes *must* ensure that each version only appears once for each package.\nThis includes ignoring SemVer build metadata.\nFor example, the index must *not* contain two entries with a version `1.0.7` and `1.0.7+extra`.\n\n## JSON schema\n\nEach line in a package file contains a JSON object that describes a published\nversion of the package. The following is a pretty-printed example with comments\nexplaining the format of the entry.\n\n```javascript\n{\n    // The name of the package.\n    // This must only contain alphanumeric, `-`, or `_` characters.\n    \"name\": \"foo\",\n    // The version of the package this row is describing.\n    // This must be a valid version number according to the Semantic\n    // Versioning 2.0.0 spec at https://semver.org/.\n    \"vers\": \"0.1.0\",\n    // Array of direct dependencies of the package.\n    \"deps\": [\n        {\n            // Name of the dependency.\n            // If the dependency is renamed from the original package name,\n            // this is the new name. The original package name is stored in\n            // the `package` field.\n            \"name\": \"rand\",\n            // The SemVer requirement for this dependency.\n            // This must be a valid version requirement defined at\n            // https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html.\n            \"req\": \"^0.6\",\n            // Array of features (as strings) enabled for this dependency.\n            // May be omitted since Cargo 1.84.\n            \"features\": [\"i128_support\"],\n            // Boolean of whether or not this is an optional dependency.\n            // Since Cargo 1.84, defaults to `false` if not specified.\n            \"optional\": false,\n            // Boolean of whether or not default features are enabled.\n            // Since Cargo 1.84, defaults to `true` if not specified.\n            \"default_features\": true,\n            // The target platform for the dependency.\n            // If not specified or `null`, it is not a target dependency.\n            // Otherwise, a string such as \"cfg(windows)\".\n            \"target\": null,\n            // The dependency kind.\n            // \"dev\", \"build\", or \"normal\".\n            // If not specified or `null`, it defaults to \"normal\".\n            \"kind\": \"normal\",\n            // The URL of the index of the registry where this dependency is\n            // from as a string.

The `git` protocol\nstores index files in a git repository and the `sparse` protocol fetches individual\nfiles over HTTP.\n\n### Git Protocol\nThe git protocol has no protocol prefix in the index url. For example the git index URL\nfor [crates.io] is `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`.\n\nCargo caches the git repository on disk so that it can efficiently incrementally fetch\nupdates.\n\n### Sparse Protocol\nThe sparse protocol uses the `sparse+` protocol prefix in the registry URL. For example,\nthe sparse index URL for [crates.io] is `sparse+https://index.crates.io/`.\n\nThe sparse protocol downloads each index file using an individual HTTP request. Since\nthis results in a large number of small HTTP requests, performance is significantly\nimproved with a server that supports pipelining and HTTP/2.\n\n#### Sparse authentication\nCargo will attempt to fetch the `config.json` file before\nfetching any other files. If the server responds with an HTTP 401, then Cargo will assume\nthat the registry requires authentication and re-attempt the request for `config.json`\nwith the authentication token included.\n\nOn authentication failure (or a missing authentication token) the server may include a\n`www-authenticate` header with a `Cargo login_url=\"<URL>\"` challenge to indicate where the user\ncan go to get a token.\n\nRegistries that require authentication must set `auth-required: true` in `config.json`.\n\n#### Caching\nCargo caches the crate metadata files, and captures the `ETag` or `Last-Modified` \nHTTP header from the server for each entry. When refreshing crate metadata, Cargo\nsends the `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since` header to allow the server to respond\nwith HTTP 304 \"Not Modified\" if the local cache is valid, saving time and bandwidth.\nIf both `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers are present, Cargo uses the `ETag` only.\n\n#### Cache Invalidation\nIf a registry is using some kind of CDN or proxy which caches access to the index files,\nthen it is recommended that registries implement some form of cache invalidation when\nthe files are updated. If these caches are not updated, then users may not be able to\naccess new crates until the cache is cleared.\n\n#### Nonexistent Crates\nFor crates that do not exist, the registry should respond with a 404 \"Not Found\", 410 \"Gone\"\nor 451 \"Unavailable For Legal Reasons\" code.\n\n#### Sparse Limitations\nSince the URL of the registry is stored in the lockfile, it's not recommended to offer\na registry with both protocols. Discussion about a transition plan is ongoing in issue \n[#10964]. The [crates.io] registry is an exception, since Cargo internally substitutes\nthe equivalent git URL when the sparse protocol is used.\n\nIf a registry does offer both protocols, it's currently recommended to choose one protocol\nas the canonical protocol and use [source replacement] for the other protocol.\n\n\n[`cargo publish`]: ../commands/cargo-publish.md\n[alphanumeric]: ../../std/primitive.char.html#method.is_alphanumeric\n[crates.io]: https://crates.io/\n[source replacement]: ../reference/source-replacement.md\n[#10964]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10964"

    Documentation text:

    # Registry Authentication
    Cargo authenticates to registries with credential providers. These
    credential providers are external executables or built-in providers that Cargo
    uses to store and retrieve credentials.

    Using alternative registries with authentication *requires* a credential provider to be configured
    to avoid unknowingly storing unencrypted credentials on disk. For historical reasons, public
    (non-authenticated) registries do not require credential provider configuration, and the `cargo:token`
    provider is used if no providers are configured.

    Cargo also includes platform-specific providers that use the operating system to securely store
    tokens. The `cargo:token` provider is also included which stores credentials in unencrypted plain
    text in the [credentials](config.md#credentials) file.

    ## Recommended configuration
    It's recommended to configure a global credential provider list in `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml`
    which defaults to:
    * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\config.toml`
    * Unix: `~/.cargo/config.toml`

    This recommended configuration uses the operating system provider, with a fallback to `cargo:token`
    to look in Cargo's [credentials](config.md#credentials) file or environment variables:
    ```toml
    # ~/.cargo/config.toml
    [registry]
    global-credential-providers = ["cargo:token", "cargo:libsecret", "cargo:macos-keychain", "cargo:wincred"]
    ```
    *Note that later entries have higher precedence.
    See [`registry.global-credential-providers`](config.md#registryglobal-credential-providers)
    for more details.*

    Some private registries may also recommend a registry-specific credential-provider. Check your
    registry's documentation to see if this is the case.

    ## Built-in providers
    Cargo includes several built-in credential providers. The available built-in providers
    may change in future Cargo releases (though there are currently no plans to do so).

    ### `cargo:token`
    Uses Cargo's [credentials](config.md#credentials) file to store tokens unencrypted in plain text.
    When retrieving tokens, checks the `CARGO_REGISTRIES_<NAME>_TOKEN` environment variable.
    If this credential provider is not listed, then the `*_TOKEN` environment variables will not work.

    ### `cargo:wincred`
    Uses the Windows Credential Manager to store tokens.

    The credentials are stored as `cargo-registry:<index-url>` in the Credential Manager
    under "Windows Credentials".

    ### `cargo:macos-keychain`
    Uses the macOS Keychain to store tokens.

    The Keychain Access app can be used to view stored tokens.

    ### `cargo:libsecret`
    Uses [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) to store tokens.

    Any password manager with libsecret support can be used to view stored tokens.
    The following are a few examples (non-exhaustive):

    - [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring)
    - [KDE Wallet Manager](https://apps.kde.org/kwalletmanager5/) (since KDE Frameworks 5.97.0)
    - [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) (since 2.5.0)

    ### `cargo:token-from-stdout <command> <args>`
    Launch a subprocess that returns a token on stdout. Newlines will be trimmed.
    * The process inherits the user's stdin and stderr.
    * It should exit 0 on success, and nonzero on error.
    * [`cargo login`] and [`cargo logout`] are not supported and return an error if used.

    The following environment variables will be provided to the executed command:

    * `CARGO` --- Path to the `cargo` binary executing the command.

    ## Credential plugins
    For credential provider plugins that follow Cargo's [credential provider protocol](credential-provider-protocol.md),
    the configuration value should be a string with the path to the executable (or the executable name if on the `PATH`).

    For example, to install [cargo-credential-1password](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-credential-1password)
    from crates.io do the following:

    Install the provider with `cargo install cargo-credential-1password`

    In the config, add to (or create) `registry.global-credential-providers`:
    ```toml
    [registry]
    global-credential-providers = ["cargo:token", "cargo-credential-1password --account my.1password.com"]
    ```

    The values in `global-credential-providers` are split on spaces into path and command-line arguments. To
    define a global credential provider where the path or arguments contain spaces, use
    the [`[credential-alias]` table](config.md#credential-alias).

    # Features

    Cargo "features" provide a mechanism to express [conditional compilation] and
    [optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies). A package defines a set of
    named features in the `[features]` table of `Cargo.toml`, and each feature can
    either be enabled or disabled. Features for the package being built can be
    enabled on the command-line with flags such as `--features`. Features for
    dependencies can be enabled in the dependency declaration in `Cargo.toml`.

    > **Note**: New crates or versions published on crates.io are now limited to
    > a maximum of 300 features. Exceptions are granted on a case-by-case basis.
    > See this [blog post] for details. Participation in solution discussions is
    > encouraged via the crates.io Zulip stream.

    ## The `[features]` section

    Features are defined in the `[features]` table in `Cargo.toml`. Each feature
    specifies an array of other features or optional dependencies that it enables.
    The following examples illustrate how features could be used for a 2D image
    processing library where support for different image formats can be optionally
    included:

    ```toml
    [features]
    # Defines a feature named `webp` that does not enable any other features.
    webp = []
    ```

    With this feature defined, [`cfg` expressions] can be used to conditionally
    include code to support the requested feature at compile time. For example,
    inside `lib.rs` of the package could include this:

    ```rust
    // This conditionally includes a module which implements WEBP support.
    #[cfg(feature = "webp")]
    pub mod webp;
    ```

    Cargo sets features in the package using the `rustc` [`--cfg` flag], and code
    can test for their presence with the [`cfg` attribute] or the [`cfg` macro].

    Features can list other features to enable. For example, the ICO image format
    can contain BMP and PNG images, so when it is enabled, it should make sure
    those other features are enabled, too:

    ```toml
    [features]
    bmp = []
    png = []
    ico = ["bmp", "png"]
    webp = []
    ```

    Feature names may include characters from the [Unicode XID standard] (which
    includes most letters), and additionally allows starting with `_` or digits
    `0` through `9`, and after the first character may also contain `-`, `+`, or
    `.`.

    > that they must only be [ASCII alphanumeric] characters or `_`, `-`, or `+`.

    ## The `default` feature

    By default, all features are disabled unless explicitly enabled. This can be
    changed by specifying the `default` feature:

    ```toml
    [features]
    default = ["ico", "webp"]
    bmp = []
    png = []
    ico = ["bmp", "png"]
    webp = []
    ```

    When the package is built, the `default` feature is enabled which in turn
    enables the listed features. This behavior can be changed by:

    * The `--no-default-features` [command-line
      flag](#command-line-feature-options) disables the default features of the
      package.
    * The `default-features = false` option can be specified in a [dependency
      declaration](#dependency-features).

    ## Optional dependencies

    Dependencies can be marked "optional", which means they will not be compiled
    by default. For example, let's say that our 2D image processing library uses
    an external package to handle GIF images. This can be expressed like this:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    gif = { version = "0.11.1", optional = true }
    ```

    By default, this optional dependency implicitly defines a feature that looks
    like this:

    ```toml
    [features]
    gif = ["dep:gif"]
    ```

    This means that this dependency will only be included if the `gif`
    feature is enabled.
    The same `cfg(feature = "gif")` syntax can be used in the code, and the
    dependency can be enabled just like any feature such as `--features gif` (see
    [Command-line feature options](#command-line-feature-options) below).

    In some cases, you may not want to expose a feature that has the same name
    as the optional dependency.
    For example, perhaps the optional dependency is an internal detail, or you
    want to group multiple optional dependencies together, or you just want to use
    a better name.
    If you specify the optional dependency with the `dep:` prefix anywhere
    in the `[features]` table, that disables the implicit feature.

    > **Note**: The `dep:` syntax is only available starting with Rust 1.60.
    > Previous versions can only use the implicit feature name.

    For example, let's say in order to support the AVIF image format, our library
    needs two other dependencies to be enabled:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    ravif = { version = "0.6.3", optional = true }
    rgb = { version = "0.8.25", optional = true }

    [features]
    avif = ["dep:ravif", "dep:rgb"]
    ```

    In this example, the `avif` feature will enable the two listed dependencies.
    This also avoids creating the implicit `ravif` and `rgb` features, since we
    don't want users to enable those individually as they are internal details to
    our crate.

    > **Note**: Another way to optionally include a dependency is to use
    > [platform-specific dependencies]. Instead of using features, these are
    > conditional based on the target platform.

    ## Dependency features

    Features of dependencies can be enabled within the dependency declaration. The
    `features` key indicates which features to enable:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    # Enables the `derive` feature of serde.
    serde = { version = "1.0.118", features = ["derive"] }
    ```

    The [`default` features](#the-default-feature) can be disabled using
    `default-features = false`:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    flate2 = { version = "1.0.3", default-features = false, features = ["zlib-rs"] }
    ```

    > **Note**: This may not ensure the default features are disabled. If another
    > dependency includes `flate2` without specifying `default-features = false`,
    > then the default features will be enabled. See [feature
    > unification](#feature-unification) below for more details.

    Features of dependencies can also be enabled in the `[features]` table. The
    syntax is `"package-name/feature-name"`. For example:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    jpeg-decoder = { version = "0.1.20", default-features = false }

    [features]
    # Enables parallel processing support by enabling the "rayon" feature of jpeg-decoder.
    parallel = ["jpeg-decoder/rayon"]
    ```

    The `"package-name/feature-name"` syntax will also enable `package-name`
    if it is an optional dependency. Often this is not what you want.
    You can add a `?` as in `"package-name?/feature-name"` which will only enable
    the given feature if something else enables the optional dependency.

    > **Note**: The `?` syntax is only available starting with Rust 1.60.

    For example, let's say we have added some serialization support to our
    library, and it requires enabling a corresponding feature in some optional
    dependencies.
    That can be done like this:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    serde = { version = "1.0.133", optional = true }
    rgb = { version = "0.8.25", optional = true }

    [features]
    serde = ["dep:serde", "rgb?/serde"]
    ```

    In this example, enabling the `serde` feature will enable the serde
    dependency.
    It will also enable the `serde` feature for the `rgb` dependency, but only if
    something else has enabled the `rgb` dependency.

    ## Command-line feature options

    The following command-line flags can be used to control which features are
    enabled:

    * `--features` _FEATURES_: Enables the listed features. Multiple features may
      be separated with commas or spaces. If using spaces, be sure to use quotes
      around all the features if running Cargo from a shell (such as `--features
      "foo bar"`). If building multiple packages in a [workspace], the
      `package-name/feature-name` syntax can be used to specify features for
      specific workspace members.

    * `--all-features`: Activates all features of all packages selected on the
      command-line.

    * `--no-default-features`: Does not activate the [`default`
      feature](#the-default-feature) of the selected packages.

    [workspace]: workspaces.md

    ## Feature unification

    Features are unique to the package that defines them. Enabling a feature on a
    package does not enable a feature of the same name on other packages.

    When a dependency is used by multiple packages, Cargo will use the union of
    all features enabled on that dependency when building it. This helps ensure
    that only a single copy of the dependency is used. See the [features section]
    of the resolver documentation for more details.

    For example, let's look at the [`winapi`] package which uses a [large
    number][winapi-features] of features. If your package depends on a package
    `foo` which enables the "fileapi" and "handleapi" features of `winapi`, and
    another dependency `bar` which enables the "std" and "winnt" features of
    `winapi`, then `winapi` will be built with all four of those features enabled.

    ![winapi features example](../images/winapi-features.svg)

    [`winapi`]: https://crates.io/crates/winapi
    [winapi-features]: https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs/blob/0.3.9/Cargo.toml#L25-L431

    A consequence of this is that features should be *additive*. That is, enabling
    a feature should not disable functionality, and it should usually be safe to
    enable any combination of features. A feature should not introduce a
    [SemVer-incompatible change](#semver-compatibility).

    For example, if you want to optionally support [`no_std`] environments, **do
    not** use a `no_std` feature. Instead, use a `std` feature that *enables*
    `std`. For example:

    ```rust
    #![no_std]

    #[cfg(feature = "std")]
    extern crate std;

    #[cfg(feature = "std")]
    pub fn function_that_requires_std() {
        // ...
    }
    ```

    [`no_std`]: ../../reference/names/preludes.html#the-no_std-attribute
    [features section]: resolver.md#features

    ### Mutually exclusive features

    There are rare cases where features may be mutually incompatible with one
    another. This should be avoided if at all possible, because it requires
    coordinating all uses of the package in the dependency graph to cooperate to
    avoid enabling them together. If it is not possible, consider adding a compile
    error to detect this scenario. For example:

    ```rust,ignore
    #[cfg(all(feature = "foo", feature = "bar"))]
    compile_error!("feature \"foo\" and feature \"bar\" cannot be enabled at the same time");
    ```

    Instead of using mutually exclusive features, consider some other options:

    * Split the functionality into separate packages.
    * When there is a conflict, [choose one feature over
      another][feature-precedence]. The [`cfg-if`] package can help with writing
      more complex `cfg` expressions.
    * Architect the code to allow the features to be enabled concurrently, and use
      runtime options to control which is used. For example, use a config file,
      command-line argument, or environment variable to choose which behavior to
      enable.

    [`cfg-if`]: https://crates.io/crates/cfg-if
    [feature-precedence]: features-examples.md#feature-precedence

    ### Inspecting resolved features

    In complex dependency graphs, it can sometimes be difficult to understand how
    different features get enabled on various packages. The [`cargo tree`] command
    offers several options to help inspect and visualize which features are
    enabled. Some options to try:

    * `cargo tree -e features`: This will show features in the dependency graph.
      Each feature will appear showing which package enabled it.
    * `cargo tree -f "{p} {f}"`: This is a more compact view that shows a
      comma-separated list of features enabled on each package.
    * `cargo tree -e features -i foo`: This will invert the tree, showing how
      features flow into the given package "foo". This can be useful because
      viewing the entire graph can be quite large and overwhelming. Use this when
      you are trying to figure out which features are enabled on a specific
      package and why. See the example at the bottom of the [`cargo tree`] page on
      how to read this.

    ## Feature resolver version 2

    A different feature resolver can be specified with the `resolver` field in
    `Cargo.toml`, like this:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-package"
    version = "1.0.0"
    resolver = "2"
    ```

    See the [resolver versions] section for more detail on specifying resolver
    versions.

    The version `"2"` resolver avoids unifying features in a few situations where
    that unification can be unwanted. The exact situations are described in the
    [resolver chapter][resolver-v2], but in short, it avoids unifying in these
    situations:

    * Features enabled on [platform-specific dependencies] for [target architectures][target] not
      currently being built are ignored.
    * [Build-dependencies] and proc-macros do not share features with normal
      dependencies.
    * [Dev-dependencies] do not activate features unless building a [Cargo target][target] that
      needs them (like tests or examples).

    Avoiding the unification is necessary for some situations. For example, if a
    build-dependency enables a `std` feature, and the same dependency is used as a
    normal dependency for a `no_std` environment, enabling `std` would break the
    build.

    However, one drawback is that this can increase build times because the
    dependency is built multiple times (each with different features). When using
    the version `"2"` resolver, it is recommended to check for dependencies that
    are built multiple times to reduce overall build time. If it is not *required*
    to build those duplicated packages with separate features, consider adding
    features to the `features` list in the [dependency
    declaration](#dependency-features) so that the duplicates end up with the same
    features (and thus Cargo will build it only once). You can detect these
    duplicate dependencies with the [`cargo tree --duplicates`][`cargo tree`]
    command. It will show which packages are built multiple times; look for any
    entries listed with the same version. See [Inspecting resolved
    features](#inspecting-resolved-features) for more on fetching information on
    the resolved features. For build dependencies, this is not necessary if you
    are cross-compiling with the `--target` flag because build dependencies are
    always built separately from normal dependencies in that scenario.

    [target]: ../appendix/glossary.md#target

    ### Resolver version 2 command-line flags

    The `resolver = "2"` setting also changes the behavior of the `--features` and
    `--no-default-features` [command-line options](#command-line-feature-options).

    With version `"1"`, you can only enable features for the package in the
    current working directory. For example, in a workspace with packages `foo` and
    `bar`, and you are in the directory for package `foo`, and ran the command
    `cargo build -p bar --features bar-feat`, this would fail because the
    `--features` flag only allowed enabling features on `foo`.

    With `resolver = "2"`, the features flags allow enabling features for any of
    the packages selected on the command-line with `-p` and `--workspace` flags.
    For example:

    ```sh
    # This command is allowed with resolver = "2", regardless of which directory
    # you are in.
    cargo build -p foo -p bar --features foo-feat,bar-feat

    # This explicit equivalent works with any resolver version:
    cargo build -p foo -p bar --features foo/foo-feat,bar/bar-feat
    ```

    Additionally, with `resolver = "1"`, the `--no-default-features` flag only
    disables the default feature for the package in the current directory. With
    version "2", it will disable the default features for all workspace members.

    ## Build scripts

    [Build scripts] can detect which features are enabled on the package by

    the feature name converted to uppercase and `-` converted to `_`.

    [build scripts]: build-scripts.md

    ## Required features

    details.

    [Cargo targets]: cargo-targets.md

    ## SemVer compatibility

    Enabling a feature should not introduce a SemVer-incompatible change. For
    example, the feature shouldn't change an existing API in a way that could
    break existing uses. More details about what changes are compatible can be
    found in the [SemVer Compatibility chapter](semver.md).

    Care should be taken when adding and removing feature definitions and optional
    dependencies, as these can sometimes be backwards-incompatible changes. More
    details can be found in the [Cargo section](semver.md#cargo) of the SemVer
    Compatibility chapter. In short, follow these rules:

    * The following is usually safe to do in a minor release:
      * Add a [new feature][cargo-feature-add] or [optional dependency][cargo-dep-add].
      * [Change the features used on a dependency][cargo-change-dep-feature].
    * The following should usually **not** be done in a minor release:
      * [Remove a feature][cargo-feature-remove] or [optional dependency][cargo-remove-opt-dep].
      * [Moving existing public code behind a feature][item-remove].

    ## Feature documentation and discovery

    You are encouraged to document which features are available in your package.
    This can be done by adding [doc comments] at the top of `lib.rs`. As an
    example, see the [regex crate source], which when rendered can be viewed on
    [docs.rs][regex-docs-rs]. If you have other documentation, such as a user
    guide, consider adding the documentation there (for example, see [serde.rs]).
    If you have a binary project, consider documenting the features in the README
    or other documentation for the project (for example, see [sccache]).

    Clearly documenting the features can set expectations about features that are
    considered "unstable" or otherwise shouldn't be used. For example, if there is
    an optional dependency, but you don't want users to explicitly list that
    optional dependency as a feature, exclude it from the documented list.

    Documentation published on [docs.rs] can use metadata in `Cargo.toml` to
    control which features are enabled when the documentation is built. See
    [docs.rs metadata documentation] for more details.

    > **Note**: Rustdoc has experimental support for annotating the documentation

    ### Discovering features

    When features are documented in the library API, this can make it easier for
    your users to discover which features are available and what they do. If the
    feature documentation for a package isn't readily available, you can look at
    the `Cargo.toml` file, but sometimes it can be hard to track it down. The
    crate page on [crates.io] has a link to the source repository if available.
    Tools like [`cargo vendor`] or [cargo-clone-crate] can be used to download the
    source and inspect it.

    ## Feature combinations

    Because features are a form of conditional compilation, they require an exponential number of configurations and test cases to be 100% covered. By default, tests, docs, and other tooling such as [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) will only run with the default set of features.

    We encourage you to consider your strategy and tooling in regards to different feature combinations --- Every project will have different requirements in conjunction with time, resources, and the cost-benefit of covering specific scenarios. Common configurations may be with / without default features, specific combinations of features, or all combinations of features.

    # Cargo Targets

    Cargo packages consist of *targets* which correspond to source files which can
    be compiled into a crate. Packages can have [library](#library),
    [binary](#binaries), [example](#examples), [test](#tests), and
    [benchmark](#benchmarks) targets. The list of targets can be configured in the
    `Cargo.toml` manifest, often [inferred automatically](#target-auto-discovery)
    by the [directory layout][package layout] of the source files.

    See [Configuring a target](#configuring-a-target) below for details on
    configuring the settings for a target.

    ## Library

    The library target defines a "library" that can be used and linked by other
    libraries and executables. The filename defaults to `src/lib.rs`, and the name
    of the library defaults to the name of the package, with any dashes replaced
    with underscores. A package can have only one library. The settings for the
    library can be [customized] in the `[lib]` table in `Cargo.toml`.

    ```toml
    # Example of customizing the library in Cargo.toml.
    [lib]
    crate-type = ["cdylib"]
    bench = false
    ```

    ## Binaries

    Binary targets are executable programs that can be run after being compiled.
    A binary's source can be `src/main.rs` and/or stored in the [`src/bin/`
    directory][package layout]. For `src/main.rs`, the default binary name is the
    package name. The settings for each binary can be [customized] in the`[[bin]]`
    tables in `Cargo.toml`.

    Binaries can use the public API of the package's library. They are also linked
    with the [`[dependencies]`][dependencies] defined in `Cargo.toml`.

    You can run individual binaries with the [`cargo run`] command with the `--bin
    <bin-name>` option. [`cargo install`] can be used to copy the executable to a
    common location.

    ```toml
    # Example of customizing binaries in Cargo.toml.
    [[bin]]
    name = "cool-tool"
    test = false
    bench = false

    [[bin]]
    name = "frobnicator"
    required-features = ["frobnicate"]
    ```

    ## Examples

    Files located under the [`examples` directory][package layout] are example
    uses of the functionality provided by the library. When compiled, they are
    placed in the [`target/debug/examples` directory][build cache].

    Examples can use the public API of the package's library. They are also linked
    with the [`[dependencies]`][dependencies] and
    [`[dev-dependencies]`][dev-dependencies] defined in `Cargo.toml`.

    By default, examples are executable binaries (with a `main()` function). You
    can specify the [`crate-type` field](#the-crate-type-field) to make an example
    be compiled as a library:

    ```toml
    [[example]]
    name = "foo"
    crate-type = ["staticlib"]
    ```

    You can run individual executable examples with the [`cargo run`] command with
    the `--example <example-name>` option. Library examples can be built with
    [`cargo build`] with the `--example <example-name>` option. [`cargo install`]
    with the `--example <example-name>` option can be used to copy executable
    binaries to a common location. Examples are compiled by [`cargo test`] by
    default to protect them from bit-rotting. Set [the `test`
    field](#the-test-field) to `true` if you have `#[test]` functions in the
    example that you want to run with [`cargo test`].

    ## Tests

    There are two styles of tests within a Cargo project:

    * *Unit tests* which are functions marked with the [`#[test]`
      attribute][test-attribute] located within your library or binaries (or any
      target enabled with [the `test` field](#the-test-field)). These tests have
      access to private APIs located within the target they are defined in.
    * *Integration tests* which is a separate executable binary, also containing
      `#[test]` functions, which is linked with the project's library and has
      access to its *public* API.

    Tests are run with the [`cargo test`] command. By default, Cargo and `rustc`
    use the [libtest harness] which is responsible for collecting functions
    annotated with the [`#[test]` attribute][test-attribute] and executing them in
    parallel, reporting the success and failure of each test. See [the `harness`
    field](#the-harness-field) if you want to use a different harness or test
    strategy.

    > **Note**: There is another special style of test in Cargo:
    > [documentation tests][documentation examples].
    > They are handled by `rustdoc` and have a slightly different execution model.
    > For more information, please see [`cargo test`][cargo-test-documentation-tests].

    [libtest harness]: ../../rustc/tests/index.html
    [cargo-test-documentation-tests]: ../commands/cargo-test.md#documentation-tests

    ### Integration tests

    Files located under the [`tests` directory][package layout] are integration
    tests. When you run [`cargo test`], Cargo will compile each of these files as
    a separate crate, and execute them.

    Integration tests can use the public API of the package's library. They are
    also linked with the [`[dependencies]`][dependencies] and
    [`[dev-dependencies]`][dev-dependencies] defined in `Cargo.toml`.

    If you want to share code among multiple integration tests, you can place it
    in a separate module such as `tests/common/mod.rs` and then put `mod common;`
    in each test to import it.

    Each integration test results in a separate executable binary, and [`cargo
    test`] will run them serially. In some cases this can be inefficient, as it
    can take longer to compile, and may not make full use of multiple CPUs when
    running the tests. If you have a lot of integration tests, you may want to
    consider creating a single integration test, and split the tests into multiple
    modules. The libtest harness will automatically find all of the `#[test]`
    annotated functions and run them in parallel. You can pass module names to
    [`cargo test`] to only run the tests within that module.

    Binary targets are automatically built if there is an integration test. This
    allows an integration test to execute the binary to exercise and test its
    behavior. The `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` [environment variable] is set when the
    integration test is built so that it can use the [`env` macro] to locate the
    executable.

    [environment variable]: environment-variables.md#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates
    [`env` macro]: ../../std/macro.env.html

    ## Benchmarks

    Benchmarks provide a way to test the performance of your code using the
    [`cargo bench`] command. They follow the same structure as [tests](#tests),
    with each benchmark function annotated with the `#[bench]` attribute.
    Similarly to tests:

    * Benchmarks are placed in the [`benches` directory][package layout].
    * Benchmark functions defined in libraries and binaries have access to the
      *private* API within the target they are defined in. Benchmarks in the
      `benches` directory may use the *public* API.
    * [The `bench` field](#the-bench-field) can be used to define which targets
      are benchmarked by default.
    * [The `harness` field](#the-harness-field) can be used to disable the
      built-in harness.

    > **Note**: The [`#[bench]`
    > attribute](../../unstable-book/library-features/test.html) is currently
    > unstable and only available on the [nightly channel]. There are some
    > packages available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/keywords/benchmark) that
    > may help with running benchmarks on the stable channel, such as
    > [Criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion).

    ## Configuring a target

    All of the  `[lib]`, `[[bin]]`, `[[example]]`, `[[test]]`, and `[[bench]]`
    sections in `Cargo.toml` support similar configuration for specifying how a
    target should be built. The double-bracket sections like `[[bin]]` are
    [array-of-table of TOML](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0-rc.3#array-of-tables),
    which means you can write more than one `[[bin]]` section to make several
    executables in your crate. You can only specify one library, so `[lib]` is a
    normal TOML table.

    The following is an overview of the TOML settings for each target, with each
    field described in detail below.

    ```toml
    [lib]
    name = "foo"           # The name of the target.
    path = "src/lib.rs"    # The source file of the target.
    test = true            # Is tested by default.
    doctest = true         # Documentation examples are tested by default.
    bench = true           # Is benchmarked by default.
    doc = true             # Is documented by default.
    proc-macro = false     # Set to `true` for a proc-macro library.
    harness = true         # Use libtest harness.
    crate-type = ["lib"]   # The crate types to generate.
    required-features = [] # Features required to build this target (N/A for lib).
    ```

    ### The `name` field

    The `name` field specifies the name of the target, which corresponds to the
    filename of the artifact that will be generated. For a library, this is the
    crate name that dependencies will use to reference it.

    For the library target, this defaults to the name of the package , with any
    dashes replaced with underscores. For the default binary (`src/main.rs`),
    it also defaults to the name of the package, with no replacement for dashes.
    For [auto discovered](#target-auto-discovery) targets, it defaults to the
    directory or file name.

    This is required for all targets except `[lib]`.

    ### The `path` field

    The `path` field specifies where the source for the crate is located, relative
    to the `Cargo.toml` file.

    If not specified, the [inferred path](#target-auto-discovery) is used based on
    the target name.

    ### The `test` field

    The `test` field indicates whether or not the target is tested by default by
    [`cargo test`]. The default is `true` for lib, bins, and tests.

    > **Note**: Examples are built by [`cargo test`] by default to ensure they
    > continue to compile, but they are not *tested* by default. Setting `test =
    > true` for an example will also build it as a test and run any
    > [`#[test]`][test-attribute] functions defined in the example.

    ### The `doctest` field

    The `doctest` field indicates whether or not [documentation examples] are
    tested by default by [`cargo test`]. This is only relevant for libraries, it
    has no effect on other sections. The default is `true` for the library.

    ### The `bench` field

    The `bench` field indicates whether or not the target is benchmarked by
    default by [`cargo bench`]. The default is `true` for lib, bins, and
    benchmarks.

    ### The `doc` field

    The `doc` field indicates whether or not the target is included in the
    documentation generated by [`cargo doc`] by default. The default is `true` for
    libraries and binaries.

    > **Note**: The binary will be skipped if its name is the same as the lib
    > target.

    ### The `plugin` field

    This option is deprecated and unused.

    ### The `proc-macro` field

    The `proc-macro` field indicates that the library is a [procedural macro]
    ([reference][proc-macro-reference]). This is only valid for the `[lib]`
    target.

    ### The `harness` field

    The `harness` field indicates that the [`--test` flag] will be passed to
    `rustc` which will automatically include the libtest library which is the
    driver for collecting and running tests marked with the [`#[test]`
    attribute][test-attribute] or benchmarks with the `#[bench]` attribute. The
    default is `true` for all targets.

    If set to `false`, then you are responsible for defining a `main()` function
    to run tests and benchmarks.

    Tests have the [`cfg(test)` conditional expression][cfg-test] enabled whether
    or not the harness is enabled.

    ### The `crate-type` field

    The `crate-type` field defines the [crate types] that will be generated by the
    target. It is an array of strings, allowing you to specify multiple crate
    types for a single target. This can only be specified for libraries and
    examples. Binaries, tests, and benchmarks are always the "bin" crate type. The
    defaults are:

    Target | Crate Type
    -------|-----------
    Normal library | `"lib"`
    Proc-macro library | `"proc-macro"`
    Example | `"bin"`

    The available options are `bin`, `lib`, `rlib`, `dylib`, `cdylib`,
    `staticlib`, and `proc-macro`. You can read more about the different crate
    types in the [Rust Reference Manual][crate types].

    ### The `required-features` field

    The `required-features` field specifies which [features] the target needs in
    order to be built. If any of the required features are not enabled, the
    target will be skipped. This is only relevant for the `[[bin]]`, `[[bench]]`,
    `[[test]]`, and `[[example]]` sections, it has no effect on `[lib]`.

    ```toml
    [features]
    # ...
    postgres = []
    sqlite = []
    tools = []

    [[bin]]
    name = "my-pg-tool"
    required-features = ["postgres", "tools"]
    ```

    ### The `edition` field

    The `edition` field defines the [Rust edition] the target will use. If not
    specified, it defaults to the [`edition` field][package-edition] for the
    `[package]`.

    > **Note:** This field is deprecated and will be removed in a future Edition

    ## Target auto-discovery

    By default, Cargo automatically determines the targets to build based on the
    [layout of the files][package layout] on the filesystem. The target
    configuration tables, such as `[lib]`, `[[bin]]`, `[[test]]`, `[[bench]]`, or
    `[[example]]`, can be used to add additional targets that don't follow the
    standard directory layout.

    The automatic target discovery can be disabled so that only manually
    configured targets will be built. Setting the keys `autolib`, `autobins`, `autoexamples`,
    `autotests`, or `autobenches` to `false` in the `[package]` section will
    disable auto-discovery of the corresponding target type.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    autolib = false
    autobins = false
    autoexamples = false
    autotests = false
    autobenches = false
    ```

    Disabling automatic discovery should only be needed for specialized
    situations. For example, if you have a library where you want a *module* named
    `bin`, this would present a problem because Cargo would usually attempt to
    compile anything in the `bin` directory as an executable. Here is a sample
    layout of this scenario:

    ```text
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        ├── lib.rs
        └── bin
            └── mod.rs
    ```

    To prevent Cargo from inferring `src/bin/mod.rs` as an executable, set
    `autobins = false` in `Cargo.toml` to disable auto-discovery:

    ```toml
    [package]
    # …
    autobins = false
    ```

    > **Note**: For packages with the 2015 edition, the default for auto-discovery
    > is `false` if at least one target is manually defined in `Cargo.toml`.
    > Beginning with the 2018 edition, the default is always `true`.

    > **MSRV:** Respected as of 1.27 for `autobins`, `autoexamples`, `autotests`, and `autobenches`

    > **MSRV:** Respected as of 1.83 for `autolib`

    # Future incompat report

    Cargo checks for future-incompatible warnings in all dependencies. These are warnings for
    changes that may become hard errors in the future, causing the dependency to
    stop building in a future version of rustc. If any warnings are found, a small
    notice is displayed indicating that the warnings were found, and provides
    instructions on how to display a full report.

    For example, you may see something like this at the end of a build:

    ```text
    warning: the following packages contain code that will be rejected by a future
             version of Rust: rental v0.5.5
    note: to see what the problems were, use the option `--future-incompat-report`,
          or run `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1`
    ```

    A full report can be displayed with the `cargo report future-incompatibilities
    --id ID` command, or by running the build again with
    the `--future-incompat-report` flag. The developer should then update their
    dependencies to a version where the issue is fixed, or work with the
    developers of the dependencies to help resolve the issue.

    ## Configuration

    This feature can be configured through a [`[future-incompat-report]`][config]
    section in `.cargo/config.toml`. Currently, the supported options are:

    ```toml
    [future-incompat-report]
    frequency = "always"
    ```

    The supported values for the frequency are `"always"` and `"never"`, which control
    whether or not a message is printed out at the end of `cargo build` / `cargo check`.

    # Unstable Features

    Experimental Cargo features are only available on the [nightly channel]. You
    are encouraged to experiment with these features to see if they meet your
    needs, and if there are any issues or problems. Check the linked tracking
    issues listed below for more information on the feature, and click the GitHub
    subscribe button if you want future updates.

    After some period of time, if the feature does not have any major concerns, it
    can be [stabilized], which will make it available on stable once the current
    nightly release reaches the stable channel (anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks).

    There are three different ways that unstable features can be enabled based on
    how the feature works:

    * New syntax in `Cargo.toml` requires a `cargo-features` key at the top of
      `Cargo.toml`, before any tables. For example:

      ```toml
      # This specifies which new Cargo.toml features are enabled.
      cargo-features = ["test-dummy-unstable"]

      [package]

      version = "0.1.0"
      im-a-teapot = true  # This is a new option enabled by test-dummy-unstable.
      ```

    * New command-line flags, options, and subcommands require the `-Z
      unstable-options` CLI option to also be included. For example, the new
      `--artifact-dir` option is only available on nightly:

      ```cargo +nightly build --artifact-dir=out -Z unstable-options```

    * `-Z` command-line flags are used to enable new functionality that may not
      have an interface, or the interface has not yet been designed, or for more
      complex features that affect multiple parts of Cargo. For example, the
      [mtime-on-use](#mtime-on-use) feature can be enabled with:

      ```cargo +nightly build -Z mtime-on-use```

      Run `cargo -Z help` to see a list of flags available.

      Anything which can be configured with a `-Z` flag can also be set in the
      cargo [config file] (`.cargo/config.toml`) in the `unstable` table. For
      example:

      ```toml
      [unstable]
      mtime-on-use = true
      build-std = ["core", "alloc"]
      ```

    Each new feature described below should explain how to use it.

    ## allow-features

    This permanently-unstable flag makes it so that only a listed set of
    unstable features can be used. Specifically, if you pass
    `-Zallow-features=foo,bar`, you'll continue to be able to pass `-Zfoo`
    and `-Zbar` to `cargo`, but you will be unable to pass `-Zbaz`. You can
    pass an empty string (`-Zallow-features=`) to disallow all unstable
    features.

    `-Zallow-features` also restricts which unstable features can be passed
    to the `cargo-features` entry in `Cargo.toml`. If, for example, you want
    to allow

    ```toml
    cargo-features = ["test-dummy-unstable"]
    ```

    where `test-dummy-unstable` is unstable, that features would also be
    disallowed by `-Zallow-features=`, and allowed with
    `-Zallow-features=test-dummy-unstable`.

    The list of features passed to cargo's `-Zallow-features` is also passed
    to any Rust tools that cargo ends up calling (like `rustc` or
    `rustdoc`). Thus, if you run `cargo -Zallow-features=`, no unstable
    Cargo _or_ Rust features can be used.

    ## no-index-update
    * Original Issue: [#3479](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/3479)
    * Tracking Issue: [#7404](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7404)

    The `-Z no-index-update` flag ensures that Cargo does not attempt to update
    the registry index. This is intended for tools such as Crater that issue many
    Cargo commands, and you want to avoid the network latency for updating the
    index each time.

    * Cache usage meta tracking issue: [#7150](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7150)

    The `-Z mtime-on-use` flag is an experiment to have Cargo update the mtime of
    used files to make it easier for tools like cargo-sweep to detect which files
    are stale. For many workflows this needs to be set on *all* invocations of cargo.
    To make this more practical setting the `unstable.mtime_on_use` flag in `.cargo/config.toml`
    or the corresponding ENV variable will apply the `-Z mtime-on-use` to all
    invocations of nightly cargo. (the config flag is ignored by stable)

    * Tracking Issue: [#5133](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5133)

    When running commands such as `cargo install` or `cargo build`, Cargo
    currently requires dev-dependencies to be downloaded, even if they are not
    used. The `-Z avoid-dev-deps` flag allows Cargo to avoid downloading
    dev-dependencies if they are not needed. The `Cargo.lock` file will not be
    generated if dev-dependencies are skipped.

    * Tracking Issue: [#5657](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5657)

    > Note: It is not recommended to use this feature. Because it enforces minimal
    > versions for all transitive dependencies, its usefulness is limited since
    > not all external dependencies declare proper lower version bounds. It is
    > intended that it will be changed in the future to only enforce minimal

    When a `Cargo.lock` file is generated, the `-Z minimal-versions` flag will
    resolve the dependencies to the minimum SemVer version that will satisfy the
    requirements (instead of the greatest version).

    The intended use-case of this flag is to check, during continuous integration,
    that the versions specified in Cargo.toml are a correct reflection of the
    minimum versions that you are actually using. That is, if Cargo.toml says
    `foo = "1.0.0"` that you don't accidentally depend on features added only in
    `foo 1.5.0`.

    * Tracking Issue: [#6790](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6790)

    This feature allows you to specify the directory where artifacts will be copied
    to after they are built. Typically artifacts are only written to the
    `target/release` or `target/debug` directories. However, determining the exact
    filename can be tricky since you need to parse JSON output. The `--artifact-dir`
    flag makes it easier to predictably access the artifacts. Note that the
    artifacts are copied, so the originals are still in the `target` directory.
    Example:

    ```sh
    cargo +nightly build --artifact-dir=out -Z unstable-options
    ```

    This can also be specified in `.cargo/config.toml` files.

    * RFC: [#2196](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2196-metabuild.md)

    Metabuild is a feature to have declarative build scripts. Instead of writing
    a `build.rs` script, you specify a list of build dependencies in the
    `metabuild` key in `Cargo.toml`. A build script is automatically generated
    that runs each build dependency in order. Metabuild packages can then read
    metadata from `Cargo.toml` to specify their behavior.

    Include `cargo-features` at the top of `Cargo.toml`, a `metabuild` key in the
    `package`, list the dependencies in `build-dependencies`, and add any metadata
    that the metabuild packages require under `package.metadata`. Example:

    ```toml
    cargo-features = ["metabuild"]

    [package]
    name = "mypackage"
    version = "0.0.1"
    metabuild = ["foo", "bar"]

    [build-dependencies]
    foo = "1.0"
    bar = "1.0"

    [package.metadata.foo]
    extra-info = "qwerty"
    ```

    Metabuild packages should have a public function called `metabuild` that
    performs the same actions as a regular `build.rs` script would perform.

    ## public-dependency
    * Tracking Issue: [#44663](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44663)

    The 'public-dependency' feature allows marking dependencies as 'public'
    or 'private'. When this feature is enabled, additional information is passed to rustc to allow
    the [exported_private_dependencies](../../rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#exported-private-dependencies) lint to function properly.

    To enable this feature, you can either use `-Zpublic-dependency`

    ```sh
    cargo +nightly run -Zpublic-dependency
    ```

    or `[unstable]` table, for example,

    ```toml
    # .cargo/config.toml
    [unstable]
    public-dependency = true
    ```

    `public-dependency` could also be enabled in `cargo-features`, **though this is deprecated and will be removed soon**.

    ```toml
    cargo-features = ["public-dependency"]

    [dependencies]
    my_dep = { version = "1.2.3", public = true }
    private_dep = "2.0.0" # Will be 'private' by default

    The `precise-pre-release` feature allows pre-release versions to be selected with `update --precise`
    even when a pre-release is not specified by a projects `Cargo.toml`.

    Take for example this `Cargo.toml`.

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    my-dependency = "0.1.1"
    ```

    It's possible to update `my-dependency` to a pre-release with `update -Zunstable-options my-dependency --precise 0.1.2-pre.0`.
    This is because `0.1.2-pre.0` is considered compatible with `0.1.1`.
    It would not be possible to upgrade to `0.2.0-pre.0` from `0.1.1` in the same way.

    ## update-breaking

    * Tracking Issue: [#12425](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12425)

    Allow upgrading dependencies version requirements in `Cargo.toml` across SemVer
    incompatible versions using with the `--breaking` flag.

    This only applies to dependencies when
    - The package is a dependency of a workspace member
    - The dependency is not renamed
    - A SemVer-incompatible version is available
    - The "SemVer operator" is used (`^` which is the default)

    Users may further restrict which packages get upgraded by specifying them on
    the command line.

    Example:
    ```console
    $ cargo +nightly -Zunstable-options update --breaking
    $ cargo +nightly -Zunstable-options update --breaking clap
    ```

    *This is meant to fill a similar role as [cargo-upgrade](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/)*

    ## build-std
    * Tracking Repository: <https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware>

    The `build-std` feature enables Cargo to compile the standard library itself as
    part of a crate graph compilation. This feature has also historically been known
    as "std-aware Cargo". This feature is still in very early stages of development,
    and is also a possible massive feature addition to Cargo. This is a very large
    feature to document, even in the minimal form that it exists in today, so if
    you're curious to stay up to date you'll want to follow the [tracking
    repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware) and its set of
    issues.

    The functionality implemented today is behind a flag called `-Z build-std`. This
    flag indicates that Cargo should compile the standard library from source code
    using the same profile as the main build itself. Note that for this to work you
    need to have the source code for the standard library available, and at this
    time the only supported method of doing so is to add the `rust-src` rust rustup
    component:

    ```console
    $ rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
    ```

    Usage looks like:

    ```console
    $ cargo new foo
    $ cd foo
    $ cargo +nightly run -Z build-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
       Compiling core v0.0.0 (...)
       ...
       Compiling foo v0.1.0 (...)
        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 21.00s
         Running `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/foo`
    Hello, world!
    ```

    Here we recompiled the standard library in debug mode with debug assertions
    (like `src/main.rs` is compiled) and everything was linked together at the end.

    Using `-Z build-std` will implicitly compile the stable crates `core`, `std`,
    `alloc`, and `proc_macro`. If you're using `cargo test` it will also compile the
    `test` crate. If you're working with an environment which does not support some
    of these crates, then you can pass an argument to `-Zbuild-std` as well:

    ```console
    $ cargo +nightly build -Z build-std=core,alloc
    ```

    The value here is a comma-separated list of standard library crates to build.

    ### Requirements

    As a summary, a list of requirements today to use `-Z build-std` are:

    * You must install libstd's source code through `rustup component add rust-src`
    * You must use both a nightly Cargo and a nightly rustc
    * The `-Z build-std` flag must be passed to all `cargo` invocations.

    ### Reporting bugs and helping out

    The `-Z build-std` feature is in the very early stages of development! This
    feature for Cargo has an extremely long history and is very large in scope, and
    this is just the beginning. If you'd like to report bugs please either report
    them to:

    * Cargo --- <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/new> --- for implementation bugs
    * The tracking repository ---
      <https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware/issues/new> --- for larger design
      questions.

    Also if you'd like to see a feature that's not yet implemented and/or if
    something doesn't quite work the way you'd like it to, feel free to check out
    the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware/issues) of
    the tracking repository, and if it's not there please file a new issue!

    ## build-std-features
    * Tracking Repository: <https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-cargo-std-aware>

    This flag is a sibling to the `-Zbuild-std` feature flag. This will configure
    the features enabled for the standard library itself when building the standard
    library. The default enabled features, at this time, are `backtrace` and
    `panic-unwind`. This flag expects a comma-separated list and, if provided, will
    override the default list of features enabled.

    ## binary-dep-depinfo
    * Tracking rustc issue: [#63012](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63012)

    The `-Z binary-dep-depinfo` flag causes Cargo to forward the same flag to
    `rustc` which will then cause `rustc` to include the paths of all binary
    dependencies in the "dep info" file (with the `.d` extension). Cargo then uses
    that information for change-detection (if any binary dependency changes, then
    the crate will be rebuilt). The primary use case is for building the compiler
    itself, which has implicit dependencies on the standard library that would
    otherwise be untracked for change-detection.

  documentationQuestion2: How can the `binary-dep-depinfo` flag be used to improve change-detection in a Cargo project, and what is the typical scenario where this is necessary?

    ## checksum-freshness
    * Tracking issue: [#14136](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14136)

    The `-Z checksum-freshness` flag will replace the use of file mtimes in cargo's
    fingerprints with a file checksum value. This is most useful on systems with a poor
    mtime implementation, or in CI/CD. The checksum algorithm can change without notice
    between cargo versions. Fingerprints are used by cargo to determine when a crate needs to be rebuilt.

    For the time being files ingested by build script will continue to use mtimes, even when `checksum-freshness`
    is enabled. This is not intended as a long term solution.

    ## panic-abort-tests
    * Tracking Issue: [#67650](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67650)
    * Original Pull Request: [#7460](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7460)

    The `-Z panic-abort-tests` flag will enable nightly support to compile test
    harness crates with `-Cpanic=abort`. Without this flag Cargo will compile tests,
    and everything they depend on, with `-Cpanic=unwind` because it's the only way
    `test`-the-crate knows how to operate. As of [rust-lang/rust#64158], however,
    the `test` crate supports `-C panic=abort` with a test-per-process, and can help
    avoid compiling crate graphs multiple times.

    It's currently unclear how this feature will be stabilized in Cargo, but we'd
    like to stabilize it somehow!

    ## config-include
    * Tracking Issue: [#7723](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7723)

    This feature requires the `-Zconfig-include` command-line option.

    The `include` key in a config file can be used to load another config file. It
    takes a string for a path to another file relative to the config file, or an
    array of config file paths. Only path ending with `.toml` is accepted.

    ```toml
    # a path ending with `.toml`
    include = "path/to/mordor.toml"

    # or an array of paths
    include = ["frodo.toml", "samwise.toml"]
    ```

    Unlike other config values, the merge behavior of the `include` key is
    different. When a config file contains an `include` key:

    1. The config values are first loaded from the `include` path.
        * If the value of the `include` key is an array of paths, the config values
          are loaded and merged from left to right for each path.
        * Recurse this step if the config values from the `include` path also
          contain an `include` key.
    2. Then, the config file's own values are merged on top of the config
       from the `include` path.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `config-include` feature in Cargo as described in the documentation?

    ## target-applies-to-host
    * Original Pull Request: [#9322](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9322)
    * Tracking Issue: [#9453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9453)

    Historically, Cargo's behavior for whether the `linker` and `rustflags`
    configuration options from environment variables and
    [`[target]`](config.md#target) are respected for build scripts, plugins,
    and other artifacts that are _always_ built for the host platform has
    been somewhat inconsistent.
    When `--target` is _not_ passed, Cargo respects the same `linker` and
    `rustflags` for build scripts as for all other compile artifacts. When
    `--target` _is_ passed, however, Cargo respects `linker` from
    [`[target.<host triple>]`](config.md#targettriplelinker), and does not
    pick up any `rustflags` configuration.
    This dual behavior is confusing, but also makes it difficult to correctly
    configure builds where the host triple and the [target triple] happen to
    be the same, but artifacts intended to run on the build host should still
    be configured differently.

    `-Ztarget-applies-to-host` enables the top-level
    `target-applies-to-host` setting in Cargo configuration files which
    allows users to opt into different (and more consistent) behavior for
    these properties. When `target-applies-to-host` is unset, or set to
    `true`, in the configuration file, the existing Cargo behavior is
    preserved (though see `-Zhost-config`, which changes that default). When
    it is set to `false`, no options from `[target.<host triple>]`,
    `RUSTFLAGS`, or `[build]` are respected for host artifacts regardless of
    whether `--target` is passed to Cargo. To customize artifacts intended
    to be run on the host, use `[host]` ([`host-config`](#host-config)).

    In the future, `target-applies-to-host` may end up defaulting to `false`
    to provide more sane and consistent default behavior.

    ```toml
    # config.toml
    target-applies-to-host = false
    ```

    cargo +nightly -Ztarget-applies-to-host build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

    ## host-config
    * Original Pull Request: [#9322](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9322)
    * Tracking Issue: [#9452](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9452)

    The `host` key in a config file can be used to pass flags to host build targets
    such as build scripts that must run on the host system instead of the target
    system when cross compiling. It supports both generic and host arch specific
    tables. Matching host arch tables take precedence over generic host tables.

    It requires the `-Zhost-config` and `-Ztarget-applies-to-host`
    command-line options to be set, and that `target-applies-to-host =
    false` is set in the Cargo configuration file.

    ```toml
    # config.toml
    [host]
    linker = "/path/to/host/linker"
    [host.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
    linker = "/path/to/host/arch/linker"
    rustflags = ["-Clink-arg=--verbose"]
    [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
    linker = "/path/to/target/linker"
    ```

    The generic `host` table above will be entirely ignored when building on an
    `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` host as the `host.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` table
    takes precedence.

    Setting `-Zhost-config` changes the default for `target-applies-to-host` to
    `false` from `true`.

    ## unit-graph
    * Tracking Issue: [#8002](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8002)

    The `--unit-graph` flag can be passed to any build command (`build`, `check`,
    `run`, `test`, `bench`, `doc`, etc.) to emit a JSON object to stdout which
    represents Cargo's internal unit graph. Nothing is actually built, and the
    command returns immediately after printing. Each "unit" corresponds to an
    execution of the compiler. These objects also include which unit each unit
    depends on.

    ```
    cargo +nightly build --unit-graph -Z unstable-options
    ```

    This structure provides a more complete view of the dependency relationship as
    Cargo sees it. In particular, the "features" field supports the new feature
    resolver where a dependency can be built multiple times with different
    features. `cargo metadata` fundamentally cannot represent the relationship of
    features between different dependency kinds, and features now depend on which
    command is run and which packages and targets are selected. Additionally it
    can provide details about intra-package dependencies like build scripts or
    tests.

    The following is a description of the JSON structure:

    ```javascript

    ## Profile `rustflags` option
    * Original Issue: [rust-lang/cargo#7878](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7878)
    * Tracking Issue: [rust-lang/cargo#10271](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10271)

    This feature provides a new option in the `[profile]` section to specify flags
    that are passed directly to rustc.
    This can be enabled like so:

    ```toml
    cargo-features = ["profile-rustflags"]

    [package]
    # ...

    [profile.release]
    rustflags = [ "-C", "..." ]
    ```

    To set this in a profile in Cargo configuration, you need to use either
    `-Z profile-rustflags` or `[unstable]` table to enable it. For example,

    ```toml
    # .cargo/config.toml
    [unstable]
    profile-rustflags = true

    [profile.release]
    rustflags = [ "-C", "..." ]
    ```

    ## rustdoc-map
    * Tracking Issue: [#8296](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8296)

    This feature adds configuration settings that are passed to `rustdoc` so that
    it can generate links to dependencies whose documentation is hosted elsewhere
    when the dependency is not documented. First, add this to `.cargo/config`:

    ```toml
    [doc.extern-map.registries]
    crates-io = "https://docs.rs/"
    ```

    Then, when building documentation, use the following flags to cause links
    to dependencies to link to [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/):

    ```
    cargo +nightly doc --no-deps -Zrustdoc-map
    ```

    The `registries` table contains a mapping of registry name to the URL to link
    to. The URL may have the markers `{pkg_name}` and `{version}` which will get
    replaced with the corresponding values. If neither are specified, then Cargo
    defaults to appending `{pkg_name}/{version}/` to the end of the URL.

    Another config setting is available to redirect standard library links. By
    default, rustdoc creates links to <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/>. To
    change this behavior, use the `doc.extern-map.std` setting:

    ```toml
    [doc.extern-map]
    std = "local"
    ```

    A value of `"local"` means to link to the documentation found in the `rustc`
    sysroot. If you are using rustup, this documentation can be installed with
    `rustup component add rust-docs`.

    The default value is `"remote"`.

    The value may also take a URL for a custom location.

    ## per-package-target
    * Tracking Issue: [#9406](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9406)
    * Original Pull Request: [#9030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9030)
    * Original Issue: [#7004](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7004)

    The `per-package-target` feature adds two keys to the manifest:
    `package.default-target` and `package.forced-target`. The first makes
    the package be compiled by default (ie. when no `--target` argument is
    passed) for some target. The second one makes the package always be
    compiled for the target.

    Example:

    ```toml
    [package]
    forced-target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"
    ```

    In this example, the crate is always built for
    `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, for instance because it is going to be used
    as a plugin for a main program that runs on the host (or provided on
    the command line) target.

    ## artifact-dependencies

    * Tracking Issue: [#9096](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9096)
    * Original Pull Request: [#9992](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9992)

    Artifact dependencies allow Cargo packages to depend on `bin`, `cdylib`, and `staticlib` crates,
    and use the artifacts built by those crates at compile time.

    Run `cargo` with `-Z bindeps` to enable this functionality.

    ### artifact-dependencies: Dependency declarations

    Artifact-dependencies adds the following keys to a dependency declaration in `Cargo.toml`:

    - `artifact` --- This specifies the [Cargo Target](cargo-targets.md) to build.
      Normally without this field, Cargo will only build the `[lib]` target from a dependency.
      This field allows specifying which target will be built, and made available as a binary at build time:

      * `"bin"` --- Compiled executable binaries, corresponding to all of the `[[bin]]` sections in the dependency's manifest.
      * `"bin:<bin-name>"` --- Compiled executable binary, corresponding to a specific binary target specified by the given `<bin-name>`.
      * `"cdylib"` --- A C-compatible dynamic library, corresponding to a `[lib]` section with `crate-type = ["cdylib"]` in the dependency's manifest.
      * `"staticlib"` --- A C-compatible static library, corresponding to a `[lib]` section with `crate-type = ["staticlib"]` in the dependency's manifest.

      The `artifact` value can be a string, or it can be an array of strings to specify multiple targets.

      Example:

      ```toml
      [dependencies]
      bar = { version = "1.0", artifact = "staticlib" }
      zoo = { version = "1.0", artifact = ["bin:cat", "bin:dog"]}
      ```

    - `lib` --- This is a Boolean value which indicates whether or not to also build the dependency's library as a normal Rust `lib` dependency.
      This field can only be specified when `artifact` is specified.

      The default for this field is `false` when `artifact` is specified.
      If this is set to `true`, then the dependency's `[lib]` target will also be built for the platform target the declaring package is being built for.
      This allows the package to use the dependency from Rust code like a normal dependency in addition to an artifact dependency.

      Example:

      ```toml
      [dependencies]
      bar = { version = "1.0", artifact = "bin", lib = true }
      ```

    - `target` --- The platform target to build the dependency for.
      This field can only be specified when `artifact` is specified.

      The default if this is not specified depends on the dependency kind.
      For build dependencies, it will be built for the host target.
      For all other dependencies, it will be built for the same targets the declaring package is built for.

      For a build dependency, this can also take the special value of `"target"` which means to build the dependency for the same targets that the package is being built for.

      ```toml
      [build-dependencies]
      bar = { version = "1.0", artifact = "cdylib", target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"}
      same-target = { version = "1.0", artifact = "bin", target = "target" }
      ```

    ### artifact-dependencies: Environment variables

    After building an artifact dependency, Cargo provides the following environment variables that you can use to access the artifact:

    - `CARGO_<ARTIFACT-TYPE>_DIR_<DEP>` --- This is the directory containing all the artifacts from the dependency.

      `<ARTIFACT-TYPE>` is the `artifact` specified for the dependency (uppercased as in `CDYLIB`, `STATICLIB`, or `BIN`) and `<DEP>` is the name of the dependency.
      As with other Cargo environment variables, dependency names are converted to uppercase, with dashes replaced by underscores.

      If your manifest renames the dependency, `<DEP>` corresponds to the name you specify, not the original package name.

    - `CARGO_<ARTIFACT-TYPE>_FILE_<DEP>_<NAME>` --- This is the full path to the artifact.

      `<ARTIFACT-TYPE>` is the `artifact` specified for the dependency (uppercased as above), `<DEP>` is the name of the dependency (transformed as above), and `<NAME>` is the name of the artifact from the dependency.

      Note that `<NAME>` is not modified in any way from the `name` specified in the crate supplying the artifact, or the crate name if not specified; for instance, it may be in lowercase, or contain dashes.

      For convenience, if the artifact name matches the original package name, cargo additionally supplies a copy of this variable with the `_<NAME>` suffix omitted.
      For instance, if the `cmake` crate supplies a binary named `cmake`, Cargo supplies both `CARGO_BIN_FILE_CMAKE` and `CARGO_BIN_FILE_CMAKE_cmake`.

    For each kind of dependency, these variables are supplied to the same part of the build process that has access to that kind of dependency:

    - For build-dependencies, these variables are supplied to the `build.rs` script, and can be accessed using [`std::env::var_os`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.var_os.html).
      (As with any OS file path, these may or may not be valid UTF-8.)
    - For normal dependencies, these variables are supplied during the compilation of the crate, and can be accessed using the [`env!`] macro.
    - For dev-dependencies, these variables are supplied during the compilation of examples, tests, and benchmarks, and can be accessed using the [`env!`] macro.

    [`env!`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.env.html

    ### artifact-dependencies: Examples

    #### Example: use a binary executable from a build script

    In the `Cargo.toml` file, you can specify a dependency on a binary to make available for a build script:

    ```toml
    [build-dependencies]
    some-build-tool = { version = "1.0", artifact = "bin" }
    ```

    Then inside the build script, the binary can be executed at build time:

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let build_tool = std::env::var_os("CARGO_BIN_FILE_SOME_BUILD_TOOL").unwrap();
        let status = std::process::Command::new(build_tool)
            .arg("do-stuff")
            .status()
            .unwrap();
        if !status.success() {
            eprintln!("failed!");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    }
    ```

    #### Example: use _cdylib_ artifact in build script

    The `Cargo.toml` in the consuming package, building the `bar` library as `cdylib`
    for a specific build target…

    ```toml
    [build-dependencies]
    bar = { artifact = "cdylib", version = "1.0", target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown" }
    ```

    …along with the build script in `build.rs`.

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        wasm::run_file(std::env::var("CARGO_CDYLIB_FILE_BAR").unwrap());
    }
    ```

    #### Example: use _binary_ artifact and its library in a binary

    The `Cargo.toml` in the consuming package, building the `bar` binary for inclusion
    as artifact while making it available as library as well…

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bar = { artifact = "bin", version = "1.0", lib = true }
    ```

    …along with the executable using `main.rs`.

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        bar::init();
        command::run(env!("CARGO_BIN_FILE_BAR"));
    }
    ```

    ## publish-timeout
    * Tracking Issue: [11222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11222)

    The `publish.timeout` key in a config file can be used to control how long
    `cargo publish` waits between posting a package to the registry and it being
    available in the local index.

    A timeout of `0` prevents any checks from occurring. The current default is
    `60` seconds.

    It requires the `-Zpublish-timeout` command-line options to be set.

    ```toml
    # config.toml
    [publish]
    timeout = 300  # in seconds
    ```

    ## asymmetric-token
    * Tracking Issue: [10519](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10519)
    * RFC: [#3231](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3231)

    The `-Z asymmetric-token` flag enables the `cargo:paseto` credential provider which allows Cargo to authenticate to registries without sending secrets over the network.

    In [`config.toml`](config.md) and `credentials.toml` files there is a field called `private-key`, which is a private key formatted in the secret [subset of `PASERK`](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paserk/blob/master/types/secret.md) and is used to sign asymmetric tokens

    A keypair can be generated with `cargo login --generate-keypair` which will:
    - generate a public/private keypair in the currently recommended fashion.
    - save the private key in `credentials.toml`.
    - print the public key in [PASERK public](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paserk/blob/master/types/public.md) format.

    It is recommended that the `private-key` be saved in `credentials.toml`. It is also supported in `config.toml`, primarily so that it can be set using the associated environment variable, which is the recommended way to provide it in CI contexts. This setup is what we have for the `token` field for setting a secret token.

    There is also an optional field called `private-key-subject` which is a string chosen by the registry.
    This string will be included as part of an asymmetric token and should not be secret.
    It is intended for the rare use cases like "cryptographic proof that the central CA server authorized this action". Cargo requires it to be non-whitespace printable ASCII. Registries that need non-ASCII data should base64 encode it.

    Both fields can be set with `cargo login --registry=name --private-key --private-key-subject="subject"` which will prompt you to put in the key value.

    A registry can have at most one of `private-key` or `token` set.

    All PASETOs will include `iat`, the current time in ISO 8601 format. Cargo will include the following where appropriate:
    - `sub` an optional, non-secret string chosen by the registry that is expected to be claimed with every request. The value will be the `private-key-subject` from the `config.toml` file.
    - `mutation` if present, indicates that this request is a mutating operation (or a read-only operation if not present), must be one of the strings `publish`, `yank`, or `unyank`.
      - `name` name of the crate related to this request.
      - `vers` version string of the crate related to this request.
      - `cksum` the SHA256 hash of the crate contents, as a string of 64 lowercase hexadecimal digits, must be present only when `mutation` is equal to `publish`
    - `challenge` the challenge string received from a 401/403 from this server this session. Registries that issue challenges must track which challenges have been issued/used and never accept a given challenge more than once within the same validity period (avoiding the need to track every challenge ever issued).

    The "footer" (which is part of the signature) will be a JSON string in UTF-8 and include:
    - `url` the RFC 3986 compliant URL where cargo got the config.json file,
      - If this is a registry with an HTTP index, then this is the base URL that all index queries are relative to.
      - If this is a registry with a GIT index, it is the URL Cargo used to clone the index.
    - `kid` the identifier of the private key used to sign the request, using the [PASERK IDs](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paserk/blob/master/operations/ID.md) standard.

    PASETO includes the message that was signed, so the server does not have to reconstruct the exact string from the request in order to check the signature. The server does need to check that the signature is valid for the string in the PASETO and that the contents of that string matches the request.
    If a claim should be expected for the request but is missing in the PASETO then the request must be rejected.

    ## `cargo config`

    * Original Issue: [#2362](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2362)
    * Tracking Issue: [#9301](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9301)

    The `cargo config` subcommand provides a way to display the configuration
    files that cargo loads. It currently includes the `get` subcommand which
    can take an optional config value to display.

    ```console
    cargo +nightly -Zunstable-options config get build.rustflags
    ```

    If no config value is included, it will display all config values. See the
    `--help` output for more options available.

    ## rustc `--print`

    * Tracking Issue: [#9357](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9357)

    `cargo rustc --print=VAL` forwards the `--print` flag to `rustc` in order to
    extract information from `rustc`. This runs `rustc` with the corresponding
    [`--print`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments.html#--print-print-compiler-information)
    flag, and then immediately exits without compiling. Exposing this as a cargo
    flag allows cargo to inject the correct target and RUSTFLAGS based on the
    current configuration.

    The primary use case is to run `cargo rustc --print=cfg` to get config values
    for the appropriate target and influenced by any other RUSTFLAGS.

    ## Different binary name

    * Tracking Issue: [#9778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9778)
    * PR: [#9627](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9627)

    The `different-binary-name` feature allows setting the filename of the binary without having to obey the
    restrictions placed on crate names. For example, the crate name must use only `alphanumeric` characters
    or `-` or `_`, and cannot be empty.

    The `filename` parameter should **not** include the binary extension, `cargo` will figure out the appropriate
    extension and use that for the binary on its own.

    The `filename` parameter is only available in the `[[bin]]` section of the manifest.

    ```toml
    cargo-features = ["different-binary-name"]

    [package]
    name =  "foo"
    version = "0.0.1"

    [[bin]]

    ## scrape-examples

    * Tracking Issue: [#9910](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9910)

    The `-Z rustdoc-scrape-examples` flag tells Rustdoc to search crates in the current workspace
    for calls to functions. Those call-sites are then included as documentation. You can use the flag
    like this:

    ```
    cargo doc -Z unstable-options -Z rustdoc-scrape-examples
    ```

    By default, Cargo will scrape examples from the example targets of packages being documented.
    You can individually enable or disable targets from being scraped with the `doc-scrape-examples` flag, such as:

    ```toml
    # Enable scraping examples from a library
    [lib]
    doc-scrape-examples = true

    # Disable scraping examples from an example target
    [[example]]
    name = "my-example"
    doc-scrape-examples = false
    ```

    **Note on tests:** enabling `doc-scrape-examples` on test targets will not currently have any effect. Scraping
    examples from tests is a work-in-progress.

    **Note on dev-dependencies:** documenting a library does not normally require the crate's dev-dependencies. However,
    example targets require dev-deps. For backwards compatibility, `-Z rustdoc-scrape-examples` will *not* introduce a
    dev-deps requirement for `cargo doc`. Therefore examples will *not* be scraped from example targets under the
    following conditions:

    1. No target being documented requires dev-deps, AND
    2. At least one crate with targets being documented has dev-deps, AND
    3. The `doc-scrape-examples` parameter is unset or false for all `[[example]]` targets.

    If you want examples to be scraped from example targets, then you must not satisfy one of the above conditions.
    For example, you can set `doc-scrape-examples` to true for one example target, and that signals to Cargo that
    you are ok with dev-deps being build for `cargo doc`.

    ## codegen-backend

    The `codegen-backend` feature makes it possible to select the codegen backend used by rustc using a profile.

    To set this in a profile in Cargo configuration, you need to use either
    `-Z codegen-backend` or `[unstable]` table to enable it. For example,

    ```toml
    # .cargo/config.toml
    [unstable]
    codegen-backend = true

    While `-Zgitoxide` enables all currently implemented features, one can individually select git operations
    to run with `gitoxide` with the `-Zgitoxide=operation[,operationN]` syntax.

    Valid operations are the following:

    * `shallow-deps` - perform a shallow clone of git dependencies.

    **Details on shallow clones**

    * To enable shallow clones, add `-Zgit=shallow-deps` for fetching git dependencies or `-Zgit=shallow-index` for fetching registry index.
    * Shallow-cloned and shallow-checked-out git repositories reside at their own `-shallow` suffixed directories, i.e,
      - `~/.cargo/registry/index/*-shallow`
      - `~/.cargo/git/db/*-shallow`
      - `~/.cargo/git/checkouts/*-shallow`
    * When the unstable feature is on, fetching/cloning a git repository is always a shallow fetch. This roughly equals to `git fetch --depth 1` everywhere.
    * Even with the presence of `Cargo.lock` or specifying a commit `{ rev = "…" }`, gitoxide and libgit2 are still smart enough to shallow fetch without unshallowing the existing repository.

    ## script

    * Tracking Issue: [#12207](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12207)

    Cargo can directly run `.rs` files as:
    ```console
    $ cargo +nightly -Zscript file.rs
    ```
    where `file.rs` can be as simple as:
    ```rust
    fn main() {}
    ```

    A user may optionally specify a manifest in a `cargo` code fence in a module-level comment, like:
    ````rust
    #!/usr/bin/env -S cargo +nightly -Zscript
    ---cargo
    [dependencies]
    clap = { version = "4.2", features = ["derive"] }
    ---

    use clap::Parser;

    #[derive(Parser, Debug)]
    #[clap(version)]
    struct Args {
        #[clap(short, long, help = "Path to config")]
        config: Option<std::path::PathBuf>,
    }

    fn main() {
        let args = Args::parse();
        println!("{:?}", args);
    }
    ````

    ### Single-file packages

    In addition to today's multi-file packages (`Cargo.toml` file with other `.rs`
    files), we are adding the concept of single-file packages which may contain an
    embedded manifest.  There is no required distinguishment for a single-file
    `.rs` package from any other `.rs` file.

    Single-file packages may be selected via `--manifest-path`, like
    `cargo test --manifest-path foo.rs`. Unlike `Cargo.toml`, these files cannot be auto-discovered.

    A single-file package may contain an embedded manifest.  An embedded manifest
    is stored using `TOML` in rust "frontmatter", a markdown code-fence with `cargo`
    at the start of the infostring at the top of the file.

    Inferred / defaulted manifest fields:
    - `package.name = <slugified file stem>`
    - `package.edition = <current>` to avoid always having to add an embedded
      manifest at the cost of potentially breaking scripts on rust upgrades
      - Warn when `edition` is unspecified to raise awareness of this

    Disallowed manifest fields:
    - `[workspace]`, `[lib]`, `[[bin]]`, `[[example]]`, `[[test]]`, `[[bench]]`
    - `package.workspace`, `package.build`, `package.links`, `package.autolib`, `package.autobins`, `package.autoexamples`, `package.autotests`, `package.autobenches`

    The default `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` for single-file packages is at `$CARGO_HOME/target/<hash>`:
    - Avoid conflicts from multiple single-file packages being in the same directory
    - Avoid problems with the single-file package's parent directory being read-only
    - Avoid cluttering the user's directory

    The lockfile for single-file packages will be placed in `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.  In
    the future, when workspaces are supported, that will allow a user to have a
    persistent lockfile.

    ### Manifest-commands

    You may pass a manifest directly to the `cargo` command, without a subcommand,
    like `foo/Cargo.toml` or a single-file package like `foo.rs`.  This is mostly
    intended for being put in `#!` lines.

    The precedence for how to interpret `cargo <subcommand>` is
    1. Built-in xor single-file packages
    2. Aliases
    3. External subcommands

    A parameter is identified as a manifest-command if it has one of:
    - Path separators
    - A `.rs` extension
    - The file name is `Cargo.toml`

    Differences between `cargo run --manifest-path <path>` and `cargo <path>`
    - `cargo <path>` runs with the config for `<path>` and not the current dir, more like `cargo install --path <path>`
    - `cargo <path>` is at a verbosity level below the normal default.  Pass `-v` to get normal output.

Path to the source files of the standard and core library (sysroot) will begin with `/rustc/[rustc commit hash]`,\n   e.g. `/home/username/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/result.rs` ->\n   `/rustc/fe72845f7bb6a77b9e671e6a4f32fe714962cec4/library/core/src/result.rs`\n2. Path to the current package will be stripped, relatively to the current workspace root, e.g. `/home/username/crate/src/lib.rs` -> `src/lib.rs`.\n3. Path to dependency packages will be replaced with `[package name]-[version]`. E.g. `/home/username/deps/foo/src/lib.rs` -> `foo-0.1.0/src/lib.rs`\n\nWhen a path to the source files of the standard and core library is *not* in scope for sanitization,\nthe emitted path will depend on if `rust-src` component is present.\nIf it is, then some paths will point to the copy of the source files on your file system;\nif it isn't, then they will show up as `/rustc/[rustc commit hash]/library/...`\n(just like when it is selected for sanitization).\nPaths to all other source files will not be affected.\n\nThis will not affect any hard-coded paths in the source code, such as in strings.\n\n#### Environment variable\n\n*as a new entry of [\"Environment variables Cargo sets for build scripts\"](./environment-variables.md#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates)*\n\n* `CARGO_TRIM_PATHS` --- The value of `trim-paths` profile option.\n    `false`, `\"none\"`, and empty arrays would be converted to `none`.\n    `true` and `\"all\"` become `all`.\n    Values in a non-empty array would be joined into a comma-separated list.\n    If the build script introduces absolute paths to built artifacts (such as by invoking a compiler),\n    the user may request them to be sanitized in different types of artifacts.\n    Common paths requiring sanitization include `OUT_DIR`, `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` and `CARGO_MANIFEST_PATH`,\n    plus any other introduced by the build script, such as include directories.\n\n## gc\n\n* Tracking Issue: [#12633](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12633)\n\nThe `-Zgc` flag is used to enable certain features related to garbage-collection of cargo's global cache within the cargo home directory.\n\n#### Automatic gc configuration\n\nThe `-Zgc` flag will enable Cargo to read extra configuration options related to garbage collection.\nThe settings available are:\n\n```toml\n# Example config.toml file.\n\n# Sub-table for defining specific settings for cleaning the global cache.\n[cache.global-clean]\n# Anything older than this duration will be deleted in the source cache.\nmax-src-age = \"1 month\"\n# Anything older than this duration will be deleted in the compressed crate cache.\nmax-crate-age = \"3 months\"\n# Any index older than this duration will be deleted from the index cache.\nmax-index-age = \"3 months\"\n# Any git checkout older than this duration will be deleted from the checkout cache.\nmax-git-co-age = \"1 month\"\n# Any git clone older than this duration will be deleted from the git cache.\nmax-git-db-age = \"3 months\"\n```\n\nNote that the [`cache.auto-clean-frequency`] option was stabilized in Rust 1.88.\n\n[`cache.auto-clean-frequency`]: config.md#cacheauto-clean-frequency\n\n### Manual garbage collection with `cargo clean`\n\nManual deletion can be done with the `cargo clean gc -Zgc` command.\nDeletion of cache contents can be performed by passing one of the cache options:\n\n- `--max-src-age=DURATION` --- Deletes source cache files that have not been used since the given age.\n- `--max-crate-age=DURATION` --- Deletes crate cache files that have not been used since the given age.\n- `--max-index-age=DURATION` --- Deletes registry indexes that have not been used since then given age (including their `.crate` and `src` files).\n- `--max-git-co-age=DURATION` --- Deletes git dependency checkouts that have not been used since then given age.\n- `--max-git-db-age=DURATION` --- Deletes git dependency clones that have not been used since then given age.\n- `--max-download-age=DURATION` --- Deletes any downloaded cache data that has not been used since then given age.\n- `--max-src-size=SIZE` --- Deletes the oldest source cache files until the cache is under the given size.\n- `--max-crate-size=SIZE` --- Deletes the oldest crate cache files until the cache is under the given size.\n- `--max-git-size=SIZE` --- Deletes the oldest git dependency caches until the cache is under the given size.\n- `--max-download-size=SIZE` --- Deletes the oldest downloaded cache data until the cache is under the given size.\n\nA DURATION is specified in the form \"N seconds/minutes/days/weeks/months\" where N is an integer.\n\nA SIZE is specified in the form \"N *suffix*\" where *suffix* is B, kB, MB, GB, kiB, MiB, or GiB, and N is an integer or floating point number.

Relative path bases are relative\nto the parent directory of the configuration file that declared that path base.\n\nThe name of a path base must use only [alphanumeric](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html#method.is_alphanumeric)\ncharacters or `-` or `_`, must start with an [alphabetic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html#method.is_alphabetic)\ncharacter, and must not be empty.\n\nIf the name of path base used in a dependency is neither in the configuration\nnor one of the built-in path base, then Cargo will raise an error.\n\n#### Built-in path bases\n\nCargo provides implicit path bases that can be used without the need to specify\nthem in a `[path-bases]` table.\n\n* `workspace` - If a project is [a workspace or workspace member](workspaces.md)\nthen this path base is defined as the parent directory of the root `Cargo.toml`\nof the workspace.\n\nIf a built-in path base name is also declared in the configuration, then Cargo\nwill prefer the value in the configuration. The allows Cargo to add new built-in\npath bases without compatibility issues (as existing uses will shadow the\nbuilt-in name).\n\n## lockfile-path\n* Original Issue: [#5707](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5707)\n* Tracking Issue: [#14421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14421)\n\nThis feature allows you to specify the path of lockfile Cargo.lock. \nBy default, lockfile is written into `<workspace_root>/Cargo.lock`. \nHowever, when sources are stored in read-only directory, most of the cargo commands \nwould fail, trying to write a lockfile. The `--lockfile-path`\nflag makes it easier to work with readonly sources. \nNote, that currently path must end with `Cargo.lock`. Meaning, if you want to use \nthis feature in multiple projects, lockfiles should be stored in different directories.\nExample:\n\n```sh\ncargo +nightly metadata --lockfile-path=$LOCKFILES_ROOT/my-project/Cargo.lock -Z unstable-options\n```\n\n## package-workspace\n* Tracking Issue: [#10948](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10948)\n\nThis allows cargo to package (or publish) multiple crates in a workspace, even\nif they have inter-dependencies. For example, consider a workspace containing\npackages `foo` and `dep`, where `foo` depends on `dep`. Then\n\n```sh\ncargo +nightly -Zpackage-workspace package -p foo -p dep\n```\n\nwill package both `foo` and `dep`, while\n\n```sh\ncargo +nightly -Zpackage-workspace publish -p foo -p dep\n```\n\nwill publish both `foo` and `dep`.\nIf `foo` and `dep` are the only crates in the workspace, you can use the `--workspace`\nflag instead of specifying the crates individually:\n\n```sh\ncargo +nightly -Zpackage-workspace package --workspace\ncargo +nightly -Zpackage-workspace publish --workspace\n```\n\n#### Lock-file behavior\n\nWhen packaging a binary at the same time as one of its dependencies, the binary\nwill be packaged with a lock-file pointing at the dependency's registry entry\n*as though the dependency were already published*, even though it has not yet\nbeen. In this case, `cargo` needs to know the registry that the dependency\nwill eventually be published on. `cargo` will attempt to infer this registry\nby examining the [the `publish` field](manifest.md#the-publish-field), falling back\nto `crates.io` if no `publish` field is set. To explicitly set the registry,\npass a `--registry` or `--index` flag.\n\n```sh\ncargo +nightly -Zpackage-workspace --registry=my-registry package -p foo -p dep\ncargo +nightly -Zpackage-workspace --index=https://example.com package -p foo -p dep\n```\n\n## native-completions\n* Original Issue: [#6645](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6645)\n* Tracking Issue: [#14520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14520)\n\nThis feature moves the handwritten completion scripts to Rust native, making it\neasier for us to add, extend and test new completions. This feature is enabled with the\nnightly channel, without requiring additional `-Z` options.\n\nAreas of particular interest for feedback\n- Arguments that need escaping or quoting that aren't handled correctly\n- Inaccuracies in the information\n- Bugs in parsing of the command-line\n- Arguments that don't report their completions\n- If a known issue is being problematic\n\nFeedback can be broken down into\n- What completion candidates are reported\n  - Known issues: [#14520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14520), [`A-completions`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/A-completions)\n  - [Report an issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/new) or [discuss the behavior](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14520)\n- Shell integration, command-line parsing, and completion filtering\n  - Known issues: [clap#3166](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3166), [clap's `A-completions`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/labels/A-completion)\n  - [Report an issue](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/new/choose) or [discuss the behavior](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/new/choose)\n\nWhen in doubt, you can discuss this in [#14520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14520) or on [zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo)\n\n### How to use native-completions feature:\n- bash:\n  Add `source <(CARGO_COMPLETE=bash cargo +nightly)` to `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/cargo`.\n\n- zsh:\n  Add `source <(CARGO_COMPLETE=zsh cargo +nightly)` to your `.zshrc`.\n  \n- fish:\n  Add `source (CARGO_COMPLETE=fish cargo +nightly | psub)` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/completions/cargo.fish`\n\n- elvish:\n  Add `eval (E:CARGO_COMPLETE=elvish cargo +nightly | slurp)` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/elvish/rc.elv`\n\n- powershell:\n  Add `CARGO_COMPLETE=powershell cargo +nightly | Invoke-Expression` to `$PROFILE`.\n\n## warnings\n\n* Original Issue: [#8424](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8424)\n* Tracking Issue: [#14802](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14802)\n\nThe `-Z warnings` feature enables the `build.warnings` configuration option to control how\nCargo handles warnings.

    Documentation text:

    # Stabilized and removed features

    ## Compile progress

    The compile-progress feature has been stabilized in the 1.30 release.
    Progress bars are now enabled by default.
    See [`term.progress`](config.md#termprogresswhen) for more information about
    controlling this feature.

    ## Edition

    Specifying the `edition` in `Cargo.toml` has been stabilized in the 1.31 release.
    See [the edition field](manifest.md#the-edition-field) for more information
    about specifying this field.

    ## rename-dependency

    Specifying renamed dependencies in `Cargo.toml` has been stabilized in the 1.31 release.
    See [renaming dependencies](specifying-dependencies.md#renaming-dependencies-in-cargotoml)
    for more information about renaming dependencies.

    ## Alternate Registries

    Support for alternate registries has been stabilized in the 1.34 release.
    See the [Registries chapter](registries.md) for more information about alternate registries.

    ## Offline Mode

    The offline feature has been stabilized in the 1.36 release.
    See the [`--offline` flag](../commands/cargo.md#option-cargo---offline) for
    more information on using the offline mode.

    ## publish-lockfile

    The `publish-lockfile` feature has been removed in the 1.37 release.
    The `Cargo.lock` file is always included when a package is published if the
    package contains a binary target. `cargo install` requires the `--locked` flag
    to use the `Cargo.lock` file.
    See [`cargo package`](../commands/cargo-package.md) and
    [`cargo install`](../commands/cargo-install.md) for more information.

    ## default-run

    The `default-run` feature has been stabilized in the 1.37 release.
    See [the `default-run` field](manifest.md#the-default-run-field) for more
    information about specifying the default target to run.

    ## cache-messages

    Compiler message caching has been stabilized in the 1.40 release.
    Compiler warnings are now cached by default and will be replayed automatically
    when re-running Cargo.

    ## install-upgrade

    Documentation text:

    # Source Replacement

    This document is about replacing the crate index. You can read about overriding
    dependencies in the [overriding dependencies] section of this
    documentation.

    A *source* is a provider that contains crates that may be included as
    dependencies for a package. Cargo supports the ability to **replace one source
    with another** to express strategies such as:

    * Vendoring --- custom sources can be defined which represent crates on the local
      filesystem. These sources are subsets of the source that they're replacing and
      can be checked into packages if necessary.

    * Mirroring --- sources can be replaced with an equivalent version which acts as a
      cache for crates.io itself.

    Cargo has a core assumption about source replacement that the source code is
    exactly the same from both sources. Note that this also means that
    a replacement source is not allowed to have crates which are not present in the
    original source.

    As a consequence, source replacement is not appropriate for situations such as
    patching a dependency or a private registry. Cargo supports patching
    dependencies through the usage of [the `[patch]` key][overriding
    dependencies], and private registry support is described in [the Registries
    chapter][registries].

    When using source replacement, running commands that need to
    contact the registry directly[^1] requires passing the `--registry` option. This helps avoid
    any ambiguity about which registry to contact, and will use the authentication
    token for the specified registry.

    [^1]: Examples of such commands are in [Publishing Commands].

    [Publishing Commands]: ../commands/publishing-commands.md
    [overriding dependencies]: overriding-dependencies.md
    [registries]: registries.md

    ## Configuration

    Configuration of replacement sources is done through [`.cargo/config.toml`][config]
    and the full set of available keys are:

    ```toml
    # The `source` table is where all keys related to source-replacement
    # are stored.
    [source]

    # Under the `source` table are a number of other tables whose keys are a
    # name for the relevant source. For example this section defines a new
    # source, called `my-vendor-source`, which comes from a directory
    # located at `vendor` relative to the directory containing this `.cargo/config.toml`
    # file
    [source.my-vendor-source]
    directory = "vendor"

    # The crates.io default source for crates is available under the name
    # "crates-io", and here we use the `replace-with` key to indicate that it's
    # replaced with our source above.
    #
    # The `replace-with` key can also reference an alternative registry name
    # defined in the `[registries]` table.
    [source.crates-io]
    replace-with = "my-vendor-source"

    # Each source has its own table where the key is the name of the source
    [source.the-source-name]

    # Indicate that `the-source-name` will be replaced with `another-source`,
    # defined elsewhere
    replace-with = "another-source"

    # Several kinds of sources can be specified (described in more detail below):
    registry = "https://example.com/path/to/index"
    local-registry = "path/to/registry"
    directory = "path/to/vendor"

    # Git sources can optionally specify a branch/tag/rev as well
    git = "https://example.com/path/to/repo"
    # branch = "master"
    # tag = "v1.0.1"
    # rev = "313f44e8"
    ```

    [config]: config.md

    ## Registry Sources

    A "registry source" is one that is the same as crates.io itself. That is, it has
    an index served in a git repository which matches the format of the
    [crates.io index](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index). That repository
    then has configuration indicating where to download crates from.

    Currently there is not an already-available project for setting up a mirror of
    crates.io. Stay tuned though!

    ## Local Registry Sources

    A "local registry source" is intended to be a subset of another registry
    source, but available on the local filesystem (aka vendoring). Local registries
    are downloaded ahead of time, typically sync'd with a `Cargo.lock`, and are
    made up of a set of `*.crate` files and an index like the normal registry is.

    The primary way to manage and create local registry sources is through the
    [`cargo-local-registry`][cargo-local-registry] subcommand,
    [available on crates.io][cargo-local-registry] and can be installed with
    `cargo install cargo-local-registry`.

    [cargo-local-registry]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-local-registry

    Local registries are contained within one directory and contain a number of
    `*.crate` files downloaded from crates.io as well as an `index` directory with
    the same format as the crates.io-index project (populated with just entries for
    the crates that are present).

    ## Directory Sources

    A "directory source" is similar to a local registry source where it contains a
    number of crates available on the local filesystem, suitable for vendoring
    dependencies. Directory sources are primarily managed by the `cargo vendor`
    subcommand.

    Directory sources are distinct from local registries though in that they contain
    the unpacked version of `*.crate` files, making it more suitable in some
    situations to check everything into source control. A directory source is just a
    directory containing a number of other directories which contain the source code
    for crates (the unpacked version of `*.crate` files). Currently no restriction
    is placed on the name of each directory.

    Each crate in a directory source also has an associated metadata file indicating
    the checksum of each file in the crate to protect against accidental
    modifications.

    Documentation text:

    # Rust Version

    The `rust-version` field is an optional key that tells cargo what version of the
    Rust toolchain you support for your package.

    ```toml
    [package]
    # ...
    rust-version = "1.56"
    ```

    The Rust version must be a bare version number with at least one component; it
    cannot include semver operators or pre-release identifiers. Compiler pre-release
    identifiers such as -nightly will be ignored while checking the Rust version.

    > **MSRV:** Respected as of 1.56

    ## Uses

    **Diagnostics:**

    When your package is compiled on an unsupported toolchain, Cargo will report that as an error to the user. This makes the support expectations clear and avoids reporting a less direct diagnostic like invalid syntax or missing functionality
    in the standard library. This affects all [Cargo targets](cargo-targets.md) in the
    package, including binaries, examples, test suites, benchmarks, etc.
    A user can opt-in to an unsupported build of a package with the `--ignore-rust-version` flag.


    **Development aid:**

    `cargo add` will auto-select the dependency's version requirement to be the latest version compatible with your `rust-version`.
    If that isn't the latest version, `cargo add` will inform users so they can make the choice on whether to keep it or update your `rust-version`.

    The [resolver](resolver.md#rust-version) may take Rust version into account when picking dependencies.

    Other tools may also take advantage of it, like `cargo clippy`'s
    [`incompatible_msrv` lint](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/stable/index.html#/incompatible_msrv).

    > **Note:** The `rust-version` may be ignored using the `--ignore-rust-version` option.

    ## Support Expectations

    These are general expectations; some packages may document when they do not follow these.

    **Complete:**

    All functionality, including binaries and API, are available on the supported Rust versions under every [feature](features.md).

    **Verified:**

    A package's functionality is verified on its supported Rust versions, including automated testing.
    See also our
    [Rust version CI guide](../guide/continuous-integration.md#verifying-rust-version).

    **Patchable:**

    When licenses allow it,
    users can [override their local dependency](overriding-dependencies.md) with a fork of your package.
    In this situation, Cargo may load the entire workspace for the patched dependency which should work on the supported Rust versions, even if other packages in the workspace have different supported Rust versions.

    **Dependency Support:**

    In support of the above,
    it is expected that each dependency's version-requirement supports at least one version compatible with your `rust-version`.
    However,
    it is **not** expected that the dependency specification excludes versions incompatible with your `rust-version`.
    In fact, supporting both allows you to balance the needs of users that support older Rust versions with those that don't.

    ## Setting and Updating Rust Version

    What Rust versions to support is a trade off between
    - Costs for the maintainer in not using newer features of the Rust toolchain or their dependencies
    - Costs to users who would benefit from a package using newer features of a toolchain, e.g. reducing build times by migrating to a feature in the standard library from a polyfill
    - Availability of a package to users supporting older Rust versions

    > **Note:** [Changing `rust-version`](semver.md#env-new-rust) is assumed to be a minor incompatibility

    > **Recommendation:** Choose a policy for what Rust versions to support and when that is changed so users can compare it with their own policy and,
    > if it isn't compatible,
    > decide whether the loss of general improvements or the risk of a blocking bug that won't be fixed is acceptable or not.
    >
    > The simplest policy to support is to always use the latest Rust version.
    >
    > Depending on your risk profile, the next simplest approach is to continue to support old major or minor versions of your package that support older Rust versions.

    ### Selecting supported Rust versions

    Users of your package are most likely to track their supported Rust versions to:
    - Their Rust toolchain vendor's support policy, e.g. The Rust Project or a Linux distribution
      - Note: the Rust Project only offers bug fixes and security updates for the latest version.
    - A fixed schedule for users to re-verify their packages with the new toolchain, e.g. the first release of the year, every 5 releases.

    In addition, users are unlikely to be using the new Rust version immediately but need time to notice and re-verify or might not be aligned on the exact same schedule..

    Example version policies:
    - "N-2", meaning "latest version with a 2 release grace window for updating"
    - Every even release with a 2 release grace window for updating
    - Every version from this calendar year with a one year grace window for updating

    > **Note:** To find the minimum `rust-version` compatible with your project as-is, you can use third-party tools like [`cargo-msrv`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-msrv).

    ### Update timeline

    When your policy specifies you no longer need to support a Rust version, you can update `rust-version` immediately or when needed.

    By allowing `rust-version` to drift from your policy,
    you offer users more of a grace window for upgrading.
    However, this is too unpredictable to be relied on for aligning with the Rust version users track.

    The further `rust-version` drifts from your specified policy,
    the more likely users are to infer a policy you did not intend,
    leading to frustration at the unmet expectations.

    When drift is allowed,
    there is the question of what is "justifiable enough" to drop supported Versions.
    Each person can come to a reasonably different justification;
    working through that discussion can be frustrating for the involved parties.
    This will disempower those who would want to avoid that type of conflict,
    which is particularly the case for new or casual contributors who either
    feel that they are not in a position to raise the question or
    that the conflict may hurt the chance of their change being merged.

    ### Multiple Policies in a Workspace

    Cargo allows supporting multiple policies within one workspace.

    Verifying specific packages under specific Rust versions can get complicated.
    Tools like [`cargo-hack`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hack) can help.

    For any dependency shared across policies,
    the lowest common versions must be used as Cargo
    [unifies SemVer-compatible versions](resolver.md#semver-compatibility),
    potentially limiting access to features of the shared dependency for the workspace member with the higher `rust-version`.

    To allow users to patch a dependency on one of your workspace members,
    every package in the workspace would need to be loadable in the oldest Rust version supported by the workspace.

    When using [`incompatible-rust-versions = "fallback"`](config.md#resolverincompatible-rust-versions),
    the Rust version of one package can affect dependency versions selected for another package with a different Rust version.
    See the [resolver](resolver.md#rust-version) chapter for more details.

    ### One or More Policies

    One way to mitigate the downsides of supporting older Rust versions is to apply your policy to older major or minor versions of your package that you continue to support.
    You likely still need a policy for what Rust versions the development branch support compared to the release branches for those major or minor versions.

    Only updating the development branch when "needed"' can help reduce the number of supported release branches.

    There is the question of what can be backported into these release branches.
    By backporting new functionality between minor versions,
    the next available version would be missing it which could be considered a breaking change, violating SemVer.
    Backporting changes also comes with the risk of introducing bugs.

    Supporting older versions comes at a cost.
    This cost is dependent on the risk and impact of bugs within the package and what is acceptable for backporting.
    Creating the release branches on-demand and putting the backport burden on the community are ways to balance this cost.

    There is not yet a way for dependency management tools to report that a non-latest version is still supported,
    shifting the responsibility to users to notice this in documentation.

    For example, a Rust version support policy could look like:
    - The development branch tracks to the latest stable release from the Rust Project, updated when needed
      - The minor version will be raised when changing `rust-version`
    - The project supports every version for this calendar year, with another year grace window
      - The last minor version that supports a supported Rust version will receive community provided bug fixes
      - Fixes must be backported to all supported minor releases between the development branch and the needed supported Rust version
