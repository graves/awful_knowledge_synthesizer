This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot time.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -u user\n\t     Set the owner of the files in the file system to user.  The\n\t     default owner is the owner of the directory on which the file\n\t     system is being mounted.  The user may be a user-name, or a\n\t     numeric value.\n\n     -g group\n\t     Set the group of the files in the file system to group.  The\n\t     default group is the group of the directory on which the file\n\t     system is being mounted.  The group may be a group-name, or a\n\t     numeric value.\n\n     -m mask\n\t     Specify the maximum file permissions for files in the file\n\t     system.  (For example, a mask of 755 specifies that, by default,\n\t     the owner should have read, write, and execute permissions for\n\t     files, but others should only have read and execute permissions.\n\t     See chmod(1) for more information about octal file modes.)  Only\n\t     the nine low-order bits of mask are used.\tThe default mask is\n\t     taken from the directory on which the file system is being\n\t     mounted."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use mount_hfs to set the owner of the mounted HFS+ file system to a specific user, such as 'admin', and set the group to 'staff'?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to mount an HFS+ file system with a custom permission mask of 755, ensuring that files have read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, but only read and execute for others?
