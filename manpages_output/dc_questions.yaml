Otherwise, those files are processed, and\n       dc(1) will then exit.\n\n       If a user wants to set up a standard environment, they can use\n       DC_ENV_ARGS (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section).  For example, if a\n       user wants the scale always set to 10, they can set DC_ENV_ARGS to -e\n       10k, and this dc(1) will always start with a scale of 10."

    This is a non-portable extension.

           All long options are non-portable extensions.

    STDIN
           If no files are given on the command-line and no files or expressions
           are given by the -f, --file, -e, or --expression options, then dc(1)
           reads from stdin.

           However, there is a caveat to this.

           First, stdin is evaluated a line at a time.  The only exception to this
           is if a string has been finished, but not ended.  This means that,
           except for escaped brackets, all brackets must be balanced before dc(1)
           parses and executes.

    STDOUT
           Any non-error output is written to stdout.  In addition, if history
           (see the HISTORY section) and the prompt (see the TTY MODE section) are
           enabled, both are output to stdout.

           Note: Unlike other dc(1) implementations, this dc(1) will issue a fatal
           error (see the EXIT STATUS section) if it cannot write to stdout, so if
           stdout is closed, as in dc >&-, it will quit with an error.  This is
           done so that dc(1) can report problems when stdout is redirected to a
           file.

    STDERR
           Any error output is written to stderr.

           Note: Unlike other dc(1) implementations, this dc(1) will issue a fatal
           error (see the EXIT STATUS section) if it cannot write to stderr, so if

    SYNTAX
           Each item in the input source code, either a number (see the NUMBERS
           section) or a command (see the COMMANDS section), is processed and
           executed, in order.  Input is processed immediately when entered.

           ibase is a register (see the REGISTERS section) that determines how to
           interpret constant numbers.  It is the “input” base, or the number base
           used for interpreting input numbers.  ibase is initially 10.  The max
           allowable value for ibase is 16.  The min allowable value for ibase is
           2.  The max allowable value for ibase can be queried in dc(1) programs
           with the T command.

    INTERACTIVE MODE
           Like bc(1), dc(1) has an interactive mode and a non-interactive mode.
           Interactive mode is turned on automatically when both stdin and stdout
           are hooked to a terminal, but the -i flag and --interactive option can
           turn it on in other situations.

           In interactive mode, dc(1) attempts to recover from errors (see the
           RESET section), and in normal execution, flushes stdout as soon as
           execution is done for the current input.  dc(1) may also reset on
           SIGINT instead of exit, depending on the contents of, or default for,
           the DC_SIGINT_RESET environment variable (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
           section).

    TTY MODE
           If stdin, stdout, and stderr are all connected to a TTY, then “TTY
           mode” is considered to be available, and thus, dc(1) can turn on TTY
           mode, subject to some settings.

           If there is the environment variable DC_TTY_MODE in the environment
           (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section), then if that environment
           variable contains a non-zero integer, dc(1) will turn on TTY mode when
           stdin, stdout, and stderr are all connected to a TTY.  If the
           DC_TTY_MODE environment variable exists but is not a non-zero integer,
           then dc(1) will not turn TTY mode on.

    Manpage text:

    However, if DC_PROMPT does not exist, the prompt can be enabled or
           disabled with the DC_TTY_MODE environment variable, the -P and --no-
           prompt options, and the -R and --no-read-prompt options.  See the
           ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES and OPTIONS sections for more details.

    SIGNAL HANDLING
           Sending a SIGINT will cause dc(1) to do one of two things.

           If dc(1) is not in interactive mode (see the INTERACTIVE MODE section),
           or the DC_SIGINT_RESET environment variable (see the ENVIRONMENT
           VARIABLES section), or its default, is either not an integer or it is
           zero, dc(1) will exit.

           However, if dc(1) is in interactive mode, and the DC_SIGINT_RESET or
           its default is an integer and non-zero, then dc(1) will stop executing
           the current input and reset (see the RESET section) upon receiving a
           SIGINT.

           Note that “current input” can mean one of two things.  If dc(1) is
           processing input from stdin in interactive mode, it will ask for more
           input.  If dc(1) is processing input from a file in interactive mode,
           it will stop processing the file and start processing the next file, if
           one exists, or ask for input from stdin if no other file exists.

    Manpage text:

    This means that if a SIGINT is sent to dc(1) as it is executing a file,
           it can seem as though dc(1) did not respond to the signal since it will
           immediately start executing the next file.  This is by design; most
           files that users execute when interacting with dc(1) have function
           definitions, which are quick to parse.  If a file takes a long time to
           execute, there may be a bug in that file.  The rest of the files could
           still be executed without problem, allowing the user to continue.

           SIGTERM and SIGQUIT cause dc(1) to clean up and exit, and it uses the
           default handler for all other signals.  The one exception is SIGHUP; in
           that case, and only when dc(1) is in TTY mode (see the TTY MODE
           section), a SIGHUP will cause dc(1) to clean up and exit.

    COMMAND LINE HISTORY
           dc(1) supports interactive command-line editing.

           If dc(1) can be in TTY mode (see the TTY MODE section), history can be
           enabled.  This means that command-line history can only be enabled when
           stdin, stdout, and stderr are all connected to a TTY.
