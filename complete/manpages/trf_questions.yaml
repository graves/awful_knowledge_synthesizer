These patches\n       allow the writing of extensions to the generic I/O system of the core\n       which are able to intercept all read/write operations on designated\n       channels, thus giving it the ability to transform the data flowing\n       through these channels as desired.\n\n       This allows things like transparent encryption, compression, charset\n       recoding, etc.\n\n       Since version 8.2 of the tcl core the aforementioned patches are part\n       of the tcl core itself, changing the status of trf from \"extension\n       requiring core patches\" to \"normal extension\".\n\n       Other packages built upon either the stackd channels directly, or Trf\n       are:\n\n       [1]    TrfCrypt, by myself, contains various encryption systems\n\n       [2]    TLS, an SSL/TLS implementation by Matt Newman.\n\n       [3]    Tcl MIME by Marshall Rose.\n\nAPI\n       The commands provide by trf can be placed into the three categories\n       listed below. Note that all commands are added to the global namespace.\n\n       Encodings\n\t      The encoding commands either take some data and return the same\n\t      data in encoded form, or take encoded data and return a decoded\n\t      result.\n\n\t      [1]    oct\n\n\t      [2]    hex\n\n\t      [3]    oct\n\n\t      [4]    base64\n\n\t      [5]    uuencode\n\n\t      [6]    ascii85\n\n\t      [7]    otp_words\n\n\t      [8]    quoted-printable"
