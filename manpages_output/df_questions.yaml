By default block counts are displayed with an assumed block size\n     of 512 bytes.  If neither a file or a file system operand is specified,\n     statistics for all mounted file systems are displayed (subject to the -t\n     option below).\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     --libxo\n\t     Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human\n\t     and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details\n\t     on command line arguments.\n\n     -a      Show all mount points, including those that were mounted with the\n\t     MNT_IGNORE flag.  This is implied for file systems specified on\n\t     the command line."
