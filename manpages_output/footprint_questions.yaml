    INVESTIGATING MEMORY FOOTPRINT
         footprint provides an efficient calculation of a process's memory
         footprint and a high-level overview of the various categories of memory
         contributing to that footprint. The details that it provides can be used
         as a starting point in an investigation.

         Prioritize reducing "Dirty" memory. Dirty memory cannot be automatically
         reclaimed by the kernel and is directly used by various parts of the OS
         as a measure of a process's contribution to system memory pressure.
         Next, focus on reducing "Reclaimable" memory, especially purgeable
         volatile memory which will become dirty when marked non-volatile.
         Although this memory can be cheaply reclaimed by the kernel, purgeable
         volatile memory is commonly used as a cache of data that may be expensive
         for a user process to recreate (such as decoded image data).
         "Clean" memory can also be cheaply taken by the kernel, but unlike
         "Reclaimable" it can be restored automatically by the kernel without the
         help of a user process. For example, clean file backed data can be
         automatically evicted from memory and re-read from disk on-demand. Having
         too much clean memory can still be a performance problem, since large
         working sets can cause thrashing when loading and unloading various parts
         of a process under low memory situations.
         Lastly, avoid using "Wired" memory as much as possible since it cannot be
         paged out or reclaimed.

    Manpage text:

    For malloc and VM allocated memory, details about when and where the
         memory was allocated can often be obtained by enabling MallocStackLogging
         and using malloc_history(1) to view the backtrace at the time of each
         allocation. Xcode.app and Instruments.app also provide visual tools for
         debugging memory, such as the Xcode's Memory Graph Debugger.

         vmmap(1) provides a similar view to footprint, but with an emphasis on
         displaying the raw metrics returned by the kernel rather than the
         simplified and more processed view of footprint.  One important
         difference is that vmmap(1)'s "DIRTY" column does not include the
         compressed or swapped memory found in the "SWAPPED" column.
         Additionally, vmmap(1) can only operate on a single process and contains
         additional information such as a malloc zone summary.

    MEMORY ACCOUNTING
         Determining what dirty memory should and should not be accounted to a
         process is a difficult problem. Memory can be shared by many processes,
         it can sometimes be allocated on your behalf by other processes, and no
         matter how the accounting is done can often be expensive to accurately
         calculate.

    Manpage text:

    Many operating systems have historically exposed memory metrics such as
         Virtual Size (VSIZE) and Resident Size (RSIZE/RPRVT/RSS/etc.). Metrics
         such as these, which are useful in their own respect, are not great
         indicators of the amount of physical memory required by a process to run
         (and therefore the memory pressure that a process applies to the system).
         For instance, Virtual Size includes allocations that may not be backed by
         physical memory, and Resident Size includes clean and volatile purgeable
         memory that can be reclaimed by the kernel (as described earlier).
         On the other hand, analyzing the dirty memory reported by the underlying
         VM objects mapped into a process (the approach taken by --vmObjectDirty),
         while more accurate, is expensive and cannot be done in real-time for
         systems that need to frequently know the memory footprint of a process.

         Apple platforms instead keep track of the 'physical footprint' by using a
         per-process ledger in the kernel that is kept up-to-date by the pmap and
         other subsystems. This ledger is cheap to query, suitably accurate, and
         provides additional features such as tracking peak memory and the ability
         to charge one process for memory that is no longer mapped into it or that
         may have been allocated by another process. In cases where footprint is
         unable to analyze a portion of 'physical footprint' that is not mapped
         into a process, this memory will be listed as 'Owned physical footprint
         (unmapped)'. If this memory is mapped into another userspace process then
         the --unmapped argument can be used to search all processes for a mapping
         of the same VM object, which if found will provide a better description
         and what process(s) have mapped the memory. This also happens by default
         when targeting all processes via --all.  Any memory still listed as
         "(unmapped)" after using --unmapped is likely not mapped into any
         userspace process and instead only referenced by the kernel or drivers.
         The exact definition of this 'physical footprint' ledger is complicated
         and subject to change, but suffice it to say that the default mode of
         footprint aims to present an accurate memory breakdown that matches the
         value reported by the ledger. Most other diagnostic tools, such as the
         'MEM' column in top(1), the 'Memory' column in Activity Monitor.app, and
         the Memory Debug Gauge in Xcode.app, query this ledger to populate their
         metrics.
