By default, mdt measures\n       creates/second and removes/second.  Optionally mdt will also measure\n       the per second rates for stat, chmod, and move (rename) operations.\n\n       Each path specified on the command line corresponds to a mount point\n       for a file system to be tested.\tBy default, mdt will start 8 pthreads.\n       Each pthread will make a directory and create 16384 files in the\n       directory.  The number of pthreads (directories) can be specified via\n       the -n option, and the number of file per directory can be specified\n       via the -f option.\n\n       mdt is a metadata only test and no writes or reads are done.  By\n       default files are zero length.  For a StorNext file system, space may\n       be allocated to the file via the -b option which performs a StorNext\n       API CvApi_VerifyAlloc call.  Be aware that allocating space to files in\n       this manner is not reflected in the file size.\n\n       On completion, mdt will print the number of files and rates for the\n       specified metadata requests in the form of operations/second.  The -v\n       option will expand output listing per stream detail.\n\n       Unless the -R option is specified, mdt will remove all created files\n       and directories in the remove test section.\n\n       For StorNext file systems, mdt will unmount and then mount the target\n       file systems between test sections in order to clear the client\n       metadata cache.\tTargeted file systems should not be busy as to prevent\n       remounting.  The -U option will cause mdt to bypass remounting between\n       test sections.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -?     Display usage.\n\n       -a     Run all test sections.  In addition to create and remove, rates\n\t      for stat, chmod, move (rename) are also measured.\n\n       -b prealloc_size_in_bytes\n\t      Specify the size in bytes to preallocate after creating a file.\n\t      The default is 0 bytes and no preallocate.\n\n\t      Optionally, a single letter suffix can represent bytes in units.\n\t      mdt single letter unit suffixes are as follows.\n\n\t\t k    KB   10^3 \t     1,000\n\t\t m    MB   10^6 \t 1,000,000\n\t\t b    GB   10^9      1,000,000,000\n\t\t K    KiB  2^10 \t     1,024\n\t\t M    MiB  2^20 \t 1,048,576\n\t\t B    GiB  2^30      1,073,741,824"
