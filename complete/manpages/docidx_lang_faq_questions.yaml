The\n       intermediate files use docidx markup and are not deleted when\n       generation completes. These files can therefore serve as examples.\n\n       dtplite is distributed as part of Tcllib, so to get it you need one of\n\n       [1]    A CVS snapshot of Tcllib. How to retrieve such a snapshot and\n\t      the tools required for this are described at\n\t      http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=12883\n\n       [2]    A Tcllib release archive. They are available at\n\t      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.\n       Please report any such in the category doctools of the Tcllib SF\n       Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also\n       report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either the package\n       and/or the documentation.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       docidx_lang_cmdref, docidx_lang_intro, docidx_lang_syntax\n\nKEYWORDS\n       docidx commands, docidx language, docidx markup, docidx syntax,\n       examples, faq, markup, semantic markup\n\nCATEGORY\n       Documentation tools\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
