    NAME
           smtp - Postfix SMTP+LMTP client

    SYNOPSIS
           smtp [generic Postfix daemon options]

    DESCRIPTION
           The Postfix SMTP+LMTP client implements the SMTP and LMTP mail delivery
           protocols. It processes message delivery requests from the queue
           manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a
           domain or host to deliver to, and recipient information.  This program
           expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.

           The SMTP+LMTP client updates the queue file and marks recipients as
           finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried
           again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent to the
           bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.

           The SMTP+LMTP client looks up a list of mail exchanger addresses for
           the destination host, sorts the list by preference, and connects to
           each listed address until it finds a server that responds.

           When a server is not reachable, or when mail delivery fails due to a
           recoverable error condition, the SMTP+LMTP client will try to deliver
           the mail to an alternate host.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `smtp`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAfter a successful mail transaction, a connection may be saved to the\n       scache(8) connection cache server, so that it may be used by any\n       SMTP+LMTP client for a subsequent transaction.\n\n       By default, connection caching is enabled temporarily for destinations\n       that have a high volume of mail in the active queue. Connection caching\n       can be enabled permanently for specific destinations.\n\nSMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX\n       SMTP destinations have the following form:\n\n       domainname\n\n       domainname:port\n\t      Look up the mail exchangers for the specified domain, and\n\t      connect to the specified port (default: smtp).\n\n       [hostname]\n\n       [hostname]:port\n\t      Look up the address(es) of the specified host, and connect to\n\t      the specified port (default: smtp).\n\n       [address]\n\n       [address]:port\n\t      Connect to the host at the specified address, and connect to the\n\t      specified port (default: smtp). An IPv6 address must be\n\t      formatted as [ipv6:address]."

If the process runs chrooted, an absolute\n\t      pathname is interpreted relative to the Postfix queue directory.\n\n       inet:hostname\n\n       inet:hostname:port\n\n       inet:[address]\n\n       inet:[address]:port\n\t      Connect to the specified TCP port on the specified local or\n\t      remote host. If no port is specified, connect to the port\n\t      defined as lmtp in services(4).  If no such service is found,\n\t      the lmtp_tcp_port configuration parameter (default value of 24)\n\t      will be used.  An IPv6 address must be formatted as\n\t      [ipv6:address].\n\nSECURITY\n       The SMTP+LMTP client is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to SMTP\n       or LMTP servers and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP+LMTP client\n       can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 821 (SMTP protocol)\n       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)\n       RFC 1651 (SMTP service extensions)\n       RFC 1652 (8bit-MIME transport)\n       RFC 1870 (Message Size Declaration)\n       RFC 2033 (LMTP protocol)\n       RFC 2034 (SMTP Enhanced Error Codes)\n       RFC 2045 (MIME: Format of Internet Message Bodies)\n       RFC 2046 (MIME: Media Types)\n       RFC 2554 (AUTH command)\n       RFC 2821 (SMTP protocol)\n       RFC 2920 (SMTP Pipelining)\n       RFC 3207 (STARTTLS command)\n       RFC 3461 (SMTP DSN Extension)\n       RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)\n       RFC 4954 (AUTH command)\n       RFC 5321 (SMTP protocol)\n       RFC 6531 (Internationalized SMTP)\n       RFC 6533 (Internationalized Delivery Status Notifications)\n       RFC 7672 (SMTP security via opportunistic DANE TLS)"

    DIAGNOSTICS
           Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message
           files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt
           queue for further inspection.

           Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the
           postmaster is notified of bounces, protocol problems, and of other
           trouble.

    BUGS
           SMTP and LMTP connection caching does not work with TLS. The necessary
           support for TLS object passivation and re-activation does not exist
           without closing the session, which defeats the purpose.

           SMTP and LMTP connection caching assumes that SASL credentials are
           valid for all destinations that map onto the same IP address and TCP
           port.

    CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
           Before Postfix version 2.3, the LMTP client is a separate program that
           implements only a subset of the functionality available with SMTP:
           there is no support for TLS, and connections are cached in-process,
           making it ineffective when the client is used for multiple domains.
