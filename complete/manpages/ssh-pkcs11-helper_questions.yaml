Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ssh-pkcs11-helper`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSSH-PKCS11-HELPER(8)\t    System Manager's Manual\t  SSH-PKCS11-HELPER(8)\n\nNAME\n     ssh-pkcs11-helper â€“ OpenSSH helper for PKCS#11 support\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     ssh-pkcs11-helper [-v]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     ssh-pkcs11-helper is used by ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) to\n     access keys provided by a PKCS#11 token.\n\n     ssh-pkcs11-helper is not intended to be invoked directly by the user.\n\n     A single option is supported:\n\n     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh-pkcs11-helper to print debugging\n\t     messages about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging\n\t     problems.\tMultiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The\n\t     maximum is 3.\n\n\t     Note that ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) will\n\t     automatically pass the -v flag to ssh-pkcs11-helper when they\n\t     have themselves been placed in debug mode.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), ssh-keygen(1)\n\nHISTORY\n     ssh-pkcs11-helper first appeared in OpenBSD 4.7.\n\nAUTHORS\n     Markus Friedl <markus@openbsd.org>\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\tApril 29, 2022\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
