Things such as missing local or\n     remote attributes for MSRP will be flagged as a warning but is not an\n     error if the Mac is not sourcing or sinking streams as appropriate for\n     the warning.\n\n     avbdiagnose will flag potential errors and warnings and suggest filing a\n     radar report at http://bugreporter.apple.com.  Please attach the\n     generated file at /tmp/avbdiagnose-<date>.bz2 to the bug report. An error\n     or warning report may be the result of a network device. Please use your\n     best judgement before filing the bug report."
