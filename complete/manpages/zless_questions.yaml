Such files generally have a “Z” or “gz” extension\n     (both the compress(1) and gzip(1) formats are supported).\tAny flags that\n     are specified are passed to the user's preferred PAGER (which is\n     /usr/bin/more by default).\n\n     zless is equivalent to zmore but uses less(1) as a pager instead of\n     more(1).\n\n     When multiple files are specified, zmore will pause at the end of each\n     file and present the following prompt to the user:\n\n\t   prev_file (END) - Next: next_file\n\n     Where prev_file is the file that was just displayed and next_file is the\n     next file to be displayed.  The following keys are recognized at the\n     prompt:\n\n\t   e or q  quit zmore.\n\n\t   s\t   skip the next file (or exit if the next file is the last)."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use zless to view a compressed file named data.gz with the less pager?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how to navigate through multiple compressed files using zless?
