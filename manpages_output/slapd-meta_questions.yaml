The information\n       contained in these servers can be presented as belonging to a single\n       Directory Information Tree (DIT).\n\n       A basic knowledge of the functionality of the slapd-ldap(5) backend is\n       recommended.  This backend has been designed as an enhancement of the\n       ldap backend.  The two backends share many features (actually they also\n       share portions of code).  While the ldap backend is intended to proxy\n       operations directed to a single server, the meta backend is mainly\n       intended for proxying of multiple servers and possibly naming context\n       masquerading.  These features, although useful in many scenarios, may\n       result in excessive overhead for some applications, so its use should\n       be carefully considered.  In the examples section, some typical\n       scenarios will be discussed.\n\n       The proxy instance of slapd(8) must contain schema information for the\n       attributes and objectClasses used in filters, request DN and request-\n       related data in general.  It should also contain schema information for\n       the data returned by the proxied server.  It is the responsibility of\n       the proxy administrator to keep the schema of the proxy lined up with\n       that of the proxied server."

That is,\n       they must follow a \"database meta\" line and come before any subsequent\n       \"backend\" or \"database\" lines.  Other database options are described in\n       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\n       Note: In early versions of back-ldap and back-meta it was recommended\n       to always set\n\n\t      lastmod  off\n\n       for ldap and meta databases.  This was required because operational\n       attributes related to entry creation and modification should not be\n       proxied, as they could be mistakenly written to the target server(s),\n       generating an error.  The current implementation automatically sets\n       lastmod to off, so its use is redundant and should be omitted."

While the former can gain limited\n       beneficial effects from rewriting stuff, the latter can become an\n       amazingly powerful tool.\n\n       Consider a couple of scenarios first.\n\n       1) Two directory servers share two levels of naming context; say\n       \"dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com\" and \"dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com\".  Then, an unambiguous\n       Meta database can be configured as:\n\n\t      database meta\n\t      suffix   \"dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\t      uri      \"ldap://a.foo.com/dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\t      uri      \"ldap://b.foo.com/dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\n       Operations directed to a specific target can be easily resolved because\n       there are no ambiguities.  The only operation that may resolve to\n       multiple targets is a search with base \"dc=foo,dc=com\" and scope at\n       least \"one\", which results in spawning two searches to the targets.\n\n       2a) Two directory servers don't share any portion of naming context,\n       but they'd present as a single DIT [Caveat: uniqueness of (massaged)\n       entries among the two servers is assumed; integrity checks risk to\n       incur in excessive overhead and have not been implemented].  Say we\n       have \"dc=bar,dc=org\" and \"o=Foo,c=US\", and we'd like them to appear as\n       branches of \"dc=foo,dc=com\", say \"dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com\" and\n       \"dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com\".

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `slapd-meta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ndatabase\t    meta\n\t      suffix\t    \"dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\n\t      uri\t    \"ldap://a.bar.com/dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\t      suffixmassage \"dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com\" \"dc=bar,dc=org\"\n\n\t      uri\t    \"ldap://b.foo.com/dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\t      suffixmassage \"dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com\" \"o=Foo,c=US\"\n\n       Again, operations can be resolved without ambiguity, although some\n       rewriting is required.  Notice that the virtual naming context of each\n       target is a branch of the database's naming context; it is rewritten\n       back and forth when operations are performed towards the target\n       servers.  What \"back and forth\" means will be clarified later.\n\n       When a search with base \"dc=foo,dc=com\" is attempted, if the scope is\n       \"base\" it fails with \"no such object\"; in fact, the common root of the\n       two targets (prior to massaging) does not exist.  If the scope is\n       \"one\", both targets are contacted with the base replaced by each\n       target's base; the scope is derated to \"base\".  In general, a scope\n       \"one\" search is honored, and the scope is derated, only when the\n       incoming base is at most one level lower of a target's naming context\n       (prior to massaging).\n\n       Finally, if the scope is \"sub\" the incoming base is replaced by each\n       target's unmassaged naming context, and the scope is not altered.\n\n       2b) Consider the above reported scenario with the two servers sharing\n       the same naming context:\n\n\t      database\t    meta\n\t      suffix\t    \"dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\n\t      uri\t    \"ldap://a.bar.com/dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\t      suffixmassage \"dc=foo,dc=com\" \"dc=bar,dc=org\"\n\n\t      uri\t    \"ldap://b.foo.com/dc=foo,dc=com\"\n\t      suffixmassage \"dc=foo,dc=com\" \"o=Foo,c=US\"\n\n       All the previous considerations hold, except that now there is no way\n       to unambiguously resolve a DN.  In this case, all the operations that\n       require an unambiguous target selection will fail unless the DN is\n       already cached or a default target has been set.  Practical\n       configurations may result as a combination of all the above scenarios.\n\nACLs\n       Note on ACLs: at present you may add whatever ACL rule you desire to to\n       the Meta (and LDAP) backends.  However, the meaning of an ACL on a\n       proxy may require some considerations.  Two philosophies may be\n       considered:\n\n       a) the remote server dictates the permissions; the proxy simply passes\n       back what it gets from the remote server.\n\n       b) the remote server unveils \"everything\"; the proxy is responsible for\n       protecting data from unauthorized access.\n\n       Of course the latter sounds unreasonable, but it is not.  It is\n       possible to imagine scenarios in which a remote host discloses data\n       that can be considered \"public\" inside an intranet, and a proxy that\n       connects it to the internet may impose additional constraints.  To this\n       purpose, the proxy should be able to comply with all the ACL matching\n       criteria that the server supports.  This has been achieved with regard\n       to all the criteria supported by slapd except a special subtle case\n       (please file an ITS if you can find other exceptions:\n       <http://www.openldap.org/its/>).  The rule\n\n\t      access to dn=\"<dn>\" attrs=<attr>\n\t\t     by dnattr=<dnattr> read\n\t\t     by * none\n\n       cannot be matched iff the attribute that is being requested, <attr>, is\n       NOT <dnattr>, and the attribute that determines membership, <dnattr>,\n       has not been requested (e.g. in a search)\n\n       In fact this ACL is resolved by slapd using the portion of entry it\n       retrieved from the remote server without requiring any further\n       intervention of the backend, so, if the <dnattr> attribute has not been\n       fetched, the match cannot be assessed because the attribute is not\n       present, not because no value matches the requirement!\n\n       Note on ACLs and attribute mapping: ACLs are applied to the mapped\n       attributes; for instance, if the attribute locally known as \"foo\" is\n       mapped to \"bar\" on a remote server, then local ACLs apply to attribute\n       \"foo\" and are totally unaware of its remote name.  The remote server\n       will check permissions for \"bar\", and the local server will possibly\n       enforce additional restrictions to \"foo\".\n\nREWRITING\n       A string is rewritten according to a set of rules, called a `rewrite\n       context'.  The rules are based on POSIX (''extended'') regular\n       expressions (regex) with substring matching; basic variable\n       substitution and map resolution of substrings is allowed by specific\n       mechanisms detailed in the following.  The behavior of pattern\n       matching/substitution can be altered by a set of flags.\n\n       The underlying concept is to build a lightweight rewrite module for the\n       slapd server (initially dedicated to the LDAP backend).\n\nPasses\n       An incoming string is matched against a set of rules.  Rules are made\n       of a regex match pattern, a substitution pattern and a set of actions,\n       described by a set of flags.  In case of match a string rewriting is\n       performed according to the substitution pattern that allows to refer to\n       substrings matched in the incoming string.  The actions, if any, are\n       finally performed.  The substitution pattern allows map resolution of\n       substrings.  A map is a generic object that maps a substitution pattern\n       to a value.  The flags are divided in \"Pattern matching Flags\" and\n       \"Action Flags\"; the former alter the regex match pattern behavior while\n       the latter alter the action that is taken after substitution.\n\nPattern Matching Flags\n       `C'    honors case in matching (default is case insensitive)\n\n       `R'    use POSIX ''basic'' regular expressions (default is\n\t      ''extended'')\n\n       `M{n}' allow no more than n recursive passes for a specific rule; does\n\t      not alter the max total count of passes, so it can only enforce\n\t      a stricter limit for a specific rule.\n\nAction Flags\n       `:'    apply the rule once only (default is recursive)\n\n       `@'    stop applying rules in case of match; the current rule is still\n\t      applied recursively; combine with `:' to apply the current rule\n\t      only once and then stop.\n\n       `#'    stop current operation if the rule matches, and issue an\n\t      `unwilling to perform' error.\n\n       `G{n}' jump n rules back and forth (watch for loops!).  Note that\n\t      `G{1}' is implicit in every rule.\n\n       `I'    ignores errors in rule; this means, in case of error, e.g.\n\t      issued by a map, the error is treated as a missed match.\tThe\n\t      `unwilling to perform' is not overridden.\n\n       `U{n}' uses n as return code if the rule matches; the flag does not\n\t      alter the recursive behavior of the rule, so, to have it\n\t      performed only once, it must be used in combination with `:',\n\t      e.g.  `:U{16}' returns the value `16' after exactly one\n\t      execution of the rule, if the pattern matches.  As a\n\t      consequence, its behavior is equivalent to `@', with the return\n\t      code set to n; or, in other words, `@' is equivalent to `U{0}'.\n\t      By convention, the freely available codes are above 16 included;\n\t      the others are reserved.\n\n       The ordering of the flags can be significant.  For instance: `IG{2}'\n       means ignore errors and jump two lines ahead both in case of match and\n       in case of error, while `G{2}I' means ignore errors, but jump two lines\n       ahead only in case of match.\n\n       More flags (mainly Action Flags) will be added as needed.\n\nPattern matching:\n       See regex(7) and/or re_format(7).\n\nSubstitution Pattern Syntax:\n       Everything starting with `%' requires substitution;\n\n       the only obvious exception is `%%', which is left as is;\n\n       the basic substitution is `%d', where `d' is a digit; 0 means the whole\n       string, while 1-9 is a submatch;\n\n       a `%' followed by a `{' invokes an advanced substitution.  The pattern\n       is:\n\n\t      `%' `{' [ <op> ] <name> `(' <substitution> `)' `}'\n\n       where <name> must be a legal name for the map, i.e.\n\n\t      <name> ::= [a-z][a-z0-9]* (case insensitive)\n\t      <op> ::= `>' `|' `&' `&&' `*' `**' `$'\n\n       and <substitution> must be a legal substitution pattern, with no limits\n       on the nesting level.\n\n       The operators are:\n\n       >      sub context invocation; <name> must be a legal, already defined\n\t      rewrite context name\n\n       |      external command invocation; <name> must refer to a legal,\n\t      already defined command name (NOT IMPL.)\n\n       &      variable assignment; <name> defines a variable in the running\n\t      operation structure which can be dereferenced later; operator &\n\t      assigns a variable in the rewrite context scope; operator &&\n\t      assigns a variable that scopes the entire session, e.g. its\n\t      value can be dereferenced later by other rewrite contexts\n\n       *      variable dereferencing; <name> must refer to a variable that is\n\t      defined and assigned for the running operation; operator *\n\t      dereferences a variable scoping the rewrite context; operator **\n\t      dereferences a variable scoping the whole session, e.g. the\n\t      value is passed across rewrite contexts\n\n       $      parameter dereferencing; <name> must refer to an existing\n\t      parameter; the idea is to make some run-time parameters set by\n\t      the system available to the rewrite engine, as the client host\n\t      name, the bind DN if any, constant parameters initialized at\n\t      config time, and so on; no parameter is currently set by either\n\t      back-ldap or back-meta, but constant parameters can be defined\n\t      in the configuration file by using the rewriteParam directive.\n\n       Substitution escaping has been delegated to the `%' symbol, which is\n       used instead of `\\' in string substitution patterns because `\\' is\n       already escaped by slapd's low level parsing routines; as a\n       consequence, regex escaping requires two `\\' symbols, e.g.\n       `.*\\.foo\\.bar' must be written as `.*\\\\.foo\\\\.bar'.\n\nRewrite context:\n       A rewrite context is a set of rules which are applied in sequence.  The\n       basic idea is to have an application initialize a rewrite engine (think\n       of Apache's mod_rewrite ...) with a set of rewrite contexts; when\n       string rewriting is required, one invokes the appropriate rewrite\n       context with the input string and obtains the newly rewritten one if no\n       errors occur.\n\n       Each basic server operation is associated to a rewrite context; they\n       are divided in two main groups: client -> server and server -> client\n       rewriting.\n\n       client -> server:\n\n\t      (default) \t   if defined and no specific context\n\t\t\t\t   is available\n\t      bindDN\t\t   bind\n\t      searchBase\t   search\n\t      searchFilter\t   search\n\t      searchFilterAttrDN   search\n\t      compareDN \t   compare\n\t      compareAttrDN\t   compare AVA\n\t      addDN\t\t   add\n\t      addAttrDN \t   add AVA\n\t      modifyDN\t\t   modify\n\t      modifyAttrDN\t   modify AVA\n\t      modrDN\t\t   modrdn\n\t      newSuperiorDN\t   modrdn\n\t      deleteDN\t\t   delete\n\t      exopPasswdDN\t   password modify extended operation DN if proxy\n\n       server -> client:\n\n\t      searchResult\t   search (only if defined; no default;\n\t\t\t\t   acts on DN and DN-syntax attributes\n\t\t\t\t   of search results)\n\t      searchAttrDN\t   search AVA\n\t      matchedDN \t   all ops (only if applicable)\n\nBasic configuration syntax\n       rewriteEngine { on | off }\n\t      If `on', the requested rewriting is performed; if `off', no\n\t      rewriting takes place (an easy way to stop rewriting without\n\t      altering too much the configuration file).\n\n       rewriteContext <context name> [ alias <aliased context name> ]\n\t      <Context name> is the name that identifies the context, i.e. the\n\t      name used by the application to refer to the set of rules it\n\t      contains.  It is used also to reference sub contexts in string\n\t      rewriting.  A context may alias another one.  In this case the\n\t      alias context contains no rule, and any reference to it will\n\t      result in accessing the aliased one.\n\n       rewriteRule <regex match pattern> <substitution pattern> [ <flags> ]\n\t      Determines how a string can be rewritten if a pattern is\n\t      matched.\tExamples are reported below.\n\nAdditional configuration syntax:\n       rewriteMap <map type> <map name> [ <map attrs> ]\n\t      Allows to define a map that transforms substring rewriting into\n\t      something else.  The map is referenced inside the substitution\n\t      pattern of a rule.\n\n       rewriteParam <param name> <param value>\n\t      Sets a value with global scope, that can be dereferenced by the\n\t      command `%{$paramName}'.\n\n       rewriteMaxPasses <number of passes> [<number of passes per rule>]\n\t      Sets the maximum number of total rewriting passes that can be\n\t      performed in a single rewrite operation (to avoid loops).
