Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `puts`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nFPUTS(3)\t\t   Library Functions Manual\t\t      FPUTS(3)\n\nNAME\n     fputs, puts – output a line to a stream\n\nLIBRARY\n     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     #include <stdio.h>\n\n     int\n     fputs(const char *restrict s, FILE *restrict stream);\n\n     int\n     puts(const char *s);\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The function fputs() writes the string pointed to by s to the stream\n     pointed to by stream.\n\n     The function puts() writes the string s, and a terminating newline\n     character, to the stream stdout.\n\nRETURN VALUES\n     The functions fputs() and puts() return a nonnegative integer on success\n     and EOF on error.\n\nERRORS\n     [EBADF]\t\tThe stream argument is not a writable stream.\n\n     The functions fputs() and puts() may also fail and set errno for any of\n     the errors specified for the routines write(2).\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n     fputs() now returns a non-negative number (as opposed to 0) on successful\n     completion.  As a result, many tests (e.g., \"fputs() == 0\", \"fputs() !=\n     0\") do not give the desired result.  Use \"fputs() != EOF\" or \"fputs() ==\n     EOF\" to determine success or failure."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the fputs and puts functions?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the puts function to output a string followed by a newline to standard output?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the fputs function to write a string to a file stream?
