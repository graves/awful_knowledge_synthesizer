Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -L      Display the logical current working directory.\n\n     -P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic\n\t     links resolved).\n\n     If no options are specified, the -L option is assumed.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     Environment variables used by pwd:\n\n     PWD      Logical current working directory.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The pwd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Show current working directory with symbolic links resolved:\n\n\t   $ /bin/pwd -P\n\t   /usr/home/fernape\n\n     Show the logical current directory.  Then use file(1) to inspect the\n     /home directory:"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the pwd command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the pwd command to display the physical current working directory, resolving all symbolic links?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the pwd command with the -L option to show the logical current working directory?

However, it can give a different answer in the rare case that the\n     current directory or a containing directory was moved after the shell\n     descended into it.\n\n     The -L option does not work unless the PWD environment variable is\n     exported by the shell.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t       October 24, 2020 \t\t    macOS 15.3"
