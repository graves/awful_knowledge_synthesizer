File arguments specify the directories to be\n       scanned; if no such arguments are given, your default terminfo\n       directory is scanned.  If you also specify the -h option, a directory\n       header will be issued as each directory is entered.\n\n       There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:\n\n       -a     report on all of the terminal databases which ncurses would\n\t      search, rather than only the first one that it finds.\n\n\t      If the -s is also given, toe adds a column to the report,\n\t      showing (like conflict(1)) which entries which belong to a given\n\t      terminal database.  An \"*\" marks entries which differ, and \"+\"\n\t      marks equivalent entries.\n\n       -s     sort the output by the entry names."

  manpageQuestion2: How can I use the toe command to list all terminal types in the default terminfo directory along with their descriptions?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would I use to generate a sorted list of all terminal databases that ncurses would search, including information about conflicting entries?
