The file /etc/termcap is read to determine\n     the appropriate sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable\n     of underlining, but is capable of a standout mode then that is used\n     instead.  If the terminal can overstrike, or handles underlining\n     automatically, ul degenerates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot\n     underline, underlining is ignored.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -i      Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing\n\t     appropriate dashes ‘-’.\n\n     -t terminal\n\t     Overrides the terminal type specified in the environment with\n\t     terminal."
