If a variable is\n     undefined, the string “undefined” is output.\n\n     The first form of the command displays all of the path or system\n     configuration variables to standard output.  If file is provided, all\n     path configuration variables are reported for file using pathconf(2).\n     Otherwise, all system configuration variables are reported using\n     confstr(3) and sysconf(3).\n\n     The second form of the command, with two mandatory arguments, retrieves\n     file- and file system-specific configuration variables using pathconf(2).\n     The third form, with a single argument, retrieves system configuration\n     variables using confstr(3) and sysconf(3), depending on the type of\n     variable.\tAs an extension, the second form can also be used to query\n     static limits from <limits.h>."
