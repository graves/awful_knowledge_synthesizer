[-elementborderwidth elementBorderWidth]\n       Specifies the width of borders drawn around the internal elements of\n       the scrollbar (the two arrows and the slider).  The value may have any\n       of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.

The scrollbar command returns its pathName\n       argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a\n       window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A scrollbar is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of\n       the scrollbar, and a slider in the middle portion of the scrollbar.  It\n       provides information about what is visible in an associated window that\n       displays a document of some sort (such as a file being edited or a\n       drawing).  The position and size of the slider indicate which portion\n       of the document is visible in the associated window.  For example, if\n       the slider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area\n       between the two arrows, it means that the associated window displays\n       the top third of its document."

The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a\n       Tcl command generated from the scrollbar's -command option.  The\n       command may take any of the following forms.  In each case, prefix is\n       the contents of the -command option, which usually has a form like .t\n       yview\n\n       prefix moveto fraction\n\t      Fraction is a real number between 0 and 1.  The widget should\n\t      adjust its view so that the point given by fraction appears at\n\t      the beginning of the widget.  If fraction is 0 it refers to the\n\t      beginning of the document.  1.0 refers to the end of the\n\t      document, 0.333 refers to a point one-third of the way through\n\t      the document, and so on.\n\n       prefix scroll number units\n\t      The widget should adjust its view by number units.  The units\n\t      are defined in whatever way makes sense for the widget, such as\n\t      characters or lines in a text widget.  Number is either 1, which\n\t      means one unit should scroll off the top or left of the window,\n\t      or -1, which means that one unit should scroll off the bottom or\n\t      right of the window."

It is up to\n\t      the widget to define the meaning of a page;  typically it is\n\t      slightly less than what fits in the window, so that there is a\n\t      slight overlap between the old and new views.

In the old command syntax, the\n       set widget command has the following form:\n\n       pathName set totalUnits windowUnits firstUnit lastUnit\n\t      In this form the arguments are all integers.  TotalUnits gives\n\t      the total size of the object being displayed in the associated\n\t      widget.  The meaning of one unit depends on the associated\n\t      widget;  for example, in a text editor widget units might\n\t      correspond to lines of text.  WindowUnits indicates the total\n\t      number of units that can fit in the associated window at one\n\t      time.  FirstUnit and lastUnit give the indices of the first and\n\t      last units currently visible in the associated window (zero\n\t      corresponds to the first unit of the object)."
