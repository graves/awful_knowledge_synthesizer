Empty means that the new interpreter has neither\n\t      namespaces, nor any commands. It is useful only for the creation\n\t      of aliases.\n\n\t      If a path is specified then it is taken as the name of the new\n\t      interpreter.\n\n       ::interp::snitLink path methodlist\n\t      This command assumes that it was called from within a method of\n\t      a snit object, and that the command mymethod is available.\n\n\t      It extends the interpreter specified by path with aliases for\n\t      all methods found in the methodlist, with the alias directing\n\t      execution to the same-named method of the snit object invoking\n\t      this command.  Each element of methodlist is actually\n\t      interpreted as a command prefix, with the first word of each\n\t      prefix the name of the method to link to.\n\n\t      The result of the command is the empty string.\n\n       ::interp::snitDictLink path methoddict\n\t      This command behaves like ::interp::snitLink, except that it\n\t      takes a dictionary mapping from commands to methods as its\n\t      input, and not a list of methods.  Like for ::interp::snitLink\n\t      the method references are actually command prefixes.  This\n\t      command allows the creation of more complex command-method\n\t      mappings than ::interp::snitLink.\n\n\t      The result of the command is the empty string.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category interp of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       alias, empty interpreter, interpreter, method, snit\n\nCATEGORY\n       Programming tools\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2006 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
