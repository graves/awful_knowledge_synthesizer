  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the avbanalyse tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use avbanalyse to analyze a PCAP file containing AVB network traffic?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using avbanalyse to extract payload data from an IEC 61883-6 AM824 audio stream in a PCAP file?
