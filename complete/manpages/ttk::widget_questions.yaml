The class is used when\n       querying the option database for the window's other options, to\n       determine the default bindtags for the window, and to select the\n       widget's default layout and style.  This is a read-only option: it may\n       only be specified when the window is created, and may not be changed\n       with the configure widget command.  [-cursor cursor] Specifies the\n       mouse cursor to be used for the widget.\tSee Tk_GetCursor and\n       cursors(n) in the Tk reference manual for the legal values.  If set to\n       the empty string (the default), the cursor is inherited from the parent\n       widget.\t[-takefocus takeFocus] Determines whether the window accepts\n       the focus during keyboard traversal.  Either 0, 1, a command prefix (to\n       which the widget path is appended, and which should return 0 or 1), or\n       the empty string.  See options(n) in the Tk reference manual for the\n       full description.  [-style style] May be used to specify a custom\n       widget style."

See scrollbar(n) for more information\n       [-xscrollcommand xScrollCommand] A command prefix, used to communicate\n       with horizontal scrollbars.\n\t      When the view in the widget's window changes, the widget will\n\t      generate a Tcl command by concatenating the scroll command and\n\t      two numbers.  Each of the numbers is a fraction between 0 and 1\n\t      indicating a position in the document; 0 indicates the\n\t      beginning, and 1 indicates the end.  The first fraction\n\t      indicates the first information in the widget that is visible in\n\t      the window, and the second fraction indicates the information\n\t      just after the last portion that is visible.\n\n\t      Typically the xScrollCommand option consists of the path name of\n\t      a scrollbar widget followed by “set”, e.g.  “.x.scrollbar set”.\n\t      This will cause the scrollbar to be updated whenever the view in\n\t      the window changes."

See the description of -xscrollcommand above\n       for details.\n\nLABEL OPTIONS\n       The following options are supported by labels, buttons, and other\n       button-like widgets: [-text text] Specifies a text string to be\n       displayed inside the widget (unless overridden by -textvariable).\n       [-textvariable textVariable] Specifies the name of variable whose value\n       will be used in place of the -text resource.  [-underline underline] If\n       set, specifies the integer index (0-based) of a character to underline\n       in the text string.  The underlined character is used for mnemonic\n       activation.  [-image image] Specifies an image to display.  This is a\n       list of 1 or more elements.  The first element is the default image\n       name.  The rest of the list is a sequence of statespec / value pairs as\n       per style map, specifying different images to use when the widget is in\n       a particular state or combination of states.  All images in the list\n       should have the same size.  [-compound compound] Specifies how to\n       display the image relative to the text, in the case both -text and\n       -image are present.  Valid values are:"
