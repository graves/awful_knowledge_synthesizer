The input and output file\n       formats are expected to be compatible with Sendmail version 8, and are\n       expected to be suitable for the use as NIS alias maps.\n\n       If the result files do not exist they will be created with the same\n       group and other read permissions as their source file.\n\n       While a database update is in progress, signal delivery is postponed,\n       and an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on the entire database, in\n       order to avoid surprises in spectator processes.\n\n       The format of Postfix alias input files is described in aliases(5).\n\n       By default the lookup key is mapped to lowercase to make the lookups\n       case insensitive; as of Postfix 2.3 this case folding happens only with\n       tables whose lookup keys are fixed-case strings such as btree:, dbm: or\n       hash:. With earlier versions, the lookup key is folded even with tables\n       where a lookup field can match both upper and lower case text, such as\n       regexp: and pcre:. This resulted in loss of information with $number\n       substitutions.\n\n       Options:\n\n       -c config_dir\n\t      Read the main.cf configuration file in the named directory\n\t      instead of the default configuration directory.\n\n       -d key Search the specified maps for key and remove one entry per map.\n\t      The exit status is zero when the requested information was\n\t      found.\n\n\t      If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key values\n\t      from the standard input stream. The exit status is zero when at\n\t      least one of the requested keys was found.\n\n       -f     Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while creating or\n\t      querying a table.\n\n\t      With Postfix version 2.3 and later, this option has no effect\n\t      for regular expression tables. There, case folding is controlled\n\t      by appending a flag to a pattern.\n\n       -i     Incremental mode. Read entries from standard input and do not\n\t      truncate an existing database. By default, postalias(1) creates\n\t      a new database from the entries in file_name.\n\n       -N     Include the terminating null character that terminates lookup\n\t      keys and values. By default, postalias(1) does whatever is the\n\t      default for the host operating system.\n\n       -n     Don't include the terminating null character that terminates\n\t      lookup keys and values. By default, postalias(1) does whatever\n\t      is the default for the host operating system.\n\n       -o     Do not release root privileges when processing a non-root input\n\t      file. By default, postalias(1) drops root privileges and runs as\n\t      the source file owner instead.\n\n       -p     Do not inherit the file access permissions from the input file\n\t      when creating a new file.  Instead, create a new file with\n\t      default access permissions (mode 0644).\n\n       -q key Search the specified maps for key and write the first value\n\t      found to the standard output stream. The exit status is zero\n\t      when the requested information was found.\n\n\t      If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key values\n\t      from the standard input stream and writes one line of key: value\n\t      output for each key that was found. The exit status is zero when\n\t      at least one of the requested keys was found.\n\n       -r     When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update\n\t      existing entries, and make those updates anyway.\n\n       -s     Retrieve all database elements, and write one line of key: value\n\t      output for each element. The elements are printed in database\n\t      order, which is not necessarily the same as the original input\n\t      order.  This feature is available in Postfix version 2.2 and\n\t      later, and is not available for all database types.\n\n       -u     Disable UTF-8 support. UTF-8 support is enabled by default when\n\t      \"smtputf8_enable = yes\". It requires that keys and values are\n\t      valid UTF-8 strings.\n\n       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v\n\t      options make the software increasingly verbose.\n\n       -w     When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update\n\t      existing entries, and ignore those attempts.\n\n       Arguments:\n\n       file_type\n\t      The database type. To find out what types are supported, use the\n\t      \"postconf -m\" command.\n\n\t      The postalias(1) command can query any supported file type, but\n\t      it can create only the following file types:\n\n\t      btree  The output is a btree file, named file_name.db.  This is\n\t\t     available on systems with support for db databases.\n\n\t      cdb    The output is one file named file_name.cdb.  This is\n\t\t     available on systems with support for cdb databases.\n\n\t      dbm    The output consists of two files, named file_name.pag and\n\t\t     file_name.dir.  This is available on systems with support\n\t\t     for dbm databases.\n\n\t      hash   The output is a hashed file, named file_name.db.  This is\n\t\t     available on systems with support for db databases.\n\n\t      fail   A table that reliably fails all requests. The lookup\n\t\t     table name is used for logging only. This table exists to\n\t\t     simplify Postfix error tests.\n\n\t      sdbm   The output consists of two files, named file_name.pag and\n\t\t     file_name.dir.  This is available on systems with support\n\t\t     for sdbm databases.\n\n\t      When no file_type is specified, the software uses the database\n\t      type specified via the default_database_type configuration\n\t      parameter.  The default value for this parameter depends on the\n\t      host environment.\n\n       file_name\n\t      The name of the alias database source file when creating a\n\t      database.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems are logged to the standard error stream and to syslogd(8).  No\n       output means that no problems were detected. Duplicate entries are\n       skipped and are flagged with a warning.\n\n       postalias(1) terminates with zero exit status in case of success\n       (including successful \"postalias -q\" lookup) and terminates with\n       non-zero exit status in case of failure.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\n       MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      Directory with Postfix configuration files.\n\n       MAIL_VERBOSE\n\t      Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this\n       program.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary.
