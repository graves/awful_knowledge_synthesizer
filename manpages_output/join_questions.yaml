The first field in each\n     line is used by default.  There is one line in the output for each pair\n     of lines in file1 and file2 which have identical join fields.  Each\n     output line consists of the join field, the remaining fields from file1\n     and then the remaining fields from file2.\n\n     The default field separators are tab and space characters.  In this case,\n     multiple tabs and spaces count as a single field separator, and leading\n     tabs and spaces are ignored.  The default output field separator is a\n     single space character."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `join`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nMany of the options use file and field numbers.  Both file numbers and\n     field numbers are 1 based, i.e., the first file on the command line is\n     file number 1 and the first field is field number 1.  The following\n     options are available:\n\n     -a file_number\n\t     In addition to the default output, produce a line for each\n\t     unpairable line in file file_number.\n\n     -e string\n\t     Replace empty output fields with string.\n\n     -o list\n\t     The -o option specifies the fields that will be output from each\n\t     file for each line with matching join fields.  Each element of\n\t     list has either the form file_number.field, where file_number is\n\t     a file number and field is a field number, or the form ‘0’\n\t     (zero), representing the join field.  The elements of list must\n\t     be either comma (‘,’) or whitespace separated.  (The latter\n\t     requires quoting to protect it from the shell, or, a simpler\n\t     approach is to use multiple -o options.)\n\n     -t char\n\t     Use character char as a field delimiter for both input and\n\t     output.  Every occurrence of char in a line is significant."
