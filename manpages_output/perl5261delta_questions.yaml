This has\n       now been fixed.\t[GH #16021]\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16021>\n\n   [CVE-2017-12883] Buffer over-read in regular expression parser\n       For certain types of syntax error in a regular expression pattern, the\n       error message could either contain the contents of a random, possibly\n       large, chunk of memory, or could crash perl.  This has now been fixed.\n       [GH #16025] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16025>\n\n   [CVE-2017-12814] $ENV{$key} stack buffer overflow on Windows\n       A possible stack buffer overflow in the %ENV code on Windows has been\n       fixed by removing the buffer completely since it was superfluous\n       anyway.\t[GH #16051] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16051>\n\nIncompatible Changes\n       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.26.0.  If any\n       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See\n       \"Reporting Bugs\" below.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   Updated Modules and Pragmata\n       •   base has been upgraded from version 2.25 to 2.26.\n\n\t   The effects of dotless @INC on this module have been limited by the\n\t   introduction of a more refined and accurate solution for removing\n\t   '.' from @INC while reducing the false positives.\n\n       •   charnames has been upgraded from version 1.44 to 1.45.\n\n       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170530 to\n\t   5.20170922_26.\n\nPlatform Support\n   Platform-Specific Notes\n       FreeBSD\n\t   •   Building with g++ on FreeBSD-11.0 has been fixed.  [GH #15984]\n\t       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15984>\n\n       Windows\n\t   •   Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual\n\t       Studio 2017 (containing Visual C++ 14.1) has been added.\n\n\t   •   Building XS modules with GCC 6 in a 64-bit build of Perl failed\n\t       due to incorrect mapping of \"strtoll\" and \"strtoull\".  This has\n\t       now been fixed.\t[GH #16074]\n\t       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16074> [cpan #121683]\n\t       <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121683> [cpan\n\t       #122353]\n\t       <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=122353>\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       •   Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause\n\t   them to write to the internal stack without allocating room for the\n\t   item being written.\tIn rare situations, this could have led to a\n\t   crash.  These bugs have now been fixed, and if any similar bugs are\n\t   introduced in future, they will be detected automatically in\n\t   debugging builds.  [GH #16076]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16076>\n\n       •   Using a symbolic ref with postderef syntax as the key in a hash\n\t   lookup was yielding an assertion failure on debugging builds.  [GH\n\t   #16029] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16029>\n\n       •   List assignment (\"aassign\") could in some rare cases allocate an\n\t   entry on the mortal stack and leave the entry uninitialized.  [GH\n\t   #16017] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16017>\n\n       •   Attempting to apply an attribute to an \"our\" variable where a\n\t   function of that name already exists could result in a NULL pointer\n\t   being supplied where an SV was expected, crashing perl.  [perl\n\t   #131597] <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131597>\n\n       •   The code that vivifies a typeglob out of a code ref made some false\n\t   assumptions that could lead to a crash in cases such as $::{\"A\"} =\n\t   sub {}; \\&{\"A\"}.  This has now been fixed.  [GH #15937]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15937>\n\n       •   \"my_atof2\" no longer reads beyond the terminating NUL, which\n\t   previously occurred if the decimal point is immediately before the\n\t   NUL. [GH #16002] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16002>\n\n       •   Occasional \"Malformed UTF-8 character\" crashes in \"s//\" on utf8\n\t   strings have been fixed.  [GH #16019]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16019>\n\n       •   \"perldoc -f s\" now finds \"s///\".  [GH #15989]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15989>\n\n       •   Some erroneous warnings after utf8 conversion have been fixed.  [GH\n\t   #15958] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15958>\n\n       •   The \"jmpenv\" frame to catch Perl exceptions is set up lazily, and\n\t   this used to be a bit too lazy.  The catcher is now set up earlier,\n\t   preventing some possible crashes.  [GH #11804]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/11804>\n\n       •   Spurious \"Assuming NOT a POSIX class\" warnings have been removed.\n\t   [GH #16001] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16001>\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.26.1 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl\n       5.26.0 and contains approximately 8,900 lines of changes across 85\n       files from 23 authors.\n\n       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there\n       were approximately 990 lines of changes to 38 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers.

Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see\n       \"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\" in perlsec for details of\n       how to report the issue.\n\nGive Thanks\n       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in\n       Perl 5, you can do so by running the \"perlthanks\" program:\n\n\t   perlthanks\n\n       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of\n       thanks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5261DELTA(1)"
