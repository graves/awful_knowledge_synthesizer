For a description of assignment, see the beginning of\n       zshparam(1).\n\n       The first word is the command to be executed, and the remaining words,\n       if any, are arguments to the command.  If a command name is given, the\n       parameter assignments modify the environment of the command when it is\n       executed.  The value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128\n       plus the signal number if terminated by a signal.  For example,\n\n\t      echo foo\n\n       is a simple command with arguments.\n\n       A pipeline is either a simple command, or a sequence of two or more\n       simple commands where each command is separated from the next by `|' or\n       `|&'.  Where commands are separated by `|', the standard output of the\n       first command is connected to the standard input of the next.  `|&' is\n       shorthand for `2>&1 |', which connects both the standard output and the\n       standard error of the command to the standard input of the next.  The\n       value of a pipeline is the value of the last command, unless the\n       pipeline is preceded by `!' in which case the value is the logical\n       inverse of the value of the last command.  For example,"

    Manpage text:

    For use with completion, which would remove an initial backslash
           followed by a character that isn't special, it may be more convenient
           to quote the word by starting with a single quote, i.e. 'foo;
           completion will automatically add the trailing single quote.

       Alias difficulties
           Although aliases can be used in ways that bend normal shell syntax, not
           every string of non-white-space characters can be used as an alias.

           Any set of characters not listed as a word above is not a word, hence
           no attempt is made to expand it as an alias, no matter how it is
           defined (i.e. via the builtin or the special parameter aliases
           described in the section THE ZSH/PARAMETER MODULE in zshmodules(1)).
           However, as noted in the case of POSIX_ALIASES above, the shell does
           not attempt to deduce whether the string corresponds to a word at the
           time the alias is created.

           For example, an expression containing an = at the start of a command
           line is an assignment and cannot be expanded as an alias; a lone = is
           not an assignment but can only be set as an alias using the parameter,
           as otherwise the = is taken part of the syntax of the builtin command.

    REDIRECTIONS WITH NO COMMAND
           When a simple command consists of one or more redirection operators and
           zero or more parameter assignments, but no command name, zsh can behave
           in several ways.

           If the parameter NULLCMD is not set or the option CSH_NULLCMD is set,
           an error is caused.  This is the csh behavior and CSH_NULLCMD is set by
           default when emulating csh.

           If the option SH_NULLCMD is set, the builtin `:' is inserted as a
           command with the given redirections.  This is the default when
           emulating sh or ksh.

           Otherwise, if the parameter NULLCMD is set, its value will be used as a
           command with the given redirections.  If both NULLCMD and READNULLCMD
           are set, then the value of the latter will be used instead of that of
           the former when the redirection is an input.  The default for NULLCMD
           is `cat' and for READNULLCMD is `more'. Thus

    If execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and
           the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script.
           /bin/sh is spawned to execute it.  If the program is a file beginning
           with `#!', the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for
           the program.  The shell will execute the specified interpreter on
           operating systems that do not handle this executable format in the
           kernel.

           If no external command is found but a function
           command_not_found_handler exists the shell executes this function with
           all command line arguments.  The return status of the function becomes
           the status of the command.  Note that the handler is executed in a
           subshell forked to execute an external command, hence changes to
           directories, shell parameters, etc. have no effect on the main shell.

    FUNCTIONS
           Shell functions are defined with the function reserved word or the
           special syntax `funcname ()'.  Shell functions are read in and stored
           internally.  Alias names are resolved when the function is read.
           Functions are executed like commands with the arguments passed as
           positional parameters.  (See the section `Command Execution'.)

           1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process ID was 1234.

           If a job is started with `&|' or `&!', then that job is immediately
           disowned.  After startup, it does not have a place in the job table,
           and is not subject to the job control features described here.

           If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the
           key ^Z (control-Z) which sends a TSTP signal to the current job:  this
           key may be redefined by the susp option of the external stty command.
           The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been
           `suspended', and print another prompt.  You can then manipulate the
           state of this job, putting it in the background with the bg command, or
           run some other commands and then eventually bring the job back into the

    Manpage text:

    A job being run in the background will suspend if it tries to read from
           the terminal.

           Note that if the job running in the foreground is a shell function,
           then suspending it will have the effect of causing the shell to fork.
           This is necessary to separate the function's state from that of the
           parent shell performing the job control, so that the latter can return
           to the command line prompt.  As a result, even if fg is used to
           continue the job the function will no longer be part of the parent
           shell, and any variables set by the function will not be visible in the
           parent shell.  Thus the behaviour is different from the case where the
           function was never suspended.  Zsh is different from many other shells
           in this regard.

           One additional side effect is that use of disown with a job created by
           suspending shell code in this fashion is delayed: the job can only be
           disowned once any process started from the parent shell has terminated.
           At that point, the disowned job disappears silently from the job list.

    The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.  It

           just before it prints a prompt before it informs you.  All such
           notifications are sent directly to the terminal, not to the standard
           output or standard error.

           When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes
           triggers any trap set for CHLD.

           When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or suspended,

    SIGNALS
           The INT and QUIT signals for an invoked command are ignored if the
           command is followed by `&' and the MONITOR option is not active.  The
           shell itself always ignores the QUIT signal.  Otherwise, signals have
           the values inherited by the shell from its parent (but see the TRAPNAL
           special functions in the section `Functions').

           Certain jobs are run asynchronously by the shell other than those
           explicitly put into the background; even in cases where the shell would
           usually wait for such jobs, an explicit exit command or exit due to the
           option ERR_EXIT will cause the shell to exit without waiting.  Examples
           of such asynchronous jobs are process substitution, see the section
           PROCESS SUBSTITUTION in the zshexpn(1) manual page, and the handler
           processes for multios, see the section MULTIOS in the zshmisc(1) manual
           page.

    ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
           The shell can perform integer and floating point arithmetic, either
           using the builtin let, or via a substitution of the form $((...)).  For
           integers, the shell is usually compiled to use 8-byte precision where
           this is available, otherwise precision is 4 bytes.  This can be tested,
           for example, by giving the command `print - $(( 12345678901 ))'; if the
           number appears unchanged, the precision is at least 8 bytes.  Floating
           point arithmetic always uses the `double' type with whatever
           corresponding precision is provided by the compiler and the library.

    Mathematical functions can be called with the syntax `func(args)',
           where the function decides if the args is used as a string or a
           comma-separated list of arithmetic expressions. The shell currently
           defines no mathematical functions by default, but the module
           zsh/mathfunc may be loaded with the zmodload builtin to provide
           standard floating point mathematical functions.

           An expression of the form `##x' where x is any character sequence such
           as `a', `^A', or `\M-\C-x' gives the value of this character and an
           expression of the form `#name' gives the value of the first character
           of the contents of the parameter name.  Character values are according
           to the character set used in the current locale; for multibyte
           character handling the option MULTIBYTE must be set.  Note that this
           form is different from `$#name', a standard parameter substitution
           which gives the length of the parameter name.  `#\' is accepted instead
           of `##', but its use is deprecated.

    Promotion of integer to floating point values is performed where
           necessary.  In addition, if any operator which requires an integer
           (`&', `|', `^', `<<', `>>' and their equivalents with assignment) is
           given a floating point argument, it will be silently rounded towards
           zero except for `~' which rounds down.

           Users should beware that, in common with many other programming
           languages but not software designed for calculation, the evaluation of
           an expression in zsh is taken a term at a time and promotion of
           integers to floating point does not occur in terms only containing
           integers.  A typical result of this is that a division such as 6/8 is
           truncated, in this being rounded towards 0.  The FORCE_FLOAT shell
           option can be used in scripts or functions where floating point
           evaluation is required throughout.

           Scalar variables can hold integer or floating point values at different
           times; there is no memory of the numeric type in this case.
