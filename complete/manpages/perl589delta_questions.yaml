    NAME
           perl589delta - what is new for perl v5.8.9

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.8.8 release and the
           5.8.9 release.

    Notice
           The 5.8.9 release will be the last significant release of the 5.8.x
           series. Any future releases of 5.8.x will likely only be to deal with
           security issues, and platform build failures. Hence you should look to
           migrating to 5.10.x, if you have not started already.  See "Known
           Problems" for more information.

    Incompatible Changes
           A particular construction in the source code of extensions written in
           C++ may need changing. See "Changed Internals" for more details. All
           extensions written in C, most written in C++, and all existing compiled
           extensions are unaffected. This was necessary to improve C++ support.

           Other than this, there are no changes intentionally incompatible with
           5.8.8.  If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

    Core Enhancements
       Unicode Character Database 5.1.0.
           The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has
           been updated to 5.1.0 from 4.1.0. See
           <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#NotableChanges> for the
           notable changes.

    Manpage text:

    stat and -X on directory handles
           It is now possible to call "stat" and the "-X" filestat operators on
           directory handles. As both directory and file handles are barewords,
           there can be ambiguities over which was intended. In these situations
           the file handle semantics are preferred. Both also treat *FILE{IO}
           filehandles like *FILE filehandles.

       Source filters in @INC
           It's possible to enhance the mechanism of subroutine hooks in @INC by
           adding a source filter on top of the filehandle opened and returned by
           the hook. This feature was planned a long time ago, but wasn't quite
           working until now. See "require" in perlfunc for details. (Nicholas
           Clark)

       Exceptions in constant folding
           The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception handler,
           and if folding throws an exception (such as attempting to evaluate
           0/0), perl now retains the current optree, rather than aborting the
           whole program.  Without this change, programs would not compile if they
           had expressions that happened to generate exceptions, even though those
           expressions were in code that could never be reached at runtime.

Several bugs have been\n       located and eliminated, and the code now makes better use of the\n       information it has, so should be faster. In particular, it doesn't scan\n       to the end of a string before calculating an offset within the string,\n       which should speed up some operations on long strings. It is now\n       possible to disable the caching code at run time, to verify that it is\n       not the cause of suspected problems.\n\n   Runtime relocatable installations\n       There is now Configure support for creating a perl tree that is\n       relocatable at run time. see \"Relocatable installations\".\n\n   New internal variables\n       \"${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}\"\n\t   This variable gives the native status returned by the last pipe\n\t   close, backtick command, successful call to \"wait\" or \"waitpid\", or\n\t   from the \"system\" operator.

You can use these macros\n       if you call code that may \"croak\", but you need to do some cleanup\n       before giving control back to Perl.

    •   "-Dv" displays the process id as part of the trace output.

       XS-assisted SWASHGET
           Some pure-perl code that the regexp engine was using to retrieve
           Unicode properties and transliteration mappings has been reimplemented
           in XS for faster execution.  (SADAHIRO Tomoyuki)

       Constant subroutines
           The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient form
           of inlineable constants. Storing a reference to a constant value in a
           symbol table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a constant
           subroutine, but using about 400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant
           subroutine is automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine
           if necessary.  The approach taken is analogous to the existing space
           optimisation for subroutine stub declarations, which are stored as
           plain scalars in place of the full typeglob.

           However, to aid backwards compatibility of existing code, which
           (wrongly) does not expect anything other than typeglobs in symbol
           tables, nothing in core uses this feature, other than the regression
           tests.

    •   Improvements to the perl-static.exe build process.

           •   Add Win32 makefile option to link all extensions statically.

           •   The WinCE directory has been merged into the Win32 directory.

           •   "setlocale" tests have been re-enabled for Windows XP onwards.

    Selected Bug Fixes
       Unicode
           Many many bugs related to the internal Unicode implementation (UTF-8)
           have been fixed. In particular, long standing bugs related to returning
           Unicode via "tie", overloading or $@ are now gone, some of which were
           never reported.

           "unpack" will internally convert the string back from UTF-8 on numeric
           types.  This is a compromise between the full consistency now in 5.10,
           and the current behaviour, which is often used as a "feature" on string
           types.

           Using ":crlf" and "UTF-16" IO layers together will now work.

           Fixed problems with "split", Unicode "/\s+/" and "/ \0/".

           Fixed bug RT #40641 - encoding of Unicode characters in regular
           expressions.

    A new entry has been added to the MAGIC vtable - "svt_local". This is
           used when copying magic to the new value during "local", allowing
           certain problems with localising shared variables to be resolved.

           For the implementation details, see "Magic Virtual Tables" in perlguts.

       Reblessing overloaded objects now works
           Internally, perl object-ness is on the referent, not the reference,
           even though methods can only be called via a reference. However, the
           original implementation of overloading stored flags related to
           overloading on the reference, relying on the flags being copied when
           the reference was copied, or set at the creation of a new reference.
           This manifests in a bug - if you rebless an object from a class that
           has overloading, into one that does not, then any other existing
           references think that they (still) point to an overloaded object,
           choose these C code paths, and then throw errors.  Analogously,
           blessing into an overloaded class when other references exist will
           result in them not using overloading.

    The implementation has been fixed for 5.10, but this fix changes the
           semantics of flag bits, so is not binary compatible, so can't be
           applied to 5.8.9.  However, 5.8.9 has a work-around that implements the
           same bug fix. If the referent has multiple references, then all the
           other references are located and corrected. A full search is avoided
           whenever possible by scanning lexicals outwards from the current
           subroutine, and the argument stack.

           A certain well known Linux vendor applied incomplete versions of this
           bug fix to their /usr/bin/perl and then prematurely closed bug reports
           about performance issues without consulting back upstream. This not
           being enough, they then proceeded to ignore the necessary fixes to
           these unreleased changes for 11 months, until massive pressure was
           applied by their long-suffering paying customers, catalysed by the
           failings being featured on a prominent blog and Slashdot.

    There have been many small cleanups made to the internals. In

           initialise the new body, rather than assignment via multiple temporary
           variables. It has also benefited from simplification and de-duplication
           of the arena management code.

           A lot of small improvements in the code base were made due to reports

           "PERLSYS_TERM" no longer requires a context. "PerlIO_teardown()" is now
           called without a context, and debugging output in this function has
           been disabled because that required that an interpreter was present, an
           invalid assumption at termination time.

    Manpage text:

    All compile time options which affect binary compatibility have been
           grouped together into a global variable ("PL_bincompat_options").

           The values of "PERL_REVISION", "PERL_VERSION" and "PERL_SUBVERSION" are
           now baked into global variables (and hence into any shared perl
           library).  Additionally under "MULTIPLICITY", the perl executable now
           records the size of the interpreter structure (total, and for this
           version). Coupled with "PL_bincompat_options" this will allow 5.8.10
           (and later), when compiled with a shared perl library, to perform
           sanity checks in "main()" to verify that the shared library is indeed
           binary compatible.

           Symbolic references can now have embedded NULs. The new public function
           "Perl_get_cvn_flags()" can be used in extensions if you have to handle
           them.

       Macro cleanups
           The core code, and XS code in ext that is not dual-lived on CPAN, no
           longer uses the macros "PL_na", "NEWSV()", "Null()", "Nullav",
           "Nullcv", "Nullhv", "Nullhv" etc. Their use is discouraged in new code,
           particularly "PL_na", which is a small performance hit.

    Known Problems
           There are no known new bugs.

           However, programs that rely on bugs that have been fixed will have
           problems.  Also, many bug fixes present in 5.10.0 can't be back-ported
           to the 5.8.x branch, because they require changes that are binary
           incompatible, or because the code changes are too large and hence too
           risky to incorporate.

           We have only limited volunteer labour, and the maintenance burden is
           getting increasingly complex. Hence this will be the last significant
           release of the 5.8.x series. Any future releases of 5.8.x will likely
           only be to deal with security issues, and platform build failures.
           Hence you should look to migrating to 5.10.x, if you have not started
           already. Alternatively, if business requirements constrain you to
           continue to use 5.8.x, you may wish to consider commercial support from
           firms such as ActiveState.

    Platform Specific Notes
       Win32
           "readdir()", "cwd()", $^X and @INC now use the alternate (short)
           filename if the long name is outside the current codepage (Jan Dubois).

    Acknowledgements
           Some of the work in this release was funded by a TPF grant.

           Steve Hay worked behind the scenes working out the causes of the
           differences between core modules, their CPAN releases, and previous
           core releases, and the best way to rectify them. He doesn't want to do
           it again. I know this feeling, and I'm very glad he did it this time,
           instead of me.

           Paul Fenwick assembled a team of 18 volunteers, who broke the back of
           writing this document. In particular, Bradley Dean, Eddy Tan, and
           Vincent Pit provided half the team's contribution.

           Schwern verified the list of updated module versions, correcting quite
           a few errors that I (and everyone else) had missed, both wrongly stated
           module versions, and changed modules that had not been listed.

           The crack Berlin-based QA team of Andreas Koenig and Slaven Rezic
           tirelessly re-built snapshots, tested most everything CPAN against
           them, and then identified the changes responsible for any module
           regressions, ensuring that several show-stopper bugs were stomped
           before the first release candidate was cut.

    The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and applied
           most of the patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed in
           AUTHORS.

           And obviously, Larry Wall, without whom we wouldn't have Perl.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
           recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
           database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be information at
           http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
           http://bugs.perl.org/

           If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
           inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
           send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
           subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
           committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,
           figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
           mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
           supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl
           core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
