Stooop only\n       introduces a few new commands: class, new, delete, virtual and classof.\n       Along with a few coding conventions, that is basically all you need to\n       know to use stooop. Stooop is meant to be as simple to use as possible.\n\n       This manual is very succinct and is to be used as a quick reminder for\n       the programmer, who should have read the thorough stooop_man.html HTML\n       documentation at this point.\n\n       ::stooop::class name body\n\t      This command creates a class. The body, similar in contents to a\n\t      Tcl namespace (which a class actually also is), contains member\n\t      procedure definitions. Member procedures can also be defined\n\t      outside the class body, by prefixing their name with class::, as\n\t      you would proceed with namespace procedures.\n\n\t      proc class {this ?arg arg ...?} ?base {?arg arg ...?} ...? body\n\t\t     This is the constructor procedure for the class. It is\n\t\t     invoked following a new invocation on the class. It must\n\t\t     have the same name as the class and a first argument\n\t\t     named this. Any number of base classes specifications,\n\t\t     including arguments to be passed to their constructor,\n\t\t     are allowed before the actual body of the procedure.\n\n\t      proc ~class {this} body\n\t\t     This is the destructor procedure for the class. It is\n\t\t     invoked following a delete invocation. Its name must be\n\t\t     the concatenation of a single ~ character followed by the\n\t\t     class name (as in C++). It must have a single argument\n\t\t     named this.\n\n\t      proc name {this ?arg arg ...?} body\n\t\t     This is a member procedure of the class, as its first\n\t\t     argument is named this. It allows a simple access of\n\t\t     member data for the object referenced by this inside the\n\t\t     procedure. For example:\n\n\t\t\tset ($this,data) 0"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the stooop package in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you define a class in stooop called 'MyClass' with a constructor that takes an argument 'value'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the stooop::delete command to remove an instance of a class called 'MyClass'?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `stooop`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nproc name {?arg arg ...?} body\n\t\t     This is a static (as in C++) member procedure of the\n\t\t     class, as its first argument is not named this. Static\n\t\t     (global) class data can be accessed as in:\n\n\t\t\tset (data) 0\n\n\n\t      proc class {this copy} body\n\t\t     This is the optional copy procedure for the class. It\n\t\t     must have the same name as the class and exactly 2\n\t\t     arguments named this and copy. It is invoked following a\n\t\t     new invocation on an existing object of the class.\n\n       ::stooop::new class ?arg arg ...?\n\t      This command is used to create an object. The first argument is\n\t      the class name and is followed by the arguments needed by the\n\t      corresponding class constructor. A unique identifier for the\n\t      object just created is returned.\n\n       ::stooop::delete object ?object ...?\n\t      This command is used to delete one or several objects. It takes\n\t      one or more object identifiers as argument(s).\n\n       ::stooop::virtual proc name {this ?arg arg ...?} ?body?\n\t      The virtual specifier may be used on member procedures to\n\t      achieve dynamic binding. A procedure in a base class can then be\n\t      redefined (overloaded) in the derived class(es). If the base\n\t      class procedure is invoked on an object, it is actually the\n\t      derived class procedure which is invoked, if it exists. If the\n\t      base class procedure has no body, then it is considered to be a\n\t      pure virtual and the derived class procedure is always invoked.\n\n       ::stooop::classof object\n\t      This command returns the class of the existing object passed as\n\t      single parameter.\n\n       ::stooop::new object\n\t      This command is used to create an object by copying an existing\n\t      object. The copy constructor of the corresponding class is\n\t      invoked if it exists, otherwise a simple copy of the copied\n\t      object data members is performed.\n\nDEBUGGING\n       Environment variables\n\n\t      STOOOPCHECKDATA\n\t\t     Setting this variable to any true value will cause stooop\n\t\t     to check for invalid member or class data access.\n\n\t      STOOOPCHECKPROCEDURES\n\t\t     Setting this variable to any true value will cause stooop\n\t\t     to check for invalid member procedure arguments and pure\n\t\t     interface classes instanciation.\n\n\t      STOOOPCHECKALL\n\t\t     Setting this variable to any true value will cause stooop\n\t\t     to activate both procedure and data member checking.\n\n\t      STOOOPCHECKOBJECTS\n\t\t     Setting this variable to any true value will cause stooop\n\t\t     to activate object checking. The following stooop\n\t\t     namespace procedures then become available for debugging:\n\t\t     printObjects, record and report.\n\n\t      STOOOPTRACEPROCEDURES\n\t\t     Setting this environment variable to either stdout,\n\t\t     stderr or a file name, activates procedure tracing. The\n\t\t     stooop library will then output to the specified channel\n\t\t     1 line of informational text for each member procedure\n\t\t     invocation.\n\n\t      STOOOPTRACEPROCEDURESFORMAT\n\t\t     Defines the trace procedures output format. Defaults to\n\t\t     \"class: %C, procedure: %p, object: %O, arguments: %a\".\n\n\t      STOOOPTRACEDATA\n\t\t     Setting this environment variable to either stdout,\n\t\t     stderr or a file name, activates data tracing. The stooop\n\t\t     library will then output to the specified channel 1 line\n\t\t     of informational text for each member data access.\n\n\t      STOOOPTRACEDATAFORMAT\n\t\t     Defines the trace data output format. Defaults to \"class:\n\t\t     %C, procedure: %p, array: %A, object: %O, member: %m,\n\t\t     operation: %o, value: %v\".\n\n\t      STOOOPTRACEDATAOPERATIONS\n\t\t     When tracing data output, by default, all read, write and\n\t\t     unsetting accesses are reported, but the user can set\n\t\t     this variable to any combination of the letters r, w, and\n\t\t     u for more specific tracing (please refer to the trace\n\t\t     Tcl manual page for more information).\n\n\t      STOOOPTRACEALL\n\t\t     Setting this environment variable to either stdout,\n\t\t     stderr or a file name, enables both procedure and data\n\t\t     tracing.\n\n       ::stooop::printObjects ?pattern?\n\t      Prints an ordered list of existing objects, in creation order,\n\t      oldest first. Each output line contains the class name, object\n\t      identifier and the procedure within which the creation occurred.\n\t      The optional pattern argument (as in the Tcl string match\n\t      command) can be used to limit the output to matching class\n\t      names.\n\n       ::stooop::record\n\t      When invoked, a snapshot of all existing stooop objects is\n\t      taken. Reporting can then be used at a later time to see which\n\t      objects were created or deleted in the interval.\n\n       ::stooop::report ?pattern?\n\t      Prints the created and deleted objects since the\n\t      ::stooop::record procedure was invoked last. If present, the\n\t      pattern argument limits the output to matching class names.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Please see the full HTML documentation in stooop_man.html.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
