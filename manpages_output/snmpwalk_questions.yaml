This OID\n       specifies which portion of the object identifier space will be searched\n       using GETNEXT requests.\tAll variables in the subtree below the given\n       OID are queried and their values presented to the user.\tEach variable\n       name is given in the format specified in variables(5).\n\n       If no OID argument is present, snmpwalk will search the subtree rooted\n       at SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2 (including any MIB object values from other MIB\n       modules, that are defined as lying within this subtree).  If the\n       network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error\n       packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to\n       pinpoint why the request was malformed."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snmpwalk`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the end of the MIB,\n       the message \"End of MIB\" will be displayed.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -Cc     Do not check whether the returned OIDs are increasing.  Some\n\t       agents (LaserJets are an example) return OIDs out of order, but\n\t       can complete the walk anyway.  Other agents return OIDs that\n\t       are out of order and can cause snmpwalk to loop indefinitely.\n\t       By default, snmpwalk tries to detect this behavior and warns\n\t       you when it hits an agent acting illegally.  Use -Cc to turn\n\t       off this check.\n\n       -CE {OID}\n\t       End the walk at the specified OID, rather than a simple\n\t       subtree.  This can be used to walk a partial subtree, selected\n\t       columns of a table, or even two or more tables within a single\n\t       command.\n\n       -Ci     Include the given OID in the search range.  Normally snmpwalk\n\t       uses GETNEXT requests starting with the OID you specified and\n\t       returns all results in the MIB subtree rooted at that OID.\n\t       Sometimes, you may wish to include the OID specified on the\n\t       command line in the printed results if it is a valid OID in the\n\t       tree itself.  This option lets you do this explicitly."

This allows a\n\t       walk of a single instance to behave as generally expected, and\n\t       return the specified instance value.
