The ldapx package is built upon the ldap package in\n       order to get low level LDAP access.\n\n       LDAP access is compatible with RFC 2251 (http://www.rfc-\n       editor.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt).  LDIF access is compatible with RFC 2849\n       (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt).\n\nOVERVIEW\n       The ldapx package provides objects to interact with LDAP directories\n       and LDIF files with an easy to use programming interface.  It\n       implements three snit::type classes.\n\n       The first class, entry, is used to store individual entries.  Two\n       different formats are available: the first one is the standard format,\n       which represents an entry as read from the directory. The second format\n       is the change format, which stores differences between two standard\n       entries.\n\n       With these entries, an application which wants to modify an entry in a\n       directory needs to read a (standard) entry from the directory, create a\n       fresh copy into a new (standard) entry, modify the new copy, and then\n       compute the differences between the two entries into a new (change)\n       entry, which may be commited to the directory.\n\n       Such kinds of modifications are so heavily used that standard entries\n       may contain their own copy of the original data. With such a copy, the\n       application described above reads a (standard) entry from the\n       directory, backs-up the original data, modifies the entry, and computes\n       the differences between the entry and its backup. These differences are\n       then commited to the directory.\n\n       Methods are provided to compute differences between two entries, to\n       apply differences to an entry in order to get a new entry, and to get\n       or set attributes in standard entries.\n\n       The second class is the ldap class. It provides a method to connect and\n       bind to the directory with a uniform access to LDAP and LDAPS through\n       an URL (ldap:// or ldaps://). The traverse control structure executes a\n       body for each entry found in the directory. The commit method applies\n       some changes (represented as entry objects) to the directory.  Since\n       some attributes are represented as UTF-8 strings, the option -utf8\n       controls which attributes must be converted and which attributes must\n       not be converted.\n\n       The last class is the ldif class. It provides a method to associate a\n       standard Tcl channel to an LDIF object. Then, methods read and write\n       read or write entries from or to this channel. This class can make use\n       of standard or change entries, according to the type of the LDIF file\n       which may contain either standard entries or change entries (but not\n       both at the same time). The option -utf8 works exactly as with the ldap\n       class.\n\nENTRY CLASS\n   ENTRY INSTANCE DATA\n       An instance of the entry class keeps the following data:\n\n       dn     This is the DN of the entry, which includes (in LDAP\n\t      terminology) the RDN (relative DN) and the Superior parts.\n\n       format The format may be uninitialized (entry not yet used), standard\n\t      or change. Most methods check the format of the entry, which can\n\t      be reset with the reset method.\n\n       attrvals\n\t      In a standard entry, this is where the attributes and associated\n\t      values are stored. Many methods provide access to these\n\t      informations. Attribute names are always converted into lower\n\t      case.\n\n       backup In a standard entry, the backup may contain a copy of the dn and\n\t      all attributes and values. Methods backup and restore manipulate\n\t      these data, and method diff may use this backup.\n\n       change In a change entry, these data represent the modifications. Such\n\t      modifications are handled by specialized methods such as apply\n\t      or commit.  Detailed format should not be used directly by\n\t      programs.\n\n\t      Internally, modifications are represented as a list of elements,\n\t      each element has one of the following formats (which match the\n\t      corresponding LDAP operations):\n\n\t      [1]    {add {attr1 {val1...valn} attr2 {...} ...}}\n\n\t\t     Addition of a new entry.\n\n\t      [2]    {mod {modop {attr1 ?val1...valn?} attr2 ...} {modop ...}\n\t\t     ...}\n\n\t\t     Modification of one or more attributes and/or values,\n\t\t     where <modop> can be modadd, moddel or modrepl (see the\n\t\t     LDAP modify operation).\n\n\t      [3]    {del}\n\n\t\t     Deletion of an old entry.\n\n\t      [4]    {modrdn newrdn deleteoldrdn ?newsuperior?}\n\n\t\t     Renaming of an entry.\n\n   ENTRY OPTIONS\n       No option is defined by this class.\n\n   METHODS FOR ALL KINDS OF ENTRIES\n       e reset\n\t      This method resets the entry to an uninitialized state.\n\n       e dn ?newdn?\n\t      This method returns the current DN of the entry. If the optional\n\t      newdn is specified, it replaces the current DN of the entry.\n\n       e rdn  This method returns the RDN part of the DN of the entry.\n\n       e superior\n\t      This method returns the superior part of the DN of the entry.\n\n       e print\n\t      This method returns the entry as a string ready to be printed.\n\n   METHODS FOR STANDARD ENTRIES ONLY\n       In all methods, attribute names are converted in lower case.\n\n       se isempty\n\t      This method returns 1 if the entry is empty (i.e. without any\n\t      attribute).\n\n       se get attr\n\t      This method returns all values of the attribute attr, or the\n\t      empty list if the attribute is not fond.\n\n       se get1 attr\n\t      This method returns the first value of the attribute.\n\n       se set attr values\n\t      This method sets the values (list values) of the attribute attr.\n\t      If the list is empty, this method deletes all\n\n       se set1 attr value\n\t      This method sets the values of the attribute attr to be an\n\t      unique value value. Previous values, if any, are replaced by the\n\t      new value.\n\n       se add attr values\n\t      This method adds all elements the list values to the values of\n\t      the attribute attr.\n\n       se add1 attr value\n\t      This method adds a single value given by the parameter value to\n\t      the attribute attr.\n\n       se del attr ?values?\n\t      If the optional list values is specified, this method deletes\n\t      all specified values from the attribute attr.  If the argument\n\t      values is not specified, this method deletes all values.\n\n       se del1 attr value\n\t      This method deletes a unique value from the attribute attr.\n\n       se getattr\n\t      This method returns all attributes names.\n\n       se getall\n\t      This method returns all attributes and values from the entry,\n\t      packed in a list of pairs <attribute, list of values>.\n\n       se setall avpairs\n\t      This method sets at once all attributes and values. The format\n\t      of the avpairs argument is the same as the one returned by\n\t      method getall.\n\n       se backup ?other?\n\t      This method stores in an other standard entry object a copy of\n\t      the current DN and attributes/values. If the optional other\n\t      argument is not specified, copy is done in the current entry (in\n\t      a specific place, see section OVERVIEW).\n\n       se swap\n\t      This method swaps the current and backup contexts of the entry.\n\n       se restore ?other?\n\t      If the optional argument other is given, which must then be a\n\t      standard entry, this method restores the current entry into the\n\t      other entry. If the argument other argument is not specified,\n\t      this methods restores the current entry from its internal backup\n\t      (see section OVERVIEW).\n\n       se apply centry\n\t      This method applies changes defined in the centry argument,\n\t      which must be a change entry.\n\n   METHODS FOR CHANGE ENTRIES ONLY\n       ce change ?new?\n\t      If the optional argument new is specified, this method modifies\n\t      the change list (see subsection Entry Instance Data for the\n\t      exact format). In both cases, current change list is returned.\n\t      Warning: values returned by this method should only be used by\n\t      specialized methods such as apply or commit.\n\n       ce diff new ?old?\n\t      This method computes the differences between the new and old\n\t      entries under the form of a change list, and stores this list\n\t      into the current change entry. If the optional argument old is\n\t      not specified, difference is computed from the entry and its\n\t      internal backup (see section OVERVIEW). Return value is the\n\t      computed change list.\n\n   ENTRY EXAMPLE\n\n\t   package require ldapx\n\n\t   #\n\t   # Create an entry and fill it as a standard entry with\n\t   # attributes and values\n\t   #\n\t   ::ldapx::entry create e\n\t   e dn \"uid=joe,ou=people,o=mycomp\"\n\t   e set1 \"uid\" \t    \"joe\"\n\t   e set  \"objectClass\"     {person anotherObjectClass}\n\t   e set1 \"givenName\"\t    \"Joe\"\n\t   e set1 \"sn\"\t\t    \"User\"\n\t   e set  \"telephoneNumber\" {+31415926535 +2182818}\n\t   e set1 \"anotherAttr\"     \"This is a beautiful day, isn't it?\"\n\n\t   puts stdout \"e\\n[e print]\"\n\n\t   #\n\t   # Create a second entry as a backup of the first, and\n\t   # make some changes on it.\n\t   # Entry is named automatically by snit.\n\t   #\n\n\t   set b [::ldapx::entry create %AUTO%]\n\t   e backup $b\n\n\t   puts stdout \"$b\\n[$b print]\"\n\n\t   $b del  \"anotherAttr\"\n\t   $b del1 \"objectClass\" \"anotherObjectClass\"\n\n\t   #\n\t   # Create a change entry, a compute differences between first\n\t   # and second entry.\n\t   #\n\n\t   ::ldapx::entry create c\n\t   c diff e $b\n\n\t   puts stdout \"$c\\n[$c print]\"\n\n\t   #\n\t   # Apply changes to first entry.

The error method may be used to fetch this\n\t      message.\n\n   LDAP OPTIONS\n       A first set of options of the ldap class is used during search\n       operations (methods traverse, search and read, see below).\n\n       -scope base|one|sub\n\t      Specify the scope of the LDAP search to be one of base, one or\n\t      sub to specify a base object, one-level or subtree search.\n\n\t      The default is sub.\n\n       -derefaliases never|seach|find|always\n\t      Specify how aliases dereferencing is handled: never is used to\n\t      specify that aliases are never derefenced, always that aliases\n\t      are always derefenced, search that aliases are dereferenced when\n\t      searching, or find that aliases are dereferenced only  when\n\t      locating\tthe  base object for the search.\n\n\t      The default is never.\n\n       -sizelimit integer\n\t      Specify the maximum number of entries to be retreived during a\n\t      search. A value of 0 means no limit.\n\n\t      Default is 0.\n\n       -timelimit integer\n\t      Specify the time limit for a search to complete.\tA value of 0\n\t      means no limit.\n\n\t      Default is 0.\n\n       -attrsonly 0|1\n\t      Specify if only attribute names are to be retrieved (value 1).\n\t      Normally (value 0), attribute values are also retrieved.\n\n\t      Default is 0.\n\n       The last option is used when getting entries or committing changes in\n       the directory:\n\n       -utf8 pattern-yes pattern-no\n\t      Specify which attribute values are encoded in UTF-8. This\n\t      information is specific to the LDAP schema in use by the\n\t      application, since some attributes such as jpegPhoto, for\n\t      example, are not encoded in UTF-8. This option takes the form of\n\t      a list with two regular expressions suitable for the regexp\n\t      command (anchored by ^ and $).  The first specifies which\n\t      attribute names are to be UTF-8 encoded, and the second selects,\n\t      among those, the attribute names which will not be UTF-8\n\t      encoded.\tIt is thus possible to say: convert all attributes,\n\t      except jpegPhoto.\n\n\t      Default is {{.*} {}}, meaning: all attributes are converted,\n\t      without exception.\n\n   LDAP METHODS\n       la error ?newmsg?\n\t      This method returns the error message that occurred in the last\n\t      call to a ldap class method. If the optional argument newmsg is\n\t      supplied, it becomes the last error message.\n\n       la connect url ?binddn? ?bindpw?\n\t      This method connects to the LDAP server using given URL (which\n\t      can be of the form ldap://host:port or ldaps://host:port). If an\n\t      optional binddn argument is given together with the bindpw\n\t      argument, the connect binds to the LDAP server using the\n\t      specified DN and password.\n\n       la disconnect\n\t      This method disconnects (and unbinds, if necessary) from the\n\t      LDAP server.\n\n       la traverse base filter attrs entry body\n\t      This method is a new control structure. It searches the LDAP\n\t      directory from the specified base DN (given by the base\n\t      argument) and selects entries based on the argument filter. For\n\t      each entry found, this method fetches attributes specified by\n\t      the attrs argument (or all attributes if it is an empty list),\n\t      stores them in the entry instance of class entry and executes\n\t      the script defined by the argument body. Options are used to\n\t      refine the search.\n\n\t      Caution: when this method is used, the script body cannot\n\t      perform another LDAP search (methods traverse, search or read).\n\n       la search base filter attrs\n\t      This method searches the directory using the same way as method\n\t      traverse. All found entries are stored in newly created\n\t      instances of class entry, which are returned in a list. The\n\t      newly created instances should be destroyed when they are no\n\t      longer used.\n\n       la read base filter entry ... entry\n\t      This method reads one or more entries, using the same search\n\t      criteria as methods traverse and search.\tAll attributes are\n\t      stored in the entries. This method provides a quick way to read\n\t      some entries. It returns the number of entries found in the\n\t      directory (which may be more than the number of read entries).\n\t      If called without any entry argument, this method just returns\n\t      the number of entries found, without returning any data.\n\n       la commit entry ... entry\n\t      This method commits the changes stored in the entry arguments.\n\t      Each entry may be either a change entry, or a standard entry\n\t      with a backup.\n\n\t      Note: in the future, this method should use the LDAP transaction\n\t      extension provided by OpenLDAP 2.3 and later.\n\n   LDAP EXAMPLE\n\n\t   package require ldapx\n\n\t   #\n\t   # Connects to the LDAP directory\n\t   #\n\n\t   ::ldapx::ldap create l\n\t   set url \"ldap://server.mycomp.com\"\n\t   if {!
