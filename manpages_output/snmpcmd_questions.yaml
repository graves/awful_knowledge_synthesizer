The command line applications use the SNMP\n       protocol to communicate with an SNMP capable network entity, an agent.\n       Individual applications typically (but not necessarily) take additional\n       parameters that are given after the agent specification.  These\n       parameters are documented in the manual pages for each application.\n\nCOMMAND-LINE CONFIG OPTIONS\n       In addition to the options described in this manual page, all of the\n       tokens described in the snmp.conf and other .conf manual pages can be\n       used on the command line of Net-SNMP applications as well by prefixing\n       them with \"--\".\tEG, specifying --dontLoadHostConfig=true on the\n       command line will turn of loading of the host specific configuration\n       files.\n\n       The snmp.conf file settings and the double-dash arguments over-ride the\n       single-dash arguments.  So it's important to note that if single-dash\n       arguments aren't working because you have settings in the snmp.conf\n       file that conflict with them then you'll need to use the longer-form\n       double-dash arguments to successfully trump the snmp.conf file\n       settings.\n\nGeneric Options\n       Thes options control how the Net-SNMP commands behave regardless of\n       what version of SNMP you are using.  See further below for options that\n       control specific versions or sub-modules of the SNMP protocol.\n\n       -d     Dump (in hexadecimal) the raw SNMP packets sent and received.\n\n       -D[TOKEN[,...]]\n\t      Turn on debugging output for the given TOKEN(s).\tTry ALL for\n\t      extremely verbose output.\n\n       -h, --help\n\t      Display a brief usage message and then exit.\n\n       -H     Display a list of configuration file directives understood by\n\t      the command and then exit.\n\n       -I [brRhu]\n\t      Specifies input parsing options. See INPUT OPTIONS below.\n\n       -L [eEfFoOsS]\n\t      Specifies output logging options. See LOGGING OPTIONS below.\n\n       -m MIBLIST\n\t      Specifies a colon separated list of MIB modules (not files) to\n\t      load for this application.  This overrides (or augments) the\n\t      environment variable MIBS, the snmp.conf directive mibs, and the\n\t      list of MIBs hardcoded into the Net-SNMP library.\n\n\t      If MIBLIST has a leading '-' or '+' character, then the MIB\n\t      modules listed are loaded in addition to the default list,\n\t      coming before or after this list respectively.  Otherwise, the\n\t      specified MIBs are loaded instead of this default list.\n\n\t      The special keyword ALL is used to load all MIB modules in the\n\t      MIB directory search list.  Every file whose name does not begin\n\t      with \".\" will be parsed as if it were a MIB file.\n\n       -M DIRLIST\n\t      Specifies a colon separated list of directories to search for\n\t      MIBs.  This overrides (or augments) the environment variable\n\t      MIBDIRS, the snmp.conf directive mibdirs, and the default\n\t      directory hardcoded into the Net-SNMP library\n\t      (/usr/share/snmp/mibs).\n\n\t      If DIRLIST has a leading '-' or '+' character, then the given\n\t      directories are added to the default list, being searched before\n\t      or after the directories on this list respectively.  Otherwise,\n\t      the specified directories are searched instead of this default\n\t      list.\n\n\t      Note that the directories appearing later in the list have have\n\t      precedence over earlier ones.  To avoid searching any MIB\n\t      directories, set the MIBDIRS environment variable to the empty\n\t      string (\"\").\n\n\t      Note that MIBs specified using the -m option or the mibs\n\t      configuration directive will be loaded from one of the\n\t      directories listed by the -M option (or equivalents).  The\n\t      mibfile directive takes a full path to the specified MIB file,\n\t      so this does not need to be in the MIB directory search list.\n\n       -v 1 | 2c | 3\n\t      Specifies the protocol version to use: 1 (RFCs 1155-1157), 2c\n\t      (RFCs 1901-1908), or 3 (RFCs 2571-2574).\tThe default is\n\t      typically version 3.  Overrides the defVersion token in the\n\t      snmp.conf file.  -O [abeEfnqQsStTuUvxX] Specifies output\n\t      printing options. See OUTPUT OPTIONS below.\n\n       -P [cdeRuwW]\n\t      Specifies MIB parsing options.  See MIB PARSING OPTIONS below.\n\n       -r retries\n\t      Specifies the number of retries to be used in the requests. The\n\t      default is 5.\n\n       -t timeout\n\t      Specifies the timeout in seconds between retries. The default is\n\t      1.  Floating point numbers can be used to specify fractions of\n\t      seconds.\n\n       -V, --version\n\t      Display version information for the application and then exit.\n\n       -Yname=\"value\"\n\n       --name=\"value\"\n\t      Allows to specify any token (\"name\") supported in the snmp.conf\n\t      file and sets its value to \"value\". Overrides the corresponding\n\t      token in the snmp.conf file. See snmp.conf(5) for the full list\n\t      of tokens."

Appropriate pass phrase(s)\n\t      must provided when using any level higher than noAuthNoPriv.\n\t      Overrides the defSecurityLevel token in the snmp.conf file.\n\n       -n contextName\n\t      Set the contextName used for SNMPv3 messages.  The default\n\t      contextName is the empty string \"\".  Overrides the defContext\n\t      token in the snmp.conf file.\n\n\nSNMPv3 over TLS Options\n       These options pass transport-specific parameters to the TLS layer.  If\n       you're using SNMP over TLS or DTLS you'll need to pass a combination of\n       these either through these command line options or through snmp.conf\n       configuration tokens.\n\n       A note about <certificate-specifier>s : Net-SNMP looks for X.509\n       certificates in each of the normal SNMP configuration directory search\n       paths under a \"tls\" subdirectory.  IE, it will look in ~/.snmp/tls and\n       in /usr/local/share/snmp/tls for certificates.  The certificate\n       components (eg, the public and private halves) are stored in sub-\n       directories underneath this root set of directories.  See the net-snmp-\n       cert tool for help in importing, creating and managing Net-SNMP\n       certificates.  <certificate-specifier>s can reference either a\n       fingerprint of the certificate to use (the net-snmp-cert tool can help\n       you figure out the certificates) or the filename's prefix can be used.\n       For example, if you had a \"snmpd.crt\" certificate file then you could\n       simply refer to the certificate via the \"snmpd\" specifier.\n\n       -T our_identity=<certificate-specifier>\n\t      Indicates to the transport which key should be used to initiate\n\t      (D)TLS client connections.  This would typically be a\n\t      certificate found using the application name (eg snmpd,\n\t      snmptrapd, perl, python) or genericized name \"snmpapp\" if using\n\t      one of the generic applications (snmpget, snmpwalk, etc).  This\n\t      can also be set using the clientCert specifier in a snmp.conf\n\t      configuration file.\n\n       -T their_identity=<certificate-specifier>\n\t      If you expect a particular certificate to be presented by the\n\t      other side then you can use this specifier to indicate the\n\t      certificate it should present.  If it fails to present the\n\t      expected certificate the client will refuse to open the\n\t      connection (because doing otherwise could lead to man-in-the-\n\t      middle attacks).\tThis can also be set using the serverCert\n\t      specifier in a snmp.conf configuration file.\n\n       -T trust_cert=<certificate-specifier>\n\t      If you have a trusted CA certificate you wish to anchor trust\n\t      with, you can use this flag to load a given certificate as a\n\t      trust anchor.  A copy of the certificate must exist within the\n\t      Net-SNMP certificate storage system or this must point to a\n\t      complete path name.  Also see the \"trustCert\" snmp.conf\n\t      configuration token.\n\n       -T their_hostname=<name>\n\t      If the server's presented certificate can be validating using a\n\t      trust anchor then their hostname will be checked to ensure their\n\t      presented hostname matches one that is expected (you don't want\n\t      to connect to goodhost.example.com and accept a certificate\n\t      presented by badhost.example.com do you?).  This token can\n\t      specify the exact host name expected to be presented by the\n\t      remote side, either in a subjectAltName field or in the\n\t      CommonName field of the server's X.509 certificate.\n\nSNMPv3 with USM Options\n       These options are specific to using SNMPv3 with the original User-based\n       Security Model (USM).\n\n       -3[MmKk]  0xHEXKEY\n\t      Sets the keys to be used for SNMPv3 transactions.  These options\n\t      allow you to set the master authentication and encryption keys\n\t      (-3m and -3M respectively) or set the localized authentication\n\t      and encryption keys (-3k and -3K respectively).  SNMPv3 keys can\n\t      be either passed in by hand using these flags, or by the use of\n\t      keys generated from passwords using the -A and -X flags\n\t      discussed below.\tFor further details on SNMPv3 and its usage of\n\t      keying information, see the Net-SNMP tutorial web site (\n\t      http://www.Net-SNMP.org/tutorial-5/commands/ ).  Overrides the\n\t      defAuthMasterKey (-3m), defPrivMasterKey (-3M),\n\t      defAuthLocalizedKey (-3k) or defPrivLocalizedKey (-3K) tokens,\n\t      respectively, in the snmp.conf file, see snmp.conf(5).\n\n       -a authProtocol\n\t      Set the authentication protocol (MD5 or SHA) used for\n\t      authenticated SNMPv3 messages. Overrides the defAuthType token\n\t      in the snmp.conf file.\n\n       -A authPassword\n\t      Set the authentication pass phrase used for authenticated SNMPv3\n\t      messages.  Overrides the defAuthPassphrase token in the\n\t      snmp.conf file. It is insecure to specify pass phrases on the\n\t      command line, see snmp.conf(5).\n\n       -e engineID\n\t      Set the authoritative (security) engineID used for SNMPv3\n\t      REQUEST messages, given as a hexadecimal string (optionally\n\t      prefixed by \"0x\").  It is typically not necessary to specify\n\t      this engine ID, as it will usually be discovered automatically.\n\n       -E engineID\n\t      Set the context engineID used for SNMPv3 REQUEST messages\n\t      scopedPdu, given as a hexadecimal string.  If not specified,\n\t      this will default to the authoritative engineID.\n\n       -u secName\n\t      Set the securityName used for authenticated SNMPv3 messages.\n\t      Overrides the defSecurityName token in the snmp.conf file.\n\n       -x privProtocol\n\t      Set the privacy protocol (DES or AES) used for encrypted SNMPv3\n\t      messages.  Overrides the defPrivType token in the snmp.conf\n\t      file. This option is only valid if the Net-SNMP software was\n\t      build to use OpenSSL.\n\n       -X privPassword\n\t      Set the privacy pass phrase used for encrypted SNMPv3 messages.\n\t      Overrides the defPrivPassphrase token in the snmp.conf file.  It\n\t      is insecure to specify pass phrases on the command line, see\n\t      snmp.conf(5).\n\n       -Z boots,time\n\t      Set the engineBoots and engineTime used for authenticated SNMPv3\n\t      messages.  This will initialize the local notion of the agents\n\t      boots/time with an authenticated value stored in the LCD.  It is\n\t      typically not necessary to specify this option, as these values\n\t      will usually be discovered automatically."

This specification takes the form:\n\n\t      [<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>\n\n       At its simplest, the AGENT specification may consist of a hostname, or\n       an IPv4 address in the standard \"dotted quad\" notation.\tIn this case,\n       communication will be attempted using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the given\n       host.  Otherwise, the <transport-address> part of the specification is\n       parsed according to the following table:\n\n\t   <transport-specifier>       <transport-address> format\n\n\t   udp\t\t\t       hostname[:port] or IPv4-address[:port]\n\n\t   tcp\t\t\t       hostname[:port] or IPv4-address[:port]\n\n\t   unix \t\t       pathname\n\n\t   ipx\t\t\t       [network]:node[/port]\n\n\t   aal5pvc or pvc\t       [interface.][VPI.]VCI\n\n\t   udp6 or udpv6 or udpipv6    hostname[:port] or IPv6-address:port or\n\t\t\t\t\t'['IPv6-address']'[:port]\n\n\t   tcp6 or tcpv6 or tcpipv6    hostname[:port] or IPv6-address:port or\n\t\t\t\t\t'['IPv6-address']'[:port]\n\n       Note that <transport-specifier> strings are case-insensitive so that,\n       for example, \"tcp\" and \"TCP\" are equivalent.  Here are some examples,\n       along with their interpretation:\n\n       hostname:161\t       perform query using UDP/IPv4 datagrams to\n\t\t\t       hostname on port 161.  The \":161\" is redundant\n\t\t\t       here since that is the default SNMP port in any\n\t\t\t       case.\n\n       udp:hostname\t       identical to the previous specification.  The\n\t\t\t       \"udp:\" is redundant here since UDP/IPv4 is the\n\t\t\t       default transport.\n\n       TCP:hostname:1161       connect to hostname on port 1161 using TCP/IPv4\n\t\t\t       and perform query over that connection.\n\t\t\t       udp6:hostname:10161 perform the query using\n\t\t\t       UDP/IPv6 datagrams to port 10161 on hostname\n\t\t\t       (which will be looked up as an AAAA record).\n\n       UDP6:[fe80::2d0:b7ff:fe21:c6c0]\n\t\t\t       perform the query using UDP/IPv6 datagrams to\n\t\t\t       port 161 at address fe80::2d0:b7ff:fe21:c6c0.\n\n       tcpipv6:[::1]:1611      connect to port 1611 on the local host (::1 in\n\t\t\t       IPv6 parlance) using TCP/IPv6 and perform query\n\t\t\t       over that connection.\n\n       tls:hostname:10161\n\n       dtls:hostname:10161     Connects using SNMP over DTLS or TLS as\n\t\t\t       documented by the ISMS working group (RFCs not\n\t\t\t       yet published as of this date).\tThis will\n\t\t\t       require (and automatically ensures) that the\n\t\t\t       TSM security model is in use.  You'll also need\n\t\t\t       to set up trust paths for the certificates\n\t\t\t       presented by the server (see above for\n\t\t\t       descriptions of this).\n\n       ssh:hostname:22\t       Connects using SNMP over SSH as documented by\n\t\t\t       the ISMS working group (RFCs not yet published\n\t\t\t       as of this date).

Any type of transport definition can be\n\t\t\t       used as the alias expansion parameter.  Aliases\n\t\t\t       are particularly useful for using repeated\n\t\t\t       complex transport strings.\n\n       AAL5PVC:100\t       perform the query using AAL5 PDUs sent on the\n\t\t\t       permanent virtual circuit with VPI=0 and\n\t\t\t       VCI=100 (decimal) on the first ATM adapter in\n\t\t\t       the machine.\n\n       PVC:1.10.32\t       perform the query using AAL5 PDUs sent on the\n\t\t\t       permanent virtual circuit with VPI=10 (decimal)\n\t\t\t       and VCI=32 (decimal) on the second ATM adapter\n\t\t\t       in the machine.\tNote that \"PVC\" is a synonym\n\t\t\t       for \"AAL5PVC\".\n\n       Note that not all the transport domains listed above will always be\n       available; for instance, hosts with no IPv6 support will not be able to\n       use udp6 transport addresses, and attempts to do so will result in the\n       error \"Unknown host\".  Likewise, since AAL5 PVC support is only\n       currently available on Linux, it will fail with the same error on other\n       platforms.\n\nMIB PARSING OPTIONS\n       The Net-SNMP MIB parser mostly adheres to the Structure of Management\n       Information (SMI).  As that specification has changed through time, and\n       in recognition of the (ahem) diversity in compliance expressed in MIB\n       files, additional options provide more flexibility in reading MIB\n       files.\n\n       -Pc    Toggles whether ASN.1 comments should extend to the end of the\n\t      MIB source line.\tStrictly speaking, a second appearance of \"--\"\n\t      should terminate the comment, but this breaks some MIB files.\n\t      The default behaviour (to interpret comments correctly) can also\n\t      be set with the configuration token commentToEOL.\n\n       -Pd    Disables the loading of MIB object DESCRIPTIONs when parsing MIB\n\t      files.  This reduces the amount of memory used by the running\n\t      application.\n\n       -Pe    Toggles whether to show errors encountered when parsing MIB\n\t      files.  These include references to IMPORTed modules and MIB\n\t      objects that cannot be located in the MIB directory search list.\n\t      The default behaviour can also be set with the configuration\n\t      token showMibErrors.\n\n       -PR    If the same MIB object (parent name and sub-identifier) appears\n\t      multiple times in the list of MIB definitions loaded, use the\n\t      last version to be read in.  By default, the first version will\n\t      be used, and any duplicates discarded.  This behaviour can also\n\t      be set with the configuration token mibReplaceWithLatest.\n\n\t      Such ordering is normally only relevant if there are two MIB\n\t      files with conflicting object definitions for the same OID (or\n\t      different revisions of the same basic MIB object).\n\n       -Pu    Toggles whether to allow the underline character in MIB object\n\t      names and other symbols.\tStrictly speaking, this is not valid\n\t      SMI syntax, but some vendor MIB files define such names.\tThe\n\t      default behaviour can also be set with the configuration token\n\t      mibAllowUnderline.\n\n       -Pw    Show various warning messages in parsing MIB files and building\n\t      the overall OID tree.  This can also be set with the\n\t      configuration directive mibWarningLevel 1\n\n       -PW    Show some additional warning messages, mostly relating to\n\t      parsing individual MIB objects.  This can also be set with the\n\t      configuration directive mibWarningLevel 2"

The default\n       behaviour will be described at the end of this section.\n\n       -Ib    specifies that the given name should be regarded as a regular\n\t      expression, to match (case-insensitively) against object names\n\t      in the MIB tree.\tThe \"best\" match will be used - calculated as\n\t      the one that matches the closest to the beginning of the node\n\t      name and the highest in the tree.  For example, the MIB object\n\t      vacmSecurityModel could be matched by the expression\n\t      vacmsecuritymodel (full name, but different case), or\n\t      vacm.*model (regexp pattern).\n\n\t      Note that '.' is a special character in regular expression\n\t      patterns, so the expression cannot specify instance\n\t      subidentifiers or more than one object name.  A \"best match\"\n\t      expression will only be applied against single MIB object names.\n\t      For example, the expression sys*ontact.0 would not match the\n\t      instance sysContact.0 (although sys*ontact would match\n\t      sysContact).  Similarly, specifying a MIB module name will not\n\t      succeed (so SNMPv2-MIB::sys.*ontact would not match either).\n\n       -Ih    disables the use of DISPLAY-HINT information when assigning\n\t      values.  This would then require providing the raw value:\n\t\t  snmpset ... HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0\n\t\t\t\t  x \"07 D2 0C 0A 02 04 06 08\"\n\t      instead of a formatted version:\n\t\t  snmpset ... HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0\n\t\t\t\t  = 2002-12-10,2:4:6.8\n\n       -Ir    disables checking table indexes and the value to be assigned\n\t      against the relevant MIB definitions.  This will (hopefully)\n\t      result in the remote agent reporting an invalid request, rather\n\t      than checking (and rejecting) this before it is sent to the\n\t      remote agent.\n\n\t      Local checks are more efficient (and the diagnostics provided\n\t      also tend to be more precise), but disabling this behaviour is\n\t      particularly useful when testing the remote agent.\n\n       -IR    enables \"random access\" lookup of MIB names.  Rather than\n\t      providing a full OID path to the desired MIB object (or\n\t      qualifying this object with an explicit MIB module name), the\n\t      MIB tree will be searched for the matching object name.  Thus\n\t      .iso.org.dod.internet.mib-2.system.sysDescr.0 (or\n\t      SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0) can be specified simply as sysDescr.0.\n\n\t      Warning:\n\t\t     Since MIB object names are not globally unique, this\n\t\t     approach may return a different MIB object depending on\n\t\t     which MIB files have been loaded.\n\n\t      The MIB-MODULE::objectName syntax has the advantage of uniquely\n\t      identifying a particular MIB object, as well as being slightly\n\t      more efficient (and automatically loading the necessary MIB file\n\t      if necessary).\n\n       -Is SUFFIX\n\t      adds the specified suffix to each textual OID given on the\n\t      command line.  This can be used to retrieve multiple objects\n\t      from the same row of a table, by specifying a common index\n\t      value.\n\n       -IS PREFIX\n\t      adds the specified prefix to each textual OID given on the\n\t      command line.  This can be used to specify an explicit MIB\n\t      module name for all objects being retrieved (or for incurably\n\t      lazy typists).\n\n       -Iu    enables the traditional UCD-style approach to interpreting input\n\t      OIDs.  This assumes that OIDs are rooted at the 'mib-2' point in\n\t      the tree (unless they start with an explicit '.' or include a\n\t      MIB module name).  So the sysDescr instance above would be\n\t      referenced as system.sysDescr.0."
