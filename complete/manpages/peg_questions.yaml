It allows the incremental definition of the grammar, its\n       manipulation and querying of the definition.  The package neither\n       provides complex operations on the grammar, nor has it the ability to\n       execute a grammar definition for a stream of symbols.  Two packages\n       related to this one are grammar::mengine and grammar::peg::interpreter.\n       The first of them defines a general virtual machine for the matching of\n       a character stream, and the second implements an interpreter for\n       parsing expression grammars on top of that virtual machine.\n\n   TERMS & CONCEPTS\n       PEGs are similar to context-free grammars, but not equivalent; in some\n       cases PEGs are strictly more powerful than context-free grammars (there\n       exist PEGs for some non-context-free languages).  The formal\n       mathematical definition of parsing expressions and parsing expression\n       grammars can be found in section PARSING EXPRESSION GRAMMARS.\n\n       In short, we have terminal symbols, which are the most basic building\n       blocks for sentences, and nonterminal symbols with associated parsing\n       expressions, defining the grammatical structure of the sentences. The\n       two sets of symbols are distinctive, and do not overlap. When speaking\n       about symbols the word \"symbol\" is often left out. The union of the\n       sets of terminal and nonterminal symbols is called the set of symbols.\n\n       Here the set of terminal symbols is not explicitly managed, but\n       implicitly defined as the set of all characters. Note that this means\n       that we inherit from Tcl the ability to handle all of Unicode.\n\n       A pair of nonterminal and parsing expression is also called a\n       grammatical rule, or rule for short. In the context of a rule the\n       nonterminal is often called the left-hand-side (LHS), and the parsing\n       expression the right-hand-side (RHS).\n\n       The start expression of a grammar is a parsing expression from which\n       all the sentences contained in the language specified by the grammar\n       are derived.  To make the understanding of this term easier let us\n       assume for a moment that the RHS of each rule, and the start\n       expression, is either a sequence of symbols, or a series of alternate\n       parsing expressions.  In the latter case the rule can be seen as a set\n       of rules, each providing one alternative for the nonterminal.  A\n       parsing expression A' is now a derivation of a parsing expression A if\n       we pick one of the nonterminals N in the expression, and one of the\n       alternative rules R for N, and then replace the nonterminal in A with\n       the RHS of the chosen rule. Here we can see why the terminal symbols\n       are called such. They cannot be expanded any further, thus terminate\n       the process of deriving new expressions.  An example"

The terms left- and right-\n\t      recursive, and useful are analogously defined.\n\n       [2]    A grammar is minimal if it contains only reachable and useful\n\t      nonterminals.\n\n       [3]    A grammar is wellformed if it is not left-recursive.

For an incomplete grammar on the\n\t      other hand input sentences exist for which an attempt to match\n\t      them against the grammar will not terminate.\n\n       [4]    As we wish to allow ourselves to build a grammar incrementally\n\t      in a container object we will encounter stages where the RHS of\n\t      one or more rules reference symbols which are not yet known to\n\t      the container.

Otherwise it will contain a copy of the grammar\n\t      contained in the src.  The src has to be a container object\n\t      reference for all operators except deserialize.  The deserialize\n\t      operator requires src to be the serialization of a parsing\n\t      expression grammar instead.\n\n\t      An empty grammar has no nonterminal symbols, and the start\n\t      expression is the empty expression, i.e. epsilon.

Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       LL(k), TDPL, context-free languages, expression, grammar, parsing,\n       parsing expression, parsing expression grammar, push down automaton,\n       recursive descent, state, top-down parsing languages, transducer\n\nCATEGORY\n       Grammars and finite automata\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2005 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `peg` command in macOS?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you define a new nonterminal symbol with an associated parsing expression using the `peg` resource?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the function of the `peg nonterminal mode` command and how can it be used to control the semantic value handling of a nonterminal symbol?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `peg`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ngrammar_peg\t\t\t      0.1\t\t       grammar::peg(n)"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the peg tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use peg to parse a simple text file containing a sequence of key-value pairs separated by colons?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using peg to match a specific pattern in a text string?
