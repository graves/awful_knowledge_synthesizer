All of the forms expect at least one additional argument,\n       window, which must be the path name of a top-level window.\n\n       The legal forms for the wm command are:\n\n       wm aspect window ?minNumer minDenom maxNumer maxDenom?\n\t      If minNumer, minDenom, maxNumer, and maxDenom are all specified,\n\t      then they will be passed to the window manager and the window\n\t      manager should use them to enforce a range of acceptable aspect\n\t      ratios for window.  The aspect ratio of window (width/length)\n\t      will be constrained to lie between minNumer/minDenom and\n\t      maxNumer/maxDenom.  If minNumer etc. are all specified as empty\n\t      strings, then any existing aspect ratio restrictions are\n\t      removed.\tIf minNumer etc. are specified, then the command\n\t      returns an empty string.\tOtherwise, it returns a Tcl list\n\t      containing four elements, which are the current values of\n\t      minNumer, minDenom, maxNumer, and maxDenom (if no aspect\n\t      restrictions are in effect, then an empty string is returned)."

If the natural size of a top-level window changes,\n       then the window's size changes to match.  A top-level window can be\n       given a size other than its natural size in two ways.  First, the user\n       can resize the window manually using the facilities of the window\n       manager, such as resize handles.  Second, the application can request a\n       particular size for a top-level window using the wm geometry command.\n       These two cases are handled identically by Tk;  in either case, the\n       requested size overrides the natural size.  You can return the window\n       to its natural by invoking wm geometry with an empty geometry string.\n\n       Normally a top-level window can have any size from one pixel in each\n       dimension up to the size of its screen.\tHowever, you can use the wm\n       minsize and wm maxsize commands to limit the range of allowable sizes.\n       The range set by wm minsize and wm maxsize applies to all forms of\n       resizing, including the window's natural size as well as manual resizes\n       and the wm geometry command.
