It allows the incremental definition of the automaton, its\n       manipulation and querying of the definition.  While the package\n       provides complex operations on the automaton (via package\n       grammar::fa::op), it does not have the ability to execute a definition\n       for a stream of symbols.  Use the packages grammar::fa::dacceptor and\n       grammar::fa::dexec for that.  Another package related to this is\n       grammar::fa::compiler. It turns a FA into an executor class which has\n       the definition of the FA hardwired into it. The output of this package\n       is configurable to suit a large number of different implementation\n       languages and paradigms.\n\n       For more information about what a finite automaton is see section\n       FINITE AUTOMATONS.\n\nAPI\n       The package exports the API described here.\n\n       ::grammar::fa faName ?=|:=|<--|as|deserialize src|fromRegex re ?over??\n\t      Creates a new finite automaton with an associated global Tcl\n\t      command whose name is faName. This command may be used to invoke\n\t      various operations on the automaton. It has the following\n\t      general form:\n\n\t      faName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command. See section FA METHODS for more explanations.\n\t\t     The new automaton will be empty if no src is specified.\n\t\t     Otherwise it will contain a copy of the definition\n\t\t     contained in the src.  The src has to be a FA object\n\t\t     reference for all operators except deserialize and\n\t\t     fromRegex. The deserialize operator requires src to be\n\t\t     the serialization of a FA instead, and fromRegex takes a\n\t\t     regular expression in the form a of a syntax tree. See\n\t\t     ::grammar::fa::op::fromRegex for more detail on that.\n\nFA METHODS\n       All automatons provide the following methods for their manipulation:\n\n       faName destroy\n\t      Destroys the automaton, including its storage space and\n\t      associated command.\n\n       faName clear\n\t      Clears out the definition of the automaton contained in faName,\n\t      but does not destroy the object.\n\n       faName = srcFA\n\t      Assigns the contents of the automaton contained in srcFA to\n\t      faName, overwriting any existing definition.  This is the\n\t      assignment operator for automatons. It copies the automaton\n\t      contained in the FA object srcFA over the automaton definition\n\t      in faName. The old contents of faName are deleted by this\n\t      operation.\n\n\t      This operation is in effect equivalent to"

Here epsilon denotes the empty input symbol and is\n\t      distinct from all symbols in Sy; and {S} is the set of subsets\n\t      of S. In other words, T maps a combination of State and Input\n\t      (which can be empty) to a set of successor states.\n\n       In computer theory a FA is most often shown as a graph where the nodes\n       represent the states, and the edges between the nodes encode the\n       transition function: For all n in S' = T (s, sy) we have one edge\n       between the nodes representing s and n resp., labeled with sy. The\n       start and accepting states are encoded through distinct visual markers,\n       i.e. they are attributes of the nodes.\n\n       FA's are used to process streams of symbols over Sy.\n\n       A specific FA is said to accept a finite stream sy_1 sy_2 state in St\n       and ending at a state in Fi whose edges have the labels sy_1, sy_2,\n       etc. to sy_n.  The set of all strings accepted by the FA is the\n       language of the FA. One important equivalence is that the set of\n       languages which can be accepted by an FA is the set of regular\n       languages.\n\n       Another important concept is that of deterministic FAs. A FA is said to\n       be deterministic if for each string of input symbols there is exactly\n       one path in the graph of the FA beginning at the start state and whose\n       edges are labeled with the symbols in the string.  While it might seem\n       that non-deterministic FAs to have more power of recognition, this is\n       not so. For each non-deterministic FA we can construct a deterministic\n       FA which accepts the same language (--> Thompson's subset\n       construction).\n\n       While one of the premier applications of FAs is in parsing, especially\n       in the lexer stage (where symbols == characters), this is not the only\n       possibility by far.\n\n       Quite a lot of processes can be modeled as a FA, albeit with a possibly\n       large set of states. For these the notion of accepting states is often\n       less or not relevant at all. What is needed instead is the ability to\n       act to state changes in the FA, i.e. to generate some output in\n       response to the input.  This transforms a FA into a finite transducer,\n       which has an additional set OSy of output symbols and also an\n       additional output function O which maps from \"S x (Sy + epsilon)\" to\n       \"(Osy + epsilon)\", i.e a combination of state and input, possibly empty\n       to an output symbol, or nothing.\n\n       For the graph representation this means that edges are additional\n       labeled with the output symbol to write when this edge is traversed\n       while matching input. Note that for an application \"writing an output\n       symbol\" can also be \"executing some code\".\n\n       Transducers are not handled by this package. They will get their own\n       package in the future.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
