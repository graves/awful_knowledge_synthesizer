If the optional\n     interval is specified, then vm_stat will display the statistics every\n     interval seconds.\tIn this case, each line of output displays the change\n     in each statistic (an interval count of 1 displays the values per\n     second).  However, the first line of output following each banner\n     displays the system-wide totals for each statistic.  If a count is\n     provided, the command will terminate after count intervals.  The\n     following values are displayed:\n\n     Pages free\n\t     the total number of free pages in the system.\n\n     Pages active\n\t     the total number of pages currently in use and pageable.\n\n     Pages inactive\n\t     the total number of pages on the inactive list.\n\n     Pages speculative\n\t     the total number of pages on the speculative list."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the vm_stat command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use vm_stat to display virtual memory statistics every 5 seconds for a total of 3 intervals?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using vm_stat to view the system-wide totals for virtual memory statistics after one interval?
