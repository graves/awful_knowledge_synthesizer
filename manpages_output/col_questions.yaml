Normally\n\t     characters printed on a half line boundary are printed on the\n\t     following line.\n\n     -h      Do not output multiple spaces instead of tabs (default).\n\n     -l num  Buffer at least num lines in memory.  By default, 128 lines are\n\t     buffered.\n\n     -p      Force unknown control sequences to be passed through unchanged.\n\t     Normally, col will filter out any control sequences from the\n\t     input other than those recognized and interpreted by itself,\n\t     which are listed below."
