JPEG\n       stands for Joint Photography Experts Group and is a standard for the\n       lossy compression of photographical images. It is specified at\n       LINK_HERE.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::jpeg::isJPEG file\n\t      Returns a boolean value indicating if file is a JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::imageInfo file\n\t      Returns a dictionary with keys version, units, xdensity,\n\t      ydensity, xthumb, and ythumb. The values are the associated\n\t      properties of the JPEG image in file.  Throws an error if file\n\t      is not a JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::dimensions file\n\t      Returns the dimensions of the JPEG file as a list of the\n\t      horizontal and vertical pixel count.  Throws an error if file is\n\t      not a JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::getThumbnail file\n\t      This procedure will return the binary thumbnail image data, if a\n\t      JPEG thumbnail is included in file, and the empty string\n\t      otherwise. Note that it is possible to include thumbnails in\n\t      formats other than JPEG although that is not common. The command\n\t      finds thumbnails that are encoded in either the JFXX or EXIF\n\t      segments of the JPEG information. If both are present the EXIF\n\t      thumbnail will take precedence.  Throws an error if file is not\n\t      a JPEG image.\n\n\t\t  set fh [open thumbnail.jpg w+]\n\t\t  fconfigure $fh -translation binary -encoding binary\n\t\t  puts -nonewline $fh [::jpeg::getThumbnail photo.jpg]\n\t\t  close $fh\n\n\n       ::jpeg::getExif file ?section?\n\t      section must be one of main or thumbnail.  The default is main.\n\t      Returns a dictionary containing the EXIF information for the\n\t      specified section.  For example:\n\n\n\t\t  set exif {\n\t\t   Make     Canon\n\t\t   Model    {Canon DIGITAL IXUS}\n\t\t   DateTime {2001:06:09 15:17:32}\n\t\t  }\n\n\t      Throws an error if file is not a JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::formatExif keys\n\t      Takes a list of key-value pairs as returned by getExif and\n\t      formats many of the values into a more human readable form. As\n\t      few as one key-value may be passed in, the entire exif is not\n\t      required.\n\n\t\t  foreach {key val} [::jpeg::formatExif [::jpeg::getExif photo.jpg]] {\n\t\t      puts \"$key: $val\"\n\t\t  }"

Those keys will appear in a 4 digit hexadecimal\n\t      format.\n\n       ::jpeg::removeExif file\n\t      Removes the Exif data segment from the specified file and\n\t      replaces it with a standard JFIF segment.  Throws an error if\n\t      file is not a JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::stripJPEG file\n\t      Removes all metadata from the JPEG file leaving only the image.\n\t      This includes comments, EXIF segments, JFXX segments, and\n\t      application specific segments.  Throws an error if file is not a\n\t      JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::getComments file\n\t      Returns a list containing all the JPEG comments found in the\n\t      file.  Throws an error if file is not a valid JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::addComment file text...\n\t      Adds one or more plain text comments to the JPEG image in file.\n\t      Throws an error if file is not a valid JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::removeComments file\n\t      Removes all comments from the file specified.  Throws an error\n\t      if file is not a valid JPEG image.\n\n       ::jpeg::replaceComment file text\n\t      Replaces the first comment in the file with the new text.  This\n\t      is merely a shortcut for ::jpeg::removeComments and\n\t      ::jpeg::addComment Throws an error if file is not a valid JPEG\n\t      image.\n\n       ::jpeg::debug file\n\t      Prints everything we know about the given file in a nice format.\n\n       ::jpeg::markers channel\n\t      This is an internal helper command, we document it for use by\n\t      advanced users of the package. The argument channel is an open\n\t      file handle positioned at the start of the first marker (usually\n\t      2 bytes). The command returns a list with one element for each\n\t      JFIF marker found in the file. Each element consists of a list\n\t      of the marker name, its offset in the file, and its length. The\n\t      offset points to the beginning of the sections data, not the\n\t      marker itself.  The length is the length of the data from the\n\t      offset listed to the start of the next marker.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n       can only work with files cant write exif data gps exif data not parsed\n       makernote data not yet implemented\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
