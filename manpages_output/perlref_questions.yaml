Any scalar may hold a hard reference.  Because arrays\n       and hashes contain scalars, you can now easily build arrays of arrays,\n       arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, arrays of hashes of functions, and\n       so on.\n\n       Hard references are smart--they keep track of reference counts for you,\n       automatically freeing the thing referred to when its reference count\n       goes to zero.  (Reference counts for values in self-referential or\n       cyclic data structures may not go to zero without a little help; see\n       \"Circular References\" for a detailed explanation.)  If that thing\n       happens to be an object, the object is destructed.  See perlobj for\n       more about objects.  (In a sense, everything in Perl is an object, but\n       we usually reserve the word for references to objects that have been\n       officially \"blessed\" into a class package.)"

    Manpage text:

    Symbolic references are names of variables or other objects, just as a
           symbolic link in a Unix filesystem contains merely the name of a file.
           The *glob notation is something of a symbolic reference.  (Symbolic
           references are sometimes called "soft references", but please don't
           call them that; references are confusing enough without useless
           synonyms.)

           In contrast, hard references are more like hard links in a Unix file
           system: They are used to access an underlying object without concern
           for what its (other) name is.  When the word "reference" is used
           without an adjective, as in the following paragraph, it is usually
           talking about a hard reference.

           References are easy to use in Perl.  There is just one overriding
           principle: in general, Perl does no implicit referencing or
           dereferencing.  When a scalar is holding a reference, it always behaves
           as a simple scalar.  It doesn't magically start being an array or hash
           or subroutine; you have to tell it explicitly to do so, by
           dereferencing it.

    Manpage text:

    *foo{NAME} and *foo{PACKAGE} are the exception, in that they return
           strings, rather than references.  These return the package and name of
           the typeglob itself, rather than one that has been assigned to it.  So,
           after "*foo=*Foo::bar", *foo will become "*Foo::bar" when used as a
           string, but *foo{PACKAGE} and *foo{NAME} will continue to produce
           "main" and "foo", respectively.

           *foo{IO} is an alternative to the *HANDLE mechanism given in "Typeglobs
           and Filehandles" in perldata for passing filehandles into or out of
           subroutines, or storing into larger data structures.  Its disadvantage
           is that it won't create a new filehandle for you.  Its advantage is
           that you have less risk of clobbering more than you want to with a
           typeglob assignment.  (It still conflates file and directory handles,

The block creates a reference to an\n       anonymous array containing the results of the call to \"mysub(1,2,3)\".\n       So the whole block returns a reference to an array, which is then\n       dereferenced by \"@{...}\" and stuck into the double-quoted string. This\n       chicanery is also useful for arbitrary expressions:\n\n\t   print \"That yields @{[$n + 5]} widgets\\n\";\n\n       Similarly, an expression that returns a reference to a scalar can be\n       dereferenced via \"${...}\".

Imagine a TreeNode class\n       where each node references its parent and child nodes.

A\n       weak reference does not increment the reference count for a variable,\n       which means that the object can go out of scope and be destroyed. You\n       can weaken a reference with the \"weaken\" function exported by the\n       Scalar::Util module.\n\n       Here's how we can make the first example safer:\n\n\t   use Scalar::Util 'weaken';\n\n\t   my $foo = {};\n\t   my $bar = { foo => $foo };\n\t   $foo->{bar} = $bar;"

    Manpage text:

    weaken $foo->{bar};

           The reference from $foo to $bar has been weakened. When the $bar
           variable goes out of scope, it will be garbage-collected. The next time
           you look at the value of the "$foo->{bar}" key, it will be "undef".

           This action at a distance can be confusing, so you should be careful
           with your use of weaken. You should weaken the reference in the
           variable that will go out of scope first. That way, the longer-lived
           variable will contain the expected reference until it goes out of
           scope.

       Symbolic references
           We said that references spring into existence as necessary if they are
           undefined, but we didn't say what happens if a value used as a
           reference is already defined, but isn't a hard reference.  If you use
           it as a reference, it'll be treated as a symbolic reference.  That is,
           the value of the scalar is taken to be the name of a variable, rather
           than a direct link to a (possibly) anonymous value.
