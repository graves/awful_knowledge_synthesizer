    NAME
           perl5300delta - what is new for perl v5.30.0

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.28.0 release and the
           5.30.0 release.

           If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read
           perl5280delta, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.28.0.

    Notice
           sv_utf8_(downgrade|decode) are no longer marked as experimental.  [GH
           #16822] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16822>.

    Core Enhancements
       Limited variable length lookbehind in regular expression pattern matching
           is now experimentally supported
           Using a lookbehind assertion (like "(?<=foo?)" or "(?<!ba{1,9}r)"
           previously would generate an error and refuse to compile.  Now it
           compiles (if the maximum lookbehind is at most 255 characters), but
           raises a warning in the new "experimental::vlb" warnings category.
           This is to caution you that the precise behavior is subject to change
           based on feedback from use in the field.

    Manpage text:

    See "(?<=pattern)" in perlre and "(?<!pattern)" in perlre.

       The upper limit "n" specifiable in a regular expression quantifier of the
           form "{m,n}" has been doubled to 65534
           The meaning of an unbounded upper quantifier "{m,}" remains unchanged.
           It matches 2**31 - 1 times on most platforms, and more on ones where a
           C language short variable is more than 4 bytes long.

       Unicode 12.1 is supported
           Because of a change in Unicode release cycles, Perl jumps from Unicode
           10.0 in Perl 5.28 to Unicode 12.1 in Perl 5.30.

           For details on the Unicode changes, see
           <https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/> for 11.0;
           <https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/> for 12.0; and
           <https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/> for 12.1.  (Unicode
           12.1 differs from 12.0 only in the addition of a single character, that
           for the new Japanese era name.)

           The Word_Break property, as in past Perl releases, remains tailored to
           behave more in line with expectations of Perl users.  This means that
           sequential runs of horizontal white space characters are not broken
           apart, but kept as a single run.  Unicode 11 changed from past versions
           to be more in line with Perl, but it left several white space
           characters as causing breaks: TAB, NO BREAK SPACE, and FIGURE SPACE
           (U+2007).  We have decided to continue to use the previous Perl
           tailoring with regards to these.

This restriction is now removed.\n\n   Turkic UTF-8 locales are now seamlessly supported\n       Turkic languages have different casing rules than other languages for\n       the characters \"i\" and \"I\".  The uppercase of \"i\" is LATIN CAPITAL\n       LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130); and the lowercase of \"I\" is LATIN\n       SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).  Unicode furnishes alternate casing\n       rules for use with Turkic languages.  Previously, Perl ignored these,\n       but now, it uses them when it detects that it is operating under a\n       Turkic UTF-8 locale."

All recursive calls are treated as infinite recursion.\n\t       Previously they would cause the interpreter to panic.  Now,\n\t       they cause the regex pattern to fail to compile.\n\n\t   4.  Similarly, any other error likely would lead to a panic; now to\n\t       just the pattern failing to compile.\n\n\t   5.  The old mechanism did not detect illegal ranges in the\n\t       definition of the property.  Now, the range max must not be\n\t       smaller than the range min.  Otherwise, the pattern fails to\n\t       compile.\n\n\t   6.  The intention was to have each sub called only once during the\n\t       lifetime of the program, so that a property's definition is\n\t       immutable.  This was relaxed so that it could be called once\n\t       for all /i compilations, and potentially a second time for\n\t       non-/i (the sub is passed a parameter indicating which).\n\t       However, in practice there were instances when this was broken,\n\t       and multiple calls were possible.  Those have been fixed.  Now\n\t       (besides the /i,non-/i cases) the only way a sub can be called\n\t       multiple times is if some component of it has not been defined\n\t       yet.  For example, suppose we have sub IsA() whose definition\n\t       is known at compile time, and it in turn calls isB() whose\n\t       definition is not yet known.  isA() will be called each time a\n\t       pattern it appears in is compiled.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
           database at <https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.

           If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
           inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
