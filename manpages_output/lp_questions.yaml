Use a filename\n       of \"-\" to force printing from the standard input.\n\n   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION\n       CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST and\n       PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If neither are set,\n       the current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is used,\n       followed by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The following options are recognized by lp:"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lp command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the lp command to print a file named 'report.txt' with the default printer destination?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the correct syntax to use the lp command with the -n option to print three copies of a file?

On\n\t    systems that support it, this option forces the print file to be\n\t    copied to the spool directory before printing.  In CUPS, print\n\t    files are always sent to the scheduler via IPP which has the same\n\t    effect.\n\n       -d destination\n\t    Prints files to the named printer.\n\n       -h hostname[:port]\n\t    Chooses an alternate server.\n\n       -i job-id\n\t    Specifies an existing job to modify.\n\n       -m   Sends an email when the job is completed.\n\n       -n copies\n\t    Sets the number of copies to print.\n\n       -o \"name=value [ ... name=value ]\"\n\t    Sets one or more job options.
