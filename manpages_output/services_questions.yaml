Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `services`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSERVICES(5)\t\t      File Formats Manual\t\t   SERVICES(5)\n\nNAME\n     services â€“ service name data base\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The services file contains information regarding the known services\n     available in the DARPA Internet.  For each service a single line should\n     be present with the following information:\n\n\t   official service name\n\t   port number\n\t   protocol name\n\t   aliases\n\n     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  The\n     port number and protocol name are considered a single item; a ``/'' is\n     used to separate the port and protocol (e.g. ``512/tcp'').  A ``#''\n     indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the end\n     of the line are not interpreted by the routines which search the file.\n\n     Service names may contain any printable character other than a field\n     delimiter, newline, or comment character.\n\nINTERACTION WITH DIRECTORY SERVICES\n     Processes generally find service records using one of the getservent(3)\n     family of functions, or using getaddrinfo(3).  On Mac OS X, these\n     functions interact with the DirectoryService(8) daemon, which reads the\n     /etc/services file as well as searching other directory information\n     services to determine service name, protocol, and port information."
