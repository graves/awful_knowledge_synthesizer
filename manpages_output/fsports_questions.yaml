This file can also\n       be used to redefine the port used by the Xsan Alternate Portmapper\n       service.  The fsports file is usually only necessary when the Xsan\n       control-network configuration must pass through a firewall.  Use of the\n       fsports file permits firewall pinholing for improved security.  If no\n       fsports file is used then port assignment is operating-system\n       dependent.\n\nSYNTAX\n       When an fsports file exists in the Xsan 'config' directory, it\n       restricts the TCP and UDP port bindings to the user-specified range.\n       The format of the fsports file has two required lines, one optional\n       line, and comments starting with pound-sign (#) in column one as\n       follows:\n\t  MinPort value\n\t  MaxPort value\n\t  AltPmap value"

    Manpage text:

    The value fields are port numbers that define an inclusive range of
           ports that the Xsan server processes can use.  Be careful to choose
           port range values that are appropriate for your operating system. Note
           that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) suggests a dynamic
           client port range for outgoing connections of 49152 through 65535. With
           that in mind, most Linux kernels use a port range of 32768 through
           61000, Microsoft Windows operating systems through XP use the range
           1025 to 5000 by default, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Server 2008 use
           the IANA range by default, and Windows Server 2003 uses the range 1025
           to 5000 by default, until Microsoft security update MS08-037 from 2008
           is installed, after which it uses the IANA range by default.

           The optional AltPmap value changes the TCP port used for the Xsan
           Alternate Portmapper service, which defaults to port 5164.  When Xsan
           is used with a firewall, you can either configure the firewall to allow
           port 5164 or change the SNFS port number via the AltPmap keyword to a
           port that is allowed to pass through the firewall.

    UPDATING FSPORTS CONFIGURATION ON AN HA PAIR
           When changing the fsports configuration on an HA pair and the AltPmap
           directive is used, special care must be taken to avoid having the HA
           mechanism reboot one or both of the HA nodes. Here is the sequence to
           follow:

           Step 1.
           Use the StorNext GUI to enter HA config mode. This locks the secondary
           node and allows configuration changes to be made on the primary node.

           Step 2.
           Stop the cvfs service on the primary node.

           Step 3.
           Stop the cvfs service on the coordinator (name service) nodes.

           Step 4.
           Update, remove or create the fsports file on the coordinator nodes.

           Step 5.
           Start the cvfs service on the coordinator nodes.

           Step 6.
           Update, remove or create the fsports file on both the HA primary and HA
           secondary nodes.

           Step 7.
           Start the cvfs service on the primary node.

           Step 8.
           Use the StorNext GUI to exit HA config mode.
