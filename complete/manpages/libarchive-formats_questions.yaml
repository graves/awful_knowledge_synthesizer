Generally speaking, all of these archive formats consist of a\n     series of “entries”.  Each entry stores a single file system object, such\n     as a file, directory, or symbolic link.\n\n     The following provides a brief description of each format supported by\n     libarchive, with some information about recognized extensions or\n     limitations of the current library support.  Note that just because a\n     format is supported by libarchive does not imply that a program that uses\n     libarchive will support that format.  Applications that use libarchive\n     specify which formats they wish to support, though many programs do use\n     libarchive convenience functions to enable all supported formats.\n\n   Tar Formats\n     The libarchive(3) library can read most tar archives.  It can write\n     POSIX-standard “ustar” and “pax interchange” formats as well as v7 tar\n     format and a subset of the legacy GNU tar format."

File sizes are limited to 24 bits in the PWB\n\t     format, because of the limits of the file system, and to 31 bits\n\t     in the newer binary format, where signed 32 bit longs were used."

This format stores the header contents\n\t     as octal values in ASCII.\tIt is standard, portable, and immune\n\t     from byte-order confusion.  File sizes and mtime are limited to\n\t     33 bits (8GB file size), other fields are limited to 18 bits.\n\n     SVR4/newc\n\t     The libarchive library can read both CRC and non-CRC variants of\n\t     this format.  The SVR4 format uses eight-digit hexadecimal values\n\t     for all header fields.  This limits file size to 4GB, and also\n\t     limits the mtime and other fields to 32 bits.  The SVR4 format\n\t     can optionally include a CRC of the file contents, although\n\t     libarchive does not currently verify this CRC.\n\n     Cpio first appeared in PWB/UNIX 1.0, which was released within AT&T in\n     1977.  PWB/UNIX 1.0 formed the basis of System III Unix, released outside\n     of AT&T in 1981.  This makes cpio older than tar, although cpio was not\n     included in Version 7 AT&T Unix.  As a result, the tar command became\n     much better known in universities and research groups that used Version\n     7.  The combination of the find and cpio utilities provided very precise\n     control over file selection.  Unfortunately, the format has many\n     limitations that make it unsuitable for widespread use.  Only the POSIX\n     format permits files over 4GB, and its 18-bit limit for most other fields\n     makes it unsuitable for modern systems.  In addition, cpio formats only\n     store numeric UID/GID values (not usernames and group names), which can\n     make it very difficult to correctly transfer archives across systems with\n     dissimilar user numbering."
