This manual page includes all the separate\n       manual pages in the following order:\n\n       zsh\t    Zsh overview\n       zshroadmap   Informal introduction to the manual\n       zshmisc\t    Anything not fitting into the other sections\n       zshexpn\t    Zsh command and parameter expansion\n       zshparam     Zsh parameters\n       zshoptions   Zsh options\n       zshbuiltins  Zsh built-in functions\n       zshzle\t    Zsh command line editing\n       zshcompwid   Zsh completion widgets\n       zshcompsys   Zsh completion system\n       zshcompctl   Zsh completion control\n       zshmodules   Zsh loadable modules\n       zshtcpsys    Zsh built-in TCP functions\n       zshzftpsys   Zsh built-in FTP client\n       zshcontrib   Additional zsh functions and utilities\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive\n       login shell and as a shell script command processor.  Of the standard\n       shells, zsh most closely resembles ksh but includes many enhancements.\n       It does not provide compatibility with POSIX or other shells in its\n       default operating mode:\tsee the section `Compatibility' below."

    Zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
           command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
           mechanism, and a host of other features.

    AUTHOR
           Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad.  Zsh is now maintained by
           the members of the zsh-workers mailing list <zsh-workers@zsh.org>.  The
           development is currently coordinated by Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.
           The coordinator can be contacted at <coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters
           relating to the code should generally go to the mailing list.

    AVAILABILITY
           Zsh is available from the following HTTP and anonymous FTP site.

           ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/
           https://www.zsh.org/pub/

           The up-to-date source code is available via Git from Sourceforge.  See

    Manpage text:

    After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as
           described above, the remaining arguments are assigned to the positional
           parameters.

           For further options, which are common to invocation and the set
           builtin, see zshoptions(1).

           The long option `--emulate' followed (in a separate word) by an
           emulation mode may be passed to the shell.  The emulation modes are
           those described for the emulate builtin, see zshbuiltins(1).  The
           `--emulate' option must precede any other options (which might
           otherwise be overridden), but following options are honoured, so may be
           used to modify the requested emulation mode.  Note that certain extra
           steps are taken to ensure a smooth emulation when this option is used
           compared with the emulate command within the shell: for example,
           variables that conflict with POSIX usage such as path are not defined
           within the shell.

           Options may be specified by name using the -o option.  -o acts like a
           single-letter option, but takes a following string as the option name.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nzsh -x -o shwordsplit scr\n\n       runs the script scr, setting the XTRACE option by the corresponding\n       letter `-x' and the SH_WORD_SPLIT option by name.  Options may be\n       turned off by name by using +o instead of -o.  -o can be stacked up\n       with preceding single-letter options, so for example `-xo shwordsplit'\n       or `-xoshwordsplit' is equivalent to `-x -o shwordsplit'.\n\n       Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style,\n       `--option-name'.  When this is done, `-' characters in the option name\n       are permitted: they are translated into `_', and thus ignored.  So, for\n       example, `zsh --sh-word-split' invokes zsh with the SH_WORD_SPLIT\n       option turned on.  Like other option syntaxes, options can be turned\n       off by replacing the initial `-' with a `+'; thus `+-sh-word-split' is\n       equivalent to `--no-sh-word-split'.  Unlike other option syntaxes,\n       GNU-style long options cannot be stacked with any other options, so for\n       example `-x-shwordsplit' is an error, rather than being treated like\n       `-x --shwordsplit'.\n\n       The special GNU-style option `--version' is handled; it sends to\n       standard output the shell's version information, then exits\n       successfully.  `--help' is also handled; it sends to standard output a\n       list of options that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits\n       successfully.\n\n       Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that\n       start with `-' or `+' to be treated as normal arguments, in two ways.\n       Firstly, a lone `-' (or `+') as an argument by itself ends option\n       processing.  Secondly, a special option `--' (or `+-'), which may be\n       specified on its own (which is the standard POSIX usage) or may be\n       stacked with preceding options (so `-x-' is equivalent to `-x --').\n       Options are not permitted to be stacked after `--' (so `-x-f' is an\n       error), but note the GNU-style option form discussed above, where\n       `--shwordsplit' is permitted and does not end option processing.\n\n       Except when the sh/ksh emulation single-letter options are in effect,\n       the option `-b' (or `+b') ends option processing.  `-b' is like `--',\n       except that further single-letter options can be stacked after the `-b'\n       and will take effect as normal.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n       Zsh tries to emulate sh or ksh when it is invoked as sh or ksh\n       respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first letter of the name\n       by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `r' (assumed to stand\n       for `restricted'), and if that is `b', `s' or `k' it will emulate sh or\n       ksh.  Furthermore, if invoked as su (which happens on certain systems\n       when the shell is executed by the su command), the shell will try to\n       find an alternative name from the SHELL environment variable and\n       perform emulation based on that.\n\n       In sh and ksh compatibility modes the following parameters are not\n       special and not initialized by the shell: ARGC, argv, cdpath, fignore,\n       fpath, HISTCHARS, mailpath, MANPATH, manpath, path, prompt, PROMPT,\n       PROMPT2, PROMPT3, PROMPT4, psvar, status.\n\n       The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed.  Login shells\n       source /etc/profile followed by $HOME/.profile.\tIf the ENV environment\n       variable is set on invocation, $ENV is sourced after the profile\n       scripts.  The value of ENV is subjected to parameter expansion, command\n       substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a\n       pathname.  Note that the PRIVILEGED option also affects the execution\n       of startup files.\n\n       The following options are set if the shell is invoked as sh or ksh:\n       NO_BAD_PATTERN, NO_BANG_HIST, NO_BG_NICE, NO_EQUALS,\n       NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO, GLOB_SUBST, NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT, NO_HUP,\n       INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS, KSH_ARRAYS, NO_MULTIOS, NO_NOMATCH, NO_NOTIFY,\n       POSIX_BUILTINS, NO_PROMPT_PERCENT, RM_STAR_SILENT, SH_FILE_EXPANSION,\n       SH_GLOB, SH_OPTION_LETTERS, SH_WORD_SPLIT.  Additionally the BSD_ECHO\n       and IGNORE_BRACES options are set if zsh is invoked as sh.  Also, the\n       KSH_OPTION_PRINT, LOCAL_OPTIONS, PROMPT_BANG, PROMPT_SUBST and\n       SINGLE_LINE_ZLE options are set if zsh is invoked as ksh.\n\n       Please note that, whilst reasonable efforts are taken to address\n       incompatibilities when they arise, zsh does not guarantee complete\n       emulation of other shells, nor POSIX compliance. For more information\n       on the differences between zsh and other shells, please refer to\n       chapter 2 of the shell FAQ, https://www.zsh.org/FAQ/.\n\nRESTRICTED SHELL\n       When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts with the\n       letter `r' or the `-r' command line option is supplied at invocation,\n       the shell becomes restricted.  Emulation mode is determined after\n       stripping the letter `r' from the invocation name.  The following are\n       disabled in restricted mode:\n\n       •      changing directories with the cd builtin\n\n       •      changing or unsetting the EGID, EUID, GID, HISTFILE, HISTSIZE,\n\t      IFS, LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_AOUT_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,\n\t      LD_PRELOAD, MODULE_PATH, module_path, PATH, path, SHELL, UID and\n\t      USERNAME parameters\n\n       •      specifying command names containing /\n\n       •      specifying command pathnames using hash\n\n       •      redirecting output to files\n\n       •      using the exec builtin command to replace the shell with another\n\t      command\n\n       •      using jobs -Z to overwrite the shell process' argument and\n\t      environment space\n\n       •      using the ARGV0 parameter to override argv[0] for external\n\t      commands\n\n       •      turning off restricted mode with set +r or unsetopt RESTRICTED\n\n       These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup files.\n       The startup files should set up PATH to point to a directory of\n       commands which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment.\n       They may also add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins.\n\n       Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the\n       RESTRICTED option.  This immediately enables all the restrictions\n       described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup\n       files.\n\n       A shell Restricted Mode is an outdated way to restrict what users may\n       do:  modern systems have better, safer and more reliable ways to\n       confine user actions, such as chroot jails, containers and zones.\n\n       A restricted shell is very difficult to implement safely.  The feature\n       may be removed in a future version of zsh.\n\n       It is important to realise that the restrictions only apply to the\n       shell, not to the commands it runs (except for some shell builtins).\n       While a restricted shell can only run the restricted list of commands\n       accessible via the predefined `PATH' variable, it does not prevent\n       those commands from running any other command.\n\n       As an example, if `env' is among the list of allowed commands, then it\n       allows the user to run any command as `env' is not a shell builtin\n       command and can run arbitrary executables.\n\n       So when implementing a restricted shell framework it is important to be\n       fully aware of what actions each of the allowed commands or features\n       (which may be regarded as modules) can perform.\n\n       Many commands can have their behaviour affected by environment\n       variables.  Except for the few listed above, zsh does not restrict the\n       setting of environment variables.\n\n       If a `perl', `python', `bash', or other general purpose interpreted\n       script it treated as a restricted command, the user can work around the\n       restriction by setting specially crafted `PERL5LIB', `PYTHONPATH',\n       `BASHENV' (etc.) environment variables. On GNU systems, any command can\n       be made to run arbitrary code when performing character set conversion\n       (including zsh itself) by setting a `GCONV_PATH' environment variable.\n       Those are only a few examples.\n\n       Bear in mind that, contrary to some other shells, `readonly' is not a\n       security feature in zsh as it can be undone and so cannot be used to\n       mitigate the above.\n\n       A restricted shell only works if the allowed commands are few and\n       carefully written so as not to grant more access to users than\n       intended.  It is also important to restrict what zsh module the user\n       may load as some of them, such as `zsh/system', `zsh/mapfile' and\n       `zsh/files', allow bypassing most of the restrictions.\n\nSTARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES\n       Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden.\n       Subsequent behaviour is modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options; the\n       former affects all startup files, while the second only affects global\n       startup files (those shown here with an path starting with a /).  If\n       one of the options is unset at any point, any subsequent startup\n       file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read.  It is also\n       possible for a file in $ZDOTDIR to re-enable GLOBAL_RCS. Both RCS and\n       GLOBAL_RCS are set by default.\n\n       Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv.  If the shell is a login\n       shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then\n       $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile.  Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are\n       read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc.  Finally, if the shell\n       is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.\n\n       When a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout and then\n       /etc/zlogout are read.  This happens with either an explicit exit via\n       the exit or logout commands, or an implicit exit by reading end-of-file\n       from the terminal.  However, if the shell terminates due to exec'ing\n       another process, the logout files are not read.\tThese are also\n       affected by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options.  Note also that the RCS\n       option affects the saving of history files, i.e. if RCS is unset when\n       the shell exits, no history file will be saved.\n\n       If ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead.  Files listed above as being\n       in /etc may be in another directory, depending on the installation.\n\n       As /etc/zshenv is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that it\n       be kept as small as possible.  In particular, it is a good idea to put\n       code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind a test\n       of the form `if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...' so that it will not be executed\n       when zsh is invoked with the `-f' option.\n\n       Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the zcompile builtin\n       command (see zshbuiltins(1)).  If a compiled file exists (named for the\n       original file plus the .zwc extension) and it is newer than the\n       original file, the compiled file will be used instead.\n\nNAME\n       zshroadmap - informal introduction to the zsh manual The Zsh Manual,\n       like the shell itself, is large and often complicated.  This section of\n       the manual provides some pointers to areas of the shell that are likely\n       to be of particular interest to new users, and indicates where in the\n       rest of the manual the documentation is to be found.\n\nWHEN THE SHELL STARTS\n       When it starts, the shell reads commands from various files.  These can\n       be created or edited to customize the shell.  See the section\n       Startup/Shutdown Files in zsh(1).\n\n       If no personal initialization files exist for the current user, a\n       function is run to help you change some of the most common settings.\n       It won't appear if your administrator has disabled the zsh/newuser\n       module.\tThe function is designed to be self-explanatory.  You can run\n       it by hand with `autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install; zsh-newuser-install\n       -f'.  See also the section `User Configuration Functions' in\n       zshcontrib(1).\n\nINTERACTIVE USE\n       Interaction with the shell uses the builtin Zsh Line Editor, ZLE.  This\n       is described in detail in zshzle(1).\n\n       The first decision a user must make is whether to use the Emacs or Vi\n       editing mode as the keys for editing are substantially different.\n       Emacs editing mode is probably more natural for beginners and can be\n       selected explicitly with the command bindkey -e.\n\n       A history mechanism for retrieving previously typed lines (most simply\n       with the Up or Down arrow keys) is available; note that, unlike other\n       shells, zsh will not save these lines when the shell exits unless you\n       set appropriate variables, and the number of history lines retained by\n       default is quite small (30 lines).  See the description of the shell\n       variables (referred to in the documentation as parameters) HISTFILE,\n       HISTSIZE and SAVEHIST in zshparam(1).  Note that it's currently only\n       possible to read and write files saving history when the shell is\n       interactive, i.e. it does not work from scripts.\n\n       The shell now supports the UTF-8 character set (and also others if\n       supported by the operating system).  This is (mostly) handled\n       transparently by the shell, but the degree of support in terminal\n       emulators is variable.  There is some discussion of this in the shell\n       FAQ, https://www.zsh.org/FAQ/.  Note in particular that for combining\n       characters to be handled the option COMBINING_CHARS needs to be set.\n       Because the shell is now more sensitive to the definition of the\n       character set, note that if you are upgrading from an older version of\n       the shell you should ensure that the appropriate variable, either LANG\n       (to affect all aspects of the shell's operation) or LC_CTYPE (to affect\n       only the handling of character sets) is set to an appropriate value.\n       This is true even if you are using a single-byte character set\n       including extensions of ASCII such as ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15.  See\n       the description of LC_CTYPE in zshparam(1).\n\n   Completion\n       Completion is a feature present in many shells. It allows the user to\n       type only a part (usually the prefix) of a word and have the shell fill\n       in the rest.  The completion system in zsh is programmable.  For\n       example, the shell can be set to complete email addresses in arguments\n       to the mail command from your ~/.abook/addressbook; usernames,\n       hostnames, and even remote paths in arguments to scp, and so on.\n       Anything that can be written in or glued together with zsh can be the\n       source of what the line editor offers as possible completions.\n\n       Zsh has two completion systems, an old, so called compctl completion\n       (named after the builtin command that serves as its complete and only\n       user interface), and a new one, referred to as compsys, organized as\n       library of builtin and user-defined functions.  The two systems differ\n       in their interface for specifying the completion behavior.  The new\n       system is more customizable and is supplied with completions for many\n       commonly used commands; it is therefore to be preferred.\n\n       The completion system must be enabled explicitly when the shell starts.\n       For more information see zshcompsys(1).\n\n   Extending the line editor\n       Apart from completion, the line editor is highly extensible by means of\n       shell functions.  Some useful functions are provided with the shell;\n       they provide facilities such as:\n\n       insert-composed-char\n\t      composing characters not found on the keyboard\n\n       match-words-by-style\n\t      configuring what the line editor considers a word when moving or\n\t      deleting by word\n\n       history-beginning-search-backward-end, etc.\n\t      alternative ways of searching the shell history\n\n       replace-string, replace-pattern\n\t      functions for replacing strings or patterns globally in the\n\t      command line\n\n       edit-command-line\n\t      edit the command line with an external editor.\n\n       See the section `ZLE Functions' in zshcontrib(1) for descriptions of\n       these.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The shell has a large number of options for changing its behaviour.\n       These cover all aspects of the shell; browsing the full documentation\n       is the only good way to become acquainted with the many possibilities.\n       See zshoptions(1).\n\nPATTERN MATCHING\n       The shell has a rich set of patterns which are available for file\n       matching (described in the documentation as `filename generation' and\n       also known for historical reasons as `globbing') and for use when\n       programming.  These are described in the section `Filename Generation'\n       in zshexpn(1).\n\n       Of particular interest are the following patterns that are not commonly\n       supported by other systems of pattern matching:\n\n       **     for matching over multiple directories\n\n       |      for matching either of two alternatives\n\n       ~, ^   the ability to exclude patterns from matching when the\n\t      EXTENDED_GLOB option is set\n\n       (...)  glob qualifiers, included in parentheses at the end of the\n\t      pattern, which select files by type (such as directories) or\n\t      attribute (such as size).\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS ON SYNTAX\n       Although the syntax of zsh is in ways similar to the Korn shell, and\n       therefore more remotely to the original UNIX shell, the Bourne shell,\n       its default behaviour does not entirely correspond to those shells.\n       General shell syntax is introduced in the section `Shell Grammar' in\n       zshmisc(1).\n\n       One commonly encountered difference is that variables substituted onto\n       the command line are not split into words.  See the description of the\n       shell option SH_WORD_SPLIT in the section `Parameter Expansion' in\n       zshexpn(1).  In zsh, you can either explicitly request the splitting\n       (e.g. ${=foo}) or use an array when you want a variable to expand to\n       more than one word.  See the section `Array Parameters' in zshparam(1).\n\nPROGRAMMING\n       The most convenient way of adding enhancements to the shell is\n       typically by writing a shell function and arranging for it to be\n       autoloaded.  Functions are described in the section `Functions' in\n       zshmisc(1).  Users changing from the C shell and its relatives should\n       notice that aliases are less used in zsh as they don't perform argument\n       substitution, only simple text replacement.\n\n       A few general functions, other than those for the line editor described\n       above, are provided with the shell and are described in zshcontrib(1).\n       Features include:\n\n       promptinit\n\t      a prompt theme system for changing prompts easily, see the\n\t      section `Prompt Themes'"

    Manpage text:

    For use with completion, which would remove an initial backslash
           followed by a character that isn't special, it may be more convenient
           to quote the word by starting with a single quote, i.e. 'foo;
           completion will automatically add the trailing single quote.

       Alias difficulties
           Although aliases can be used in ways that bend normal shell syntax, not
           every string of non-white-space characters can be used as an alias.

           Any set of characters not listed as a word above is not a word, hence
           no attempt is made to expand it as an alias, no matter how it is
           defined (i.e. via the builtin or the special parameter aliases
           described in the section THE ZSH/PARAMETER MODULE in zshmodules(1)).
           However, as noted in the case of POSIX_ALIASES above, the shell does
           not attempt to deduce whether the string corresponds to a word at the
           time the alias is created.

           For example, an expression containing an = at the start of a command
           line is an assignment and cannot be expanded as an alias; a lone = is
           not an assignment but can only be set as an alias using the parameter,
           as otherwise the = is taken part of the syntax of the builtin command.

    REDIRECTIONS WITH NO COMMAND
           When a simple command consists of one or more redirection operators and
           zero or more parameter assignments, but no command name, zsh can behave
           in several ways.

           If the parameter NULLCMD is not set or the option CSH_NULLCMD is set,
           an error is caused.  This is the csh behavior and CSH_NULLCMD is set by
           default when emulating csh.

           If the option SH_NULLCMD is set, the builtin `:' is inserted as a
           command with the given redirections.  This is the default when
           emulating sh or ksh.

           Otherwise, if the parameter NULLCMD is set, its value will be used as a
           command with the given redirections.  If both NULLCMD and READNULLCMD
           are set, then the value of the latter will be used instead of that of
           the former when the redirection is an input.  The default for NULLCMD
           is `cat' and for READNULLCMD is `more'. Thus

    If execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and
           the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script.
           /bin/sh is spawned to execute it.  If the program is a file beginning
           with `#!', the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for
           the program.  The shell will execute the specified interpreter on
           operating systems that do not handle this executable format in the
           kernel.

           If no external command is found but a function
           command_not_found_handler exists the shell executes this function with
           all command line arguments.  The return status of the function becomes
           the status of the command.  Note that the handler is executed in a
           subshell forked to execute an external command, hence changes to
           directories, shell parameters, etc. have no effect on the main shell.

    FUNCTIONS
           Shell functions are defined with the function reserved word or the
           special syntax `funcname ()'.  Shell functions are read in and stored
           internally.  Alias names are resolved when the function is read.
           Functions are executed like commands with the arguments passed as
           positional parameters.  (See the section `Command Execution'.)

    Manpage text:

    Arguments to the function may be specified as words following the
           closing brace defining the function, hence if there are none no
           arguments (other than $0) are set.  This is a difference from the way
           other functions are parsed: normal function definitions may be followed
           by certain keywords such as `else' or `fi', which will be treated as
           arguments to anonymous functions, so that a newline or semicolon is
           needed to force keyword interpretation.

           Note also that the argument list of any enclosing script or function is
           hidden (as would be the case for any other function called at this
           point).

           Redirections may be applied to the anonymous function in the same
           manner as to a current-shell structure enclosed in braces.  The main
           use of anonymous functions is to provide a scope for local variables.
           This is particularly convenient in start-up files as these do not
           provide their own local variable scope.

Any\n       function that does not exist is silently ignored.  A function found by\n       this mechanism is referred to elsewhere as a hook function.  An error\n       in any function causes subsequent functions not to be run.

           If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the
           key ^Z (control-Z) which sends a TSTP signal to the current job:  this
           key may be redefined by the susp option of the external stty command.
           The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been

    Manpage text:

    A job being run in the background will suspend if it tries to read from
           the terminal.

           Note that if the job running in the foreground is a shell function,
           then suspending it will have the effect of causing the shell to fork.
           This is necessary to separate the function's state from that of the
           parent shell performing the job control, so that the latter can return
           to the command line prompt.  As a result, even if fg is used to
           continue the job the function will no longer be part of the parent
           shell, and any variables set by the function will not be visible in the
           parent shell.  Thus the behaviour is different from the case where the
           function was never suspended.  Zsh is different from many other shells
           in this regard.

           One additional side effect is that use of disown with a job created by
           suspending shell code in this fashion is delayed: the job can only be
           disowned once any process started from the parent shell has terminated.
           At that point, the disowned job disappears silently from the job list.

    SIGNALS
           The INT and QUIT signals for an invoked command are ignored if the
           command is followed by `&' and the MONITOR option is not active.  The
           shell itself always ignores the QUIT signal.  Otherwise, signals have
           the values inherited by the shell from its parent (but see the TRAPNAL
           special functions in the section `Functions').

           Certain jobs are run asynchronously by the shell other than those
           explicitly put into the background; even in cases where the shell would
           usually wait for such jobs, an explicit exit command or exit due to the
           option ERR_EXIT will cause the shell to exit without waiting.  Examples
           of such asynchronous jobs are process substitution, see the section
           PROCESS SUBSTITUTION in the zshexpn(1) manual page, and the handler
           processes for multios, see the section MULTIOS in the zshmisc(1) manual

    ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
           The shell can perform integer and floating point arithmetic, either
           using the builtin let, or via a substitution of the form $((...)).  For
           integers, the shell is usually compiled to use 8-byte precision where
           this is available, otherwise precision is 4 bytes.  This can be tested,
           for example, by giving the command `print - $(( 12345678901 ))'; if the
           number appears unchanged, the precision is at least 8 bytes.  Floating
           point arithmetic always uses the `double' type with whatever
           corresponding precision is provided by the compiler and the library.

Integers may also be of\n       the form `base#n', where base is a decimal number between two and\n       thirty-six representing the arithmetic base and n is a number in that\n       base (for example, `16#ff' is 255 in hexadecimal).  The base# may also\n       be omitted, in which case base 10 is used.  For backwards compatibility\n       the form `[base]n' is also accepted."

    Mathematical functions can be called with the syntax `func(args)',
           where the function decides if the args is used as a string or a
           comma-separated list of arithmetic expressions. The shell currently
           defines no mathematical functions by default, but the module
           zsh/mathfunc may be loaded with the zmodload builtin to provide
           standard floating point mathematical functions.

           An expression of the form `##x' where x is any character sequence such
           as `a', `^A', or `\M-\C-x' gives the value of this character and an
           expression of the form `#name' gives the value of the first character
           of the contents of the parameter name.  Character values are according
           to the character set used in the current locale; for multibyte
           character handling the option MULTIBYTE must be set.  Note that this
           form is different from `$#name', a standard parameter substitution
           which gives the length of the parameter name.  `#\' is accepted instead

    Promotion of integer to floating point values is performed where
           necessary.  In addition, if any operator which requires an integer
           (`&', `|', `^', `<<', `>>' and their equivalents with assignment) is
           given a floating point argument, it will be silently rounded towards
           zero except for `~' which rounds down.

           Users should beware that, in common with many other programming
           languages but not software designed for calculation, the evaluation of
           an expression in zsh is taken a term at a time and promotion of
           integers to floating point does not occur in terms only containing
           integers.  A typical result of this is that a division such as 6/8 is
           truncated, in this being rounded towards 0.  The FORCE_FLOAT shell
           option can be used in scripts or functions where floating point
           evaluation is required throughout.

In other words, [[ $var ]] is the same as [[ -n $var\n       ]].  It is recommended that the second, explicit, form be used where\n       possible.\n\n       Normal shell expansion is performed on the file, string and pattern\n       arguments, but the result of each expansion is constrained to be a\n       single word, similar to the effect of double quotes.\n\n       Filename generation is not performed on any form of argument to\n       conditions.  However, it can be forced in any case where normal shell\n       expansion is valid and when the option EXTENDED_GLOB is in effect by\n       using an explicit glob qualifier of the form (#q) at the end of the\n       string.\tA normal glob qualifier expression may appear between the `q'\n       and the closing parenthesis; if none appears the expression has no\n       effect beyond causing filename generation.

    Manpage text:

    Overview
           A history expansion begins with the first character of the histchars
           parameter, which is `!' by default, and may occur anywhere on the
           command line, including inside double quotes (but not inside single
           quotes '...' or C-style quotes $'...' nor when escaped with a
           backslash).

           The first character is followed by an optional event designator (see
           the section `Event Designators') and then an optional word designator
           (the section `Word Designators'); if neither of these designators is
           present, no history expansion occurs.

           Input lines containing history expansions are echoed after being
           expanded, but before any other expansions take place and before the
           command is executed.  It is this expanded form that is recorded as the
           history event for later references.

           History expansions do not nest.

           By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to the
           same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if
           it is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the
           previous command.  However, if the option CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY is set,
           then every history reference with no event specification always refers
           to the previous command.

    Also note that the order of expansions affects the interpretation of l
           and r.  When used in a history expansion, which occurs before any other
           expansions, l and r are treated as literal strings (except as explained
           for HIST_SUBST_PATTERN below).  When used in parameter expansion, the
           replacement of r into the parameter's value is done first, and then any
           additional process, parameter, command, arithmetic, or brace references
           are applied, which may evaluate those substitutions and expansions more
           than once if l appears more than once in the starting value.  When used
           in a glob qualifier, any substitutions or expansions are performed once
           at the time the qualifier is parsed, even before the `:s' expression
           itself is divided into l and r sides.

           If the option HIST_SUBST_PATTERN is set, l is treated as a pattern of
           the usual form described in the section FILENAME GENERATION below.
           This can be used in all the places where modifiers are available; note,
           however, that in globbing qualifiers parameter substitution has already
           taken place, so parameters in the replacement string should be quoted
           to ensure they are replaced at the correct time.  Note also that
           complicated patterns used in globbing qualifiers may need the extended
           glob qualifier notation (#q:s/.../.../) in order for the shell to
           recognize the expression as a glob qualifier.  Further, note that bad

    Manpage text:

    Parameter expansions can involve flags, as in `${(@kv)aliases}', and
           other operators, such as `${PREFIX:-"/usr/local"}'.  Parameter
           expansions can also be nested.  These topics will be introduced below.
           The full rules are complicated and are noted at the end.

           In the expansions discussed below that require a pattern, the form of
           the pattern is the same as that used for filename generation; see the
           section `Filename Generation'.  Note that these patterns, along with
           the replacement text of any substitutions, are themselves subject to
           parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
           In addition to the following operations, the colon modifiers described
           in the section `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion' can be
           applied:  for example, ${i:s/foo/bar/} performs string substitution on
           the expansion of parameter $i.

           In the following descriptions, `word' refers to a single word

Double-quoted joining\n\t      If the value after this process is an array, and the\n\t      substitution appears in double quotes, and neither an `(@)' flag\n\t      nor a `#' length operator is present at the current level, then\n\t      words of the value are joined with the first character of the\n\t      parameter $IFS, by default a space, between each word (single\n\t      word arrays are not modified).  If the `(j)' flag is present,\n\t      that is used for joining instead of $IFS."

           can be specified in any of the three numbers, specifying it in the

           the characters in the ASCII character set (multibyte characters are not
           currently handled).  The syntax is similar to a [...] expression in
           filename generation: `-' is treated specially to denote a range of

    FILENAME GENERATION
           If a word contains an unquoted instance of one of the characters `*',
           `(', `|', `<', `[', or `?', it is regarded as a pattern for filename
           generation, unless the GLOB option is unset.  If the EXTENDED_GLOB
           option is set, the `^' and `#' characters also denote a pattern;
           otherwise they are not treated specially by the shell.

           The word is replaced with a list of sorted filenames that match the
           pattern.  If no matching pattern is found, the shell gives an error
           message, unless the NULL_GLOB option is set, in which case the word is
           deleted; or unless the NOMATCH option is unset, in which case the word
           is left unchanged.

           In filename generation, the character `/' must be matched explicitly;
           also, a `.' must be matched explicitly at the beginning of a pattern or
           after a `/', unless the GLOB_DOTS option is set.  No filename
           generation pattern matches the files `.' or `..'.  In other instances
           of pattern matching, the `/' and `.' are not treated specially.

    Manpage text:

    The attributes of a parameter determine the type of its value, often
           referred to as the parameter type or variable type, and also control
           other processing that may be applied to the value when it is
           referenced.  The value type may be a scalar (a string, an integer, or a
           floating point number), an array (indexed numerically), or an
           associative array (an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by
           name, also referred to as a hash).

           Named scalar parameters may have the exported, -x, attribute, to copy
           them into the process environment, which is then passed from the shell
           to any new processes that it starts.  Exported parameters are called
           environment variables. The shell also imports environment variables at
           startup time and automatically marks the corresponding parameters as
           exported.  Some environment variables are not imported for reasons of
           security or because they would interfere with the correct operation of
           other shell features.

    Array Subscripts
           Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript.  A
           subscript of the form `[exp]' selects the single element exp, where exp
           is an arithmetic expression which will be subject to arithmetic
           expansion as if it were surrounded by `$((...))'.  The elements are
           numbered beginning with 1, unless the KSH_ARRAYS option is set in which
           case they are numbered from zero.

           Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name,
           thus `${foo[2]}' is equivalent to `$foo[2]'.  If the KSH_ARRAYS option
           is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as bracketed
           expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts.

           If the KSH_ARRAYS option is not set, then by default accesses to an
           array element with a subscript that evaluates to zero return an empty
           string, while an attempt to write such an element is treated as an
           error.  For backward compatibility the KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT option can be
           set to cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see the
           description of the option in zshoptions(1).

If one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative\n       number, say -n, then the nth element from the end of the array is used.\n       Thus `$foo[-3]' is the third element from the end of the array foo, and\n       `$foo[1,-1]' is the same as `$foo[*]'.\n\n       Subscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which case\n       the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted.  For example, if\n       FOO is set to `foobar', then `echo $FOO[2,5]' prints `ooba'.  Note that\n       some forms of subscripting described below perform pattern matching,\n       and in that case the substring extends from the start of the match of\n       the first subscript to the end of the match of the second subscript.\n       For example,\n\n\t      string=\"abcdefghijklm\"\n\t      print ${string[(r)d?,(r)h?]}\n\n       prints `defghi'.

Therefore, to use\n       subscript syntax to extract a substring from a positional parameter,\n       the expansion must be surrounded by braces; for example, `${2[3,5]}'\n       evaluates to the third through fifth characters of the second\n       positional parameter, but `$2[3,5]' is the entire second parameter\n       concatenated with the filename generation pattern `[3,5]'.\n\nPOSITIONAL PARAMETERS\n       The positional parameters provide access to the command-line arguments\n       of a shell function, shell script, or the shell itself; see the section\n       `Invocation', and also the section `Functions'.\tThe parameter n, where\n       n is a number, is the nth positional parameter.\tThe parameter `$0' is\n       a special case, see the section `Parameters Set By The Shell'."

    NAME
           zshbuiltins - zsh built-in commands

    SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
           Some shell builtin commands take options as described in individual
           entries; these are often referred to in the list below as `flags' to
           avoid confusion with shell options, which may also have an effect on
           the behaviour of builtin commands.  In this introductory section,
           `option' always has the meaning of an option to a command that should
           be familiar to most command line users.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTypically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (-).\n       Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following\n       the option letter or after white space, for example `print -C3 {1..9}'\n       or `print -C 3 {1..9}' are equivalent.  Arguments to options are not\n       the same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which\n       is which.  Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a\n       single word, for example `print -rca -- *' and `print -r -c -a -- *'\n       are equivalent.\n\n       Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with `+'\n       instead of `-'.\tThe list below makes clear which commands these are.\n\n       Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must appear\n       in a group before any non-option arguments; once the first non-option\n       argument has been found, option processing is terminated.\n\n       All builtin commands other than `echo' and precommand modifiers, even\n       those that have no options, can be given the argument `--' to terminate\n       option processing.  This indicates that the following words are\n       non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored.\tThis is useful in\n       cases where arguments to the command may begin with `-'.  For\n       historical reasons, most builtin commands (including `echo') also\n       recognize a single `-' in a separate word for this purpose; note that\n       this is less standard and use of `--' is recommended."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe order of testing cdpath is modified if the option POSIX_CD\n\t      is set, as described in the documentation for the option.\n\n\t      If no directory is found, the option CDABLE_VARS is set, and a\n\t      parameter named arg exists whose value begins with a slash,\n\t      treat its value as the directory.  In that case, the parameter\n\t      is added to the named directory hash table.\n\n\t      The second form of cd substitutes the string new for the string\n\t      old in the name of the current directory, and tries to change to\n\t      this new directory.\n\n\t      The third form of cd extracts an entry from the directory stack,\n\t      and changes to that directory.  An argument of the form `+n'\n\t      identifies a stack entry by counting from the left of the list\n\t      shown by the dirs command, starting with zero.  An argument of\n\t      the form `-n' counts from the right.  If the PUSHD_MINUS option\n\t      is set, the meanings of `+' and `-' in this context are swapped.\n\t      If the POSIX_CD option is set, this form of cd is not recognised\n\t      and will be interpreted as the first form.\n\n\t      If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function chpwd\n\t      and the functions in the array chpwd_functions are not called.\n\t      This is useful for calls to cd that do not change the\n\t      environment seen by an interactive user.\n\n\t      If the -s option is specified, cd refuses to change the current\n\t      directory if the given pathname contains symlinks.  If the -P\n\t      option is given or the CHASE_LINKS option is set, symbolic links\n\t      are resolved to their true values.  If the -L option is given\n\t      symbolic links are retained in the directory (and not resolved)\n\t      regardless of the state of the CHASE_LINKS option.\n\n       chdir  Same as cd.\n\n       clone  See the section `The zsh/clone Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       command [ -pvV ] simple command\n\t      The simple command argument is taken as an external command\n\t      instead of a function or builtin and is executed.

The -r\n\t      options causes disable to act on reserved words.\tWithout\n\t      arguments all disabled hash table elements from the\n\t      corresponding hash table are printed.  With the -m flag the\n\t      arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to\n\t      prevent them from undergoing filename expansion), and all hash\n\t      table elements from the corresponding hash table matching these\n\t      patterns are disabled.  Disabled objects can be enabled with the\n\t      enable command.\n\n\t      With the option -p, name ... refer to elements of the shell's\n\t      pattern syntax as described in the section `Filename\n\t      Generation'.

For example, if EXTENDED_GLOB\n\t      is not active, the pattern ^ is ineffective even if `disable -p\n\t      \"^\"' has not been issued.  The list below indicates any option\n\t      settings that restrict the use of the pattern.  It should be\n\t      noted that setting SH_GLOB has a wider effect than merely\n\t      disabling patterns as certain expressions, in particular those\n\t      involving parentheses, are parsed differently.\n\n\t      The following patterns may be disabled; all the strings need\n\t      quoting on the command line to prevent them from being\n\t      interpreted immediately as patterns and the patterns are shown\n\t      below in single quotes as a reminder.\n\n\t      '?'

If no\n\t      job is specified, disown the current job.\n\n\t      If the jobs are currently stopped and the AUTO_CONTINUE option\n\t      is not set, a warning is printed containing information about\n\t      how to make them running after they have been disowned.  If one\n\t      of the latter two forms is used, the jobs will automatically be\n\t      made running, independent of the setting of the AUTO_CONTINUE\n\t      option.\n\n       echo [ -neE ] [ arg ... ]\n\t      Write each arg on the standard output, with a space separating\n\t      each one.  If the -n flag is not present, print a newline at the\n\t      end.  echo recognizes the following escape sequences:\n\n\t      \\a     bell character\n\t      \\b     backspace\n\t      \\c     suppress subsequent characters and final newline\n\t      \\e     escape\n\t      \\f     form feed\n\t      \\n     linefeed (newline)\n\t      \\r     carriage return\n\t      \\t     horizontal tab\n\t      \\v     vertical tab\n\t      \\\\     backslash\n\t      \\0NNN  character code in octal\n\t      \\xNN   character code in hexadecimal\n\t      \\uNNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal\n\t      \\UNNNNNNNN\n\t\t     unicode character code in hexadecimal\n\n\t      The -E flag, or the BSD_ECHO option, can be used to disable\n\t      these escape sequences.  In the latter case, -e flag can be used\n\t      to enable them.\n\n\t      Note that for standards compliance a double dash does not\n\t      terminate option processing; instead, it is printed directly.\n\t      However, a single dash does terminate option processing, so the\n\t      first dash, possibly following options, is not printed, but\n\t      everything following it is printed as an argument.  The single\n\t      dash behaviour is different from other shells.  For a more\n\t      portable way of printing text, see printf, and for a more\n\t      controllable way of printing text within zsh, see print.\n\n       echotc See the section `The zsh/termcap Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       echoti See the section `The zsh/terminfo Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       emulate [ -lLR ] [ {zsh|sh|ksh|csh} [ flags ... ] ]\n\t      Without any argument print current emulation mode.\n\n\t      With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the specified\n\t      shell as much as possible.  csh will never be fully emulated.\n\t      If the argument is not one of the shells listed above, zsh will\n\t      be used as a default; more precisely, the tests performed on the\n\t      argument are the same as those used to determine the emulation\n\t      at startup based on the shell name, see the section\n\t      COMPATIBILITY in zsh(1) .  In addition to setting shell options,\n\t      the command also restores the pristine state of pattern enables,\n\t      as if all patterns had been enabled using enable -p.\n\n\t      If the emulate command occurs inside a function that has been\n\t      marked for execution tracing with functions -t then the xtrace\n\t      option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other\n\t      options.\tNote that code executed inside the function by the .,\n\t      source, or eval commands is not considered to be running\n\t      directly from the function, hence does not provoke this\n\t      behaviour.\n\n\t      If the -R switch is given, all settable options are reset to\n\t      their default value corresponding to the specified emulation\n\t      mode, except for certain options describing the interactive\n\t      environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause\n\t      portability problems in scripts and functions are altered.  If\n\t      the -L switch is given, the options LOCAL_OPTIONS,\n\t      LOCAL_PATTERNS and LOCAL_TRAPS will be set as well, causing the\n\t      effects of the emulate command and any setopt, disable -p or\n\t      enable -p, and trap commands to be local to the immediately\n\t      surrounding shell function, if any; normally these options are\n\t      turned off in all emulation modes except ksh. The -L switch is\n\t      mutually exclusive with the use of -c in flags.\n\n\t      If there is a single argument and the -l switch is given, the\n\t      options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with\n\t      the prefix `no') are listed.  -l can be combined with -L or -R\n\t      and the list will be modified in the appropriate way.  Note the\n\t      list does not depend on the current setting of options, i.e. it\n\t      includes all options that may in principle change, not just\n\t      those that would actually change.\n\n\t      The flags may be any of the invocation-time flags described in\n\t      the section INVOCATION in zsh(1), except that `-o EMACS' and `-o\n\t      VI' may not be used.  Flags such as `+r'/`+o RESTRICTED' may be\n\t      prohibited in some circumstances.\n\n\t      If -c arg appears in flags, arg is evaluated while the requested\n\t      emulation is temporarily in effect.  In this case the emulation\n\t      mode and all options are restored to their previous values\n\t      before emulate returns.  The -R switch may precede the name of\n\t      the shell to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from\n\t      including -R in flags.\n\n\t      Use of -c enables `sticky' emulation mode for functions defined\n\t      within the evaluated expression:\tthe emulation mode is\n\t      associated thereafter with the function so that whenever the\n\t      function is executed the emulation (respecting the -R switch, if\n\t      present) and all options are set (and pattern disables cleared)\n\t      before entry to the function, and the state is restored after\n\t      exit.  If the function is called when the sticky emulation is\n\t      already in effect, either within an `emulate shell -c'\n\t      expression or within another function with the same sticky\n\t      emulation, entry and exit from the function do not cause options\n\t      to be altered (except due to standard processing such as the\n\t      LOCAL_OPTIONS option).  This also applies to functions marked\n\t      for autoload within the sticky emulation; the appropriate set of\n\t      options will be applied at the point the function is loaded as\n\t      well as when it is run.\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     emulate sh -c 'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }\n\t\t     fno() { fni; }'\n\t\t     fno\n\n\t      The two functions fni and fno are defined with sticky sh\n\t      emulation.  fno is then executed, causing options associated\n\t      with emulations to be set to their values in sh.\tfno then calls\n\t      fni; because fni is also marked for sticky sh emulation, no\n\t      option changes take place on entry to or exit from it.  Hence\n\t      the option cshnullglob, turned off by sh emulation, will be\n\t      turned on within fni and remain on return to fno.  On exit from\n\t      fno, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the\n\t      state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation.\n\n\t      The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended\n\t      purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a\n\t      suitable environment.  More detailed rules follow.\n\t      1.     The sticky emulation environment provided by `emulate\n\t\t     shell -c' is identical to that provided by entry to a\n\t\t     function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of\n\t\t     being defined in such an environment.  Hence, for\n\t\t     example, the sticky emulation is inherited by\n\t\t     subfunctions defined within functions with sticky\n\t\t     emulation.\n\t      2.     No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from\n\t\t     functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other\n\t\t     than those that would normally take place, even if those\n\t\t     functions are called within sticky emulation.\n\t      3.     No special handling is provided for functions marked for\n\t\t     autoload nor for functions present in wordcode created by\n\t\t     the zcompile command.\n\t      4.     The presence or absence of the -R switch to emulate\n\t\t     corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for\n\t\t     example `emulate sh -c', `emulate -R sh -c' and `emulate\n\t\t     csh -c' are treated as three distinct sticky emulations.\n\t      5.     Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the\n\t\t     basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are\n\t\t     different, so for example `emulate zsh -c' and `emulate\n\t\t     zsh -o cbases -c' are treated as distinct sticky\n\t\t     emulations.\n\n       enable [ -afmprs ] name ...\n\t      Enable the named hash table elements, presumably disabled\n\t      earlier with disable.  The default is to enable builtin\n\t      commands.  The -a option causes enable to act on regular or\n\t      global aliases.  The -s option causes enable to act on suffix\n\t      aliases.\tThe -f option causes enable to act on shell functions.\n\t      The -r option causes enable to act on reserved words.  Without\n\t      arguments all enabled hash table elements from the corresponding\n\t      hash table are printed.  With the -m flag the arguments are\n\t      taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements\n\t      from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns are\n\t      enabled.\tEnabled objects can be disabled with the disable\n\t      builtin command.\n\n\t      enable -p reenables patterns disabled with disable -p.  Note\n\t      that it does not override globbing options; for example, `enable\n\t      -p \"~\"' does not cause the pattern character ~ to be active\n\t      unless the EXTENDED_GLOB option is also set.  To enable all\n\t      possible patterns (so that they may be individually disabled\n\t      with disable -p), use `setopt EXTENDED_GLOB KSH_GLOB\n\t      NO_SH_GLOB'.\n\n       eval [ arg ... ]\n\t      Read the arguments as input to the shell and execute the\n\t      resulting command(s) in the current shell process.  The return\n\t      status is the same as if the commands had been executed directly\n\t      by the shell; if there are no args or they contain no commands\n\t      (i.e. are an empty string or whitespace) the return status is\n\t      zero.\n\n       exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] [ command [ arg ... ] ]\n\t      Replace the current shell with command rather than forking.  If\n\t      command is a shell builtin command or a shell function, the\n\t      shell executes it, and exits when the command is complete.\n\n\t      With -c clear the environment; with -l prepend - to the argv[0]\n\t      string of the command executed (to simulate a login shell); with\n\t      -a argv0 set the argv[0] string of the command executed.\tSee\n\t      the section `Precommand Modifiers' in zshmisc(1).\n\n\t      If the option POSIX_BUILTINS is set, command is never\n\t      interpreted as a shell builtin command or shell function.  This\n\t      means further precommand modifiers such as builtin and noglob\n\t      are also not interpreted within the shell.  Hence command is\n\t      always found by searching the command path.\n\n\t      If command is omitted but any redirections are specified, then\n\t      the redirections will take effect in the current shell.\n\n       exit [ n ]\n\t      Exit the shell with the exit status specified by an arithmetic\n\t      expression n; if none is specified, use the exit status from the\n\t      last command executed.

For\n\t      each sig that is a signal number or a number representing the\n\t      exit status of a process which was terminated or stopped by a\n\t      signal the name of the signal is printed.\n\n\t      On some systems, alternative signal names are allowed for a few\n\t      signals.\tTypical examples are SIGCHLD and SIGCLD or SIGPOLL and\n\t      SIGIO, assuming they correspond to the same signal number.  kill\n\t      -l will only list the preferred form, however kill -l alt will\n\t      show if the alternative form corresponds to a signal number.\n\t      For example, under Linux kill -l IO and kill -l POLL both output\n\t      29, hence kill -IO and kill -POLL have the same effect.\n\n\t      Many systems will allow process IDs to be negative to kill a\n\t      process group or zero to kill the current process group.\n\n       let arg ...\n\t      Evaluate each arg as an arithmetic expression.  See the section\n\t      `Arithmetic Evaluation' in zshmisc(1) for a description of\n\t      arithmetic expressions.  The exit status is 0 if the value of\n\t      the last expression is nonzero, 1 if it is zero, and 2 if an\n\t      error occurred.\n\n       limit [ -hs ] [ resource [ limit ] ] ...\n\t      Set or display resource limits.  Unless the -s flag is given,\n\t      the limit applies only the children of the shell.  If -s is\n\t      given without other arguments, the resource limits of the\n\t      current shell is set to the previously set resource limits of\n\t      the children.\n\n\t      If limit is not specified, print the current limit placed on\n\t      resource, otherwise set the limit to the specified value.  If\n\t      the -h flag is given, use hard limits instead of soft limits.\n\t      If no resource is given, print all limits.\n\n\t      When looping over multiple resources, the shell will abort\n\t      immediately if it detects a badly formed argument.  However, if\n\t      it fails to set a limit for some other reason it will continue\n\t      trying to set the remaining limits.\n\n\t      resource can be one of:\n\n\t      addressspace\n\t\t     Maximum amount of address space used.\n\t      aiomemorylocked\n\t\t     Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM for AIO\n\t\t     operations.\n\t      aiooperations\n\t\t     Maximum number of AIO operations.\n\t      cachedthreads\n\t\t     Maximum number of cached threads.\n\t      coredumpsize\n\t\t     Maximum size of a core dump.\n\t      cputime\n\t\t     Maximum CPU seconds per process.\n\t      datasize\n\t\t     Maximum data size (including stack) for each process.\n\t      descriptors\n\t\t     Maximum value for a file descriptor.\n\t      filesize\n\t\t     Largest single file allowed.\n\t      kqueues\n\t\t     Maximum number of kqueues allocated.\n\t      maxproc\n\t\t     Maximum number of processes.\n\t      maxpthreads\n\t\t     Maximum number of threads per process.\n\t      memorylocked\n\t\t     Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM.\n\t      memoryuse\n\t\t     Maximum resident set size.\n\t      msgqueue\n\t\t     Maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues.\n\t      posixlocks\n\t\t     Maximum number of POSIX locks per user.\n\t      pseudoterminals\n\t\t     Maximum number of pseudo-terminals.\n\t      resident\n\t\t     Maximum resident set size.\n\t      sigpending\n\t\t     Maximum number of pending signals.\n\t      sockbufsize\n\t\t     Maximum size of all socket buffers.\n\t      stacksize\n\t\t     Maximum stack size for each process.\n\t      swapsize\n\t\t     Maximum amount of swap used.\n\t      vmemorysize\n\t\t     Maximum amount of virtual memory.\n\n\t      Which of these resource limits are available depends on the\n\t      system.  resource can be abbreviated to any unambiguous prefix.\n\t      It can also be an integer, which corresponds to the integer\n\t      defined for the resource by the operating system.\n\n\t      If argument corresponds to a number which is out of the range of\n\t      the resources configured into the shell, the shell will try to\n\t      read or write the limit anyway, and will report an error if this\n\t      fails.  As the shell does not store such resources internally,\n\t      an attempt to set the limit will fail unless the -s option is\n\t      present.\n\n\t      limit is a number, with an optional scaling factor, as follows:\n\n\t      nh     hours\n\t      nk     kilobytes (default)\n\t      nm     megabytes or minutes\n\t      ng     gigabytes\n\t      [mm:]ss\n\t\t     minutes and seconds\n\n\t      The limit command is not made available by default when the\n\t      shell starts in a mode emulating another shell.  It can be made\n\t      available with the command `zmodload -F zsh/rlimits b:limit'.\n\n       local [ {+|-}AHUahlprtux ] [ {+|-}EFLRZi [ n ] ] [ name[=value] ... ]\n\t      Same as typeset, except that the options -g, and -f are not\n\t      permitted.  In this case the -x option does not force the use of\n\t      -g, i.e. exported variables will be local to functions.\n\n       logout [ n ]\n\t      Same as exit, except that it only works in a login shell.\n\n       noglob simple command\n\t      See the section `Precommand Modifiers' in zshmisc(1).\n\n       popd [ -q ] [ {+|-}n ]\n\t      Remove an entry from the directory stack, and perform a cd to\n\t      the new top directory.  With no argument, the current top entry\n\t      is removed.  An argument of the form `+n' identifies a stack\n\t      entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the dirs\n\t      command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form -n counts\n\t      from the right.  If the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings\n\t      of `+' and `-' in this context are swapped.\n\n\t      If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function chpwd\n\t      and the functions in the array $chpwd_functions are not called,\n\t      and the new directory stack is not printed.  This is useful for\n\t      calls to popd that do not change the environment seen by an\n\t      interactive user.\n\n       print [ -abcDilmnNoOpPrsSz ] [ -u n ] [ -f format ] [ -C cols ]\n\t     [ -v name ] [ -xX tabstop ] [ -R [ -en ]] [ arg ... ]\n\t      With the `-f' option the arguments are printed as described by\n\t      printf.  With no flags or with the flag `-', the arguments are\n\t      printed on the standard output as described by echo, with the\n\t      following differences: the escape sequence `\\M-x' (or `\\Mx')\n\t      metafies the character x (sets the highest bit), `\\C-x' (or\n\t      `\\Cx') produces a control character (`\\C-@' and `\\C-?' give the\n\t      characters NULL and delete), a character code in octal is\n\t      represented by `\\NNN' (instead of `\\0NNN'), and `\\E' is a\n\t      synonym for `\\e'.  Finally, if not in an escape sequence, `\\'\n\t      escapes the following character and is not printed.\n\n\t      -a     Print arguments with the column incrementing first.  Only\n\t\t     useful with the -c and -C options.\n\n\t      -b     Recognize all the escape sequences defined for the\n\t\t     bindkey command, see the section `Zle Builtins' in\n\t\t     zshzle(1).\n\n\t      -c     Print the arguments in columns.  Unless -a is also given,\n\t\t     arguments are printed with the row incrementing first.\n\n\t      -C cols\n\t\t     Print the arguments in cols columns.  Unless -a is also\n\t\t     given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing\n\t\t     first.\n\n\t      -D     Treat the arguments as paths, replacing directory\n\t\t     prefixes with ~ expressions corresponding to directory\n\t\t     names, as appropriate.\n\n\t      -i     If given together with -o or -O, sorting is performed\n\t\t     case-independently.\n\n\t      -l     Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of\n\t\t     spaces.  Note: if the list of arguments is empty, print\n\t\t     -l will still output one empty line. To print a\n\t\t     possibly-empty list of arguments one per line, use print\n\t\t     -C1, as in `print -rC1 -- \"$list[@]\"'.\n\n\t      -m     Take the first argument as a pattern (should be quoted),\n\t\t     and remove it from the argument list together with\n\t\t     subsequent arguments that do not match this pattern.\n\n\t      -n     Do not add a newline to the output.\n\n\t      -N     Print the arguments separated and terminated by nulls.\n\t\t     Again, print -rNC1 -- \"$list[@]\" is a canonical way to\n\t\t     print an arbitrary list as null-delimited records.\n\n\t      -o     Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.\n\n\t      -O     Print the arguments sorted in descending order.\n\n\t      -p     Print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.\n\n\t      -P     Perform prompt expansion (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT\n\t\t     SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).\tIn combination with `-f',\n\t\t     prompt escape sequences are parsed only within\n\t\t     interpolated arguments, not within the format string.\n\n\t      -r     Ignore the escape conventions of echo.\n\n\t      -R     Emulate the BSD echo command, which does not process\n\t\t     escape sequences unless the -e flag is given.  The -n\n\t\t     flag suppresses the trailing newline.  Only the -e and -n\n\t\t     flags are recognized after -R; all other arguments and\n\t\t     options are printed.\n\n\t      -s     Place the results in the history list instead of on the\n\t\t     standard output.  Each argument to the print command is\n\t\t     treated as a single word in the history, regardless of\n\t\t     its content.\n\n\t      -S     Place the results in the history list instead of on the\n\t\t     standard output.  In this case only a single argument is\n\t\t     allowed; it will be split into words as if it were a full\n\t\t     shell command line.  The effect is similar to reading the\n\t\t     line from a history file with the HIST_LEX_WORDS option\n\t\t     active.\n\n\t      -u n   Print the arguments to file descriptor n.\n\n\t      -v name\n\t\t     Store the printed arguments as the value of the parameter\n\t\t     name.\n\n\t      -x tab-stop\n\t\t     Expand leading tabs on each line of output in the printed\n\t\t     string assuming a tab stop every tab-stop characters.\n\t\t     This is appropriate for formatting code that may be\n\t\t     indented with tabs.  Note that leading tabs of any\n\t\t     argument to print, not just the first, are expanded, even\n\t\t     if print is using spaces to separate arguments (the\n\t\t     column count is maintained across arguments but may be\n\t\t     incorrect on output owing to previous unexpanded tabs).\n\n\t\t     The start of the output of each print command is assumed\n\t\t     to be aligned with a tab stop.  Widths of multibyte\n\t\t     characters are handled if the option MULTIBYTE is in\n\t\t     effect.  This option is ignored if other formatting\n\t\t     options are in effect, namely column alignment or printf\n\t\t     style, or if output is to a special location such as\n\t\t     shell history or the command line editor.\n\n\t      -X tab-stop\n\t\t     This is similar to -x, except that all tabs in the\n\t\t     printed string are expanded.  This is appropriate if tabs\n\t\t     in the arguments are being used to produce a table\n\t\t     format.\n\n\t      -z     Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack,\n\t\t     separated by spaces.\n\n\t      If any of `-m', `-o' or `-O' are used in combination with `-f'\n\t      and there are no arguments (after the removal process in the\n\t      case of `-m') then nothing is printed.\n\n       printf [ -v name ] format [ arg ... ]\n\t      Print the arguments according to the format specification.\n\t      Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escape\n\t      sequences as for echo are recognised in the format. All C\n\t      conversion specifications ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are\n\t      handled. In addition to this, `%b' can be used instead of `%s'\n\t      to cause escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and\n\t      `%q' can be used to quote the argument in such a way that allows\n\t      it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format\n\t      specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote\n\t      character, the numeric value of the following character is used\n\t      as the number to print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as\n\t      an arithmetic expression. See the section `Arithmetic\n\t      Evaluation' in zshmisc(1) for a description of arithmetic\n\t      expressions. With `%n', the corresponding argument is taken as\n\t      an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.\n\n\t      Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument\n\t      in order but they can explicitly specify the nth argument is to\n\t      be used by replacing `%' by `%n$' and `*' by `*n$'.  It is\n\t      recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit\n\t      style with the normal style and the handling of such mixed\n\t      styles may be subject to future change.\n\n\t      If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string\n\t      is reused until all arguments have been consumed. With the print\n\t      builtin, this can be suppressed by using the -r option. If more\n\t      arguments are required by the format than have been specified,\n\t      the behaviour is as if zero or an empty string had been\n\t      specified as the argument.\n\n\t      The -v option causes the output to be stored as the value of the\n\t      parameter name, instead of printed. If name is an array and the\n\t      format string is reused when consuming arguments then one array\n\t      element will be used for each use of the format string.\n\n       pushd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ]\n       pushd [ -qsLP ] old new\n       pushd [ -qsLP ] {+|-}n\n\t      Change the current directory, and push the old current directory\n\t      onto the directory stack.  In the first form, change the current\n\t      directory to arg.  If arg is not specified, change to the second\n\t      directory on the stack (that is, exchange the top two entries),\n\t      or change to $HOME if the PUSHD_TO_HOME option is set or if\n\t      there is only one entry on the stack.  Otherwise, arg is\n\t      interpreted as it would be by cd.  The meaning of old and new in\n\t      the second form is also the same as for cd.\n\n\t      The third form of pushd changes directory by rotating the\n\t      directory list.  An argument of the form `+n' identifies a stack\n\t      entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the dirs\n\t      command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form `-n'\n\t      counts from the right.  If the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the\n\t      meanings of `+' and `-' in this context are swapped.\n\n\t      If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function chpwd\n\t      and the functions in the array $chpwd_functions are not called,\n\t      and the new directory stack is not printed.  This is useful for\n\t      calls to pushd that do not change the environment seen by an\n\t      interactive user.\n\n\t      If the option -q is not specified and the shell option\n\t      PUSHD_SILENT is not set, the directory stack will be printed\n\t      after a pushd is performed.\n\n\t      The options -s, -L and -P have the same meanings as for the cd\n\t      builtin.\n\n       pushln [ arg ... ]\n\t      Equivalent to print -nz.\n\n       pwd [ -rLP ]\n\t      Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.\n\t      If the -r or the -P flag is specified, or the CHASE_LINKS option\n\t      is set and the -L flag is not given, the printed path will not\n\t      contain symbolic links.\n\n       r      Same as fc -e -."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nset [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o [ option_name ] ] ... [ {+|-}A [ name ] ]\n\t   [ arg ... ]\n\t      Set the options for the shell and/or set the positional\n\t      parameters, or declare and set an array.\tIf the -s option is\n\t      given, it causes the specified arguments to be sorted before\n\t      assigning them to the positional parameters (or to the array\n\t      name if -A is used).  With +s sort arguments in descending\n\t      order.  For the meaning of the other flags, see zshoptions(1).\n\t      Flags may be specified by name using the -o option. If no option\n\t      name is supplied with -o, the current option states are printed:\n\t      see the description of setopt below for more information on the\n\t      format.  With +o they are printed in a form that can be used as\n\t      input to the shell.\n\n\t      If the -A flag is specified, name is set to an array containing\n\t      the given args; if no name is specified, all arrays are printed\n\t      together with their values.\n\n\t      If +A is used and name is an array, the given arguments will\n\t      replace the initial elements of that array; if no name is\n\t      specified, all arrays are printed without their values.\n\n\t      The behaviour of arguments after -A name or +A name depends on\n\t      whether the option KSH_ARRAYS is set.  If it is not set, all\n\t      arguments following name are treated as values for the array,\n\t      regardless of their form.  If the option is set, normal option\n\t      processing continues at that point; only regular arguments are\n\t      treated as values for the array.\tThis means that\n\n\t\t     set -A array -x -- foo\n\n\t      sets array to `-x -- foo' if KSH_ARRAYS is not set, but sets the\n\t      array to foo and turns on the option `-x' if it is set.\n\n\t      If the -A flag is not present, but there are arguments beyond\n\t      the options, the positional parameters are set.  If the option\n\t      list (if any) is terminated by `--', and there are no further\n\t      arguments, the positional parameters will be unset.\n\n\t      If no arguments and no `--' are given, then the names and values\n\t      of all parameters are printed on the standard output.  If the\n\t      only argument is `+', the names of all parameters are printed.\n\n\t      For historical reasons, `set -' is treated as `set +xv' and `set\n\t      - args' as `set +xv -- args' when in any other emulation mode\n\t      than zsh's native mode.\n\n       setcap See the section `The zsh/cap Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option_name ] [ -m ] [ name ... ]\n\t      Set the options for the shell.  All options specified either\n\t      with flags or by name are set.\n\n\t      If no arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently\n\t      set are printed.\tThe form is chosen so as to minimize the\n\t      differences from the default options for the current emulation\n\t      (the default emulation being native zsh, shown as <Z> in\n\t      zshoptions(1)).  Options that are on by default for the\n\t      emulation are shown with the prefix no only if they are off,\n\t      while other options are shown without the prefix no and only if\n\t      they are on.  In addition to options changed from the default\n\t      state by the user, any options activated automatically by the\n\t      shell (for example, SHIN_STDIN or INTERACTIVE) will be shown in\n\t      the list.  The format is further modified by the option\n\t      KSH_OPTION_PRINT, however the rationale for choosing options\n\t      with or without the no prefix remains the same in this case.\n\n\t      If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns\n\t      (which should be quoted to protect them from filename\n\t      expansion), and all options with names matching these patterns\n\t      are set.\n\n\t      Note that a bad option name does not cause execution of\n\t      subsequent shell code to be aborted; this is behaviour is\n\t      different from that of `set -o'.\tThis is because set is\n\t      regarded as a special builtin by the POSIX standard, but setopt\n\t      is not.\n\n       shift [ -p ] [ n ] [ name ... ]\n\t      The positional parameters ${n+1} ... are renamed to $1 ...,\n\t      where n is an arithmetic expression that defaults to 1.  If any\n\t      names are given then the arrays with these names are shifted\n\t      instead of the positional parameters.\n\n\t      If the option -p is given arguments are instead removed (popped)\n\t      from the end rather than the start of the array.\n\n       source file [ arg ... ]\n\t      Same as `.', except that the current directory is always\n\t      searched and is always searched first, before directories in\n\t      $path.\n\n       stat   See the section `The zsh/stat Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       suspend [ -f ]\n\t      Suspend the execution of the shell (send it a SIGTSTP) until it\n\t      receives a SIGCONT.  Unless the -f option is given, this will\n\t      refuse to suspend a login shell.\n\n       test [ arg ... ]\n       [ [ arg ... ] ]\n\t      Like the system version of test.\tAdded for compatibility; use\n\t      conditional expressions instead (see the section `Conditional\n\t      Expressions').  The main differences between the conditional\n\t      expression syntax and the test and [ builtins are:  these\n\t      commands are not handled syntactically, so for example an empty\n\t      variable expansion may cause an argument to be omitted; syntax\n\t      errors cause status 2 to be returned instead of a shell error;\n\t      and arithmetic operators expect integer arguments rather than\n\t      arithmetic expressions.\n\n\t      The command attempts to implement POSIX and its extensions where\n\t      these are specified.  Unfortunately there are intrinsic\n\t      ambiguities in the syntax; in particular there is no distinction\n\t      between test operators and strings that resemble them.  The\n\t      standard attempts to resolve these for small numbers of\n\t      arguments (up to four); for five or more arguments compatibility\n\t      cannot be relied on.  Users are urged wherever possible to use\n\t      the `[[' test syntax which does not have these ambiguities.\n\n       times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and\n\t      for processes run from the shell.\n\n       trap [ arg ] [ sig ... ]\n\t      arg is a series of commands (usually quoted to protect it from\n\t      immediate evaluation by the shell) to be read and executed when\n\t      the shell receives any of the signals specified by one or more\n\t      sig args.  Each sig can be given as a number, or as the name of\n\t      a signal either with or without the string SIG in front (e.g. 1,\n\t      HUP, and SIGHUP are all the same signal).\n\n\t      If arg is `-', then the specified signals are reset to their\n\t      defaults, or, if no sig args are present, all traps are reset.\n\n\t      If arg is an empty string, then the specified signals are\n\t      ignored by the shell (and by the commands it invokes).\n\n\t      If arg is omitted but one or more sig args are provided (i.e.\n\t      the first argument is a valid signal number or name), the effect\n\t      is the same as if arg had been specified as `-'.\n\n\t      The trap command with no arguments prints a list of commands\n\t      associated with each signal.\n\n\t      If sig is ZERR then arg will be executed after each command with\n\t      a nonzero exit status.  ERR is an alias for ZERR on systems that\n\t      have no SIGERR signal (this is the usual case).\n\n\t      If sig is DEBUG then arg will be executed before each command if\n\t      the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set (as it is by default), else\n\t      after each command.  Here, a `command' is what is described as a\n\t      `sublist' in the shell grammar, see the section SIMPLE COMMANDS\n\t      & PIPELINES in zshmisc(1).  If DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set various\n\t      additional features are available.  First, it is possible to\n\t      skip the next command by setting the option ERR_EXIT; see the\n\t      description of the ERR_EXIT option in zshoptions(1).  Also, the\n\t      shell parameter ZSH_DEBUG_CMD is set to the string corresponding\n\t      to the command to be executed following the trap.  Note that\n\t      this string is reconstructed from the internal format and may\n\t      not be formatted the same way as the original text.  The\n\t      parameter is unset after the trap is executed.\n\n\t      If sig is 0 or EXIT and the trap statement is executed inside\n\t      the body of a function, then the command arg is executed after\n\t      the function completes.  The value of $? at the start of\n\t      execution is the exit status of the shell or the return status\n\t      of the function exiting.\tIf sig is 0 or EXIT and the trap\n\t      statement is not executed inside the body of a function, then\n\t      the command arg is executed when the shell terminates; the trap\n\t      runs before any zshexit hook functions.\n\n\t      ZERR, DEBUG, and EXIT traps are not executed inside other traps.\n\t      ZERR and DEBUG traps are kept within subshells, while other\n\t      traps are reset.\n\n\t      Note that traps defined with the trap builtin are slightly\n\t      different from those defined as `TRAPNAL () { ... }', as the\n\t      latter have their own function environment (line numbers, local\n\t      variables, etc.) while the former use the environment of the\n\t      command in which they were called.  For example,\n\n\t\t     trap 'print $LINENO' DEBUG\n\n\t      will print the line number of a command executed after it has\n\t      run, while\n\n\t\t     TRAPDEBUG() { print $LINENO; }\n\n\t      will always print the number zero.\n\n\t      Alternative signal names are allowed as described under kill\n\t      above.  Defining a trap under either name causes any trap under\n\t      an alternative name to be removed.  However, it is recommended\n\t      that for consistency users stick exclusively to one name or\n\t      another.\n\n       true [ arg ... ]\n\t      Do nothing and return an exit status of 0.\n\n       ttyctl [ -fu ]\n\t      The -f option freezes the tty (i.e. terminal or terminal\n\t      emulator), and -u unfreezes it.  When the tty is frozen, no\n\t      changes made to the tty settings by external programs will be\n\t      honored by the shell, except for changes in the size of the\n\t      screen; the shell will simply reset the settings to their\n\t      previous values as soon as each command exits or is suspended.\n\t      Thus, stty and similar programs have no effect when the tty is\n\t      frozen.  Freezing the tty does not cause the current state to be\n\t      remembered: instead, it causes future changes to the state to be\n\t      blocked.\n\n\t      Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or\n\t      not.\n\n\t      Note that, regardless of whether the tty is frozen or not, the\n\t      shell needs to change the settings when the line editor starts,\n\t      so unfreezing the tty does not guarantee settings made on the\n\t      command line are preserved.  Strings of commands run between\n\t      editing the command line will see a consistent tty state.  See\n\t      also the shell variable STTY for a means of initialising the tty\n\t      before running external commands and/or freezing the tty around\n\t      a single command.\n\n       type [ -wfpamsS ] name ...\n\t      Equivalent to whence -v."

When inside a function, a new parameter\n\t      is created for every name (even those that already exist), and\n\t      is unset again when the function completes.  See `Local\n\t      Parameters' in zshparam(1).  The same rules apply to special\n\t      shell parameters, which retain their special attributes when\n\t      made local.\n\n\t      For each name=value assignment, the parameter name is set to\n\t      value.  If the assignment is omitted and name does not refer to\n\t      an existing parameter, a new parameter is intialized to empty\n\t      string, zero, or empty array (as appropriate), unless the shell\n\t      option TYPESET_TO_UNSET is set.  When that option is set, the\n\t      parameter attributes are recorded but the parameter remains\n\t      unset.\n\n\t      If the shell option TYPESET_SILENT is not set, for each\n\t      remaining name that refers to a parameter that is already set,\n\t      the name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of\n\t      an assignment.  Nothing is printed for newly-created parameters,\n\t      or when any attribute flags listed below are given along with\n\t      the name.  Using `+' instead of minus to introduce an attribute\n\t      turns it off.\n\n\t      If no name is present, the names and values of all parameters\n\t      are printed.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the\n\t      display to only those parameters that have the specified\n\t      attributes, and using `+' rather than `-' to introduce the flag\n\t      suppresses printing of the values of parameters when there is no\n\t      parameter name.\n\n\t      All forms of the command handle scalar assignment.  Array\n\t      assignment is possible if any of the reserved words declare,\n\t      export, float, integer, local, readonly or typeset is matched\n\t      when the line is parsed (N.B. not when it is executed).  In this\n\t      case the arguments are parsed as assignments, except that the\n\t      `+=' syntax and the GLOB_ASSIGN option are not supported, and\n\t      scalar values after = are not split further into words, even if\n\t      expanded (regardless of the setting of the KSH_TYPESET option;\n\t      this option is obsolete).\n\n\t      Examples of the differences between command and reserved word\n\t      parsing:\n\n\t\t     # Reserved word parsing\n\t\t     typeset svar=$(echo one word) avar=(several words)\n\n\t      The above creates a scalar parameter svar and an array parameter\n\t      avar as if the assignments had been\n\n\t\t     svar=\"one word\"\n\t\t     avar=(several words)\n\n\t      On the other hand:\n\n\t\t     # Normal builtin interface\n\t\t     builtin typeset svar=$(echo two words)\n\n\t      The builtin keyword causes the above to use the standard builtin\n\t      interface to typeset in which argument parsing is performed in\n\t      the same way as for other commands.  This example creates a\n\t      scalar svar containing the value two and another scalar\n\t      parameter words with no value.  An array value in this case\n\t      would either cause an error or be treated as an obscure set of\n\t      glob qualifiers.\n\n\t      Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of\n\t      assignments after command line expansion; however, these only\n\t      perform scalar assignment:\n\n\t\t     var='svar=val'\n\t\t     typeset $var\n\n\t      The above sets the scalar parameter svar to the value val.\n\t      Parentheses around the value within var would not cause array\n\t      assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when\n\t      $var is substituted.  Any non-trivial expansion in the name part\n\t      of the assignment causes the argument to be treated in this\n\t      fashion:\n\n\t\t     typeset {var1,var2,var3}=name\n\n\t      The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of\n\t      setting the three parameters to the same value, but the command\n\t      line is parsed as a set of three normal command line arguments\n\t      to typeset after expansion.  Hence it is not possible to assign\n\t      to multiple arrays by this means.\n\n\t      Note that each interface to any of the commands may be disabled\n\t      separately.  For example, `disable -r typeset' disables the\n\t      reserved word interface to typeset, exposing the builtin\n\t      interface, while `disable typeset' disables the builtin.\tNote\n\t      that disabling the reserved word interface for typeset may cause\n\t      problems with the output of `typeset -p', which assumes the\n\t      reserved word interface is available in order to restore array\n\t      and associative array values.\n\n\t      Unlike parameter assignment statements, typeset's exit status on\n\t      an assignment that involves a command substitution does not\n\t      reflect the exit status of the command substitution.  Therefore,\n\t      to test for an error in a command substitution, separate the\n\t      declaration of the parameter from its initialization:\n\n\t\t     # WRONG\n\t\t     typeset var1=$(exit 1) || echo \"Trouble with var1\"\n\n\t\t     # RIGHT\n\t\t     typeset var1 && var1=$(exit 1) || echo \"Trouble with var1\""

If\n\t\t     the module modalias is ever subsequently requested,\n\t\t     either via a call to zmodload or implicitly, the shell\n\t\t     will attempt to load module instead.  If module is not\n\t\t     given, show the definition of modalias.  If no arguments\n\t\t     are given, list all defined module aliases.  When\n\t\t     listing, if the -L flag was also given, list the\n\t\t     definition as a zmodload command to recreate the alias.\n\n\t\t     The existence of aliases for modules is completely\n\t\t     independent of whether the name resolved is actually\n\t\t     loaded as a module: while the alias exists, loading and\n\t\t     unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same\n\t\t     effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect\n\t\t     the connection between the alias and the resolved name\n\t\t     which can be removed either by zmodload -R or by\n\t\t     redefining the alias.  Chains of aliases (i.e. where the\n\t\t     first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long\n\t\t     as these are not circular.  As the aliases take the same\n\t\t     format as module names, they may include path separators:\n\t\t     in this case, there is no requirement for any part of the\n\t\t     path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first.\n\t\t     For example, `any/old/alias' is always a valid alias.\n\n\t\t     Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added\n\t\t     to the resolved module; these remain if the alias is\n\t\t     removed.  It is valid to create an alias whose name is\n\t\t     one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to a\n\t\t     different module.\tHowever, if a module has dependencies,\n\t\t     it will not be possible to use the module name as an\n\t\t     alias as the module will already be marked as a loadable\n\t\t     module in its own right.\n\n\t\t     Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the zmodload\n\t\t     command anywhere module names are required.  However,\n\t\t     aliases will not be shown in lists of loaded modules with\n\t\t     a bare `zmodload'.\n\n\t      zmodload -R modalias ...\n\t\t     For each modalias argument that was previously defined as\n\t\t     a module alias via zmodload -A, delete the alias.\tIf any\n\t\t     was not defined, an error is caused and the remainder of\n\t\t     the line is ignored.\n\n\t      Note that zsh makes no distinction between modules that were\n\t      linked into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically.\n\t      In both cases this builtin command has to be used to make\n\t      available the builtins and other things defined by modules\n\t      (unless the module is autoloaded on these definitions). This is\n\t      true even for systems that don't support dynamic loading of\n\t      modules.\n\n       zparseopts\n\t      See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       zprof  See the section `The zsh/zprof Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       zpty   See the section `The zsh/zpty Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       zregexparse\n\t      See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       zsocket\n\t      See the section `The zsh/net/socket Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       zstyle See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       ztcp   See the section `The zsh/net/tcp Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\nNAME\n       zshzle - zsh command line editor\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       If the ZLE option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells)\n       and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user is able to\n       edit command lines.\n\n       There are two display modes.  The first, multiline mode, is the\n       default.  It only works if the TERM parameter is set to a valid\n       terminal type that can move the cursor up.  The second, single line\n       mode, is used if TERM is invalid or incapable of moving the cursor up,\n       or if the SINGLE_LINE_ZLE option is set.  This mode is similar to ksh,\n       and uses no termcap sequences.  If TERM is \"emacs\", the ZLE option will\n       be unset by default.\n\n       The parameters BAUD, COLUMNS, and LINES are also used by the line\n       editor. See Parameters Used By The Shell in zshparam(1).\n\n       The parameter zle_highlight is also used by the line editor; see\n       Character Highlighting below.  Highlighting of special characters and\n       the region between the cursor and the mark (as set with\n       set-mark-command in Emacs mode, or by visual-mode in Vi mode) is\n       enabled by default; consult this reference for more information.\n       Irascible conservatives will wish to know that all highlighting may be\n       disabled by the following setting:\n\n\t      zle_highlight=(none)\n\n       In many places, references are made to the numeric argument.  This can\n       by default be entered in emacs mode by holding the alt key and typing a\n       number, or pressing escape before each digit, and in vi command mode by\n       typing the number before entering a command.  Generally the numeric\n       argument causes the next command entered to be repeated the specified\n       number of times, unless otherwise noted below; this is implemented by\n       the digit-argument widget. See also the Arguments subsection of the\n       Widgets section for some other ways the numeric argument can be\n       modified.\n\nKEYMAPS\n       A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences and\n       ZLE commands.  The empty key sequence cannot be bound.\n\n       There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one\n       or more names.  If all of a keymap's names are deleted, it disappears.\n       bindkey can be used to manipulate keymap names.\n\n       Initially, there are eight keymaps:\n\n       emacs  EMACS emulation\n       viins  vi emulation - insert mode\n       vicmd  vi emulation - command mode\n       viopp  vi emulation - operator pending\n       visual vi emulation - selection active\n       isearch\n\t      incremental search mode\n       command\n\t      read a command name\n       .safe  fallback keymap\n\n       The `.safe' keymap is special.  It can never be altered, and the name\n       can never be removed.  However, it can be linked to other names, which\n       can be removed.\tIn the future other special keymaps may be added;\n       users should avoid using names beginning with `.' for their own\n       keymaps.\n\n       In addition to these names, either `emacs' or `viins' is also linked to\n       the name `main'.  If one of the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables\n       contain the string `vi' when the shell starts up then it will be\n       `viins', otherwise it will be `emacs'.  bindkey's -e and -v options\n       provide a convenient way to override this default choice.\n\n       When the editor starts up, it will select the `main' keymap.  If that\n       keymap doesn't exist, it will use `.safe' instead.\n\n       In the `.safe' keymap, each single key is bound to self-insert, except\n       for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to accept-line.\n       This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it means\n       you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back.\n\n   Reading Commands\n       When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence\n       that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound\n       string.\tIn this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more\n       characters are typed, and if not (or they don't match any longer\n       string) it will execute the binding.  This timeout is defined by the\n       KEYTIMEOUT parameter; its default is 0.4 sec.  There is no timeout if\n       the prefix string is not itself bound to a command.\n\n       The key timeout is also applied when ZLE is reading the bytes from a\n       multibyte character string when it is in the appropriate mode.  (This\n       requires that the shell was compiled with multibyte mode enabled;\n       typically also the locale has characters with the UTF-8 encoding,\n       although any multibyte encoding known to the operating system is\n       supported.)  If the second or a subsequent byte is not read within the\n       timeout period, the shell acts as if ? were typed and resets the input\n       state.\n\n       As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings,\n       by using `bindkey -s'.  When such a sequence is read, the replacement\n       string is pushed back as input, and the command reading process starts\n       again using these fake keystrokes.  This input can itself invoke\n       further replacement strings, but in order to detect loops the process\n       will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements without a real\n       command being read.\n\n       A key sequence typed by the user can be turned into a command name for\n       use in user-defined widgets with the read-command widget, described in\n       the subsection `Miscellaneous' of the section `Standard Widgets' below.\n\n   Local Keymaps\n       While for normal editing a single keymap is used exclusively, in many\n       modes a local keymap allows for some keys to be customised. For\n       example, in an incremental search mode, a binding in the isearch keymap\n       will override a binding in the main keymap but all keys that are not\n       overridden can still be used.\n\n       If a key sequence is defined in a local keymap, it will hide a key\n       sequence in the global keymap that is a prefix of that sequence. An\n       example of this occurs with the binding of iw in viopp as this hides\n       the binding of i in vicmd. However, a longer sequence in the global\n       keymap that shares the same prefix can still apply so for example the\n       binding of ^Xa in the global keymap will be unaffected by the binding\n       of ^Xb in the local keymap.\n\nZLE BUILTINS\n       The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The bindkey\n       command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the vared command invokes\n       ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the zle command manipulates\n       editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from\n       within shell functions.\n\n       bindkey [ options ] -l [ -L ] [ keymap ... ]\n       bindkey [ options ] -d\n       bindkey [ options ] -D keymap ...\n       bindkey [ options ] -A old-keymap new-keymap\n       bindkey [ options ] -N new-keymap [ old-keymap ]\n       bindkey [ options ] -m\n       bindkey [ options ] -r in-string ...\n       bindkey [ options ] -s in-string out-string ...\n       bindkey [ options ] in-string command ...\n       bindkey [ options ] [ in-string ]\n\t      bindkey's options can be divided into three categories: keymap\n\t      selection for the current command, operation selection, and\n\t      others.  The keymap selection options are:\n\n\t      -e     Selects keymap `emacs' for any operations by the current\n\t\t     command, and also links `emacs' to `main' so that it is\n\t\t     selected by default the next time the editor starts.\n\n\t      -v     Selects keymap `viins' for any operations by the current\n\t\t     command, and also links `viins' to `main' so that it is\n\t\t     selected by default the next time the editor starts.\n\n\t      -a     Selects keymap `vicmd' for any operations by the current\n\t\t     command.\n\n\t      -M keymap\n\t\t     The keymap specifies a keymap name that is selected for\n\t\t     any operations by the current command.\n\n\t      If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above\n\t      are used, the `main' keymap is used.  Some operations do not\n\t      permit a keymap to be selected, namely:\n\n\t      -l     List all existing keymap names; if any arguments are\n\t\t     given, list just those keymaps.\n\n\t\t     If the -L option is also used, list in the form of\n\t\t     bindkey commands to create or link the keymaps.  `bindkey\n\t\t     -lL main' shows which keymap is linked to `main', if any,\n\t\t     and hence if the standard emacs or vi emulation is in\n\t\t     effect.  This option does not show the .safe keymap\n\t\t     because it cannot be created in that fashion; however,\n\t\t     neither is `bindkey -lL .safe' reported as an error, it\n\t\t     simply outputs nothing.\n\n\t      -d     Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default\n\t\t     state.\n\n\t      -D keymap ...\n\t\t     Delete the named keymaps.\n\n\t      -A old-keymap new-keymap\n\t\t     Make the new-keymap name an alias for old-keymap, so that\n\t\t     both names refer to the same keymap.  The names have\n\t\t     equal standing; if either is deleted, the other remains.\n\t\t     If there is already a keymap with the new-keymap name, it\n\t\t     is deleted.\n\n\t      -N new-keymap [ old-keymap ]\n\t\t     Create a new keymap, named new-keymap.  If a keymap\n\t\t     already has that name, it is deleted.  If an old-keymap\n\t\t     name is given, the new keymap is initialized to be a\n\t\t     duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will be empty.\n\n\t      To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to main.\n\t      Hence the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap\n\t      `mymap' initialized from the emacs keymap (which remains\n\t      unchanged) is:\n\n\t\t     bindkey -N mymap emacs\n\t\t     bindkey -A mymap main\n\n\t      Note that while `bindkey -A newmap main' will work when newmap\n\t      is emacs or viins, it will not work for vicmd, as switching from\n\t      vi insert to command mode becomes impossible.\n\n\t      The following operations act on the `main' keymap if no keymap\n\t      selection option was given:\n\n\t      -m     Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the selected\n\t\t     keymap.  Only keys that are unbound or bound to\n\t\t     self-insert are affected.\n\n\t      -r in-string ...\n\t\t     Unbind the specified in-strings in the selected keymap.\n\t\t     This is exactly equivalent to binding the strings to\n\t\t     undefined-key.\n\n\t\t     When -R is also used, interpret the in-strings as ranges.\n\n\t\t     When -p is also used, the in-strings specify prefixes.\n\t\t     Any binding that has the given in-string as a prefix, not\n\t\t     including the binding for the in-string itself, if any,\n\t\t     will be removed.  For example,\n\n\t\t\t    bindkey -rpM viins '^['\n\n\t\t     will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap\n\t\t     beginning with an escape character (probably cursor\n\t\t     keys), but leave the binding for the escape character\n\t\t     itself (probably vi-cmd-mode).  This is incompatible with\n\t\t     the option -R.\n\n\t      -s in-string out-string ...\n\t\t     Bind each in-string to each out-string.  When in-string\n\t\t     is typed, out-string will be pushed back and treated as\n\t\t     input to the line editor.\tWhen -R is also used,\n\t\t     interpret the in-strings as ranges.\n\n\t\t     Note that both in-string and out-string are subject to\n\t\t     the same form of interpretation, as described below.\n\n\t      in-string command ...\n\t\t     Bind each in-string to each command.  When -R is used,\n\t\t     interpret the in-strings as ranges.\n\n\t      [ in-string ]\n\t\t     List key bindings.  If an in-string is specified, the\n\t\t     binding of that string in the selected keymap is\n\t\t     displayed.  Otherwise, all key bindings in the selected\n\t\t     keymap are displayed.  (As a special case, if the -e or\n\t\t     -v option is used alone, the keymap is not displayed -\n\t\t     the implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that\n\t\t     happens.)\n\n\t\t     When the option -p is used, the in-string must be\n\t\t     present.  The listing shows all bindings which have the\n\t\t     given key sequence as a prefix, not including any\n\t\t     bindings for the key sequence itself.\n\n\t\t     When the -L option is used, the list is in the form of\n\t\t     bindkey commands to create the key bindings.\n\n\t      When the -R option is used as noted above, a valid range\n\t      consists of two characters, with an optional `-' between them.\n\t      All characters between the two specified, inclusive, are bound\n\t      as specified.\n\n\t      For either in-string or out-string, the following escape\n\t      sequences are recognised:\n\n\t      \\a     bell character\n\t      \\b     backspace\n\t      \\e, \\E escape\n\t      \\f     form feed\n\t      \\n     linefeed (newline)\n\t      \\r     carriage return\n\t      \\t     horizontal tab\n\t      \\v     vertical tab\n\t      \\NNN   character code in octal\n\t      \\xNN   character code in hexadecimal\n\t      \\uNNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal\n\t      \\UNNNNNNNN\n\t\t     unicode character code in hexadecimal\n\t      \\M[-]X character with meta bit set\n\t      \\C[-]X control character\n\t      ^X     control character\n\n\t      In all other cases, `\\' escapes the following character.\tDelete\n\t      is written as `^?'.  Note that `\\M^?' and `^\\M?' are not the\n\t      same, and that (unlike emacs), the bindings `\\M-X' and `\\eX' are\n\t      entirely distinct, although they are initialized to the same\n\t      bindings by `bindkey -m'."

As of this writing, widget handlers only\n\t\t     support a single argument and thus are never passed a\n\t\t     string for error state, so widgets must be prepared to\n\t\t     test the descriptor themselves.\n\n\t\t     If either type of handler produces output to the\n\t\t     terminal, it should call `zle -I' before doing so (see\n\t\t     below).

Then a handler is installed which simply\n\t\t     prints out any data which arrives on this connection.\n\t\t     Note that `select' will indicate that the file descriptor\n\t\t     needs handling if the remote side has closed the\n\t\t     connection; we handle that by testing for a failed read.\n\n\t\t\t    if ztcp pwspc 2811; then\n\t\t\t      tcpfd=$REPLY\n\t\t\t      handler() {\n\t\t\t\tzle -I\n\t\t\t\tlocal line\n\t\t\t\tif ! read -r line <&$1; then\n\t\t\t\t  # select marks this fd if we reach EOF,\n\t\t\t\t  # so handle this specially.\n\t\t\t\t  print \"[Read on fd $1 failed, removing.]\" >&2\n\t\t\t\t  zle -F $1\n\t\t\t\t  return 1\n\t\t\t\tfi\n\t\t\t\tprint -r - $line\n\t\t\t      }\n\t\t\t      zle -F $tcpfd handler\n\t\t\t    fi\n\n\t      -I     Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary\n\t\t     widget functions, though it may be used within if normal\n\t\t     output to the terminal is required.  It invalidates the\n\t\t     current zle display in preparation for output; typically\n\t\t     this will be from a trap function.  It has no effect if\n\t\t     zle is not active.  When a trap exits, the shell checks\n\t\t     to see if the display needs restoring, hence the\n\t\t     following will print output in such a way as not to\n\t\t     disturb the line being edited:\n\n\t\t\t    TRAPUSR1() {\n\t\t\t      # Invalidate zle display\n\t\t\t      [[ -o zle ]] && zle -I\n\t\t\t      # Show output\n\t\t\t      print Hello\n\t\t\t    }\n\n\t\t     In general, the trap function may need to test whether\n\t\t     zle is active before using this method (as shown in the\n\t\t     example), since the zsh/zle module may not even be\n\t\t     loaded; if it is not, the command can be skipped.\n\n\t\t     It is possible to call `zle -I' several times before\n\t\t     control is returned to the editor; the display will only\n\t\t     be invalidated the first time to minimise disruption.\n\n\t\t     Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating\n\t\t     the display from within zle widgets; see, for example,\n\t\t     `zle -R' above.\n\n\t\t     The returned status is zero if zle was invalidated, even\n\t\t     though this may have been by a previous call to `zle -I'\n\t\t     or by a system notification.  To test if a zle widget may\n\t\t     be called at this point, execute zle with no arguments\n\t\t     and examine the return status.\n\n\t      -T     This is used to add, list or remove internal\n\t\t     transformations on the processing performed by the line\n\t\t     editor.  It is typically used only for debugging or\n\t\t     testing and is therefore of little interest to the\n\t\t     general user.\n\n\t\t     `zle -T transformation func' specifies that the given\n\t\t     transformation (see below) is effected by shell function\n\t\t     func.\n\n\t\t     `zle -Tr transformation' removes the given transformation\n\t\t     if it was present (it is not an error if none was).\n\n\t\t     `zle -TL' can be used to list all transformations\n\t\t     currently in operation.\n\n\t\t     Currently the only transformation is tc.  This is used\n\t\t     instead of outputting termcap codes to the terminal.\n\t\t     When the transformation is in operation the shell\n\t\t     function is passed the termcap code that would be output\n\t\t     as its first argument; if the operation required a\n\t\t     numeric argument, that is passed as a second argument.\n\t\t     The function should set the shell variable REPLY to the\n\t\t     transformed termcap code.\tTypically this is used to\n\t\t     produce some simply formatted version of the code and\n\t\t     optional argument for debugging or testing.  Note that\n\t\t     this transformation is not applied to other non-printing\n\t\t     characters such as carriage returns and newlines.\n\n\t      widget [ -n num ] [ -f flag ] [ -Nw ] [ -K keymap ] args ...\n\t\t     Invoke the specified widget.  This can only be done when\n\t\t     ZLE is active; normally this will be within a\n\t\t     user-defined widget.\n\n\t\t     With the options -n and -N, the current numeric argument\n\t\t     will be saved and then restored after the call to widget;\n\t\t     `-n num' sets the numeric argument temporarily to num,\n\t\t     while `-N' sets it to the default, i.e. as if there were\n\t\t     none.\n\n\t\t     With the option -K, keymap will be used as the current\n\t\t     keymap during the execution of the widget.  The previous\n\t\t     keymap will be restored when the widget exits.\n\n\t\t     Normally, calling a widget in this way does not set the\n\t\t     special parameter WIDGET and related parameters, so that\n\t\t     the environment appears as if the top-level widget called\n\t\t     by the user were still active.  With the option -w,\n\t\t     WIDGET and related parameters are set to reflect the\n\t\t     widget being executed by the zle call.\n\n\t\t     Normally, when widget returns the special parameter\n\t\t     LASTWIDGET will point to it.  This can be inhibited by\n\t\t     passing the option -f nolast.\n\n\t\t     Any further arguments will be passed to the widget; note\n\t\t     that as standard argument handling is performed, any\n\t\t     general argument list should be preceded by --.  If it is\n\t\t     a shell function, these are passed down as positional\n\t\t     parameters; for builtin widgets it is up to the widget in\n\t\t     question what it does with them.  Currently arguments are\n\t\t     only handled by the incremental-search commands, the\n\t\t     history-search-forward and -backward and the\n\t\t     corresponding functions prefixed by vi-, and by\n\t\t     universal-argument.  No error is flagged if the command\n\t\t     does not use the arguments, or only uses some of them.\n\n\t\t     The return status reflects the success or failure of the\n\t\t     operation carried out by the widget, or if it is a\n\t\t     user-defined widget the return status of the shell\n\t\t     function.\n\n\t\t     A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when\n\t\t     the widget exits, unless the BEEP options was unset or\n\t\t     the widget was called via the zle command.  Thus if a\n\t\t     user defined widget requires an immediate beep, it should\n\t\t     call the beep widget directly.\n\nZLE WIDGETS\n       All actions in the editor are performed by `widgets'.  A widget's job\n       is simply to perform some small action.\tThe ZLE commands that key\n       sequences in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets.  Widgets can be\n       user-defined or built in.\n\n       The standard widgets built into ZLE are listed in the section `Standard\n       Widgets' below.\tOther built-in widgets can be defined by other modules\n       (see zshmodules(1)).  Each built-in widget has two names: its normal\n       canonical name, and the same name preceded by a `.'.  The `.' name is\n       special: it can't be rebound to a different widget.  This makes the\n       widget available even when its usual name has been redefined.\n\n       User-defined widgets are defined using `zle -N', and implemented as\n       shell functions.  When the widget is executed, the corresponding shell\n       function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions.  It\n       is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names starting\n       with `.'.\n\nUSER-DEFINED WIDGETS\n       User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions, can execute\n       any normal shell command.  They can also run other widgets (whether\n       built-in or user-defined) using the zle builtin command. The standard\n       input of the function is redirected from /dev/null to prevent external\n       commands from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the\n       terminal, but read -k or read -q can be used to read characters.\n       Finally, they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by\n       reading and setting the special parameters described below.\n\n       These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but\n       are not in any way special outside ZLE.\tIf they have some normal value\n       outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return\n       when the widget function exits.\tThese special parameters in fact have\n       local scope, like parameters created in a function using local.\n\n       Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active, these\n       parameters are available read-only.\n\n       Note that the parameters appear as local to any ZLE widget in which\n       they appear.  Hence if it is desired to override them this needs to be\n       done within a nested function:\n\n\t      widget-function() {\n\t\t# $WIDGET here refers to the special variable\n\t\t# that is local inside widget-function\n\t\t() {\n\t\t   # This anonymous nested function allows WIDGET\n\t\t   # to be used as a local variable.  The -h\n\t\t   # removes the special status of the variable.\n\t\t   local -h WIDGET\n\t\t}\n\t      }\n\n       BUFFER (scalar)\n\t      The entire contents of the edit buffer.  If it is written to,\n\t      the cursor remains at the same offset, unless that would put it\n\t      outside the buffer.\n\n       BUFFERLINES (integer)\n\t      The number of screen lines needed for the edit buffer currently\n\t      displayed on screen (i.e. without any changes to the preceding\n\t      parameters done after the last redisplay); read-only.\n\n       CONTEXT (scalar)\n\t      The context in which zle was called to read a line; read-only.\n\t      One of the values:\n\n\t      start  The start of a command line (at prompt PS1).\n\n\t      cont   A continuation to a command line (at prompt PS2).\n\n\t      select In a select loop (at prompt PS3).\n\n\t      vared  Editing a variable in vared.\n\n       CURSOR (integer)\n\t      The offset of the cursor, within the edit buffer.  This is in\n\t      the range 0 to $#BUFFER, and is by definition equal to\n\t      $#LBUFFER.  Attempts to move the cursor outside the buffer will\n\t      result in the cursor being moved to the appropriate end of the\n\t      buffer.\n\n       CUTBUFFER (scalar)\n\t      The last item cut using one of the `kill-' commands; the string\n\t      which the next yank would insert in the line.  Later entries in\n\t      the kill ring are in the array killring.\tNote that the command\n\t      `zle copy-region-as-kill string' can be used to set the text of\n\t      the cut buffer from a shell function and cycle the kill ring in\n\t      the same way as interactively killing text.\n\n       HISTNO (integer)\n\t      The current history number.  Setting this has the same effect as\n\t      moving up or down in the history to the corresponding history\n\t      line.  An attempt to set it is ignored if the line is not stored\n\t      in the history.  Note this is not the same as the parameter\n\t      HISTCMD, which always gives the number of the history line being\n\t      added to the main shell's history.  HISTNO refers to the line\n\t      being retrieved within zle.\n\n       ISEARCHMATCH_ACTIVE (integer)\n       ISEARCHMATCH_START (integer)\n       ISEARCHMATCH_END (integer)\n\t      ISEARCHMATCH_ACTIVE indicates whether a part of the BUFFER is\n\t      currently matched by an incremental search pattern.\n\t      ISEARCHMATCH_START and ISEARCHMATCH_END give the location of the\n\t      matched part and are in the same units as CURSOR. They are only\n\t      valid for reading when ISEARCHMATCH_ACTIVE is non-zero.\n\n\t      All parameters are read-only.\n\n       KEYMAP (scalar)\n\t      The name of the currently selected keymap; read-only.\n\n       KEYS (scalar)\n\t      The keys typed to invoke this widget, as a literal string;\n\t      read-only.\n\n       KEYS_QUEUED_COUNT (integer)\n\t      The number of bytes pushed back to the input queue and therefore\n\t      available for reading immediately before any I/O is done;\n\t      read-only.  See also PENDING; the two values are distinct.\n\n       killring (array)\n\t      The array of previously killed items, with the most recently\n\t      killed first.  This gives the items that would be retrieved by a\n\t      yank-pop in the same order.  Note, however, that the most\n\t      recently killed item is in $CUTBUFFER; $killring shows the array\n\t      of previous entries.\n\n\t      The default size for the kill ring is eight, however the length\n\t      may be changed by normal array operations.  Any empty string in\n\t      the kill ring is ignored by the yank-pop command, hence the size\n\t      of the array effectively sets the maximum length of the kill\n\t      ring, while the number of non-zero strings gives the current\n\t      length, both as seen by the user at the command line.\n\n       LASTABORTEDSEARCH (scalar)\n\t      The last search string used by an interactive search that was\n\t      aborted by the user (status 3 returned by the search widget).\n\n       LASTSEARCH (scalar)\n\t      The last search string used by an interactive search; read-only.\n\t      This is set even if the search failed (status 0, 1 or 2 returned\n\t      by the search widget), but not if it was aborted by the user.\n\n       LASTWIDGET (scalar)\n\t      The name of the last widget that was executed; read-only.\n\n       LBUFFER (scalar)\n\t      The part of the buffer that lies to the left of the cursor\n\t      position.  If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is\n\t      replaced, and the cursor remains between the new $LBUFFER and\n\t      the old $RBUFFER.\n\n       MARK (integer)\n\t      Like CURSOR, but for the mark. With vi-mode operators that wait\n\t      for a movement command to select a region of text, setting MARK\n\t      allows the selection to extend in both directions from the\n\t      initial cursor position.\n\n       NUMERIC (integer)\n\t      The numeric argument. If no numeric argument was given, this\n\t      parameter is unset. When this is set inside a widget function,\n\t      builtin widgets called with the zle builtin command will use the\n\t      value assigned. If it is unset inside a widget function, builtin\n\t      widgets called behave as if no numeric argument was given.\n\n       PENDING (integer)\n\t      The number of bytes pending for input, i.e. the number of bytes\n\t      which have already been typed and can immediately be read. On\n\t      systems where the shell is not able to get this information,\n\t      this parameter will always have a value of zero.\tRead-only.\n\t      See also KEYS_QUEUED_COUNT; the two values are distinct.\n\n       PREBUFFER (scalar)\n\t      In a multi-line input at the secondary prompt, this read-only\n\t      parameter contains the contents of the lines before the one the\n\t      cursor is currently in.\n\n       PREDISPLAY (scalar)\n\t      Text to be displayed before the start of the editable text\n\t      buffer.  This does not have to be a complete line; to display a\n\t      complete line, a newline must be appended explicitly.  The text\n\t      is reset on each new invocation (but not recursive invocation)\n\t      of zle.\n\n       POSTDISPLAY (scalar)\n\t      Text to be displayed after the end of the editable text buffer.\n\t      This does not have to be a complete line; to display a complete\n\t      line, a newline must be prepended explicitly.  The text is reset\n\t      on each new invocation (but not recursive invocation) of zle.\n\n       RBUFFER (scalar)\n\t      The part of the buffer that lies to the right of the cursor\n\t      position.  If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is\n\t      replaced, and the cursor remains between the old $LBUFFER and\n\t      the new $RBUFFER.\n\n       REGION_ACTIVE (integer)\n\t      Indicates if the region is currently active.  It can be assigned\n\t      0 or 1 to deactivate and activate the region respectively. A\n\t      value of 2 activates the region in line-wise mode with the\n\t      highlighted text extending for whole lines only; see Character\n\t      Highlighting below.\n\n       region_highlight (array)\n\t      Each element of this array may be set to a string that describes\n\t      highlighting for an arbitrary region of the command line that\n\t      will take effect the next time the command line is redisplayed.\n\t      Highlighting of the non-editable parts of the command line in\n\t      PREDISPLAY and POSTDISPLAY are possible, but note that the P\n\t      flag is needed for character indexing to include PREDISPLAY.\n\n\t      Each string consists of the following whitespace-separated\n\t      parts:\n\n\t      •      Optionally, a `P' to signify that the start and end\n\t\t     offset that follow include any string set by the\n\t\t     PREDISPLAY special parameter; this is needed if the\n\t\t     predisplay string itself is to be highlighted.\n\t\t     Whitespace between the `P' and the start offset is\n\t\t     optional.\n\n\t      •      A start offset in the same units as CURSOR.\n\n\t      •      An end offset in the same units as CURSOR.\n\n\t      •      A highlight specification in the same format as used for\n\t\t     contexts in the parameter zle_highlight, see the section\n\t\t     `Character Highlighting' below; for example, standout or\n\t\t     fg=red,bold.\n\n\t      •      Optionally, a string of the form `memo=token'.  The token\n\t\t     consists of everything between the `=' and the next\n\t\t     whitespace, comma, NUL, or the end of the string.\tThe\n\t\t     token is preserved verbatim but not parsed in any way.\n\n\t\t     Plugins may use this to identify array elements they have\n\t\t     added: for example, a plugin might set token to its (the\n\t\t     plugin's) name and then use `region_highlight=(\n\t\t     ${region_highlight:#*memo=token} )' in order to remove\n\t\t     array elements it have added.\n\n\t\t     (This example uses the `${name:#pattern}' array-grepping\n\t\t     syntax described in the section `Parameter Expansion' in\n\t\t     zshexpn(1).)\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     region_highlight=(\"P0 20 bold memo=foobar\")\n\n\t      specifies that the first twenty characters of the text including\n\t      any predisplay string should be highlighted in bold.\n\n\t      Note that the effect of region_highlight is not saved and\n\t      disappears as soon as the line is accepted.\n\n\t      Note that zsh 5.8 and older do not support the `memo=token'\n\t      field and may misparse the third (highlight specification) field\n\t      when a memo is given."

           special to the shell in any way.  These parameters are used to pass
           information between the completion code and the completion widget. Some
           of the builtin commands and the condition codes use or change the
           current values of these parameters.  Any existing values will be hidden

Without `-P' the string is\n\t\t     inserted before the string given with `-p' or directly\n\t\t     before each match.\n\n\t      -I ignored-suffix\n\t\t     Like -i, but gives an ignored suffix.\n\n\t      -a     With this flag the completions are taken as names of\n\t\t     arrays and the actual completions are their values.  If\n\t\t     only some elements of the arrays are needed, the\n\t\t     completions may also contain subscripts, as in\n\t\t     `foo[2,-1]'.\n\n\t      -k     With this flag the completions are taken as names of\n\t\t     associative arrays and the actual completions are their\n\t\t     keys.  As for -a, the words may also contain subscripts,\n\t\t     as in `foo[(R)*bar*]'.\n\n\t      -d array\n\t\t     This adds per-completion display strings. The array\n\t\t     should contain one element per completion given. The\n\t\t     completion code will then display the first element\n\t\t     instead of the first completion, and so on. The array may\n\t\t     be given as the name of an array parameter or directly as\n\t\t     a space-separated list of words in parentheses.\n\n\t\t     If there are fewer display strings than completions, the\n\t\t     leftover completions will be displayed unchanged and if\n\t\t     there are more display strings than completions, the\n\t\t     leftover display strings will be silently ignored.\n\n\t      -l     This option only has an effect if used together with the\n\t\t     -d option. If it is given, the display strings are listed\n\t\t     one per line, not arrayed in columns.\n\n\t      -o [ order ]\n\t\t     This controls the order in which matches are sorted.\n\t\t     order is a comma-separated list comprising the following\n\t\t     possible values.  These values can be abbreviated to\n\t\t     their initial two or three characters.  Note that the\n\t\t     order forms part of the group name space so matches with\n\t\t     different orderings will not be in the same group.\n\n\t\t     match  If given, the order of the output is determined by\n\t\t\t    the match strings; otherwise it is determined by\n\t\t\t    the display strings (i.e. the strings given by the\n\t\t\t    -d option). This is the default if `-o' is\n\t\t\t    specified but the order argument is omitted.\n\n\t\t     nosort This specifies that the completions are pre-sorted\n\t\t\t    and their order should be preserved.  This value\n\t\t\t    only makes sense alone and cannot be combined with\n\t\t\t    any others.\n\n\t\t     numeric\n\t\t\t    If the matches include numbers, sort them\n\t\t\t    numerically rather than lexicographically.\n\n\t\t     reverse\n\t\t\t    Arrange the matches backwards by reversing the\n\t\t\t    sort ordering.\n\n\t      -J group-name\n\t\t     Gives the name of the group that the matches should be\n\t\t     stored in.\n\n\t      -V group-name\n\t\t     Like -J but naming an unsorted group. This option is\n\t\t     identical to the combination of -J and -o nosort.\n\n\t      -1     If given together with the -V option, makes only\n\t\t     consecutive duplicates in the group be removed. If\n\t\t     combined with the -J option, this has no visible effect.\n\t\t     Note that groups with and without this flag are in\n\t\t     different name spaces.\n\n\t      -2     If given together with the -J or -V option, makes all\n\t\t     duplicates be kept. Again, groups with and without this\n\t\t     flag are in different name spaces.\n\n\t      -X explanation\n\t\t     The explanation string will be printed with the list of\n\t\t     matches, above the group currently selected.\n\n\t\t     Within the explanation, the following sequences may be\n\t\t     used to specify output attributes as described in the\n\t\t     section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1):\n\t\t     `%B', `%S', `%U', `%F', `%K' and their lower case\n\t\t     counterparts, as well as `%{...%}'.  `%F', `%K' and\n\t\t     `%{...%}' take arguments in the same form as prompt\n\t\t     expansion.  (Note that the sequence `%G' is not\n\t\t     available; an argument to `%{' should be used instead.)\n\t\t     The sequence `%%' produces a literal `%'.\n\n\t\t     These sequences are most often employed by users when\n\t\t     customising the format style (see zshcompsys(1)), but\n\t\t     they must also be taken into account when writing\n\t\t     completion functions, as passing descriptions with\n\t\t     unescaped `%' characters to utility functions such as\n\t\t     _arguments and _message may produce unexpected results.\n\t\t     If arbitrary text is to be passed in a description, it\n\t\t     can be escaped using e.g. ${my_str//\\%/%%}.\n\n\t      -x message\n\t\t     Like -X, but the message will be printed even if there\n\t\t     are no matches in the group.\n\n\t      -q     The suffix given with -S will be automatically removed if\n\t\t     the next character typed is a blank or does not insert\n\t\t     anything, or if the suffix consists of only one character\n\t\t     and the next character typed is the same character.\n\n\t      -r remove-chars\n\t\t     This is a more versatile form of the -q option.  The\n\t\t     suffix given with -S or the slash automatically added\n\t\t     after completing directories will be automatically\n\t\t     removed if the next character typed inserts one of the\n\t\t     characters given in the remove-chars.  This string is\n\t\t     parsed as a characters class and understands the\n\t\t     backslash sequences used by the print command.  For\n\t\t     example, `-r \"a-z\\t\"' removes the suffix if the next\n\t\t     character typed inserts a lower case character or a TAB,\n\t\t     and `-r \"^0-9\"' removes the suffix if the next character\n\t\t     typed inserts anything but a digit. One extra backslash\n\t\t     sequence is understood in this string: `\\-' stands for\n\t\t     all characters that insert nothing. Thus `-S \"=\" -q' is\n\t\t     the same as `-S \"=\" -r \"= \\t\\n\\-\"'.\n\n\t\t     This option may also be used without the -S option; then\n\t\t     any automatically added space will be removed when one of\n\t\t     the characters in the list is typed.\n\n\t      -R remove-func\n\t\t     This is another form of the -r option. When a match has\n\t\t     been accepted and a suffix has been inserted, the\n\t\t     function remove-func will be called after the next\n\t\t     character typed.  It is passed the length of the suffix\n\t\t     as an argument and can use the special parameters\n\t\t     available in ordinary (non-completion) zle widgets (see\n\t\t     zshzle(1)) to analyse and modify the command line.\n\n\t      -f     If this flag is given, all of the matches built from the\n\t\t     completions are marked as being the names of files.  They\n\t\t     are not required to be actual filenames, but if they are,\n\t\t     and the option LIST_TYPES is set, the characters\n\t\t     describing the types of the files in the completion lists\n\t\t     will be shown. This also forces a slash to be added when\n\t\t     the name of a directory is completed.\n\n\t      -e     This flag can be used to tell the completion code that\n\t\t     the matches added are parameter names for a parameter\n\t\t     expansion. This will make the AUTO_PARAM_SLASH and\n\t\t     AUTO_PARAM_KEYS options be used for the matches.\n\n\t      -W file-prefix\n\t\t     This string is a pathname that will be prepended to each\n\t\t     match together with any prefix specified by the -p option\n\t\t     to form a complete filename for testing.  Hence it is\n\t\t     only useful if combined with the -f flag, as the tests\n\t\t     will not otherwise be performed.\n\n\t      -F array\n\t\t     Specifies an array containing patterns.  completions that\n\t\t     match one of these patterns are ignored, that is, not\n\t\t     considered to be matches.\n\n\t\t     The array may be the name of an array parameter or a list\n\t\t     of literal patterns enclosed in parentheses and quoted,\n\t\t     as in `-F \"(*?.o *?.h)\"'. If the name of an array is\n\t\t     given, the elements of the array are taken as the\n\t\t     patterns.\n\n\t      -Q     This flag instructs the completion code not to quote any\n\t\t     metacharacters in the matches when inserting them into\n\t\t     the command line.\n\n\t      -M match-spec\n\t\t     This gives local match specifications as described below\n\t\t     in the section `Completion Matching Control'. This option\n\t\t     may be given more than once.  In this case all\n\t\t     match-specs given are concatenated with spaces between\n\t\t     them to form the specification string to use.  Note that\n\t\t     they will only be used if the -U option is not given.\n\n\t      -n     Specifies that matching completions are to be added to\n\t\t     the set of matches, but are not to be listed to the user.\n\n\t      -U     If this flag is given, all completions are added to the\n\t\t     set of matches and no matching will be done by the\n\t\t     completion code. Normally this is used in functions that\n\t\t     do the matching themselves.\n\n\t      -O array\n\t\t     If this option is given, the completions are not added to\n\t\t     the set of matches.  Instead, matching is done as usual\n\t\t     and all of the completions that match will be stored in\n\t\t     the array parameter whose name is given as array.\n\n\t      -A array\n\t\t     As the -O option, except that instead of those of the\n\t\t     completions which match being stored in array, the\n\t\t     strings generated internally by the completion code are\n\t\t     stored.  For example, with a match specification of `-M\n\t\t     \"L:|no=\"', a current word of `nof' and completions of\n\t\t     `foo', this option stores the string `nofoo' in the\n\t\t     array, whereas the -O option stores the `foo' originally\n\t\t     given.\n\n\t      -D array\n\t\t     As with -O, the completions are not added to the set of\n\t\t     matches.  Instead, whenever the nth completion does not\n\t\t     match, the nth element of the array is removed.  Elements\n\t\t     for which the corresponding completion matches are\n\t\t     retained.\tThis option can be used more than once to\n\t\t     remove elements from multiple arrays.\n\n\t      -C     This option adds a special match which expands to all\n\t\t     other matches when inserted into the line, even those\n\t\t     that are added after this option is used.\tTogether with\n\t\t     the -d option it is possible to specify a string that\n\t\t     should be displayed in the list for this special match.\n\t\t     If no string is given, it will be shown as a string\n\t\t     containing the strings that would be inserted for the\n\t\t     other matches, truncated to the width of the screen.\n\n\t      -E number\n\t\t     This option adds number empty matches after matching\n\t\t     completions have been added.  An empty match takes up\n\t\t     space in completion listings but will never be inserted\n\t\t     in the line and can't be selected with menu completion or\n\t\t     menu selection.  This makes empty matches only useful to\n\t\t     format completion lists and to make explanatory string be\n\t\t     shown in completion lists (since empty matches can be\n\t\t     given display strings with the -d option).  And because\n\t\t     all but one empty string would otherwise be removed, this\n\t\t     option implies the -V and -2 options (even if an explicit\n\t\t     -J option is given).  This can be important to note as it\n\t\t     affects the name space into which matches are added.\n\n\t      -\n\t      --     This flag ends the list of flags and options. All\n\t\t     arguments after it will be taken as the completions even\n\t\t     if they begin with hyphens.\n\n\t      Except for the -M flag, if any of these flags is given more than\n\t      once, the first one (and its argument) will be used.\n\n       compset -p number\n       compset -P [ number ] pattern\n       compset -s number\n       compset -S [ number ] pattern\n       compset -n begin [ end ]\n       compset -N beg-pat [ end-pat ]\n       compset -q\n\t      This command simplifies modification of the special parameters,\n\t      while its return status allows tests on them to be carried out.\n\n\t      The options are:\n\n\t      -p number\n\t\t     If the value of the PREFIX parameter is at least number\n\t\t     characters long, the first number characters are removed\n\t\t     from it and appended to the contents of the IPREFIX\n\t\t     parameter.\n\n\t      -P [ number ] pattern\n\t\t     If the value of the PREFIX parameter begins with anything\n\t\t     that matches the pattern, the matched portion is removed\n\t\t     from PREFIX and appended to IPREFIX.\n\n\t\t     Without the optional number, the longest match is taken,\n\t\t     but if number is given, anything up to the numberth match\n\t\t     is moved.\tIf the number is negative, the numberth\n\t\t     longest match is moved. For example, if PREFIX contains\n\t\t     the string `a=b=c', then compset -P '*\\=' will move the\n\t\t     string `a=b=' into the IPREFIX parameter, but compset -P\n\t\t     1 '*\\=' will move only the string `a='.\n\n\t      -s number\n\t\t     As -p, but transfer the last number characters from the\n\t\t     value of SUFFIX to the front of the value of ISUFFIX.\n\n\t      -S [ number ] pattern\n\t\t     As -P, but match the last portion of SUFFIX and transfer\n\t\t     the matched portion to the front of the value of ISUFFIX.\n\n\t      -n begin [ end ]\n\t\t     If the current word position as specified by the\n\t\t     parameter CURRENT is greater than or equal to begin,\n\t\t     anything up to the beginth word is removed from the words\n\t\t     array and the value of the parameter CURRENT is\n\t\t     decremented by begin.\n\n\t\t     If the optional end is given, the modification is done\n\t\t     only if the current word position is also less than or\n\t\t     equal to end. In this case, the words from position end\n\t\t     onwards are also removed from the words array.\n\n\t\t     Both begin and end may be negative to count backwards\n\t\t     from the last element of the words array.\n\n\t      -N beg-pat [ end-pat ]\n\t\t     If one of the elements of the words array before the one\n\t\t     at the index given by the value of the parameter CURRENT\n\t\t     matches the pattern beg-pat, all elements up to and\n\t\t     including the matching one are removed from the words\n\t\t     array and the value of CURRENT is changed to point to the\n\t\t     same word in the changed array.\n\n\t\t     If the optional pattern end-pat is also given, and there\n\t\t     is an element in the words array matching this pattern,\n\t\t     the parameters are modified only if the index of this\n\t\t     word is higher than the one given by the CURRENT\n\t\t     parameter (so that the matching word has to be after the\n\t\t     cursor). In this case, the words starting with the one\n\t\t     matching end-pat are also removed from the words array.\n\t\t     If words contains no word matching end-pat, the testing\n\t\t     and modification is performed as if it were not given.\n\n\t      -q     The word currently being completed is split on spaces\n\t\t     into separate words, respecting the usual shell quoting\n\t\t     conventions.  The resulting words are stored in the words\n\t\t     array, and CURRENT, PREFIX, SUFFIX, QIPREFIX, and\n\t\t     QISUFFIX are modified to reflect the word part that is\n\t\t     completed.\n\n\t      In all the above cases the return status is zero if the test\n\t      succeeded and the parameters were modified and non-zero\n\t      otherwise. This allows one to use this builtin in tests such as:\n\n\t\t     if compset -P '*\\='; then ...\n\n\t      This forces anything up to and including the last equal sign to\n\t      be ignored by the completion code.\n\n       compcall [ -TD ]\n\t      This allows the use of completions defined with the compctl\n\t      builtin from within completion widgets.  The list of matches\n\t      will be generated as if one of the non-widget completion\n\t      functions (complete-word, etc.) had been called, except that\n\t      only compctls given for specific commands are used. To force the\n\t      code to try completions defined with the -T option of compctl\n\t      and/or the default completion (whether defined by compctl -D or\n\t      the builtin default) in the appropriate places, the -T and/or -D\n\t      flags can be passed to compcall.\n\n\t      The return status can be used to test if a matching compctl\n\t      definition was found. It is non-zero if a compctl was found and\n\t      zero otherwise.\n\n\t      Note that this builtin is defined by the zsh/compctl module.\n\nCOMPLETION CONDITION CODES\n       The following additional condition codes for use within the [[ ... ]]\n       construct are available in completion widgets.  These work on the\n       special parameters.  All of these tests can also be performed by the\n       compset builtin, but in the case of the condition codes the contents of\n       the special parameters are not modified.\n\n       -prefix [ number ] pattern\n\t      true if the test for the -P option of compset would succeed.\n\n       -suffix [ number ] pattern\n\t      true if the test for the -S option of compset would succeed.\n\n       -after beg-pat\n\t      true if the test of the -N option with only the beg-pat given\n\t      would succeed.\n\n       -between beg-pat end-pat\n\t      true if the test for the -N option with both patterns would\n\t      succeed.\n\nCOMPLETION MATCHING CONTROL\n       When the user invokes completion, the current word on the command line\n       (that is, the word the cursor is currently on) is used to generate a\n       match pattern.  Only those completions that match the pattern are\n       offered to the user as matches.\n\n       The default match pattern is generated from the current word by either\n\n       •      appending a `*' (matching any number of characters in a\n\t      completion) or,\n\n       •      if the shell option COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set, inserting a `*' at\n\t      the cursor position.\n\n       This narrow pattern can be broadened selectively by passing a match\n       specification to the compadd builtin command through its -M option (see\n       `Completion Builtin Commands' above).  A match specification consists\n       of one or more matchers separated by whitespace.  Matchers in a match\n       specification are applied one at a time, from left to right.  Once all\n       matchers have been applied, completions are compared to the final match\n       pattern and non-matching ones are discarded.\n\n       •      Note that the -M option is ignored if the current word contains\n\t      a glob pattern and the shell option GLOB_COMPLETE is set or if\n\t      the pattern_match key of the special associative array compstate\n\t      is set to a non-empty value (see `Completion Special Parameters'\n\t      above).\n\n       •      Users of the completion system (see zshcompsys(1))  should\n\t      generally not use the -M option directly, but rather use the\n\t      matcher-list and matcher styles (see the subsection Standard\n\t      Styles in the documentation for COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\n\t      in zshcompsys(1)).\n\n       Each matcher consists of\n\n       •      a case-sensitive letter\n\n       •      a `:',\n\n       •      one or more patterns separated by pipes (`|'),\n\n       •      an equals sign (`='), and\n\n       •      another pattern.\n\n       The patterns before the `=' are used to match substrings of the current\n       word.  For each matched substring, the corresponding part of the match\n       pattern is broadened with the pattern after the `=', by means of a\n       logical OR.\n\n       Each pattern in a matcher cosists of either\n\n       •      the empty string or\n\n       •      a sequence of\n\n\t      •      literal characters (which may be quoted with a `\\'),\n\n\t      •      question marks (`?'),\n\n\t      •      bracket expressions (`[...]'; see the subsection Glob\n\t\t     Operators in the documentation for GLOB OPERATORS in\n\t\t     zshexpn(1)), and/or\n\n\t      •      brace expressions (see below)."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOther shell patterns are not allowed.\n\n       A brace expression, like a bracket expression, consists of a list of\n\n       •      literal characters,\n\n       •      ranges (`0-9'), and/or\n\n       •      character classes (`[:name:]').\n\n       However, they differ from each other as follows:\n\n       •      A brace expression is delimited by a pair of braces (`{...}').\n\n       •      Brace expressions do not support negations.  That is, an initial\n\t      `!' or `^' has no special meaning and will be interpreted as a\n\t      literal character.\n\n       •      When a character in the current word matches the nth pattern in\n\t      a brace expression, the corresponding part of the match pattern\n\t      is broadened only with the nth pattern of the brace expression\n\t      on the other side of the `=', if there is one; if there is no\n\t      brace expression on the other side, then this pattern is the\n\t      empty string.  However, if either brace expression has more\n\t      elements than the other, then the excess entries are simply\n\t      ignored.\tWhen comparing indexes, each literal character or\n\t      character class counts as one element, but each range is instead\n\t      expanded to the full list of literal characters it represents.\n\t      Additionally, if on both sides of the `=', the nth pattern is\n\t      `[:upper:]' or `[:lower:]', then these are expanded as ranges,\n\t      too.\n\n       Note that, although the matching system does not yet handle multibyte\n       characters, this is likely to be a future extension.  Hence, using\n       `[:upper:]' and `[:lower:]' is recommended over `A-Z' and `a-z'.\n\n       Below are the different forms of matchers supported.  Each uppercase\n       form behaves exactly like its lowercase counterpart, but adds an\n       additional step after the match pattern has filtered out non-matching\n       completions:  Each of a match's substrings that was matched by a\n       subpattern from an uppercase matcher is replaced with the corresponding\n       substring of the current word.  However, patterns from lowercase\n       matchers have higher weight:  If a substring of the current word was\n       matched by patterns from both a lowercase and an uppercase matcher,\n       then the lowercase matcher's pattern wins and the corresponding part of\n       the match is not modified.\n\n       Unless indicated otherwise, each example listed assumes\n       COMPLETE_IN_WORD to be unset (as it is by default).\n\n       m:word-pat=match-pat\n       M:word-pat=match-pat\n\n\t      For each substring of the current word that matches word-pat,\n\t      broaden the corresponding part of the match pattern to\n\t      additionally match match-pat.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\n\t\t     m:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]} lets any lower case character\n\t\t     in the current word be completed to itself or its\n\t\t     uppercase counterpart.  So, the completions `foo', `FOO'\n\t\t     and `Foo' will are be considered matches for the word\n\t\t     `fo'.\n\n\t\t     M:_= inserts every underscore from the current word into\n\t\t     each match, in the same relative position, determined by\n\t\t     matching the substrings around it.  So, given a\n\t\t     completion `foo', the word `f_o' will be completed to the\n\t\t     match `f_oo', even though the latter was not present as a\n\t\t     completion.\n\n       b:word-pat=match-pat\n       B:word-pat=match-pat\n       e:word-pat=match-pat\n       E:word-pat=match-pat\n\n\t      For each consecutive substring at the b:eginning or e:nd of the\n\t      current word that matches word-pat, broaden the corresponding\n\t      part of the match pattern to additionally match match-pat.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\n\t\t     `b:-=+' lets any number of minuses at the start of the\n\t\t     current word be completed to a minus or a plus.\n\n\t\t     `B:0=' adds all zeroes at the beginning of the current\n\t\t     word to the beginning of each match.\n\n       l:|word-pat=match-pat\n       L:|word-pat=match-pat\n       R:word-pat|=match-pat\n       r:word-pat|=match-pat\n\n\t      If there is a substring at the l:eft or r:ight edge of the\n\t      current word that matches word-pat, then broaden the\n\t      corresponding part of the match pattern to additionally match\n\t      match-pat.\n\n\t      For each l:, L:, r: and R: matcher (including the ones below),\n\t      the pattern match-pat may also be a `*'.\tThis matches any\n\t      number of characters in a completion.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\n\t\t     `r:|=*' appends a `*' to the match pattern, even when\n\t\t     COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set and the cursor is not at the end\n\t\t     of the current word.\n\n\t\t     If the current word starts with a minus, then `L:|-='\n\t\t     will prepend it to each match.\n\n       l:anchor|word-pat=match-pat\n       L:anchor|word-pat=match-pat\n       r:word-pat|anchor=match-pat\n       R:word-pat|anchor=match-pat\n\n\t      For each substring of the current word that matches word-pat and\n\t      has on its l:eft or r:ight another substring matching anchor,\n\t      broaden the corresponding part of the match pattern to\n\t      additionally match match-pat.\n\n\t      Note that these matchers (and the ones below) modify only what\n\t      is matched by word-pat; they do not change the matching behavior\n\t      of what is matched by anchor (or coanchor; see the matchers\n\t      below).  Thus, unless its corresponding part of the match\n\t      pattern has been modified, the anchor in the current word has to\n\t      match literally in each completion, just like any other\n\t      substring of the current word.\n\n\t      If a matcher includes at least one anchor (which includes the\n\t      matchers with two anchors, below), then match-pat may also be\n\t      `*' or `**'.  `*' can match any part of a completion that does\n\t      not contain any substrings matching anchor, whereas a `**' can\n\t      match any part of a completion, period.  (Note that this is\n\t      different from the behavior of `*' in the anchorless forms of\n\t      `l:' and `r:' and and also different from `*' and `**' in glob\n\t      expressions.)\n\n\t      Examples:\n\n\t\t     `r:|.=*' makes the completion `comp.sources.unix' a match\n\t\t     for the word `..u' -- but not for the word `.u'.\n\n\t\t     Given a completion `--foo', the matcher `L:--|no-=' will\n\t\t     complete the word `--no-' to the match `--no-foo'.\n\n       l:anchor||coanchor=match-pat\n       L:anchor||coanchor=match-pat\n       r:coanchor||anchor=match-pat\n       R:coanchor||anchor=match-pat\n\n\t      For any two consecutive substrings of the current word that\n\t      match anchor and coanchor, in the order given, insert the\n\t      pattern match-pat between their corresponding parts in the match\n\t      pattern.\n\n\t      Note that, unlike anchor, the pattern coanchor does not change\n\t      what `*' can match.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\n\t\t     `r:?||[[:upper:]]=*' will complete the current word `fB'\n\t\t     to `fooBar', but it will not complete it to `fooHooBar'\n\t\t     (because `*' here cannot match anything that includes a\n\t\t     match for `[[:upper:]]), nor will it complete `B' to\n\t\t     `fooBar' (because there is no character in the current\n\t\t     word to match coanchor).\n\n\t\t     Given the current word `pass.n' and a completion\n\t\t     `pass.byname', the matcher `L:.||[[:alpha:]]=by' will\n\t\t     produce the match `pass.name'.\n\n       x:\n\n\t      Ignore this matcher and all matchers to its right.\n\n\t      This matcher is used to mark the end of a match specification.\n\t      In a single standalone list of matchers, this has no use, but\n\t      where match specifications are concatenated, as is often the\n\t      case when using the completion system (see zshcompsys(1)), it\n\t      can allow one match specification to override another.\n\nCOMPLETION WIDGET EXAMPLE\n       The first step is to define the widget:\n\n\t      zle -C complete complete-word complete-files\n\n       Then the widget can be bound to a key using the bindkey builtin\n       command:\n\n\t      bindkey '^X\\t' complete\n\n       After that the shell function complete-files will be invoked after\n       typing control-X and TAB. The function should then generate the\n       matches, e.g.:\n\n\t      complete-files () { compadd - * }\n\n       This function will complete files in the current directory matching the\n       current word.\n\nNAME\n       zshcompsys - zsh completion system\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This describes the shell code for the `new' completion system, referred\n       to as compsys.  It is written in shell functions based on the features\n       described in zshcompwid(1).\n\n       The features are contextual, sensitive to the point at which completion\n       is started.  Many completions are already provided.  For this reason, a\n       user can perform a great many tasks without knowing any details beyond\n       how to initialize the system, which is described below in\n       INITIALIZATION.\n\n       The context that decides what completion is to be performed may be\n       •      an argument or option position: these describe the position on\n\t      the command line at which completion is requested.  For example\n\t      `first argument to rmdir, the word being completed names a\n\t      directory';"

These provide ways for the user to\n       configure the system's behaviour.\n\n       Tags play a dual role.  They serve as a classification system for the\n       matches, typically indicating a class of object that the user may need\n       to distinguish.\tFor example, when completing arguments of the ls\n       command the user may prefer to try files before directories, so both of\n       these are tags.\tThey also appear as the rightmost element in a context\n       specification.\n\n       Styles modify various operations of the completion system, such as\n       output formatting, but also what kinds of completers are used (and in\n       what order), or which tags are examined.  Styles may accept arguments\n       and are manipulated using the zstyle command described in\n       zshmodules(1).\n\n       In summary, tags describe what the completion objects are, and style\n       how they are to be completed.  At various points of execution, the\n       completion system checks what styles and/or tags are defined for the\n       current context, and uses that to modify its behavior.  The full\n       description of context handling, which determines how tags and other\n       elements of the context influence the behaviour of styles, is described\n       below in COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION.\n\n       When a completion is requested, a dispatcher function is called; see\n       the description of _main_complete in the list of control functions\n       below. This dispatcher decides which function should be called to\n       produce the completions, and calls it. The result is passed to one or\n       more completers, functions that implement individual completion\n       strategies: simple completion, error correction, completion with error\n       correction, menu selection, etc.\n\n       More generally, the shell functions contained in the completion system\n       are of two types:\n       •      those beginning `comp' are to be called directly; there are only\n\t      a few of these;"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n•      those beginning `_' are called by the completion code.  The\n\t      shell functions of this set, which implement completion\n\t      behaviour and may be bound to keystrokes, are referred to as\n\t      `widgets'.  These proliferate as new completions are required.\n\n\nINITIALIZATION\n       If the system was installed completely, it should be enough to call the\n       shell function compinit from your initialization file; see the next\n       section.  However, the function compinstall can be run by a user to\n       configure various aspects of the completion system.\n\n       Usually, compinstall will insert code into .zshrc, although if that is\n       not writable it will save it in another file and tell you that file's\n       location.  Note that it is up to you to make sure that the lines added\n       to .zshrc are actually run; you may, for example, need to move them to\n       an earlier place in the file if .zshrc usually returns early.  So long\n       as you keep them all together (including the comment lines at the start\n       and finish), you can rerun compinstall and it will correctly locate and\n       modify these lines.  Note, however, that any code you add to this\n       section by hand is likely to be lost if you rerun compinstall, although\n       lines using the command `zstyle' should be gracefully handled.\n\n       The new code will take effect next time you start the shell, or run\n       .zshrc by hand; there is also an option to make them take effect\n       immediately.  However, if compinstall has removed definitions, you will\n       need to restart the shell to see the changes.\n\n       To run compinstall you will need to make sure it is in a directory\n       mentioned in your fpath parameter, which should already be the case if\n       zsh was properly configured as long as your startup files do not remove\n       the appropriate directories from fpath.\tThen it must be autoloaded\n       (`autoload -U compinstall' is recommended).  You can abort the\n       installation any time you are being prompted for information, and your\n       .zshrc will not be altered at all; changes only take place right at the\n       end, where you are specifically asked for confirmation.\n\n   Use of compinit\n       This section describes the use of compinit to initialize completion for\n       the current session when called directly; if you have run compinstall\n       it will be called automatically from your .zshrc.\n\n       To initialize the system, the function compinit should be in a\n       directory mentioned in the fpath parameter, and should be autoloaded\n       (`autoload -U compinit' is recommended), and then run simply as\n       `compinit'.  This will define a few utility functions, arrange for all\n       the necessary shell functions to be autoloaded, and will then re-define\n       all widgets that do completion to use the new system.  If you use the\n       menu-select widget, which is part of the zsh/complist module, you\n       should make sure that that module is loaded before the call to compinit\n       so that that widget is also re-defined.\tIf completion styles (see\n       below) are set up to perform expansion as well as completion by\n       default, and the TAB key is bound to expand-or-complete, compinit will\n       rebind it to complete-word; this is necessary to use the correct form\n       of expansion.\n\n       Should you need to use the original completion commands, you can still\n       bind keys to the old widgets by putting a `.' in front of the widget\n       name, e.g. `.expand-or-complete'.\n\n       To speed up the running of compinit, it can be made to produce a dumped\n       configuration that will be read in on future invocations; this is the\n       default, but can be turned off by calling compinit with the option -D.\n       The dumped file is .zcompdump in the same directory as the startup\n       files (i.e. $ZDOTDIR or $HOME); alternatively, an explicit file name\n       can be given by `compinit -d dumpfile'.\tThe next invocation of\n       compinit will read the dumped file instead of performing a full\n       initialization.\n\n       If the number of completion files changes, compinit will recognise this\n       and produce a new dump file.  However, if the name of a function or the\n       arguments in the first line of a #compdef function (as described below)\n       change, it is easiest to delete the dump file by hand so that compinit\n       will re-create it the next time it is run.  The check performed to see\n       if there are new functions can be omitted by giving the option -C.  In\n       this case the dump file will only be created if there isn't one\n       already.\n\n       The dumping is actually done by another function, compdump, but you\n       will only need to run this yourself if you change the configuration\n       (e.g. using compdef) and then want to dump the new one.\tThe name of\n       the old dumped file will be remembered for this purpose.\n\n       If the parameter _compdir is set, compinit uses it as a directory where\n       completion functions can be found; this is only necessary if they are\n       not already in the function search path.\n\n       For security reasons compinit also checks if the completion system\n       would use files not owned by root or by the current user, or files in\n       directories that are world- or group-writable or that are not owned by\n       root or by the current user.  If such files or directories are found,\n       compinit will ask if the completion system should really be used.  To\n       avoid these tests and make all files found be used without asking, use\n       the option -u, and to make compinit silently ignore all insecure files\n       and directories use the option -i.  This security check is skipped\n       entirely when the -C option is given, provided the dumpfile exists.\n\n       The security check can be retried at any time by running the function\n       compaudit.  This is the same check used by compinit, but when it is\n       executed directly any changes to fpath are made local to the function\n       so they do not persist.\tThe directories to be checked may be passed as\n       arguments; if none are given, compaudit uses fpath and _compdir to find\n       completion system directories, adding missing ones to fpath as\n       necessary.  To force a check of exactly the directories currently named\n       in fpath, set _compdir to an empty string before calling compaudit or\n       compinit.\n\n       The function bashcompinit provides compatibility with bash's\n       programmable completion system.\tWhen run it will define the functions,\n       compgen and complete which correspond to the bash builtins with the\n       same names.  It will then be possible to use completion specifications\n       and functions written for bash.\n\n   Autoloaded files\n       The convention for autoloaded functions used in completion is that they\n       start with an underscore; as already mentioned, the fpath/FPATH\n       parameter must contain the directory in which they are stored.  If zsh\n       was properly installed on your system, then fpath/FPATH automatically\n       contains the required directories for the standard functions.\n\n       For incomplete installations, if compinit does not find enough files\n       beginning with an underscore (fewer than twenty) in the search path, it\n       will try to find more by adding the directory _compdir to the search\n       path.  If that directory has a subdirectory named Base, all\n       subdirectories will be added to the path.  Furthermore, if the\n       subdirectory Base has a subdirectory named Core, compinit will add all\n       subdirectories of the subdirectories to the path: this allows the\n       functions to be in the same format as in the zsh source distribution.\n\n       When compinit is run, it searches all such files accessible via\n       fpath/FPATH and reads the first line of each of them.  This line should\n       contain one of the tags described below.  Files whose first line does\n       not start with one of these tags are not considered to be part of the\n       completion system and will not be treated specially.\n\n       The tags are:\n\n       #compdef name ... [ -{p|P} pattern ... [ -N name ... ] ]\n\t      The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined in\n\t      it will be called when completing names, each of which is either\n\t      the name of a command whose arguments are to be completed or one\n\t      of a number of special contexts in the form -context- described\n\t      below.\n\n\t      Each name may also be of the form `cmd=service'.\tWhen\n\t      completing the command cmd, the function typically behaves as if\n\t      the command (or special context) service was being completed\n\t      instead.\tThis provides a way of altering the behaviour of\n\t      functions that can perform many different completions.  It is\n\t      implemented by setting the parameter $service when calling the\n\t      function; the function may choose to interpret this how it\n\t      wishes, and simpler functions will probably ignore it.\n\n\t      If the #compdef line contains one of the options -p or -P, the\n\t      words following are taken to be patterns.  The function will be\n\t      called when completion is attempted for a command or context\n\t      that matches one of the patterns.  The options -p and -P are\n\t      used to specify patterns to be tried before or after other\n\t      completions respectively.  Hence -P may be used to specify\n\t      default actions.\n\n\t      The option -N is used after a list following -p or -P; it\n\t      specifies that remaining words no longer define patterns.  It is\n\t      possible to toggle between the three options as many times as\n\t      necessary.\n\n       #compdef -k style key-sequence ...\n\t      This option creates a widget behaving like the builtin widget\n\t      style and binds it to the given key-sequences, if any.  The\n\t      style must be one of the builtin widgets that perform\n\t      completion, namely complete-word, delete-char-or-list,\n\t      expand-or-complete, expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices,\n\t      menu-complete, menu-expand-or-complete, or\n\t      reverse-menu-complete.  If the zsh/complist module is loaded\n\t      (see zshmodules(1)) the widget menu-select is also available.\n\n\t      When one of the key-sequences is typed, the function in the file\n\t      will be invoked to generate the matches.\tNote that a key will\n\t      not be re-bound if it already was (that is, was bound to\n\t      something other than undefined-key).  The widget created has the\n\t      same name as the file and can be bound to any other keys using\n\t      bindkey as usual.\n\n       #compdef -K widget-name style key-sequence [ name style seq ... ]\n\t      This is similar to -k except that only one key-sequence argument\n\t      may be given for each widget-name style pair.  However, the\n\t      entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a different\n\t      set of arguments.  Note in particular that the widget-name must\n\t      be distinct in each set.\tIf it does not begin with `_' this\n\t      will be added.  The widget-name should not clash with the name\n\t      of any existing widget: names based on the name of the function\n\t      are most useful.\tFor example,\n\n\t\t     #compdef -K _foo_complete complete-word \"^X^C\" \\\n\t\t       _foo_list list-choices \"^X^D\"\n\n\t      (all on one line) defines a widget _foo_complete for completion,\n\t      bound to `^X^C', and a widget _foo_list for listing, bound to\n\t      `^X^D'.\n\n       #autoload [ options ]\n\t      Functions with the #autoload tag are marked for autoloading but\n\t      are not otherwise treated specially.  Typically they are to be\n\t      called from within one of the completion functions.  Any options\n\t      supplied will be passed to the autoload builtin; a typical use\n\t      is +X to force the function to be loaded immediately.  Note that\n\t      the -U and -z flags are always added implicitly.\n\n       The # is part of the tag name and no white space is allowed after it.\n       The #compdef tags use the compdef function described below; the main\n       difference is that the name of the function is supplied implicitly.\n\n       The special contexts for which completion functions can be defined are:\n\n       -array-value-\n\t      The right hand side of an array-assignment (`name=(...)')\n\n       -assign-parameter-\n\t      The name of a parameter in an assignment, i.e. on the left hand\n\t      side of an `='\n\n       -brace-parameter-\n\t      The name of a parameter expansion within braces (`${...}')\n\n       -command-\n\t      A word in command position\n\n       -condition-\n\t      A word inside a condition (`[[...]]')\n\n       -default-\n\t      Any word for which no other completion is defined\n\n       -equal-\n\t      A word beginning with an equals sign\n\n       -first-\n\t      This is tried before any other completion function.  The\n\t      function called may set the _compskip parameter to one of\n\t      various values: all: no further completion is attempted; a\n\t      string containing the substring patterns: no pattern completion\n\t      functions will be called; a string containing default: the\n\t      function for the `-default-' context will not be called, but\n\t      functions defined for commands will be.\n\n       -math- Inside mathematical contexts, such as `((...))'\n\n       -parameter-\n\t      The name of a parameter expansion (`$...')\n\n       -redirect-\n\t      The word after a redirection operator.\n\n       -subscript-\n\t      The contents of a parameter subscript.\n\n       -tilde-\n\t      After an initial tilde (`~'), but before the first slash in the\n\t      word.\n\n       -value-\n\t      On the right hand side of an assignment.\n\n       Default implementations are supplied for each of these contexts.  In\n       most cases the context -context- is implemented by a corresponding\n       function _context, for example the context `-tilde-' and the function\n       `_tilde').\n\n       The contexts -redirect- and -value- allow extra context-specific\n       information.  (Internally, this is handled by the functions for each\n       context calling the function _dispatch.)  The extra information is\n       added separated by commas.\n\n       For the -redirect- context, the extra information is in the form\n       `-redirect-,op,command', where op is the redirection operator and\n       command is the name of the command on the line.\tIf there is no command\n       on the line yet, the command field will be empty.\n\n       For the -value- context, the form is `-value-,name,command', where name\n       is the name of the parameter on the left hand side of the assignment.\n       In the case of elements of an associative array, for example\n       `assoc=(key <TAB>', name is expanded to `name-key'.  In certain special\n       contexts, such as completing after `make CFLAGS=', the command part\n       gives the name of the command, here make; otherwise it is empty.\n\n       It is not necessary to define fully specific completions as the\n       functions provided will try to generate completions by progressively\n       replacing the elements with `-default-'.  For example, when completing\n       after `foo=<TAB>', _value will try the names `-value-,foo,' (note the\n       empty command part), `-value-,foo,-default-'\n       and`-value-,-default-,-default-', in that order, until it finds a\n       function to handle the context.\n\n       As an example:\n\n\t      compdef '_files -g \"*.log\"' '-redirect-,2>,-default-'\n\n       completes files matching `*.log' after `2> <TAB>' for any command with\n       no more specific handler defined.\n\n       Also:\n\n\t      compdef _foo -value-,-default-,-default-\n\n       specifies that _foo provides completions for the values of parameters\n       for which no special function has been defined.\tThis is usually\n       handled by the function _value itself.\n\n       The same lookup rules are used when looking up styles (as described\n       below); for example\n\n\t      zstyle ':completion:*:*:-redirect-,2>,*:*' file-patterns '*.log'\n\n       is another way to make completion after `2> <TAB>' complete files\n       matching `*.log'.\n\n   Functions\n       The following function is defined by compinit and may be called\n       directly."

Here service should already have been defined by\n\t      `cmd1=service' lines in #compdef files, as described above.  The\n\t      argument for cmd will be completed in the same way as service.\n\n\t      The function argument may alternatively be a string containing\n\t      almost any shell code.  If the string contains an equal sign,\n\t      the above will take precedence.  The option -e may be used to\n\t      specify the first argument is to be evaluated as shell code even\n\t      if it contains an equal sign.  The string will be executed using\n\t      the eval builtin command to generate completions.  This provides\n\t      a way of avoiding having to define a new completion function.\n\t      For example, to complete files ending in `.h' as arguments to\n\t      the command foo:\n\n\t\t     compdef '_files -g \"*.h\"' foo\n\n\t      The option -n prevents any completions already defined for the\n\t      command or context from being overwritten.\n\n\t      The option -d deletes any completion defined for the command or\n\t      contexts listed.\n\n\t      The names may also contain -p, -P and -N options as described\n\t      for the #compdef tag.  The effect on the argument list is\n\t      identical, switching between definitions of patterns tried\n\t      initially, patterns tried finally, and normal commands and\n\t      contexts.\n\n\t      The parameter $_compskip may be set by any function defined for\n\t      a pattern context.  If it is set to a value containing the\n\t      substring `patterns' none of the pattern-functions will be\n\t      called; if it is set to a value containing the substring `all',\n\t      no other function will be called.  Setting $_compskip in this\n\t      manner is of particular utility when using the -p option, as\n\t      otherwise the dispatcher will move on to additional functions\n\t      (likely the default one) after calling the pattern-context one,\n\t      which can mangle the display of completion possibilities if not\n\t      handled properly.\n\n\t      The form with -k defines a widget with the same name as the\n\t      function that will be called for each of the key-sequences; this\n\t      is like the #compdef -k tag.  The function should generate the\n\t      completions needed and will otherwise behave like the builtin\n\t      widget whose name is given as the style argument.  The widgets\n\t      usable for this are: complete-word, delete-char-or-list,\n\t      expand-or-complete, expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices,\n\t      menu-complete, menu-expand-or-complete, and\n\t      reverse-menu-complete, as well as menu-select if the\n\t      zsh/complist module is loaded.  The option -n prevents the key\n\t      being bound if it is already to bound to something other than\n\t      undefined-key.\n\n\t      The form with -K is similar and defines multiple widgets based\n\t      on the same function, each of which requires the set of three\n\t      arguments name, style and key-sequence, where the latter two are\n\t      as for -k and the first must be a unique widget name beginning\n\t      with an underscore.\n\n\t      Wherever applicable, the -a option makes the function\n\t      autoloadable, equivalent to autoload -U function.\n\n       The function compdef can be used to associate existing completion\n       functions with new commands.  For example,\n\n\t      compdef _pids foo\n\n       uses the function _pids to complete process IDs for the command foo.\n\n       Note also the _gnu_generic function described below, which can be used\n       to complete options for commands that understand the `--help' option.\n\nCOMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\n       This section gives a short overview of how the completion system works,\n       and then more detail on how users can configure how and when matches\n       are generated.\n\n   Overview\n       When completion is attempted somewhere on the command line the\n       completion system begins building the context.  The context represents\n       everything that the shell knows about the meaning of the command line\n       and the significance of the cursor position.  This takes account of a\n       number of things including the command word (such as `grep' or `zsh')\n       and options to which the current word may be an argument (such as the\n       `-o' option to zsh which takes a shell option as an argument).\n\n       The context starts out very generic (\"we are beginning a completion\")\n       and becomes more specific as more is learned (\"the current word is in a\n       position that is usually a command name\" or \"the current word might be\n       a variable name\" and so on).  Therefore the context will vary during\n       the same call to the completion system.\n\n       This context information is condensed into a string consisting of\n       multiple fields separated by colons, referred to simply as `the\n       context' in the remainder of the documentation.\tNote that a user of\n       the completion system rarely needs to compose a context string, unless\n       for example a new function is being written to perform completion for a\n       new command.  What a user may need to do is compose a style pattern,\n       which is matched against a context when needed to look up\n       context-sensitive options that configure the completion system.\n\n       The next few paragraphs explain how a context is composed within the\n       completion function suite.  Following that is discussion of how styles\n       are defined.  Styles determine such things as how the matches are\n       generated, similarly to shell options but with much more control.  They\n       are defined with the zstyle builtin command (see zshmodules(1)).\n\n       The context string always consists of a fixed set of fields, separated\n       by colons and with a leading colon before the first.  Fields which are\n       not yet known are left empty, but the surrounding colons appear anyway.\n       The fields are always in the order\n       :completion:function:completer:command:argument:tag.  These have the\n       following meaning:\n\n       •      The literal string completion, saying that this style is used by\n\t      the completion system.  This distinguishes the context from\n\t      those used by, for example, zle widgets and ZFTP functions."

    Manpage text:

    Note that the order in which styles are defined does not matter; the
           style mechanism uses the most specific possible match for a particular
           style to determine the set of values.  Strings are preferred over
           patterns (for example, `:completion::complete:::foo' is more specific
           than `:completion::complete:::*'), and longer patterns are preferred
           over the pattern `*'. See zmodules(1) for details.

           Context patterns that use something other than a wildcard (*) to match
           the middle parts of the context -- the completer, command, and argument
           in :completion:function:completer:command:argument:tag -- should
           include all six colons (:) explicitly. Without this, a pattern such as
           :completion:*:foo:* could match foo against a component other than the
           intended one (for example, against completer when a match against
           command was intended).

           Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend on the

However, any matcher must\n\t      explicitly specify case-insensitive matching if that is\n\t      required.\n\n\t      For notes comparing the use of this and the matcher style, see\n\t      under the description of the tag-order style.\n\n       max-errors\n\t      This is used by the _approximate and _correct completer\n\t      functions to determine the maximum number of errors to allow.\n\t      The completer will try to generate completions by first allowing\n\t      one error, then two errors, and so on, until either a match or\n\t      matches were found or the maximum number of errors given by this\n\t      style has been reached."

If the value is `0' (zero), the list is\n\t      scrolled by half-screenfuls; if it is a positive integer, the\n\t      list is scrolled by the given number of lines; if it is a\n\t      negative number, the list is scrolled by a screenful minus the\n\t      absolute value of the given number of lines.  The default is to\n\t      scroll by single lines.\n\n       separate-sections\n\t      This style is used with the manuals tag when completing names of\n\t      manual pages.  If it is `true', entries for different sections\n\t      are added separately using tag names of the form `manuals.X',\n\t      where X is the section number.  When the group-name style is\n\t      also in effect, pages from different sections will appear\n\t      separately.  This style is also used similarly with the words\n\t      style when completing words for the dict command. It allows\n\t      words from different dictionary databases to be added\n\t      separately. See also insert-sections.\n\n\t      The default for this style is `false'.\n\n       show-ambiguity\n\t      If the zsh/complist module is loaded, this style can be used to\n\t      highlight the first ambiguous character in completion lists.

If it is `true', the\n\t      completion system outputs a progress message in the listing area\n\t      showing what completer is being tried.  The message will be\n\t      overwritten by any output when completions are found and is\n\t      removed after completion is finished.\n\n       single-ignored\n\t      This is used by the _ignored completer when there is only one\n\t      match.  If its value is `show', the single match will be\n\t      displayed but not inserted.  If the value is `menu', then the\n\t      single match and the original string are both added as matches\n\t      and menu completion is started, making it easy to select either\n\t      of them.\n\n       sort   This allows the standard ordering of matches to be overridden.\n\n\t      If its value is `true' or `false', sorting is enabled or\n\t      disabled.  Additionally the values associated with the `-o'\n\t      option to compadd can also be listed: match, nosort, numeric,\n\t      reverse.\tIf it is not set for the context, the standard\n\t      behaviour of the calling widget is used.\n\n\t      The style is tested first against the full context including the\n\t      tag, and if that fails to produce a value against the context\n\t      without the tag.\n\n\t      In many cases where a calling widget explicitly selects a\n\t      particular ordering in lieu of the default, a value of `true' is\n\t      not honoured.  An example of where this is not the case is for\n\t      command history where the default of sorting matches\n\t      chronologically may be overridden by setting the style to\n\t      `true'.\n\n\t      In the _expand completer, if it is set to `true', the expansions\n\t      generated will always be sorted.\tIf it is set to `menu', then\n\t      the expansions are only sorted when they are offered as single\n\t      strings but not in the string containing all possible\n\t      expansions.\n\n       special-dirs\n\t      Normally, the completion code will not produce the directory\n\t      names `.' and `..' as possible completions.  If this style is\n\t      set to `true', it will add both `.' and `..' as possible\n\t      completions; if it is set to `..', only `..' will be added.\n\n\t      The following example sets special-dirs to `..' when the current\n\t      prefix is empty, is a single `.', or consists only of a path\n\t      beginning with `../'.  Otherwise the value is `false'.\n\n\t\t     zstyle -e ':completion:*' special-dirs \\\n\t\t\t'[[ $PREFIX = (../)#(|.|..) ]] && reply=(..)'\n\n       squeeze-slashes\n\t      If set to `true', sequences of slashes in filename paths (for\n\t      example in `foo//bar') will be treated as a single slash.  This\n\t      is the usual behaviour of UNIX paths.  However, by default the\n\t      file completion function behaves as if there were a `*' between\n\t      the slashes.\n\n       stop   If set to `true', the _history_complete_word bindable command\n\t      will stop once when reaching the beginning or end of the\n\t      history.\tInvoking _history_complete_word will then wrap around\n\t      to the opposite end of the history.  If this style is set to\n\t      `false' (the default), _history_complete_word will loop\n\t      immediately as in a menu completion.\n\n       strip-comments\n\t      If set to `true', this style causes non-essential comment text\n\t      to be removed from completion matches.  Currently it is only\n\t      used when completing e-mail addresses where it removes any\n\t      display name from the addresses, cutting them down to plain\n\t      user@host form.\n\n       subst-globs-only\n\t      This is used by the _expand completer.  If it is set to `true',\n\t      the expansion will only be used if it resulted from globbing;\n\t      hence, if expansions resulted from the use of the substitute\n\t      style described below, but these were not further changed by\n\t      globbing, the expansions will be rejected.\n\n\t      The default for this style is `false'.\n\n       substitute\n\t      This boolean style controls whether the _expand completer will\n\t      first try to expand all substitutions in the string (such as\n\t      `$(...)' and `${...}').\n\n\t      The default is `true'.\n\n       suffix This is used by the _expand completer if the word starts with a\n\t      tilde or contains a parameter expansion.\tIf it is set to\n\t      `true', the word will only be expanded if it doesn't have a\n\t      suffix, i.e. if it is something like `~foo' or `$foo' rather\n\t      than `~foo/' or `$foo/bar', unless that suffix itself contains\n\t      characters eligible for expansion.  The default for this style\n\t      is `true'.\n\n       tag-order\n\t      This provides a mechanism for sorting how the tags available in\n\t      a particular context will be used.\n\n\t      The values for the style are sets of space-separated lists of\n\t      tags.  The tags in each value will be tried at the same time; if\n\t      no match is found, the next value is used.  (See the\n\t      file-patterns style for an exception to this behavior.)\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-:*:*' tag-order \\\n\t\t\t 'commands functions'\n\n\t      specifies that completion in command position first offers\n\t      external commands and shell functions.  Remaining tags will be\n\t      tried if no completions are found.\n\n\t      In addition to tag names, each string in the value may take one\n\t      of the following forms:\n\n\t      -      If any value consists of only a hyphen, then only the\n\t\t     tags specified in the other values are generated.\n\t\t     Normally all tags not explicitly selected are tried last\n\t\t     if the specified tags fail to generate any matches.  This\n\t\t     means that a single value consisting only of a single\n\t\t     hyphen turns off completion.\n\n\t      ! tags...\n\t\t     A string starting with an exclamation mark specifies\n\t\t     names of tags that are not to be used.  The effect is the\n\t\t     same as if all other possible tags for the context had\n\t\t     been listed.\n\n\t      tag:label ...\n\t\t     Here, tag is one of the standard tags and label is an\n\t\t     arbitrary name.  Matches are generated as normal but the\n\t\t     name label is used in contexts instead of tag.  This is\n\t\t     not useful in words starting with !.\n\n\t\t     If the label starts with a hyphen, the tag is prepended\n\t\t     to the label to form the name used for lookup.  This can\n\t\t     be used to make the completion system try a certain tag\n\t\t     more than once, supplying different style settings for\n\t\t     each attempt; see below for an example.\n\n\t      tag:label:description\n\t\t     As before, but description will replace the `%d' in the\n\t\t     value of the format style instead of the default\n\t\t     description supplied by the completion function.  Spaces\n\t\t     in the description must be quoted with a backslash.  A\n\t\t     `%d' appearing in description is replaced with the\n\t\t     description given by the completion function.\n\n\t      In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or several\n\t      patterns in the form `{pat1,pat2...}'.  In this case all\n\t      matching tags will be used except for any given explicitly in\n\t      the same string.\n\n\t      One use of these features is to try one tag more than once,\n\t      setting other styles differently on each attempt, but still to\n\t      use all the other tags without having to repeat them all.  For\n\t      example, to make completion of function names in command\n\t      position ignore all the completion functions starting with an\n\t      underscore the first time completion is tried:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:*' tag-order \\\n\t\t\t 'functions:-non-comp *' functions\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:functions-non-comp' \\\n\t\t\t ignored-patterns '_*'\n\n\t      On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the functions\n\t      tag will be replaced by functions-non-comp.  The\n\t      ignored-patterns style is set for this tag to exclude functions\n\t      starting with an underscore.  If there are no matches, the\n\t      second value of the tag-order style is used which completes\n\t      functions using the default tag, this time presumably including\n\t      all function names.\n\n\t      The matches for one tag can be split into different groups.  For\n\t      example:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' tag-order \\\n\t\t\t 'options:-long:long\\ options\n\t\t\t  options:-short:short\\ options\n\t\t\t  options:-single-letter:single\\ letter\\ options'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:options-long' \\\n\t\t\t  ignored-patterns '[-+](|-|[^-]*)'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:options-short' \\\n\t\t\t  ignored-patterns '--*' '[-+]?'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:options-single-letter' \\\n\t\t\t  ignored-patterns '???*'\n\n\t      With the group-names style set, options beginning with `--',\n\t      options beginning with a single `-' or `+' but containing\n\t      multiple characters, and single-letter options will be displayed\n\t      in separate groups with different descriptions.\n\n\t      Another use of patterns is to try multiple match specifications\n\t      one after another.  The matcher-list style offers something\n\t      similar, but it is tested very early in the completion system\n\t      and hence can't be set for single commands nor for more specific\n\t      contexts.  Here is how to try normal completion without any\n\t      match specification and, if that generates no matches, try again\n\t      with case-insensitive matching, restricting the effect to\n\t      arguments of the command foo:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*:*' tag-order '*' '*:-case'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*-case' matcher 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'\n\n\t      First, all the tags offered when completing after foo are tried\n\t      using the normal tag name.  If that generates no matches, the\n\t      second value of tag-order is used, which tries all tags again\n\t      except that this time each has -case appended to its name for\n\t      lookup of styles.  Hence this time the value for the matcher\n\t      style from the second call to zstyle in the example is used to\n\t      make completion case-insensitive.\n\n\t      It is possible to use the -e option of the zstyle builtin\n\t      command to specify conditions for the use of particular tags.\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     zstyle -e '*:-command-:*' tag-order '\n\t\t\t if [[ -n $PREFIX$SUFFIX ]]; then\n\t\t\t   reply=( )\n\t\t\t else\n\t\t\t   reply=( - )\n\t\t\t fi'\n\n\t      Completion in command position will be attempted only if the\n\t      string typed so far is not empty.  This is tested using the\n\t      PREFIX special parameter; see zshcompwid for a description of\n\t      parameters which are special inside completion widgets.  Setting\n\t      reply to an empty array provides the default behaviour of trying\n\t      all tags at once; setting it to an array containing only a\n\t      hyphen disables the use of all tags and hence of all\n\t      completions.\n\n\t      If no tag-order style has been defined for a context, the\n\t      strings `(|*-)argument-* (|*-)option-* values' and `options'\n\t      plus all tags offered by the completion function will be used to\n\t      provide a sensible default behavior that causes arguments\n\t      (whether normal command arguments or arguments of options) to be\n\t      completed before option names for most commands.\n\n       urls   This is used together with the urls tag by functions completing\n\t      URLs.\n\n\t      If the value consists of more than one string, or if the only\n\t      string does not name a file or directory, the strings are used\n\t      as the URLs to complete.\n\n\t      If the value contains only one string which is the name of a\n\t      normal file the URLs are taken from that file (where the URLs\n\t      may be separated by white space or newlines).\n\n\t      Finally, if the only string in the value names a directory, the\n\t      directory hierarchy rooted at this directory gives the\n\t      completions.  The top level directory should be the file access\n\t      method, such as `http', `ftp', `bookmark' and so on.  In many\n\t      cases the next level of directories will be a filename.  The\n\t      directory hierarchy can descend as deep as necessary.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' urls ~/.urls\n\t\t     mkdir -p ~/.urls/ftp/ftp.zsh.org/pub"

           _ignored', i.e. normally only ordinary completion is tried, first with
           the effect of the ignored-patterns style and then without it.  The

           _main_complete function returns.

           If the first argument to _main_complete is a single hyphen, the

The extensions are taken from files in current\n\t      directory or a directory specified at the beginning of the\n\t      current word. For exact matches, completion continues to allow\n\t      other completers such as _expand to expand the pattern.

This\n\t      completer can be controlled by the remove-all-dups, and sort\n\t      styles as for the _history_complete_word bindable command, see\n\t      the section `Bindable Commands' below and the section\n\t      `Completion System Configuration' above.\n\n       _ignored\n\t      The ignored-patterns style can be set to a list of patterns\n\t      which are compared against possible completions; matching ones\n\t      are removed.  With this completer those matches can be\n\t      reinstated, as if no ignored-patterns style were set.  The\n\t      completer actually generates its own list of matches; which\n\t      completers are invoked is determined in the same way as for the\n\t      _prefix completer.  The single-ignored style is also available\n\t      as described above.\n\n       _list  This completer allows the insertion of matches to be delayed\n\t      until completion is attempted a second time without the word on\n\t      the line being changed.  On the first attempt, only the list of\n\t      matches will be shown.  It is affected by the styles condition\n\t      and word, see the section `Completion System Configuration'\n\t      above.\n\n       _match This completer is intended to be used after the _complete\n\t      completer.  It behaves similarly but the string on the command\n\t      line may be a pattern to match against trial completions.  This\n\t      gives the effect of the GLOB_COMPLETE option.\n\n\t      Normally completion will be performed by taking the pattern from\n\t      the line, inserting a `*' at the cursor position and comparing\n\t      the resulting pattern with the possible completions generated.\n\t      This can be modified with the match-original style described\n\t      above.\n\n\t      The generated matches will be offered in a menu completion\n\t      unless the insert-unambiguous style is set to `true'; see the\n\t      description above for other options for this style.\n\n\t      Note that matcher specifications defined globally or used by the\n\t      completion functions (the styles matcher-list and matcher) will\n\t      not be used.\n\n       _menu  This completer was written as simple example function to show\n\t      how menu completion can be enabled in shell code. However, it\n\t      has the notable effect of disabling menu selection which can be\n\t      useful with _generic based widgets. It should be used as the\n\t      first completer in the list.  Note that this is independent of\n\t      the setting of the MENU_COMPLETE option and does not work with\n\t      the other menu completion widgets such as reverse-menu-complete,\n\t      or accept-and-menu-complete.\n\n       _oldlist\n\t      This completer controls how the standard completion widgets\n\t      behave when there is an existing list of completions which may\n\t      have been generated by a special completion (i.e. a\n\t      separately-bound completion command).  It allows the ordinary\n\t      completion keys to continue to use the list of completions thus\n\t      generated, instead of producing a new list of ordinary\n\t      contextual completions.  It should appear in the list of\n\t      completers before any of the widgets which generate matches.  It\n\t      uses two styles: old-list and old-menu, see the section\n\t      `Completion System Configuration' above.\n\n       _precommand\n\t      Complete an external command in word-separated arguments, as for\n\t      exec and /usr/bin/env.\n\n       _prefix\n\t      This completer can be used to try completion with the suffix\n\t      (everything after the cursor) ignored.  In other words, the\n\t      suffix will not be considered to be part of the word to\n\t      complete.  The effect is similar to the\n\t      expand-or-complete-prefix command.\n\n\t      The completer style is used to decide which other completers are\n\t      to be called to generate matches.  If this style is unset, the\n\t      list of completers set for the current context is used --\n\t      except, of course, the _prefix completer itself.\tFurthermore,\n\t      if this completer appears more than once in the list of\n\t      completers only those completers not already tried by the last\n\t      invocation of _prefix will be called.\n\n\t      For example, consider this global completer style:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' completer \\\n\t\t\t _complete _prefix _correct _prefix:foo\n\n\t      Here, the _prefix completer tries normal completion but ignoring\n\t      the suffix.  If that doesn't generate any matches, and neither\n\t      does the call to the _correct completer after it, _prefix will\n\t      be called a second time and, now only trying correction with the\n\t      suffix ignored.  On the second invocation the completer part of\n\t      the context appears as `foo'.\n\n\t      To use _prefix as the last resort and try only normal completion\n\t      when it is invoked:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete ... _prefix\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion::prefix:*' completer _complete\n\n\t      The add-space style is also respected.  If it is set to `true'\n\t      then _prefix will insert a space between the matches generated\n\t      (if any) and the suffix.\n\n\t      Note that this completer is only useful if the COMPLETE_IN_WORD\n\t      option is set; otherwise, the cursor will be moved to the end of\n\t      the current word before the completion code is called and hence\n\t      there will be no suffix.\n\n       _user_expand\n\t      This completer behaves similarly to the _expand completer but\n\t      instead performs expansions defined by users.  The styles\n\t      add-space and sort styles specific to the _expand completer are\n\t      usable with _user_expand in addition to other styles handled\n\t      more generally by the completion system.\tThe tag all-expansions\n\t      is also available.\n\n\t      The expansion depends on the array style user-expand being\n\t      defined for the current context; remember that the context for\n\t      completers is less specific than that for contextual completion\n\t      as the full context has not yet been determined.\tElements of\n\t      the array may have one of the following forms:\n\n\t      $hash\n\n\t\t     hash is the name of an associative array.\tNote this is\n\t\t     not a full parameter expression, merely a $, suitably\n\t\t     quoted to prevent immediate expansion, followed by the\n\t\t     name of an associative array.  If the trial expansion\n\t\t     word matches a key in hash, the resulting expansion is\n\t\t     the corresponding value.\n\t      _func\n\n\t\t     _func is the name of a shell function whose name must\n\t\t     begin with _ but is not otherwise special to the\n\t\t     completion system.  The function is called with the trial\n\t\t     word as an argument.  If the word is to be expanded, the\n\t\t     function should set the array reply to a list of\n\t\t     expansions.  Optionally, it can set REPLY to a word that\n\t\t     will be used as a description for the set of expansions.\n\t\t     The return status of the function is irrelevant.\n\nBINDABLE COMMANDS\n       In addition to the context-dependent completions provided, which are\n       expected to work in an intuitively obvious way, there are a few widgets\n       implementing special behaviour which can be bound separately to keys.\n       The following is a list of these and their default bindings.\n\n       _bash_completions\n\t      This function is used by two widgets, _bash_complete-word and\n\t      _bash_list-choices.  It exists to provide compatibility with\n\t      completion bindings in bash.  The last character of the binding\n\t      determines what is completed: `!', command names; `$',\n\t      environment variables; `@', host names; `/', file names; `~'\n\t      user names.  In bash, the binding preceded by `\\e' gives\n\t      completion, and preceded by `^X' lists options.  As some of\n\t      these bindings clash with standard zsh bindings, only `\\e~' and\n\t      `^X~' are bound by default.  To add the rest, the following\n\t      should be added to .zshrc after compinit has been run:\n\n\t\t     for key in '!' '$' '@' '/' '~'; do\n\t\t       bindkey \"\\e$key\" _bash_complete-word\n\t\t       bindkey \"^X$key\" _bash_list-choices\n\t\t     done\n\n\t      This includes the bindings for `~' in case they were already\n\t      bound to something else; the completion code does not override\n\t      user bindings.\n\n       _correct_filename (^XC)\n\t      Correct the filename path at the cursor position.  Allows up to\n\t      six errors in the name.  Can also be called with an argument to\n\t      correct a filename path, independently of zle; the correction is\n\t      printed on standard output.\n\n       _correct_word (^Xc)\n\t      Performs correction of the current argument using the usual\n\t      contextual completions as possible choices. This stores the\n\t      string `correct-word' in the function field of the context name\n\t      and then calls the _correct completer.\n\n       _expand_alias (^Xa)\n\t      This function can be used as a completer and as a bindable\n\t      command.\tIt expands the word the cursor is on if it is an\n\t      alias.  The types of alias expanded can be controlled with the\n\t      styles regular, global and disabled.\n\n\t      When used as a bindable command there is one additional feature\n\t      that can be selected by setting the complete style to `true'.\n\t      In this case, if the word is not the name of an alias,\n\t      _expand_alias tries to complete the word to a full alias name\n\t      without expanding it.  It leaves the cursor directly after the\n\t      completed word so that invoking _expand_alias once more will\n\t      expand the now-complete alias name.\n\n       _expand_word (^Xe)\n\t      Performs expansion on the current word:  equivalent to the\n\t      standard expand-word command, but using the _expand completer.\n\t      Before calling it, the function field of the context is set to\n\t      `expand-word'.\n\n       _generic\n\t      This function is not defined as a widget and not bound by\n\t      default.\tHowever, it can be used to define a widget and will\n\t      then store the name of the widget in the function field of the\n\t      context and call the completion system.  This allows custom\n\t      completion widgets with their own set of style settings to be\n\t      defined easily.  For example, to define a widget that performs\n\t      normal completion and starts menu selection:\n\n\t\t     zle -C foo complete-word _generic\n\t\t     bindkey '...' foo\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:foo:*' menu yes select=1\n\n\t      Note in particular that the completer style may be set for the\n\t      context in order to change the set of functions used to generate\n\t      possible matches.  If _generic is called with arguments, those\n\t      are passed through to _main_complete as the list of completers\n\t      in place of those defined by the completer style.\n\n       _history_complete_word (\\e/)\n\t      Complete words from the shell's command history. This uses the\n\t      list, remove-all-dups, sort, and stop styles.\n\n       _most_recent_file (^Xm)\n\t      Complete the name of the most recently modified file matching\n\t      the pattern on the command line (which may be blank).  If given\n\t      a numeric argument N, complete the Nth most recently modified\n\t      file.  Note the completion, if any, is always unique.\n\n       _next_tags (^Xn)\n\t      This command alters the set of matches used to that for the next\n\t      tag, or set of tags, either as given by the tag-order style or\n\t      as set by default; these matches would otherwise not be\n\t      available.  Successive invocations of the command cycle through\n\t      all possible sets of tags.\n\n       _read_comp (^X^R)\n\t      Prompt the user for a string, and use that to perform completion\n\t      on the current word.  There are two possibilities for the\n\t      string.  First, it can be a set of words beginning `_', for\n\t      example `_files -/', in which case the function with any\n\t      arguments will be called to generate the completions.\n\t      Unambiguous parts of the function name will be completed\n\t      automatically (normal completion is not available at this point)\n\t      until a space is typed.\n\n\t      Second, any other string will be passed as a set of arguments to\n\t      compadd and should hence be an expression specifying what should\n\t      be completed.\n\n\t      A very restricted set of editing commands is available when\n\t      reading the string:  `DEL' and `^H' delete the last character;\n\t      `^U' deletes the line, and `^C' and `^G' abort the function,\n\t      while `RET' accepts the completion.  Note the string is used\n\t      verbatim as a command line, so arguments must be quoted in\n\t      accordance with standard shell rules.\n\n\t      Once a string has been read, the next call to _read_comp will\n\t      use the existing string instead of reading a new one.  To force\n\t      a new string to be read, call _read_comp with a numeric\n\t      argument.\n\n       _complete_debug (^X?)\n\t      This widget performs ordinary completion, but captures in a\n\t      temporary file a trace of the shell commands executed by the\n\t      completion system.  Each completion attempt gets its own file.\n\t      A command to view each of these files is pushed onto the editor\n\t      buffer stack.\n\n       _complete_help (^Xh)\n\t      This widget displays information about the context names, the\n\t      tags, and the completion functions used when completing at the\n\t      current cursor position. If given a numeric argument other than\n\t      1 (as in `ESC-2 ^Xh'), then the styles used and the contexts for\n\t      which they are used will be shown, too.\n\n\t      Note that the information about styles may be incomplete; it\n\t      depends on the information available from the completion\n\t      functions called, which in turn is determined by the user's own\n\t      styles and other settings.\n\n       _complete_help_generic\n\t      Unlike other commands listed here, this must be created as a\n\t      normal ZLE widget rather than a completion widget (i.e. with zle\n\t      -N).  It is used for generating help with a widget bound to the\n\t      _generic widget that is described above.\n\n\t      If this widget is created using the name of the function, as it\n\t      is by default, then when executed it will read a key sequence.\n\t      This is expected to be bound to a call to a completion function\n\t      that uses the _generic widget.  That widget will be executed,\n\t      and information provided in the same format that the\n\t      _complete_help widget displays for contextual completion.\n\n\t      If the widget's name contains debug, for example if it is\n\t      created as `zle -N _complete_debug_generic\n\t      _complete_help_generic', it will read and execute the keystring\n\t      for a generic widget as before, but then generate debugging\n\t      information as done by _complete_debug for contextual\n\t      completion.\n\n\t      If the widget's name contains noread, it will not read a\n\t      keystring but instead arrange that the next use of a generic\n\t      widget run in the same shell will have the effect as described\n\t      above.\n\n\t      The widget works by setting the shell parameter\n\t      ZSH_TRACE_GENERIC_WIDGET which is read by _generic.  Unsetting\n\t      the parameter cancels any pending effect of the noread form.\n\n\t      For example, after executing the following:\n\n\t\t     zle -N _complete_debug_generic _complete_help_generic\n\t\t     bindkey '^x:' _complete_debug_generic\n\n\t      typing `C-x :' followed by the key sequence for a generic widget\n\t      will cause trace output for that widget to be saved to a file.\n\n       _complete_tag (^Xt)\n\t      This widget completes symbol tags created by the etags or ctags\n\t      programmes (note there is no connection with the completion\n\t      system's tags) stored in a file TAGS, in the format used by\n\t      etags, or tags, in the format created by ctags.  It will look\n\t      back up the path hierarchy for the first occurrence of either\n\t      file; if both exist, the file TAGS is preferred.\tYou can\n\t      specify the full path to a TAGS or tags file by setting the\n\t      parameter $TAGSFILE or $tagsfile respectively.  The\n\t      corresponding completion tags used are etags and vtags, after\n\t      emacs and vi respectively.\n\nUTILITY FUNCTIONS\n       Descriptions follow for utility functions that may be useful when\n       writing completion functions.  If functions are installed in\n       subdirectories, most of these reside in the Base subdirectory.  Like\n       the example functions for commands in the distribution, the utility\n       functions generating matches all follow the convention of returning\n       status zero if they generated completions and non-zero if no matching\n       completions could be added.\n\n       _absolute_command_paths\n\t      This function completes external commands as absolute paths\n\t      (unlike _command_names -e which completes their basenames).  It\n\t      takes no arguments.\n\n       _all_labels [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ command arg ... ]\n\t      This is a convenient interface to the _next_label function\n\t      below, implementing the loop shown in the _next_label example.\n\t      The command and its arguments are called to generate the\n\t      matches.\tThe options stored in the parameter name will\n\t      automatically be inserted into the args passed to the command.\n\t      Normally, they are put directly after the command, but if one of\n\t      the args is a single hyphen, they are inserted directly before\n\t      that.  If the hyphen is the last argument, it will be removed\n\t      from the argument list before the command is called.  This\n\t      allows _all_labels to be used in almost all cases where the\n\t      matches can be generated by a single call to the compadd builtin\n\t      command or by a call to one of the utility functions.\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     local expl\n\t\t     ...\n\t\t     if _requested foo; then\n\t\t       ...\n\t\t       _all_labels foo expl '...' compadd ... - $matches\n\t\t     fi\n\n\t      Will complete the strings from the matches parameter, using\n\t      compadd with additional options which will take precedence over\n\t      those generated by _all_labels.\n\n       _alternative [ -O name ] [ -C name ] spec ...\n\t      This function is useful in simple cases where multiple tags are\n\t      available.  Essentially it implements a loop like the one\n\t      described for the _tags function below.\n\n\t      The tags to use and the action to perform if a tag is requested\n\t      are described using the specs which are of the form:\n\t      `tag:descr:action'.  The tags are offered using _tags and if the\n\t      tag is requested, the action is executed with the given\n\t      description descr.  The actions are those accepted by the\n\t      _arguments function (described below), with the following\n\t      exceptions:\n\t      •      The `->state' and `=...' forms are not supported."

The options are followed by specs that describe\n\t      options and arguments of the analyzed command.  To avoid\n\t      ambiguity, all options to _arguments itself may be separated\n\t      from the spec forms by a single colon.\n\n\t      The `--' form is used to intuit spec forms from the help output\n\t      of the command being analyzed, and is described in detail below.\n\t      The opts for the `--' form are otherwise the same options as the\n\t      first form.  Note that `-s' following `--' has a distinct\n\t      meaning from `-s' preceding `--', and both may appear.\n\n\t      The option switches -s, -S, -A, -w, and -W affect how _arguments\n\t      parses the analyzed command line's options.  These switches are\n\t      useful for commands with standard argument parsing.\n\n\t      The options of _arguments have the following meanings:\n\n\t      -n     With this option, _arguments sets the parameter NORMARG\n\t\t     to the position of the first normal argument in the\n\t\t     $words array, i.e. the position after the end of the\n\t\t     options.  If that argument has not been reached, NORMARG\n\t\t     is set to -1.  The caller should declare `integer\n\t\t     NORMARG' if the -n option is passed; otherwise the\n\t\t     parameter is not used.\n\n\t      -s     Enable option stacking for single-letter options, whereby\n\t\t     multiple single-letter options may be combined into a\n\t\t     single word.  For example, the two options `-x' and `-y'\n\t\t     may be combined into a single word `-xy'.\tBy default,\n\t\t     every word corresponds to a single option name (`-xy' is\n\t\t     a single option named `xy').\n\n\t\t     Options beginning with a single hyphen or plus sign are\n\t\t     eligible for stacking; words beginning with two hyphens\n\t\t     are not.\n\n\t\t     Note that -s after -- has a different meaning, which is\n\t\t     documented in the segment entitled `Deriving spec forms\n\t\t     from the help output'.\n\n\t      -w     In combination with -s, allow option stacking even if one\n\t\t     or more of the options take arguments.  For example, if\n\t\t     -x takes an argument, with no -s, `-xy' is considered as\n\t\t     a single (unhandled) option; with -s, -xy is an option\n\t\t     with the argument `y'; with both -s and -w, -xy is the\n\t\t     option -x and the option -y with arguments to -x (and to\n\t\t     -y, if it takes arguments) still to come in subsequent\n\t\t     words.\n\n\t      -W     This option takes -w a stage further:  it is possible to\n\t\t     complete single-letter options even after an argument\n\t\t     that occurs in the same word.  However, it depends on the\n\t\t     action performed whether options will really be completed\n\t\t     at this point.  For more control, use a utility function\n\t\t     like _guard as part of the action.\n\n\t      -C     Modify the curcontext parameter for an action of the form\n\t\t     `->state'.  This is discussed in detail below.\n\n\t      -R     Return status 300 instead of zero when a $state is to be\n\t\t     handled, in the `->string' syntax.\n\n\t      -S     Do not complete options after a `--' appearing on the\n\t\t     line, and ignore the `--'.  For example, with -S, in the\n\t\t     line\n\n\t\t\t    foobar -x -- -y\n\n\t\t     the `-x' is considered an option, the `-y' is considered\n\t\t     an argument, and the `--' is considered to be neither.\n\n\t      -A pat Do not complete options after the first non-option\n\t\t     argument on the line.  pat is a pattern matching all\n\t\t     strings which are not to be taken as arguments.  For\n\t\t     example, to make _arguments stop completing options after\n\t\t     the first normal argument, but ignoring all strings\n\t\t     starting with a hyphen even if they are not described by\n\t\t     one of the optspecs, the form is `-A \"-*\"'.\n\n\t      -O name\n\t\t     Pass the elements of the array name as arguments to\n\t\t     functions called to execute actions.  This is discussed\n\t\t     in detail below.\n\n\t      -M matchspec\n\t\t     Use the match specification matchspec for completing\n\t\t     option names and values.  The default matchspec allows\n\t\t     partial word completion after `_' and `-', such as\n\t\t     completing `-f-b' to `-foo-bar'.  The default matchspec\n\t\t     is:\n\t\t     r:|[_-]=* r:|=*\n\n\t      -0     When populating values of the `opt_args' associative\n\t\t     array, don't backslash-escape colons and backslashes and\n\t\t     use NUL rather than colon for joining multiple values.\n\t\t     This option is described in more detail below, under the\n\t\t     heading specs: actions.\n\n\t      specs: overview\n\n\t      Each of the following forms is a spec describing individual sets\n\t      of options or arguments on the command line being analyzed.\n\n\t      n:message:action\n\t      n::message:action\n\t\t     This describes the n'th normal argument.  The message\n\t\t     will be printed above the matches generated and the\n\t\t     action indicates what can be completed in this position\n\t\t     (see below).  If there are two colons before the message\n\t\t     the argument is optional.\tIf the message contains only\n\t\t     white space, nothing will be printed above the matches\n\t\t     unless the action adds an explanation string itself.\n\n\t      :message:action\n\t      ::message:action\n\t\t     Similar, but describes the next argument, whatever number\n\t\t     that happens to be.  If all arguments are specified in\n\t\t     this form in the correct order the numbers are\n\t\t     unnecessary.\n\n\t      *:message:action\n\t      *::message:action\n\t      *:::message:action\n\t\t     This describes how arguments (usually non-option\n\t\t     arguments, those not beginning with - or +) are to be\n\t\t     completed when neither of the first two forms was\n\t\t     provided.\tAny number of arguments can be completed in\n\t\t     this fashion.\n\n\t\t     With two colons before the message, the words special\n\t\t     array and the CURRENT special parameter are modified to\n\t\t     refer only to the normal arguments when the action is\n\t\t     executed or evaluated.  With three colons before the\n\t\t     message they are modified to refer only to the normal\n\t\t     arguments covered by this description.\n\n\t      optspec\n\t      optspec:...\n\t\t     This describes an option.\tThe colon indicates handling\n\t\t     for one or more arguments to the option; if it is not\n\t\t     present, the option is assumed to take no arguments.\n\n\t\t     The following forms are available for the initial\n\t\t     optspec, whether or not the option has arguments.\n\n\t\t     *optspec\n\t\t\t    Here optspec is one of the remaining forms below.\n\t\t\t    This indicates the following optspec may be\n\t\t\t    repeated.  Otherwise if the corresponding option\n\t\t\t    is already present on the command line to the left\n\t\t\t    of the cursor it will not be offered again.\n\n\t\t     -optname\n\t\t     +optname\n\t\t\t    In the simplest form the optspec is just the\n\t\t\t    option name beginning with a minus or a plus sign,\n\t\t\t    such as `-foo'.  The first argument for the option\n\t\t\t    (if any) must follow as a separate word directly\n\t\t\t    after the option.\n\n\t\t\t    Either of `-+optname' and `+-optname' can be used\n\t\t\t    to specify that -optname and +optname are both\n\t\t\t    valid.\n\n\t\t\t    In all the remaining forms, the leading `-' may be\n\t\t\t    replaced by or paired with `+' in this way.\n\n\t\t     -optname-\n\t\t\t    The first argument of the option must come\n\t\t\t    directly after the option name in the same word.\n\t\t\t    For example, `-foo-:...' specifies that the\n\t\t\t    completed option and argument will look like\n\t\t\t    `-fooarg'.\n\n\t\t     -optname+\n\t\t\t    The first argument may appear immediately after\n\t\t\t    optname in the same word, or may appear as a\n\t\t\t    separate word after the option.  For example,\n\t\t\t    `-foo+:...' specifies that the completed option\n\t\t\t    and argument will look like either `-fooarg' or\n\t\t\t    `-foo arg'.\n\n\t\t     -optname=\n\t\t\t    The argument may appear as the next word, or in\n\t\t\t    same word as the option name provided that it is\n\t\t\t    separated from it by an equals sign, for example\n\t\t\t    `-foo=arg' or `-foo arg'.\n\n\t\t     -optname=-\n\t\t\t    The argument to the option must appear after an\n\t\t\t    equals sign in the same word, and may not be given\n\t\t\t    in the next argument.\n\n\t\t     optspec[explanation]\n\t\t\t    An explanation string may be appended to any of\n\t\t\t    the preceding forms of optspec by enclosing it in\n\t\t\t    brackets, as in `-q[query operation]'.\n\n\t\t\t    The verbose style is used to decide whether the\n\t\t\t    explanation strings are displayed with the option\n\t\t\t    in a completion listing.\n\n\t\t\t    If no bracketed explanation string is given but\n\t\t\t    the auto-description style is set and only one\n\t\t\t    argument is described for this optspec, the value\n\t\t\t    of the style is displayed, with any appearance of\n\t\t\t    the sequence `%d' in it replaced by the message of\n\t\t\t    the first optarg that follows the optspec; see\n\t\t\t    below.\n\n\t\t     It is possible for options with a literal `+' or `=' to\n\t\t     appear, but that character must be quoted, for example\n\t\t     `-\\+'.\n\n\t\t     Each optarg following an optspec must take one of the\n\t\t     following forms:\n\n\t\t     :message:action\n\t\t     ::message:action\n\t\t\t    An argument to the option; message and action are\n\t\t\t    treated as for ordinary arguments.\tIn the first\n\t\t\t    form, the argument is mandatory, and in the second\n\t\t\t    form it is optional.\n\n\t\t\t    This group may be repeated for options which take\n\t\t\t    multiple arguments.  In other words,\n\t\t\t    :message1:action1:message2:action2 specifies that\n\t\t\t    the option takes two arguments.\n\n\t\t     :*pattern:message:action\n\t\t     :*pattern::message:action\n\t\t     :*pattern:::message:action\n\t\t\t    This describes multiple arguments.\tOnly the last\n\t\t\t    optarg for an option taking multiple arguments may\n\t\t\t    be given in this form.  If the pattern is empty\n\t\t\t    (i.e. :*:), all the remaining words on the line\n\t\t\t    are to be completed as described by the action;\n\t\t\t    otherwise, all the words up to and including a\n\t\t\t    word matching the pattern are to be completed\n\t\t\t    using the action.\n\n\t\t\t    Multiple colons are treated as for the `*:...'\n\t\t\t    forms for ordinary arguments:  when the message is\n\t\t\t    preceded by two colons, the words special array\n\t\t\t    and the CURRENT special parameter are modified\n\t\t\t    during the execution or evaluation of the action\n\t\t\t    to refer only to the words after the option.  When\n\t\t\t    preceded by three colons, they are modified to\n\t\t\t    refer only to the words covered by this\n\t\t\t    description.\n\n\t      Any literal colon in an optname, message, or action must be\n\t      preceded by a backslash, `\\:'.\n\n\t      Each of the forms above may be preceded by a list in parentheses\n\t      of option names and argument numbers.  If the given option is on\n\t      the command line, the options and arguments indicated in\n\t      parentheses will not be offered.\tFor example, `(-two -three\n\t      1)-one:...' completes the option `-one'; if this appears on the\n\t      command line, the options -two and -three and the first ordinary\n\t      argument will not be completed after it.\t`(-foo):...' specifies\n\t      an ordinary argument completion; -foo will not be completed if\n\t      that argument is already present.\n\n\t      Other items may appear in the list of excluded options to\n\t      indicate various other items that should not be applied when the\n\t      current specification is matched: a single star (*) for the rest\n\t      arguments (i.e. a specification of the form `*:...'); a colon\n\t      (:) for all normal (non-option-) arguments; and a hyphen (-) for\n\t      all options.  For example, if `(*)' appears before an option and\n\t      the option appears on the command line, the list of remaining\n\t      arguments (those shown in the above table beginning with `*:')\n\t      will not be completed.\n\n\t      To aid in reuse of specifications, it is possible to precede any\n\t      of the forms above with `!'; then the form will no longer be\n\t      completed, although if the option or argument appears on the\n\t      command line they will be skipped as normal.  The main use for\n\t      this is when the arguments are given by an array, and _arguments\n\t      is called repeatedly for more specific contexts: on the first\n\t      call `_arguments $global_options' is used, and on subsequent\n\t      calls `_arguments !$^global_options'.\n\n\t      specs: actions"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n{eval-string}\n\t\t     A string in braces is evaluated as shell code to generate\n\t\t     matches.  If the eval-string itself does not begin with\n\t\t     an opening parenthesis or brace it is split into separate\n\t\t     words before execution.\n\n\t      = action\n\t\t     If the action starts with `= ' (an equals sign followed\n\t\t     by a space), _arguments will insert the contents of the\n\t\t     argument field of the current context as the new first\n\t\t     element in the words special array and increment the\n\t\t     value of the CURRENT special parameter.  This has the\n\t\t     effect of inserting a dummy word onto the completion\n\t\t     command line while not changing the point at which\n\t\t     completion is taking place.\n\n\t\t     This is most useful with one of the specifiers that\n\t\t     restrict the words on the command line on which the\n\t\t     action is to operate (the two- and three-colon forms\n\t\t     above).  One particular use is when an action itself\n\t\t     causes _arguments on a restricted range; it is necessary\n\t\t     to use this trick to insert an appropriate command name\n\t\t     into the range for the second call to _arguments to be\n\t\t     able to parse the line.\n\n\t       word...\n\t      word...\n\t\t     This covers all forms other than those above.  If the\n\t\t     action starts with a space, the remaining list of words\n\t\t     will be invoked unchanged.\n\n\t\t     Otherwise it will be invoked with some extra strings\n\t\t     placed after the first word; these are to be passed down\n\t\t     as options to the compadd builtin.  They ensure that the\n\t\t     state specified by _arguments, in particular the\n\t\t     descriptions of options and arguments, is correctly\n\t\t     passed to the completion command.\tThese additional\n\t\t     arguments are taken from the array parameter `expl'; this\n\t\t     will be set up before executing the action and hence may\n\t\t     be referred to inside it, typically in an expansion of\n\t\t     the form `$expl[@]' which preserves empty elements of the\n\t\t     array.\n\n\t      During the performance of the action the array `line' will be\n\t      set to the normal arguments from the command line, i.e. the\n\t      words from the command line after the command name excluding all\n\t      options and their arguments.  Options are stored in the\n\t      associative array `opt_args' with option names as keys and their\n\t      arguments as the values.\tBy default, all colons and backslashes\n\t      in the value are escaped with backslashes, and if an option has\n\t      multiple arguments (for example, when using an optspec of the\n\t      form `*optspec'), they are joined with (unescaped) colons.\n\t      However, if the -0 option was passed, no backslash escaping is\n\t      performed, and multiple values are joined with NUL bytes.  For\n\t      example, after `zsh -o foo:foo -o bar:bar -o <TAB>', the\n\t      contents of `opt_args' would be\n\n\t\t     typeset -A opt_args=( [-o]='foo\\:foo:bar\\:bar:' )\n\n\t      by default, and\n\n\t\t     typeset -A opt_args=( [-o]=$'foo:foo\\x00bar:bar\\x00' )\n\n\t      if _arguments had been called with the -0 option.\n\n\t      The parameter `context' is set when returning to the calling\n\t      function to perform an action of the form `->string'.  It is set\n\t      to an array of elements corresponding to the elements of $state.\n\t      Each element is a suitable name for the argument field of the\n\t      context: either a string of the form `option-opt-n' for the n'th\n\t      argument of the option -opt, or a string of the form\n\t      `argument-n' for the n'th argument.  For `rest' arguments, that\n\t      is those in the list at the end not handled by position, n is\n\t      the string `rest'.  For example, when completing the argument of\n\t      the -o option, the name is `option-o-1', while for the second\n\t      normal (non-option-) argument it is `argument-2'.\n\n\t      Furthermore, during the evaluation of the action the context\n\t      name in the curcontext parameter is altered to append the same\n\t      string that is stored in the context parameter.\n\n\t      The option -C tells _arguments to modify the curcontext\n\t      parameter for an action of the form `->state'.  This is the\n\t      standard parameter used to keep track of the current context.\n\t      Here it (and not the context array) should be made local to the\n\t      calling function to avoid passing back the modified value and\n\t      should be initialised to the current value at the start of the\n\t      function:\n\n\t\t     local curcontext=\"$curcontext\"\n\n\t      This is useful where it is not possible for multiple states to\n\t      be valid together.\n\n\t      Grouping Options\n\n\t      Options can be grouped to simplify exclusion lists. A group is\n\t      introduced with `+' followed by a name for the group in the\n\t      subsequent word. Whole groups can then be referenced in an\n\t      exclusion list or a group name can be used to disambiguate\n\t      between two forms of the same option. For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments \\\n\t\t\t '(group2--x)-a' \\\n\t\t       + group1 \\\n\t\t\t -m \\\n\t\t\t '(group2)-n' \\\n\t\t       + group2 \\\n\t\t\t -x -y\n\n\t      If the name of a group is specified in the form `(name)' then\n\t      only one value from that group will ever be completed; more\n\t      formally, all specifications are mutually exclusive to all other\n\t      specifications in that group. This is useful for defining\n\t      options that are aliases for each other. For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments \\\n\t\t\t -a -b \\\n\t\t       + '(operation)' \\\n\t\t\t {-c,--compress}'[compress]' \\\n\t\t\t {-d,--decompress}'[decompress]' \\\n\t\t\t {-l,--list}'[list]'\n\n\t      If an option in a group appears on the command line, it is\n\t      stored in the associative array `opt_args' with 'group-option'\n\t      as a key.  In the example above, a key `operation--c' is used if\n\t      the option `-c' is present on the command line.\n\n\t      Specifying Multiple Sets of Arguments\n\n\t      It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and arguments\n\t      with the sets separated by single hyphens. This differs from\n\t      groups in that sets are considered to be mutually exclusive of\n\t      each other.\n\n\t      Specifications before the first set and from any group are\n\t      common to all sets. For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments \\\n\t\t\t -a \\\n\t\t       - set1 \\\n\t\t\t -c \\\n\t\t       - set2 \\\n\t\t\t -d \\\n\t\t\t ':arg:(x2 y2)'\n\n\t      This defines two sets.  When the command line contains the\n\t      option `-c', the `-d' option and the argument will not be\n\t      considered possible completions.\tWhen it contains `-d' or an\n\t      argument, the option `-c' will not be considered.  However,\n\t      after `-a' both sets will still be considered valid.\n\n\t      As for groups, the name of a set may appear in exclusion lists,\n\t      either alone or preceding a normal option or argument\n\t      specification.\n\n\t      The completion code has to parse the command line separately for\n\t      each set. This can be slow so sets should only be used when\n\t      necessary.  A useful alternative is often an option\n\t      specification with rest-arguments (as in `-foo:*:...'); here the\n\t      option -foo swallows up all remaining arguments as described by\n\t      the optarg definitions.\n\n\t      Deriving spec forms from the help output\n\n\t      The option `--' allows _arguments to work out the names of long\n\t      options that support the `--help' option which is standard in\n\t      many GNU commands.  The command word is called with the argument\n\t      `--help' and the output examined for option names.  Clearly, it\n\t      can be dangerous to pass this to commands which may not support\n\t      this option as the behaviour of the command is unspecified.\n\n\t      In addition to options, `_arguments --' will try to deduce the\n\t      types of arguments available for options when the form\n\t      `--opt=val' is valid.  It is also possible to provide hints by\n\t      examining the help text of the command and adding helpspec of\n\t      the form `pattern:message:action'; note that other _arguments\n\t      spec forms are not used.\tThe pattern is matched against the\n\t      help text for an option, and if it matches the message and\n\t      action are used as for other argument specifiers.  The special\n\t      case of `*:' means both message and action are empty, which has\n\t      the effect of causing options having no description in the help\n\t      output to be ordered in listings ahead of options that have a\n\t      description.\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments -- '*\\*:toggle:(yes no)' \\\n\t\t\t\t   '*=FILE*:file:_files' \\\n\t\t\t\t   '*=DIR*:directory:_files -/' \\\n\t\t\t\t   '*=PATH*:directory:_files -/'\n\n\t      Here, `yes' and `no' will be completed as the argument of\n\t      options whose description ends in a star; file names will be\n\t      completed for options that contain the substring `=FILE' in the\n\t      description; and directories will be completed for options whose\n\t      description contains `=DIR' or `=PATH'.  The last three are in\n\t      fact the default and so need not be given explicitly, although\n\t      it is possible to override the use of these patterns.  A typical\n\t      help text which uses this feature is:\n\n\t\t       -C, --directory=DIR\t    change to directory DIR\n\n\t      so that the above specifications will cause directories to be\n\t      completed after `--directory', though not after `-C'.\n\n\t      Note also that _arguments tries to find out automatically if the\n\t      argument for an option is optional.  This can be specified\n\t      explicitly by doubling the colon before the message.\n\n\t      If the pattern ends in `(-)', this will be removed from the\n\t      pattern and the action will be used only directly after the `=',\n\t      not in the next word.  This is the behaviour of a normal\n\t      specification defined with the form `=-'.\n\n\t      By default, the command (with the option `--help') is run after\n\t      resetting all the locale categories (except for LC_CTYPE) to\n\t      `C'.  If the localized help output is known to work, the option\n\t      `-l' can be specified after the `_arguments --' so that the\n\t      command is run in the current locale.\n\n\t      The `_arguments --' can be followed by the option `-i patterns'\n\t      to give patterns for options which are not to be completed.  The\n\t      patterns can be given as the name of an array parameter or as a\n\t      literal list in parentheses.  For example,\n\n\t\t     _arguments -- -i \\\n\t\t\t \"(--(en|dis)able-FEATURE*)\"\n\n\t      will cause completion to ignore the options `--enable-FEATURE'\n\t      and `--disable-FEATURE' (this example is useful with GNU\n\t      configure).\n\n\t      The `_arguments --' form can also be followed by the option `-s\n\t      pair' to describe option aliases.  The pair consists of a list\n\t      of alternating patterns and corresponding replacements, enclosed\n\t      in parens and quoted so that it forms a single argument word in\n\t      the _arguments call.\n\n\t      For example, some configure-script help output describes options\n\t      only as `--enable-foo', but the script also accepts the negated\n\t      form `--disable-foo'.  To allow completion of the second form:\n\n\t\t     _arguments -- -s \"((#s)--enable- --disable-)\"\n\n\t      Miscellaneous notes\n\n\t      Finally, note that _arguments generally expects to be the\n\t      primary function handling any completion for which it is used.\n\t      It may have side effects which change the treatment of any\n\t      matches added by other functions called after it.  To combine\n\t      _arguments with other functions, those functions should be\n\t      called either before _arguments, as an action within a spec, or\n\t      in handlers for `->state' actions.\n\n\t      Here is a more general example of the use of _arguments:\n\n\t\t     _arguments '-l+:left border:' \\\n\t\t\t\t'-format:paper size:(letter A4)' \\\n\t\t\t\t'*-copy:output file:_files::resolution:(300 600)' \\\n\t\t\t\t':postscript file:_files -g \\*.\\(ps\\|eps\\)' \\\n\t\t\t\t'*:page number:'\n\n\t      This describes three options: `-l', `-format', and `-copy'.  The\n\t      first takes one argument described as `left border' for which no\n\t      completion will be offered because of the empty action.  Its\n\t      argument may come directly after the `-l' or it may be given as\n\t      the next word on the line.\n\n\t      The `-format' option takes one argument in the next word,\n\t      described as `paper size' for which only the strings `letter'\n\t      and `A4' will be completed.\n\n\t      The `-copy' option may appear more than once on the command line\n\t      and takes two arguments.\tThe first is mandatory and will be\n\t      completed as a filename.\tThe second is optional (because of the\n\t      second colon before the description `resolution') and will be\n\t      completed from the strings `300' and `600'.\n\n\t      The last two descriptions say what should be completed as\n\t      arguments.  The first describes the first argument as a\n\t      `postscript file' and makes files ending in `ps' or `eps' be\n\t      completed.  The last description gives all other arguments the\n\t      description `page number' but does not offer completions.\n\n       _cache_invalid cache_identifier\n\t      This function returns status zero if the completions cache\n\t      corresponding to the given cache identifier needs rebuilding.\n\t      It determines this by looking up the cache-policy style for the\n\t      current context.\tThis should provide a function name which is\n\t      run with the full path to the relevant cache file as the only\n\t      argument.\n\n\t      Example:\n\n\t\t     _example_caching_policy () {\n\t\t\t # rebuild if cache is more than a week old\n\t\t\t local -a oldp\n\t\t\t oldp=( \"$1\"(Nm+7) )\n\t\t\t (( $#oldp ))\n\t\t     }\n\n       _call_function return name [ arg ... ]\n\t      If a function name exists, it is called with the arguments args.\n\t      The return argument gives the name of a parameter in which the\n\t      return status from the function name should be stored; if return\n\t      is empty or a single hyphen it is ignored.\n\n\t      The return status of _call_function itself is zero if the\n\t      function name exists and was called and non-zero otherwise.\n\n       _call_program [ -l ] [ -p ] tag string ...\n\t      This function provides a mechanism for the user to override the\n\t      use of an external command.  It looks up the command style with\n\t      the supplied tag.  If the style is set, its value is used as the\n\t      command to execute.  The strings from the call to _call_program,\n\t      or from the style if set, are concatenated with spaces between\n\t      them and the resulting string is evaluated.  The return status\n\t      is the return status of the command called.\n\n\t      By default, the command is run in an environment where all the\n\t      locale categories (except for LC_CTYPE) are reset to `C' by\n\t      calling the utility function _comp_locale (see below). If the\n\t      option `-l' is given, the command is run with the current\n\t      locale.\n\n\t      If the option `-p' is supplied it indicates that the command\n\t      output is influenced by the permissions it is run with. If the\n\t      gain-privileges style is set to true, _call_program will make\n\t      use of commands such as sudo, if present on the command-line, to\n\t      match the permissions to whatever the final command is likely to\n\t      run under. When looking up the gain-privileges and command\n\t      styles, the command component of the zstyle context will end\n\t      with a slash (`/') followed by the command that would be used to\n\t      gain privileges.\n\n       _combination [ -s pattern ] tag style spec ... field opts ...\n\t      This function is used to complete combinations of values,  for\n\t      example pairs of hostnames and usernames.  The style argument\n\t      gives the style which defines the pairs; it is looked up in a\n\t      context with the tag specified.\n\n\t      The style name consists of field names separated by hyphens, for\n\t      example `users-hosts-ports'.  For each field for a value is\n\t      already known, a spec of the form `field=pattern' is given.  For\n\t      example, if the command line so far specifies a user `pws', the\n\t      argument `users=pws' should appear.\n\n\t      The next argument with no equals sign is taken as the name of\n\t      the field for which completions should be generated (presumably\n\t      not one of the fields for which the value is known).\n\n\t      The matches generated will be taken from the value of the style.\n\t      These should contain the possible values for the combinations in\n\t      the appropriate order (users, hosts, ports in the example\n\t      above).  The values for the different fields are separated by\n\t      colons.  This can be altered with the option -s to _combination\n\t      which specifies a pattern.  Typically this is a character class,\n\t      as for example `-s \"[:@]\"' in the case of the users-hosts style.\n\t      Each `field=pattern' specification restricts the completions\n\t      which apply to elements of the style with appropriately matching\n\t      fields.\n\n\t      If no style with the given name is defined for the given tag, or\n\t      if none of the strings in style's value match, but a function\n\t      name of the required field preceded by an underscore is defined,\n\t      that function will be called to generate the matches.  For\n\t      example, if there is no `users-hosts-ports' or no matching\n\t      hostname when a host is required, the function `_hosts' will\n\t      automatically be called.\n\n\t      If the same name is used for more than one field, in both the\n\t      `field=pattern' and the argument that gives the name of the\n\t      field to be completed, the number of the field (starting with\n\t      one) may be given after the fieldname, separated from it by a\n\t      colon.\n\n\t      All arguments after the required field name are passed to\n\t      compadd when generating matches from the style value, or to the\n\t      functions for the fields if they are called.\n\n       _command_names [ -e | - ]\n\t      This function completes words that are valid at command\n\t      position: names of aliases, builtins, hashed commands,\n\t      functions, and so on.  With the -e flag, only hashed commands\n\t      are completed.  The - flag is ignored.\n\n       _comp_locale\n\t      This function resets all the locale categories other than\n\t      LC_CTYPE to `C' so that the output from external commands can be\n\t      easily analyzed by the completion system. LC_CTYPE retains the\n\t      current value (taking LC_ALL and LANG into account), ensuring\n\t      that non-ASCII characters in file names are still handled\n\t      properly.\n\n\t      This function should normally be run only in a subshell, because\n\t      the new locale is exported to the environment. Typical usage\n\t      would be `$(_comp_locale; command ...)'.\n\n       _completers [ -p ]\n\t      This function completes names of completers.\n\n\t      -p     Include the leading underscore (`_') in the matches.\n\n       _default\n\t      This function corresponds to the -default- special context which\n\t      is applied where no completion is defined.  It is useful to call\n\t      it under certain error conditions such as completion after an\n\t      unrecognised subcommand.\tThis applies the concept of graceful\n\t      degradation to the completion system, allowing it to fallback on\n\t      basic completion of commonly useful things like filenames."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n_description [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ spec ... ]\n\t      This function is not to be confused with the previous one; it is\n\t      used as a helper function for creating options to compadd.  It\n\t      is buried inside many of the higher level completion functions\n\t      and so often does not need to be called directly.\n\n\t      The styles listed below are tested in the current context using\n\t      the given tag.  The resulting options for compadd are put into\n\t      the array named name (this is traditionally `expl', but this\n\t      convention is not enforced).  The description for the\n\t      corresponding set of matches is passed to the function in descr.\n\n\t      The styles tested are: format, hidden, matcher, ignore-line,\n\t      ignored-patterns, group-name and sort.  The format style is\n\t      first tested for the given tag and then for the descriptions tag\n\t      if no value was found, while the remainder are only tested for\n\t      the tag given as the first argument.  The function also calls\n\t      _setup which tests some more styles.\n\n\t      The string returned by the format style (if any) will be\n\t      modified so that the sequence `%d' is replaced by the descr\n\t      given as the third argument without any leading or trailing\n\t      white space.  If, after removing the white space, the descr is\n\t      the empty string, the format style will not be used and the\n\t      options put into the name array will not contain an explanation\n\t      string to be displayed above the matches.\n\n\t      If _description is called with more than three arguments, the\n\t      additional specs should be of the form `char:str'.  These supply\n\t      escape sequence replacements for the format style: every\n\t      appearance of `%char' will be replaced by string.  If no\n\t      additional specs are given but the description in descr conforms\n\t      to a common form then further escape sequences are set for\n\t      elements of that description.  These elements correspond to a\n\t      default value (`%o'), the units (`%m') range of acceptable\n\t      values (`%r') and the remaining initial part of the description\n\t      (`%h').  The form the description takes consists of specifying\n\t      the units and range in parentheses and the default value in\n\t      square brackets, for example:\n\n\t\t     _description times expl 'timeout (seconds) (0-60) [20]'\n\n\t      It is possible to use zformat conditional expressions when\n\t      styling these elements. So, for example, to add `default:' as a\n\t      tag but only when there is a default value to show, the format\n\t      style might include `%(o.default: %o.)'.\n\n\t      If the -x option is given, the description will be passed to\n\t      compadd using the -x option instead of the default -X.  This\n\t      means that the description will be displayed even if there are\n\t      no corresponding matches.\n\n\t      The options placed in the array name take account of the\n\t      group-name style, so matches are placed in a separate group\n\t      where necessary.\tThe group normally has its elements sorted (by\n\t      passing the option -J to compadd), but if an option starting\n\t      with `-V', `-J', `-1', or `-2' is passed to _description, that\n\t      option will be included in the array.  Hence it is possible for\n\t      the completion group to be unsorted by giving the option `-V',\n\t      `-1V', or `-2V'.\n\n\t      In most cases, the function will be used like this:\n\n\t\t     local expl\n\t\t     _description files expl file\n\t\t     compadd \"$expl[@]\" - \"$files[@]\"\n\n\t      Note the use of the parameter expl, the hyphen, and the list of\n\t      matches.\tAlmost all calls to compadd within the completion\n\t      system use a similar format; this ensures that user-specified\n\t      styles are correctly passed down to the builtins which implement\n\t      the internals of completion.\n\n       _dir_list [ -s sep ] [ -S ]\n\t      Complete a list of directory names separated by colons (the same\n\t      format as $PATH).\n\n\t      -s sep Use sep as separator between items.  sep defaults to a\n\t\t     colon (`:').\n\n\t      -S     Add sep instead of slash (`/') as an autoremoveable\n\t\t     suffix.\n\n       _dispatch context string ...\n\t      This sets the current context to context and looks for\n\t      completion functions to handle this context by hunting through\n\t      the list of command names or special contexts (as described\n\t      above for compdef) given as strings.  The first completion\n\t      function to be defined for one of the contexts in the list is\n\t      used to generate matches.  Typically, the last string is\n\t      -default- to cause the function for default completion to be\n\t      used as a fallback.\n\n\t      The function sets the parameter $service to the string being\n\t      tried, and sets the context/command field (the fourth) of the\n\t      $curcontext parameter to the context given as the first\n\t      argument.\n\n       _email_addresses [ -c ] [ -n plugin ]\n\t      Complete email addresses.  Addresses are provided by plugins.\n\n\t      -c     Complete bare localhost@domain.tld addresses, without a\n\t\t     name part or a comment.  Without this option, RFC822\n\t\t     `Firstname Lastname <address>' strings are completed.\n\n\t      -n plugin\n\t\t     Complete aliases from plugin.\n\n\t      The following plugins are available by default: _email-ldap (see\n\t      the filter style), _email-local (completes user@hostname Unix\n\t      addresses), _email-mail (completes aliases from ~/.mailrc),\n\t      _email-mush, _email-mutt, and _email-pine.\n\n\t      Addresses from the _email-foo plugin are added under the tag\n\t      `email-foo'.\n\n\t      Writing plugins\n\n\t      Plugins are written as separate functions with names starting\n\t      with `_email-'.  They are invoked with the -c option and compadd\n\t      options.\tThey should either do their own completion or set the\n\t      $reply array to a list of `alias:address' elements and return\n\t      300.  New plugins will be picked up and run automatically.\n\n       _files The function _files is a wrapper around _path_files. It supports\n\t      all of the same functionality, with some enhancements --\n\t      notably, it respects the list-dirs-first style, and it allows\n\t      users to override the behaviour of the -g and -/ options with\n\t      the file-patterns style. _files should therefore be preferred\n\t      over _path_files in most cases.\n\n\t      This function accepts the full set of options allowed by\n\t      _path_files, described below.\n\n       _gnu_generic\n\t      This function is a simple wrapper around the _arguments function\n\t      described above.\tIt can be used to determine automatically the\n\t      long options understood by commands that produce a list when\n\t      passed the option `--help'.  It is intended to be used as a\n\t      top-level completion function in its own right.  For example, to\n\t      enable option completion for the commands foo and bar, use\n\n\t\t     compdef _gnu_generic foo bar\n\n\t      after the call to compinit.\n\n\t      The completion system as supplied is conservative in its use of\n\t      this function, since it is important to be sure the command\n\t      understands the option `--help'.\n\n       _guard [ options ] pattern descr\n\t      This function displays descr if pattern matches the string to be\n\t      completed.  It is intended to be used in the action for the\n\t      specifications passed to _arguments and similar functions.\n\n\t      The return status is zero if the message was displayed and the\n\t      word to complete is not empty, and non-zero otherwise.\n\n\t      The pattern may be preceded by any of the options understood by\n\t      compadd that are passed down from _description, namely -M, -J,\n\t      -V, -1, -2, -n, -F and -X.  All of these options will be\n\t      ignored.\tThis fits in conveniently with the argument-passing\n\t      conventions of actions for _arguments.\n\n\t      As an example, consider a command taking the options -n and\n\t      -none, where -n must be followed by a numeric value in the same\n\t      word.  By using:\n\n\t\t     _arguments '-n-: :_guard \"[0-9]#\" \"numeric value\"' '-none'\n\n\t      _arguments can be made to both display the message `numeric\n\t      value' and complete options after `-n<TAB>'.  If the `-n' is\n\t      already followed by one or more digits (the pattern passed to\n\t      _guard) only the message will be displayed; if the `-n' is\n\t      followed by another character, only options are completed.\n\n       _message [ -r12 ] [ -VJ group ] descr\n       _message -e [ tag ] descr\n\t      The descr is used in the same way as the third argument to the\n\t      _description function, except that the resulting string will\n\t      always be shown whether or not matches were generated.  This is\n\t      useful for displaying a help message in places where no\n\t      completions can be generated.\n\n\t      The format style is examined with the messages tag to find a\n\t      message; the usual tag, descriptions, is used only if the style\n\t      is not set with the former.\n\n\t      If the -r option is given, no style is used; the descr is taken\n\t      literally as the string to display.  This is most useful when\n\t      the descr comes from a pre-processed argument list which already\n\t      contains an expanded description.  Note that this option does\n\t      not disable the `%'-sequence parsing done by compadd.\n\n\t      The -12VJ options and the group are passed to compadd and hence\n\t      determine the group the message string is added to.\n\n\t      The second -e form gives a description for completions with the\n\t      tag tag to be shown even if there are no matches for that tag.\n\t      This form is called by _arguments in the event that there is no\n\t      action for an option specification.  The tag can be omitted and\n\t      if so the tag is taken from the parameter $curtag; this is\n\t      maintained by the completion system and so is usually correct.\n\t      Note that if there are no matches at the time this function is\n\t      called, compstate[insert] is cleared, so additional matches\n\t      generated later are not inserted on the command line.\n\n       _multi_parts [ -i ] sep array\n\t      The argument sep is a separator character.  The array may be\n\t      either the name of an array parameter or a literal array in the\n\t      form `(foo bar)', a parenthesised list of words separated by\n\t      whitespace.  The possible completions are the strings from the\n\t      array.  However, each chunk delimited by sep will be completed\n\t      separately.  For example, the _tar function uses `_multi_parts /\n\t      patharray' to complete partial file paths from the given array\n\t      of complete file paths.\n\n\t      The -i option causes _multi_parts to insert a unique match even\n\t      if that requires multiple separators to be inserted.  This is\n\t      not usually the expected behaviour with filenames, but certain\n\t      other types of completion, for example those with a fixed set of\n\t      possibilities, may be more suited to this form.\n\n\t      Like other utility functions, this function accepts the `-V',\n\t      `-J', `-1', `-2', `-n', `-f', `-X', `-M', `-P', `-S', `-r',\n\t      `-R', and `-q' options and passes them to the compadd builtin.\n\n       _next_label [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ option ... ]\n\t      This function is used to implement the loop over different tag\n\t      labels for a particular tag as described above for the tag-order\n\t      style.  On each call it checks to see if there are any more tag\n\t      labels; if there is it returns status zero, otherwise non-zero.\n\t      As this function requires a current tag to be set, it must\n\t      always follow a call to _tags or _requested.\n\n\t      The -x12VJ options and the first three arguments are passed to\n\t      the _description function.  Where appropriate the tag will be\n\t      replaced by a tag label in this call.  Any description given in\n\t      the tag-order style is preferred to the descr passed to\n\t      _next_label.\n\n\t      The options given after the descr are set in the parameter given\n\t      by name, and hence are to be passed to compadd or whatever\n\t      function is called to add the matches.\n\n\t      Here is a typical use of this function for the tag foo.  The\n\t      call to _requested determines if tag foo is required at all; the\n\t      loop over _next_label handles any labels defined for the tag in\n\t      the tag-order style.\n\n\t\t     local expl ret=1\n\t\t     ...\n\t\t     if _requested foo; then\n\t\t       ...\n\t\t       while _next_label foo expl '...'; do\n\t\t\t compadd \"$expl[@]\" ... && ret=0\n\t\t       done\n\t\t       ...\n\t\t     fi\n\t\t     return ret\n\n       _normal [ -P | -p precommand ]\n\t      This is the standard function called to handle completion\n\t      outside any special -context-.  It is called both to complete\n\t      the command word and also the arguments for a command.  In the\n\t      second case, _normal looks for a special completion for that\n\t      command, and if there is none it uses the completion for the\n\t      -default- context.\n\n\t      A second use is to reexamine the command line specified by the\n\t      $words array and the $CURRENT parameter after those have been\n\t      modified.  For example, the function _precommand, which\n\t      completes after precommand specifiers such as nohup, removes the\n\t      first word from the words array, decrements the CURRENT\n\t      parameter, then calls `_normal -p $service'.  The effect is that\n\t      `nohup cmd ...' is treated in the same way as `cmd ...'.\n\n\t      -P     Reset the list of precommands. This option should be used\n\t\t     if completing a command line which allows internal\n\t\t     commands (e.g. builtins and functions) regardless of\n\t\t     prior precommands (e.g. `zsh -c').\n\n\t      -p precommand\n\t\t     Append precommand to the list of precommands. This option\n\t\t     should be used in nearly all cases in which -P is not\n\t\t     applicable.\n\n\t      If the command name matches one of the patterns given by one of\n\t      the options -p or -P to compdef, the corresponding completion\n\t      function is called and then the parameter _compskip is checked.\n\t      If it is set completion is terminated at that point even if no\n\t      matches have been found.\tThis is the same effect as in the\n\t      -first- context.\n\n       _numbers [ option ... ] [ description ] [ suffix ... ]\n\t      This can be used where a number is followed by a suffix to\n\t      indicate the units.  The unit suffixes are completed and can\n\t      also be included in the description used when completion is\n\t      invoked for the preceding number.\n\n\t      In addition to common compadd options, _numbers accepts the\n\t      following options:\n\n\t      -t tag Specify a tag to use instead of the default of numbers.\n\n\t      -u units\n\t\t     Indicate the default units for the number, e.g. bytes.\n\n\t      -l min Specify the lowest possible value for the number.\n\n\t      -m max Specify the highest possible value for the number.\n\n\t      -d default\n\t\t     Specify the default value.\n\n\t      -N     Allow negative numbers.  This is implied if the range\n\t\t     includes a negative.\n\n\t      -f     Allow decimal numbers.\n\n\t      Where a particular suffix represents the default units for a\n\t      number, it should be prefixed with a colon.  Additionally,\n\t      suffixes can be followed by a colon and a description.  So for\n\t      example, the following allows the age of something to be\n\t      specified, either in seconds or with an optional suffix with a\n\t      longer unit of time:\n\n\t\t     _numbers -u seconds age :s:seconds m:minutes h:hours d:days\n\n\t      It is typically helpful for units to be presented in order of\n\t      magnitude when completed.  To facilitate this, the order in\n\t      which they are given is preserved.\n\n\t      When the format style is looked up with the descriptions tag or\n\t      the tag specified with -t, the list of suffixes is available as\n\t      a `%x' escape sequence. This is in addition to the usual\n\t      sequences documented under the format style. The form this list\n\t      takes can also be configured. To this end, the format style is\n\t      first looked up with the tag unit-suffixes. The retrieved format\n\t      is applied to each suffix in turn and the results are then\n\t      concatenated to form the completed list. For the unit-suffixes\n\t      format, `%x' expands to the individual suffix and `%X' to its\n\t      description. %d' indicates a default suffix and can be used in a\n\t      condition. The index and reverse index are set in `%i' and `%r'\n\t      respectively and are useful for text included only with the\n\t      first and last suffixes in the list. So for example, the\n\t      following joins the suffixes together as a comma-separated list:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:unit-suffixes' format '%x%(r::,)'\n\n       _options\n\t      This can be used to complete the names of shell options.\tIt\n\t      provides a matcher specification that ignores a leading `no',\n\t      ignores underscores and allows upper-case letters to match their\n\t      lower-case counterparts (for example, `glob', `noglob',\n\t      `NO_GLOB' are all completed).  Any arguments are propagated to\n\t      the compadd builtin.\n\n       _options_set and _options_unset\n\t      These functions complete only set or unset options, with the\n\t      same matching specification used in the _options function.\n\n\t      Note that you need to uncomment a few lines in the\n\t      _main_complete function for these functions to work properly.\n\t      The lines in question are used to store the option settings in\n\t      effect before the completion widget locally sets the options it\n\t      needs.  Hence these functions are not generally used by the\n\t      completion system.\n\n       _parameters\n\t      This is used to complete the names of shell parameters.\n\n\t      The option `-g pattern' limits the completion to parameters\n\t      whose type matches the pattern.  The type of a parameter is that\n\t      shown by `print ${(t)param}', hence judicious use of `*' in\n\t      pattern is probably necessary.\n\n\t      All other arguments are passed to the compadd builtin.\n\n       _path_files\n\t      This function is used throughout the completion system to\n\t      complete filenames.  It allows completion of partial paths.  For\n\t      example, the string `/u/i/s/sig' may be completed to\n\t      `/usr/include/sys/signal.h'.\n\n\t      The options accepted by both _path_files and _files are:\n\n\t      -f     Complete all filenames.  This is the default.\n\n\t      -/     Specifies that only directories should be completed.\n\n\t      -g pattern\n\t\t     Specifies that only files matching the pattern should be\n\t\t     completed.\n\n\t      -W paths\n\t\t     Specifies path prefixes that are to be prepended to the\n\t\t     string from the command line to generate the filenames\n\t\t     but that should not be inserted as completions nor shown\n\t\t     in completion listings.  Here, paths may be the name of\n\t\t     an array parameter, a literal list of paths enclosed in\n\t\t     parentheses or an absolute pathname.\n\n\t      -F ignored-files\n\t\t     This behaves as for the corresponding option to the\n\t\t     compadd builtin.  It gives direct control over which\n\t\t     filenames should be ignored.  If the option is not\n\t\t     present, the ignored-patterns style is used.\n\n\t      Both _path_files and _files also accept the following options\n\t      which are passed to compadd: `-J', `-V', `-1', `-2', `-n', `-X',\n\t      `-M', `-P', `-S', `-q', `-r', and `-R'.\n\n\t      Finally, the _path_files function  uses the styles expand,\n\t      ambiguous, special-dirs, list-suffixes and file-sort described\n\t      above."

    Manpage text:

    compctl -M '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'

           This will first try completion without any global match specifications
           (the empty string) and, if that generates no matches, will try case
           insensitive completion.

    OPTION FLAGS
           [ -fcFBdeaRGovNAIOPZEnbjrzu/12 ]

           The remaining options specify the type of command arguments to look for
           during completion.  Any combination of these flags may be specified;
           the result is a sorted list of all the possibilities.  The options are
           as follows.

       Simple Flags
           These produce completion lists made up by the shell itself:

For\n\t      example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -k \"(cputime filesize datasize stacksize\n\t\t\t\t coredumpsize resident descriptors)\" limit\n\n       -g globstring\n\t      The globstring is expanded using filename globbing; it should be\n\t      quoted to protect it from immediate expansion. The resulting\n\t      filenames are taken as the possible completions.\tUse `*(/)'\n\t      instead of `*/' for directories.\tThe fignore special parameter\n\t      is not applied to the resulting files.  More than one pattern\n\t      may be given separated by blanks. (Note that brace expansion is\n\t      not part of globbing.  Use the syntax `(either|or)' to match\n\t      alternatives.)\n\n       -s subststring\n\t      The subststring is split into words and these words are than\n\t      expanded using all shell expansion mechanisms (see zshexpn(1)).\n\t      The resulting words are taken as possible completions.  The\n\t      fignore special parameter is not applied to the resulting files.\n\t      Note that -g is faster for filenames.\n\n       -K function\n\t      Call the given function to get the completions.  Unless the name\n\t      starts with an underscore, the function is passed two arguments:\n\t      the prefix and the suffix of the word on which completion is to\n\t      be attempted, in other words those characters before the cursor\n\t      position, and those from the cursor position onwards.  The whole\n\t      command line can be accessed with the -c and -l flags of the\n\t      read builtin. The function should set the variable reply to an\n\t      array containing the completions (one completion per element);\n\t      note that reply should not be made local to the function.  From\n\t      such a function the command line can be accessed with the -c and\n\t      -l flags to the read builtin.  For example,\n\n\t\t     function whoson { reply=(`users`); }\n\t\t     compctl -K whoson talk\n\n\t      completes only logged-on users after `talk'.  Note that `whoson'\n\t      must return an array, so `reply=`users`' would be incorrect.\n\n       -H num pattern\n\t      The possible completions are taken from the last num history\n\t      lines.  Only words matching pattern are taken.  If num is zero\n\t      or negative the whole history is searched and if pattern is the\n\t      empty string all words are taken (as with `*').  A typical use\n\t      is\n\n\t\t     compctl -D -f + -H 0 ''\n\n\t      which forces completion to look back in the history list for a\n\t      word if no filename matches.\n\n   Control Flags\n       These do not directly specify types of name to be completed, but\n       manipulate the options that do:\n\n       -Q     This instructs the shell not to quote any metacharacters in the\n\t      possible completions.  Normally the results of a completion are\n\t      inserted into the command line with any metacharacters quoted so\n\t      that they are interpreted as normal characters.  This is\n\t      appropriate for filenames and ordinary strings.  However, for\n\t      special effects, such as inserting a backquoted expression from\n\t      a completion array (-k) so that the expression will not be\n\t      evaluated until the complete line is executed, this option must\n\t      be used.\n\n       -P prefix\n\t      The prefix is inserted just before the completed string; any\n\t      initial part already typed will be completed and the whole\n\t      prefix ignored for completion purposes.  For example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -j -P \"%\" kill\n\n\t      inserts a `%' after the kill command and then completes job\n\t      names.\n\n       -S suffix\n\t      When a completion is found the suffix is inserted after the\n\t      completed string.  In the case of menu completion the suffix is\n\t      inserted immediately, but it is still possible to cycle through\n\t      the list of completions by repeatedly hitting the same key.\n\n       -W file-prefix\n\t      With directory file-prefix:  for command, file, directory and\n\t      globbing completion (options -c, -f, -/, -g), the file prefix is\n\t      implicitly added in front of the completion.  For example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -/ -W ~/Mail maildirs\n\n\t      completes any subdirectories to any depth beneath the directory\n\t      ~/Mail, although that prefix does not appear on the command\n\t      line.  The file-prefix may also be of the form accepted by the\n\t      -k flag, i.e. the name of an array or a literal list in\n\t      parenthesis. In this case all the directories in the list will\n\t      be searched for possible completions.\n\n       -q     If used with a suffix as specified by the -S option, this causes\n\t      the suffix to be removed if the next character typed is a blank\n\t      or does not insert anything or if the suffix consists of only\n\t      one character and the next character typed is the same\n\t      character; this the same rule used for the AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH\n\t      option.  The option is most useful for list separators (comma,\n\t      colon, etc.).\n\n       -l cmd This option restricts the range of command line words that are\n\t      considered to be arguments.  If combined with one of the\n\t      extended completion patterns `p[...]', `r[...]', or `R[...]'\n\t      (see the section `Extended Completion' below) the range is\n\t      restricted to the range of arguments specified in the brackets.\n\t      Completion is then performed as if these had been given as\n\t      arguments to the cmd supplied with the option. If the cmd string\n\t      is empty the first word in the range is instead taken as the\n\t      command name, and command name completion performed on the first\n\t      word in the range.  For example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -x 'r[-exec,;]' -l '' -- find\n\n\t      completes arguments between `-exec' and the following `;' (or\n\t      the end of the command line if there is no such string) as if\n\t      they were a separate command line.\n\n       -h cmd Normally zsh completes quoted strings as a whole. With this\n\t      option, completion can be done separately on different parts of\n\t      such strings. It works like the -l option but makes the\n\t      completion code work on the parts of the current word that are\n\t      separated by spaces. These parts are completed as if they were\n\t      arguments to the given cmd. If cmd is the empty string, the\n\t      first part is completed as a command name, as with -l.\n\n       -U     Use the whole list of possible completions, whether or not they\n\t      actually match the word on the command line.  The word typed so\n\t      far will be deleted.  This is most useful with a function (given\n\t      by the -K option) which can examine the word components passed\n\t      to it (or via the read builtin's -c and -l flags) and use its\n\t      own criteria to decide what matches.  If there is no completion,\n\t      the original word is retained.  Since the produced possible\n\t      completions seldom have interesting common prefixes and\n\t      suffixes, menu completion is started immediately if AUTO_MENU is\n\t      set and this flag is used.\n\n       -y func-or-var\n\t      The list provided by func-or-var is displayed instead of the\n\t      list of completions whenever a listing is required; the actual\n\t      completions to be inserted are not affected.  It can be provided\n\t      in two ways. Firstly, if func-or-var begins with a $ it defines\n\t      a variable, or if it begins with a left parenthesis a literal\n\t      array, which contains the list.  A variable may have been set by\n\t      a call to a function using the -K option.  Otherwise it contains\n\t      the name of a function which will be executed to create the\n\t      list.  The function will be passed as an argument list all\n\t      matching completions, including prefixes and suffixes expanded\n\t      in full, and should set the array reply to the result.  In both\n\t      cases, the display list will only be retrieved after a complete\n\t      list of matches has been created.\n\n\t      Note that the returned list does not have to correspond, even in\n\t      length, to the original set of matches, and may be passed as a\n\t      scalar instead of an array.  No special formatting of characters\n\t      is performed on the output in this case; in particular, newlines\n\t      are printed literally and if they appear output in columns is\n\t      suppressed.\n\n       -X explanation\n\t      Print explanation when trying completion on the current set of\n\t      options. A `%n' in this string is replaced by the number of\n\t      matches that were added for this explanation string.  The\n\t      explanation only appears if completion was tried and there was\n\t      no unique match, or when listing completions. Explanation\n\t      strings will be listed together with the matches of the group\n\t      specified together with the -X option (using the -J or -V\n\t      option). If the same explanation string is given to multiple -X\n\t      options, the string appears only once (for each group) and the\n\t      number of matches shown for the `%n' is the total number of all\n\t      matches for each of these uses. In any case, the explanation\n\t      string will only be shown if there was at least one match added\n\t      for the explanation string.\n\n\t      The sequences %B, %b, %S, %s, %U, and %u specify output\n\t      attributes (bold, standout, and underline), %F, %f, %K, %k\n\t      specify foreground and background colours, and %{...%} can be\n\t      used to include literal escape sequences as in prompts.\n\n       -Y explanation\n\t      Identical to -X, except that the explanation first undergoes\n\t      expansion following the usual rules for strings in double\n\t      quotes.  The expansion will be carried out after any functions\n\t      are called for the -K or -y options, allowing them to set\n\t      variables.\n\n       -t continue\n\t      The continue-string contains a character that specifies which\n\t      set of completion flags should be used next.  It is useful:\n\n\t      (i) With -T, or when trying a list of pattern completions, when\n\t      compctl would usually continue with ordinary processing after\n\t      finding matches; this can be suppressed with `-tn'.\n\n\t      (ii) With a list of alternatives separated by +, when compctl\n\t      would normally stop when one of the alternatives generates\n\t      matches.\tIt can be forced to consider the next set of\n\t      completions by adding `-t+' to the flags of the alternative\n\t      before the `+'.\n\n\t      (iii) In an extended completion list (see below), when compctl\n\t      would normally continue until a set of conditions succeeded,\n\t      then use only the immediately following flags.  With `-t-',\n\t      compctl will continue trying extended completions after the next\n\t      `-'; with `-tx' it will attempt completion with the default\n\t      flags, in other words those before the `-x'.\n\n       -J name\n\t      This gives the name of the group the matches should be placed\n\t      in. Groups are listed and sorted separately; likewise, menu\n\t      completion will offer the matches in the groups in the order in\n\t      which the groups were defined. If no group name is explicitly\n\t      given, the matches are stored in a group named default. The\n\t      first time a group name is encountered, a group with that name\n\t      is created. After that all matches with the same group name are\n\t      stored in that group.\n\n\t      This can be useful with non-exclusive alternative completions.\n\t      For example, in\n\n\t\t     compctl -f -J files -t+ + -v -J variables foo\n\n\t      both files and variables are possible completions, as the -t+\n\t      forces both sets of alternatives before and after the + to be\n\t      considered at once.  Because of the -J options, however, all\n\t      files are listed before all variables.\n\n       -V name\n\t      Like -J, but matches within the group will not be sorted in\n\t      listings nor in menu completion. These unsorted groups are in a\n\t      different name space from the sorted ones, so groups defined as\n\t      -J files and -V files are distinct.\n\n       -1     If given together with the -V option, makes only consecutive\n\t      duplicates in the group be removed. Note that groups with and\n\t      without this flag are in different name spaces.\n\n       -2     If given together with the -J or -V option, makes all duplicates\n\t      be kept. Again, groups with and without this flag are in\n\t      different name spaces.\n\n       -M match-spec\n\t      This defines additional matching control specifications that\n\t      should be used only when testing words for the list of flags\n\t      this flag appears in. The format of the match-spec string is\n\t      described in zshcompwid.\n\nALTERNATIVE COMPLETION\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options + options [ + ... ] [ + ] command ...\n\n       The form with `+' specifies alternative options. Completion is tried\n       with the options before the first `+'. If this produces no matches\n       completion is tried with the flags after the `+' and so on. If there\n       are no flags after the last `+' and a match has not been found up to\n       that point, default completion is tried.  If the list of flags contains\n       a -t with a + character, the next list of flags is used even if the\n       current list produced matches.\n\n       Additional options are available that restrict completion to some part\n       of the command line; this is referred to as `extended completion'.\n\nEXTENDED COMPLETION\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options -x pattern options - ... --\n\t       [ command ... ]\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options [ -x pattern options - ... -- ]\n\t       [ + options [ -x ... -- ] ... [+] ] [ command ... ]\n\n       The form with `-x' specifies extended completion for the commands\n       given; as shown, it may be combined with alternative completion using\n       `+'.  Each pattern is examined in turn; when a match is found, the\n       corresponding options, as described in the section `Option Flags'\n       above, are used to generate possible completions.  If no pattern\n       matches, the options given before the -x are used.\n\n       Note that each pattern should be supplied as a single argument and\n       should be quoted to prevent expansion of metacharacters by the shell.\n\n       A pattern is built of sub-patterns separated by commas; it matches if\n       at least one of these sub-patterns matches (they are `or'ed). These\n       sub-patterns are in turn composed of other sub-patterns separated by\n       white spaces which match if all of the sub-patterns match (they are\n       `and'ed).  An element of the sub-patterns is of the form `c[...][...]',\n       where the pairs of brackets may be repeated as often as necessary, and\n       matches if any of the sets of brackets match (an `or').\tThe example\n       below makes this clearer.\n\n       The elements may be any of the following:\n\n       s[string]...\n\t      Matches if the current word on the command line starts with one\n\t      of the strings given in brackets.  The string is not removed and\n\t      is not part of the completion.\n\n       S[string]...\n\t      Like s[string] except that the string is part of the completion.\n\n       p[from,to]...\n\t      Matches if the number of the current word is between one of the\n\t      from and to pairs inclusive. The comma and to are optional; to\n\t      defaults to the same value as from.  The numbers may be\n\t      negative: -n refers to the n'th last word on the line.\n\n       c[offset,string]...\n\t      Matches if the string matches the word offset by offset from the\n\t      current word position.  Usually offset will be negative.\n\n       C[offset,pattern]...\n\t      Like c but using pattern matching instead.\n\n       w[index,string]...\n\t      Matches if the word in position index is equal to the\n\t      corresponding string.  Note that the word count is made after\n\t      any alias expansion.\n\n       W[index,pattern]...\n\t      Like w but using pattern matching instead.\n\n       n[index,string]...\n\t      Matches if the current word contains string.  Anything up to and\n\t      including the indexth occurrence of this string will not be\n\t      considered part of the completion, but the rest will.  index may\n\t      be negative to count from the end: in most cases, index will be\n\t      1 or -1.\tFor example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -s '`users`' -x 'n[1,@]' -k hosts -- talk\n\n\t      will usually complete usernames, but if you insert an @ after\n\t      the name, names from the array hosts (assumed to contain\n\t      hostnames, though you must make the array yourself) will be\n\t      completed.  Other commands such as rcp can be handled similarly.\n\n       N[index,string]...\n\t      Like n except that the string will be taken as a character\n\t      class.

    The leading-equals form also allows different parts of the displayed
           strings to be colored differently.  For this, the pattern has to use
           the `(#b)' globbing flag and pairs of parentheses surrounding the parts
           of the strings that are to be colored differently.  In this case the
           value may consist of more than one color code separated by equal signs.
           The first code will be used for all parts for which no explicit code is
           specified and the following codes will be used for the parts matched by
           the sub-patterns in parentheses.  For example, the specification
           `=(#b)(?)*(?)=0=3=7' will be used for all matches which are at least
           two characters long and will use the code `3' for the first character,
           `7' for the last character and `0' for the rest.

           All three forms of name may be preceded by a pattern in parentheses.

    Limitations
           Although reading and writing of the file in question is efficiently
           handled, zsh's internal memory management may be arbitrarily baroque;
           however, mapfile is usually very much more efficient than anything
           involving a loop.  Note in particular that the whole contents of the
           file will always reside physically in memory when accessed (possibly
           multiple times, due to standard parameter substitution operations).  In
           particular, this means handling of sufficiently long files (greater
           than the machine's swap space, or than the range of the pointer type)
           will be incorrect.

           No errors are printed or flagged for non-existent, unreadable, or
           unwritable files, as the parameter mechanism is too low in the shell
           execution hierarchy to make this convenient.

           It is unfortunate that the mechanism for loading modules does not yet
           allow the user to specify the name of the shell parameter to be given
           the special behaviour.

    Manpage text:

    Aside from the default colour, the ANSI standard for terminal escape
           codes provides for eight colours. The bright attribute brings this to
           sixteen. These basic colours are commonly used in terminal applications
           due to being widely supported. Expanded 88 and 256 colour palettes are
           also common and, while the first sixteen colours vary somewhat between
           terminals and configurations, these add a generally consistent and
           predictable set of colours.

           In order to use the zsh/nearcolor module, it only needs to be loaded.
           Thereafter, whenever a colour is specified using a hex triplet, it will
           be compared against each of the available colours and the closest will
           be selected. The first sixteen colours are never matched in this
           process due to being unpredictable.

           It isn't possible to reliably detect support for true colour in the
           terminal emulator. It is therefore recommended to be selective in
           loading the zsh/nearcolor module. For example, the following checks the
           COLORTERM environment variable:

           zsh/nearcolor module.

           zshenv file (typically /etc/zshenv), if any, have been executed.  If
           the module is not available it is silently ignored by the shell; the
           module may safely be removed from $MODULE_PATH by the administrator if
           it is not required.

           On loading, the module tests if any of the start-up files .zshenv,
           .zprofile, .zshrc or .zlogin exist in the directory given by the
           environment variable ZDOTDIR, or the user's home directory if that is
           not set.  The test is not performed and the module halts processing if
           the shell was in an emulation mode (i.e. had been invoked as some other
           shell than zsh).

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.



    Manpage text:

    If none of the start-up files were found, the module then looks for the
           file newuser first in a sitewide directory, usually the parent
           directory of the site-functions directory, and if that is not found the
           module searches in a version-specific directory, usually the parent of
           the functions directory containing version-specific functions.  (These
           directories can be configured when zsh is built using the
           --enable-site-scriptdir=dir and --enable-scriptdir=dir flags to
           configure, respectively; the defaults are prefix/share/zsh and
           prefix/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION where the default prefix is /usr/local.)

           If the file newuser is found, it is then sourced in the same manner as
           a start-up file.  The file is expected to contain code to install
           start-up files for the user, however any valid shell code will be
           executed.

           The zsh/newuser module is then unconditionally unloaded.

           Note that it is possible to achieve exactly the same effect as the
           zsh/newuser module by adding code to /etc/zshenv.  The module exists
           simply to allow the shell to make arrangements for new users without
           the need for intervention by package maintainers and system
           administrators.

Option -m will compile a\n\t      multi-line pattern; that is, ^ and $ will match newlines within\n\t      the pattern.  Option -x will compile an extended pattern,\n\t      wherein whitespace and # comments are ignored.  Option -s makes\n\t      the dot metacharacter match all characters, including those that\n\t      indicate newline.\n\n       pcre_study\n\t      Studies the previously-compiled PCRE which may result in faster\n\t      matching.\n\n       pcre_match [ -v var ] [ -a arr ] [ -n offset ] [ -b ] string\n\t      Returns successfully if string matches the previously-compiled\n\t      PCRE.\n\n\t      Upon successful match, if the expression captures substrings\n\t      within parentheses, pcre_match will set the array match to those\n\t      substrings, unless the -a option is given, in which case it will\n\t      set the array arr.  Similarly, the variable MATCH will be set to\n\t      the entire matched portion of the string, unless the -v option\n\t      is given, in which case the variable var will be set.  No\n\t      variables are altered if there is no successful match.  A -n\n\t      option starts searching for a match from the byte offset\n\t      position in string.  If the -b option is given, the variable\n\t      ZPCRE_OP will be set to an offset pair string, representing the\n\t      byte offset positions of the entire matched portion within the\n\t      string.  For example, a ZPCRE_OP set to \"32 45\" indicates that\n\t      the matched portion began on byte offset 32 and ended on byte\n\t      offset 44.  Here, byte offset position 45 is the position\n\t      directly after the matched portion.  Keep in mind that the byte\n\t      position isn't necessarily the same as the character position\n\t      when UTF-8 characters are involved.  Consequently, the byte\n\t      offset positions are only to be relied on in the context of\n\t      using them for subsequent searches on string, using an offset\n\t      position as an argument to the -n option.  This is mostly used\n\t      to implement the \"find all non-overlapping matches\"\n\t      functionality.\n\n\t      A simple example of \"find all non-overlapping matches\":\n\n\t\t     string=\"The following zip codes: 78884 90210 99513\"\n\t\t     pcre_compile -m \"\\d{5}\"\n\t\t     accum=()\n\t\t     pcre_match -b -- $string\n\t\t     while [[ $? -eq 0 ]] do\n\t\t\t b=($=ZPCRE_OP)\n\t\t\t accum+=$MATCH\n\t\t\t pcre_match -b -n $b[2] -- $string\n\t\t     done\n\t\t     print -l $accum\n\n       The zsh/pcre module makes available the following test condition:\n\n       expr -pcre-match pcre\n\t      Matches a string against a perl-compatible regular expression.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     [[ \"$text\" -pcre-match ^d+$ ]] &&\n\t\t     print text variable contains only \"d's\".\n\n\t      If the REMATCH_PCRE option is set, the =~ operator is equivalent\n\t      to -pcre-match, and the NO_CASE_MATCH option may be used.  Note\n\t      that NO_CASE_MATCH never applies to the pcre_match builtin,\n\t      instead use the -i switch of pcre_compile.\n\nTHE ZSH/PARAM/PRIVATE MODULE\n       The zsh/param/private module is used to create parameters whose scope\n       is limited to the current function body, and not to other functions\n       called by the current function.\n\n       This module provides a single autoloaded builtin:\n\n       private [ {+|-}AHUahlmrtux ] [ {+|-}EFLRZi [ n ] ] [ name[=value] ... ]\n\t      The private builtin accepts all the same options and arguments\n\t      as local (zshbuiltins(1)) except for the `-T' option.  Tied\n\t      parameters may not be made private.\n\n\t      The `-p' option is presently a no-op because the state of\n\t      private parameters cannot reliably be reloaded.  This also\n\t      applies to printing private parameters with `typeset -p'.\n\n\t      If used at the top level (outside a function scope), private\n\t      creates a normal parameter in the same manner as declare or\n\t      typeset.\tA warning about this is printed if WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL\n\t      is set (zshoptions(1)).  Used inside a function scope, private\n\t      creates a local parameter similar to one declared with local,\n\t      except having special properties noted below.\n\n\t      Special parameters which expose or manipulate internal shell\n\t      state, such as ARGC, argv, COLUMNS, LINES, UID, EUID, IFS,\n\t      PROMPT, RANDOM, SECONDS, etc., cannot be made private unless the\n\t      `-h' option is used to hide the special meaning of the\n\t      parameter.  This may change in the future.\n\n       As with other typeset equivalents, private is both a builtin and a\n       reserved word, so arrays may be assigned with parenthesized word list\n       name=(value...) syntax.\tHowever, the reserved word `private' is not\n       available until zsh/param/private is loaded, so care must be taken with\n       order of execution and parsing for function definitions which use\n       private.  To compensate for this, the module also adds the option `-P'\n       to the `local' builtin to declare private parameters.\n\n       For example, this construction fails if zsh/param/private has not yet\n       been loaded when `bad_declaration' is defined:\n\t      bad_declaration() {\n\t\tzmodload zsh/param/private\n\t\tprivate array=( one two three )\n\t      }\n\n       This construction works because local is already a keyword, and the\n       module is loaded before the statement is executed:\n\t      good_declaration() {\n\t\tzmodload zsh/param/private\n\t\tlocal -P array=( one two three )\n\t      }\n\n       The following is usable in scripts but may have trouble with autoload:\n\t      zmodload zsh/param/private\n\t      iffy_declaration() {\n\t\tprivate array=( one two three )\n\t      }\n\n       The private builtin may always be used with scalar assignments and for\n       declarations without assignments.\n\n       Parameters declared with private have the following properties:\n\n       •      Within the function body where it is declared, the parameter\n\t      behaves as a local, except as noted above for tied or special\n\t      parameters.\n\n       •      The type of a parameter declared private cannot be changed in\n\t      the scope where it was declared, even if the parameter is unset.\n\t      Thus an array cannot be assigned to a private scalar, etc.\n\n       •      Within any other function called by the declaring function, the\n\t      private parameter does NOT hide other parameters of the same\n\t      name, so for example a global parameter of the same name is\n\t      visible and may be assigned or unset.  This includes calls to\n\t      anonymous functions, although that may also change in the\n\t      future.  However, the private name may not be created outside\n\t      the local scope when it was not previously declared.\n\n       •      An exported private remains in the environment of inner scopes\n\t      but appears unset for the current shell in those scopes.\n\t      Generally, exporting private parameters should be avoided.\n\n       Note that this differs from the static scope defined by compiled\n       languages derived from C, in that the a new call to the same function\n       creates a new scope, i.e., the parameter is still associated with the\n       call stack rather than with the function definition.  It differs from\n       ksh `typeset -S' because the syntax used to define the function has no\n       bearing on whether the parameter scope is respected.\n\nTHE ZSH/REGEX MODULE\n       The zsh/regex module makes available the following test condition:\n\n       expr -regex-match regex\n\t      Matches a string against a POSIX extended regular expression.\n\t      On successful match, matched portion of the string will normally\n\t      be placed in the MATCH variable.\tIf there are any capturing\n\t      parentheses within the regex, then the match array variable will\n\t      contain those.  If the match is not successful, then the\n\t      variables will not be altered.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     [[ alphabetical -regex-match ^a([^a]+)a([^a]+)a ]] &&\n\t\t     print -l $MATCH X $match\n\n\t      If the option REMATCH_PCRE is not set, then the =~ operator will\n\t      automatically load this module as needed and will invoke the\n\t      -regex-match operator.\n\n\t      If BASH_REMATCH is set, then the array BASH_REMATCH will be set\n\t      instead of MATCH and match.\n\n\t      Note that the zsh/regex module logic relies on the host system.\n\t      The same expr and regex pair could produce different results on\n\t      different platforms if a regex with non-standard syntax is\n\t      given.\n\n\t      For example, no syntax for matching a word boundary is defined\n\t      in the POSIX extended regular expression standard. GNU libc and\n\t      BSD libc both provide such syntaxes as extensions (\\b and\n\t      [[:<:]]/[[:>:]] respectively), but neither of these syntaxes is\n\t      supported by both of these implementations.\n\n\t      Refer to the regcomp(3) and re_format(7) manual pages on your\n\t      system for locally-supported syntax.\n\nTHE ZSH/SCHED MODULE\n       The zsh/sched module makes available one builtin command and one\n       parameter.\n\n       sched [-o] [+]hh:mm[:ss] command ...\n       sched [-o] [+]seconds command ...\n       sched [ -item ]\n\t      Make an entry in the scheduled list of commands to execute.  The\n\t      time may be specified in either absolute or relative time, and\n\t      either as hours, minutes and (optionally) seconds separated by a\n\t      colon, or seconds alone.\tAn absolute number of seconds\n\t      indicates the time since the epoch (1970/01/01 00:00); this is\n\t      useful in combination with the features in the zsh/datetime\n\t      module, see the zsh/datetime module entry in zshmodules(1).\n\n\t      With no arguments, prints the list of scheduled commands.  If\n\t      the scheduled command has the -o flag set, this is shown at the\n\t      start of the command.\n\n\t      With the argument `-item', removes the given item from the list.\n\t      The numbering of the list is continuous and entries are in time\n\t      order, so the numbering can change when entries are added or\n\t      deleted.\n\n\t      Commands are executed either immediately before a prompt, or\n\t      while the shell's line editor is waiting for input.  In the\n\t      latter case it is useful to be able to produce output that does\n\t      not interfere with the line being edited.  Providing the option\n\t      -o causes the shell to clear the command line before the event\n\t      and redraw it afterwards.  This should be used with any\n\t      scheduled event that produces visible output to the terminal; it\n\t      is not needed, for example, with output that updates a terminal\n\t      emulator's title bar.\n\n\t      To effect changes to the editor buffer when an event executes,\n\t      use the `zle' command with no arguments to test whether the\n\t      editor is active, and if it is, then use `zle widget' to access\n\t      the editor via the named widget.\n\n\t      The sched builtin is not made available by default when the\n\t      shell starts in a mode emulating another shell.  It can be made\n\t      available with the command `zmodload -F zsh/sched b:sched'.\n\n       zsh_scheduled_events\n\t      A readonly array corresponding to the events scheduled by the\n\t      sched builtin.  The indices of the array correspond to the\n\t      numbers shown when sched is run with no arguments (provided that\n\t      the KSH_ARRAYS option is not set).  The value of the array\n\t      consists of the scheduled time in seconds since the epoch (see\n\t      the section `The zsh/datetime Module' for facilities for using\n\t      this number), followed by a colon, followed by any options\n\t      (which may be empty but will be preceded by a `-' otherwise),\n\t      followed by a colon, followed by the command to be executed.\n\n\t      The sched builtin should be used for manipulating the events.\n\t      Note that this will have an immediate effect on the contents of\n\t      the array, so that indices may become invalid.\n\nTHE ZSH/NET/SOCKET MODULE\n       The zsh/net/socket module makes available one builtin command:\n\n       zsocket [ -altv ] [ -d fd ] [ args ]\n\t      zsocket is implemented as a builtin to allow full use of shell\n\t      command line editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.\n\n   Outbound Connections\n       zsocket [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename\n\t      Open a new Unix domain connection to filename.  The shell\n\t      parameter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor associated\n\t      with that connection.  Currently, only stream connections are\n\t      supported.\n\n\t      If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the target\n\t      file descriptor for the connection.\n\n\t      In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.\n\n\t      File descriptors can be closed with normal shell syntax when no\n\t      longer needed, for example:\n\n\t\t     exec {REPLY}>&-\n\n   Inbound Connections\n       zsocket -l [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename\n\t      zsocket -l will open a socket listening on filename.  The shell\n\t      parameter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor associated\n\t      with that listener.  The file descriptor remains open in\n\t      subshells and forked external executables.\n\n\t      If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the target\n\t      file descriptor for the connection.\n\n\t      In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.\n\n       zsocket -a [ -tv ] [ -d targetfd ] listenfd\n\t      zsocket -a will accept an incoming connection to the socket\n\t      associated with listenfd.  The shell parameter REPLY will be set\n\t      to the file descriptor associated with the inbound connection.\n\t      The file descriptor remains open in subshells and forked\n\t      external executables.\n\n\t      If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the target\n\t      file descriptor for the connection.\n\n\t      If -t is specified, zsocket will return if no incoming\n\t      connection is pending.

This form of locking requires the processes\n\t      accessing the file to cooperate; its most obvious use is between\n\t      two instances of the shell itself.\n\n\t      In the first form the named file, which must already exist, is\n\t      locked by opening a file descriptor to the file and applying a\n\t      lock to the file descriptor.  The lock terminates when the shell\n\t      process that created the lock exits; it is therefore often\n\t      convenient to create file locks within subshells, since the lock\n\t      is automatically released when the subshell exits.  Note that\n\t      use of the print builtin with the -u option will, as a side\n\t      effect, release the lock, as will redirection to the file in the\n\t      shell holding the lock.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe other forms can be used to look up or test styles for a\n\t      given context.\n\n\t      zstyle -s context style name [ sep ]\n\t\t     The parameter name is set to the value of the style\n\t\t     interpreted as a string.  If the value contains several\n\t\t     strings they are concatenated with spaces (or with the\n\t\t     sep string if that is given) between them.\n\n\t\t     Return 0 if the style is set, 1 otherwise.\n\n\t      zstyle -b context style name\n\t\t     The value is stored in name as a boolean, i.e. as the\n\t\t     string `yes' if the value has only one string and that\n\t\t     string is equal to one of `yes', `true', `on', or `1'. If\n\t\t     the value is any other string or has more than one\n\t\t     string, the parameter is set to `no'.\n\n\t\t     Return 0 if name is set to `yes', 1 otherwise.\n\n\t      zstyle -a context style name\n\t\t     The value is stored in name as an array. If name is\n\t\t     declared as an associative array,\tthe first, third, etc.\n\t\t     strings are used as the keys and the other strings are\n\t\t     used as the values.\n\n\t\t     Return 0 if the style is set, 1 otherwise.\n\n\t      zstyle -t context style [ string ... ]\n\t      zstyle -T context style [ string ... ]\n\t\t     Test the value of a style, i.e. the -t option only\n\t\t     returns a status (sets $?).  Without any string the\n\t\t     return status is zero if the style is defined for at\n\t\t     least one matching pattern, has only one string in its\n\t\t     value, and that is equal to one of `true', `yes', `on' or\n\t\t     `1'. If any strings are given the status is zero if and\n\t\t     only if at least one of the strings is equal to at least\n\t\t     one of the strings in the value. If the style is defined\n\t\t     but doesn't match, the return status is 1. If the style\n\t\t     is not defined, the status is 2.\n\n\t\t     The -T option tests the values of the style like -t, but\n\t\t     it returns status zero (rather than 2) if the style is\n\t\t     not defined for any matching pattern.\n\n\t      zstyle -m context style pattern\n\t\t     Match a value. Returns status zero if the pattern matches\n\t\t     at least one of the strings in the value.\n\n       zformat -f param format spec ...\n       zformat -F param format spec ...\n       zformat -a array sep spec ...\n\t      This builtin provides different forms of formatting. The first\n\t      form is selected with the -f option. In this case the format\n\t      string will be modified by replacing sequences starting with a\n\t      percent sign in it with strings from the specs.  Each spec\n\t      should be of the form `char:string' which will cause every\n\t      appearance of the sequence `%char' in format to be replaced by\n\t      the string.  The `%' sequence may also contain optional minimum\n\t      and maximum field width specifications between the `%' and the\n\t      `char' in the form `%min.maxc', i.e. the minimum field width is\n\t      given first and if the maximum field width is used, it has to be\n\t      preceded by a dot.  Specifying a minimum field width makes the\n\t      result be padded with spaces to the right if the string is\n\t      shorter than the requested width.  Padding to the left can be\n\t      achieved by giving a negative minimum field width.  If a maximum\n\t      field width is specified, the string will be truncated after\n\t      that many characters.  After all `%' sequences for the given\n\t      specs have been processed, the resulting string is stored in the\n\t      parameter param.\n\n\t      The %-escapes also understand ternary expressions in the form\n\t      used by prompts.\tThe % is followed by a `(' and then an\n\t      ordinary format specifier character as described above.  There\n\t      may be a set of digits either before or after the `('; these\n\t      specify a test number, which defaults to zero.  Negative numbers\n\t      are also allowed.  An arbitrary delimiter character follows the\n\t      format specifier, which is followed by a piece of `true' text,\n\t      the delimiter character again, a piece of `false' text, and a\n\t      closing parenthesis.  The complete expression (without the\n\t      digits) thus looks like `%(X.text1.text2)', except that the `.'\n\t      character is arbitrary.  The value given for the format\n\t      specifier in the char:string expressions is evaluated as a\n\t      mathematical expression, and compared with the test number.  If\n\t      they are the same, text1 is output, else text2 is output.  A\n\t      parenthesis may be escaped in text2 as %).  Either of text1 or\n\t      text2 may contain nested %-escapes.\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     zformat -f REPLY \"The answer is '%3(c.yes.no)'.\" c:3\n\n\t      outputs \"The answer is 'yes'.\" to REPLY since the value for the\n\t      format specifier c is 3, agreeing with the digit argument to the\n\t      ternary expression.\n\n\t      With -F instead of -f, ternary expressions choose between the\n\t      `true' or `false' text on the basis of whether the format\n\t      specifier is present and non-empty.  A test number indicates a\n\t      minimum width for the value given in the format specifier.\n\t      Negative numbers reverse this, so the test is for whether the\n\t      value exceeds a maximum width.\n\n\t      The form, using the -a option, can be used for aligning strings.\n\t      Here, the specs are of the form `left:right' where `left' and\n\t      `right' are arbitrary strings.  These strings are modified by\n\t      replacing the colons by the sep string and padding the left\n\t      strings with spaces to the right so that the sep strings in the\n\t      result (and hence the right strings after them) are all aligned\n\t      if the strings are printed below each other.  All strings\n\t      without a colon are left unchanged and all strings with an empty\n\t      right string have the trailing colon removed.  In both cases the\n\t      lengths of the strings are not used to determine how the other\n\t      strings are to be aligned.  A colon in the left string can be\n\t      escaped with a backslash.  The resulting strings are stored in\n\t      the array.\n\n       zregexparse\n\t      This implements some internals of the _regex_arguments function.\n\n       zparseopts [ -D -E -F -K -M ] [ -a array ] [ -A assoc ] [ - ] spec ...\n\t      This builtin simplifies the parsing of options in positional\n\t      parameters, i.e. the set of arguments given by $*.  Each spec\n\t      describes one option and must be of the form `opt[=array]'.  If\n\t      an option described by opt is found in the positional parameters\n\t      it is copied into the array specified with the -a option; if the\n\t      optional `=array' is given, it is instead copied into that\n\t      array, which should be declared as a normal array and never as\n\t      an associative array.\n\n\t      Note that it is an error to give any spec without an `=array'\n\t      unless one of the -a or -A options is used.\n\n\t      Unless the -E option is given, parsing stops at the first string\n\t      that isn't described by one of the specs.  Even with -E, parsing\n\t      always stops at a positional parameter equal to `-' or `--'. See\n\t      also -F.\n\n\t      The opt description must be one of the following.  Any of the\n\t      special characters can appear in the option name provided it is\n\t      preceded by a backslash.\n\n\t      name\n\t      name+  The name is the name of the option without the leading\n\t\t     `-'.  To specify a GNU-style long option, one of the\n\t\t     usual two leading `-' must be included in name; for\n\t\t     example, a `--file' option is represented by a name of\n\t\t     `-file'.\n\n\t\t     If a `+' appears after name, the option is appended to\n\t\t     array each time it is found in the positional parameters;\n\t\t     without the `+' only the last occurrence of the option is\n\t\t     preserved.\n\n\t\t     If one of these forms is used, the option takes no\n\t\t     argument, so parsing stops if the next positional\n\t\t     parameter does not also begin with `-' (unless the -E\n\t\t     option is used).\n\n\t      name:\n\t      name:-\n\t      name:: If one or two colons are given, the option takes an\n\t\t     argument; with one colon, the argument is mandatory and\n\t\t     with two colons it is optional.  The argument is appended\n\t\t     to the array after the option itself.\n\n\t\t     An optional argument is put into the same array element\n\t\t     as the option name (note that this makes empty strings as\n\t\t     arguments indistinguishable).  A mandatory argument is\n\t\t     added as a separate element unless the `:-' form is used,\n\t\t     in which case the argument is put into the same element.\n\n\t\t     A `+' as described above may appear between the name and\n\t\t     the first colon.\n\n\t      In all cases, option-arguments must appear either immediately\n\t      following the option in the same positional parameter or in the\n\t      next one. Even an optional argument may appear in the next\n\t      parameter, unless it begins with a `-'.  There is no special\n\t      handling of `=' as with GNU-style argument parsers; given the\n\t      spec `-foo:', the positional parameter `--foo=bar' is parsed as\n\t      `--foo' with an argument of `=bar'.\n\n\t      When the names of two options that take no arguments overlap,\n\t      the longest one wins, so that parsing for the specs `-foo\n\t      -foobar' (for example) is unambiguous. However, due to the\n\t      aforementioned handling of option-arguments, ambiguities may\n\t      arise when at least one overlapping spec takes an argument, as\n\t      in `-foo: -foobar'. In that case, the last matching spec wins.\n\n\t      The options of zparseopts itself cannot be stacked because, for\n\t      example, the stack `-DEK' is indistinguishable from a spec for\n\t      the GNU-style long option `--DEK'.  The options of zparseopts\n\t      itself are:\n\n\t      -a array\n\t\t     As described above, this names the default array in which\n\t\t     to store the recognised options.\n\n\t      -A assoc\n\t\t     If this is given, the options and their values are also\n\t\t     put into an associative array with the option names as\n\t\t     keys and the arguments (if any) as the values.\n\n\t      -D     If this option is given, all options found are removed\n\t\t     from the positional parameters of the calling shell or\n\t\t     shell function, up to but not including any not described\n\t\t     by the specs.  If the first such parameter is `-' or\n\t\t     `--', it is removed as well.  This is similar to using\n\t\t     the shift builtin.\n\n\t      -E     This changes the parsing rules to not stop at the first\n\t\t     string that isn't described by one of the specs.  It can\n\t\t     be used to test for or (if used together with -D) extract\n\t\t     options and their arguments, ignoring all other options\n\t\t     and arguments that may be in the positional parameters.\n\t\t     As indicated above, parsing still stops at the first `-'\n\t\t     or `--' not described by a spec, but it is not removed\n\t\t     when used with -D.\n\n\t      -F     If this option is given, zparseopts immediately stops at\n\t\t     the first option-like parameter not described by one of\n\t\t     the specs, prints an error message, and returns status 1.\n\t\t     Removal (-D) and extraction (-E) are not performed, and\n\t\t     option arrays are not updated.  This provides basic\n\t\t     validation for the given options.\n\n\t\t     Note that the appearance in the positional parameters of\n\t\t     an option without its required argument always aborts\n\t\t     parsing and returns an error as described above\n\t\t     regardless of whether this option is used.\n\n\t      -K     With this option, the arrays specified with the -a option\n\t\t     and with the `=array' forms are kept unchanged when none\n\t\t     of the specs for them is used.  Otherwise the entire\n\t\t     array is replaced when any of the specs is used.\n\t\t     Individual elements of associative arrays specified with\n\t\t     the -A option are preserved by -K.  This allows\n\t\t     assignment of default values to arrays before calling\n\t\t     zparseopts.\n\n\t      -M     This changes the assignment rules to implement a map\n\t\t     among equivalent option names.  If any spec uses the\n\t\t     `=array' form, the string array is interpreted as the\n\t\t     name of another spec, which is used to choose where to\n\t\t     store the values.\tIf no other spec is found, the values\n\t\t     are stored as usual.  This changes only the way the\n\t\t     values are stored, not the way $* is parsed, so results\n\t\t     may be unpredictable if the `name+' specifier is used\n\t\t     inconsistently.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend\n\t\t     zparseopts a=foo b:=bar c+:=bar\n\n\t      will have the effect of\n\n\t\t     foo=(-a)\n\t\t     bar=(-b x -c y -c z)\n\n\t      The arguments from `baz' on will not be used.\n\n\t      As an example for the -E option, consider:\n\n\t\t     set -- -a x -b y -c z arg1 arg2\n\t\t     zparseopts -E -D b:=bar\n\n\t      will have the effect of\n\n\t\t     bar=(-b y)\n\t\t     set -- -a x -c z arg1 arg2\n\n\t      I.e., the option -b and its arguments are taken from the\n\t      positional parameters and put into the array bar.\n\n\t      The -M option can be used like this:\n\n\t\t     set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend\n\t\t     zparseopts -A bar -M a=foo b+: c:=b\n\n\t      to have the effect of\n\n\t\t     foo=(-a)\n\t\t     bar=(-a '' -b xyz)\n\nNAME\n       zshtcpsys - zsh tcp system\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       A module zsh/net/tcp is provided to provide network I/O over TCP/IP\n       from within the shell; see its description in zshmodules(1).  This\n       manual page describes a function suite based on the module.  If the\n       module is installed, the functions are usually installed at the same\n       time, in which case they will be available for autoloading in the\n       default function search path.  In addition to the zsh/net/tcp module,\n       the zsh/zselect module is used to implement timeouts on read\n       operations.  For troubleshooting tips, consult the corresponding advice\n       for the zftp functions described in zshzftpsys(1).\n\n       There are functions corresponding to the basic I/O operations open,\n       close, read and send, named tcp_open etc., as well as a function\n       tcp_expect for pattern match analysis of data read as input.  The\n       system makes it easy to receive data from and send data to multiple\n       named sessions at once.\tIn addition, it can be linked with the shell's\n       line editor in such a way that input data is automatically shown at the\n       terminal.  Other facilities available including logging, filtering and\n       configurable output prompts.\n\n       To use the system where it is available, it should be enough to\n       `autoload -U tcp_open' and run tcp_open as documented below to start a\n       session.  The tcp_open function will autoload the remaining functions.\n\nTCP USER FUNCTIONS\n   Basic I/O\n       tcp_open [ -qz ] host port [ sess ]\n       tcp_open [ -qz ] [ -s sess | -l sess[,...] ] ...\n       tcp_open [ -qz ] [ -a fd | -f fd ] [ sess ]\n\t      Open a new session.  In the first and simplest form, open a TCP\n\t      connection to host host at port port; numeric and symbolic forms\n\t      are understood for both.\n\n\t      If sess is given, this becomes the name of the session which can\n\t      be used to refer to multiple different TCP connections.  If sess\n\t      is not given, the function will invent a numeric name value\n\t      (note this is not the same as the file descriptor to which the\n\t      session is attached).  It is recommended that session names not\n\t      include `funny' characters, where funny characters are not\n\t      well-defined but certainly do not include alphanumerics or\n\t      underscores, and certainly do include whitespace.\n\n\t      In the second case, one or more sessions to be opened are given\n\t      by name.\tA single session name is given after -s and a\n\t      comma-separated list after -l; both options may be repeated as\n\t      many times as necessary.\tA failure to open any session causes\n\t      tcp_open to abort.  The host and port are read from the file\n\t      .ztcp_sessions in the same directory as the user's zsh\n\t      initialisation files, i.e. usually the home directory, but\n\t      $ZDOTDIR if that is set.\tThe file consists of lines each giving\n\t      a session name and the corresponding host and port, in that\n\t      order (note the session name comes first, not last), separated\n\t      by whitespace.\n\n\t      The third form allows passive and fake TCP connections.  If the\n\t      option -a is used, its argument is a file descriptor open for\n\t      listening for connections.  No function front-end is provided to\n\t      open such a file descriptor, but a call to `ztcp -l port' will\n\t      create one with the file descriptor stored in the parameter\n\t      $REPLY.  The listening port can be closed with `ztcp -c fd'.  A\n\t      call to `tcp_open -a fd' will block until a remote TCP\n\t      connection is made to port on the local machine.\tAt this point,\n\t      a session is created in the usual way and is largely\n\t      indistinguishable from an active connection created with one of\n\t      the first two forms.\n\n\t      If the option -f is used, its argument is a file descriptor\n\t      which is used directly as if it were a TCP session.  How well\n\t      the remainder of the TCP function system copes with this depends\n\t      on what actually underlies this file descriptor.\tA regular file\n\t      is likely to be unusable; a FIFO (pipe) of some sort will work\n\t      better, but note that it is not a good idea for two different\n\t      sessions to attempt to read from the same FIFO at once.\n\n\t      If the option -q is given with any of the three forms, tcp_open\n\t      will not print informational messages, although it will in any\n\t      case exit with an appropriate status.\n\n\t      If the line editor (zle) is in use, which is typically the case\n\t      if the shell is interactive, tcp_open installs a handler inside\n\t      zle which will check for new data at the same time as it checks\n\t      for keyboard input.  This is convenient as the shell consumes no\n\t      CPU time while waiting; the test is performed by the operating\n\t      system.  Giving the option -z to any of the forms of tcp_open\n\t      prevents the handler from being installed, so data must be read\n\t      explicitly.  Note, however, this is not necessary for executing\n\t      complete sets of send and read commands from a function, as zle\n\t      is not active at this point.  Generally speaking, the handler is\n\t      only active when the shell is waiting for input at a command\n\t      prompt or in the vared builtin.  The option has no effect if zle\n\t      is not active; `[[ -o zle]]' will test for this.\n\n\t      The first session to be opened becomes the current session and\n\t      subsequent calls to tcp_open do not change it.  The current\n\t      session is stored in the parameter $TCP_SESS; see below for more\n\t      detail about the parameters used by the system.\n\n\t      The function tcp_on_open, if defined, is called when a session\n\t      is opened.  See the description below.\n\n       tcp_close [ -qn ] [ -a | -l sess[,...] | sess ... ]\n\t      Close the named sessions, or the current session if none is\n\t      given, or all open sessions if -a is given.  The options -l and\n\t      -s are both handled for consistency with tcp_open, although the\n\t      latter is redundant.\n\n\t      If the session being closed is the current one, $TCP_SESS is\n\t      unset, leaving no current session, even if there are other\n\t      sessions still open.\n\n\t      If the session was opened with tcp_open -f, the file descriptor\n\t      is closed so long as it is in the range 0 to 9 accessible\n\t      directly from the command line.  If the option -n is given, no\n\t      attempt will be made to close file descriptors in this case.\n\t      The -n option is not used for genuine ztcp session; the file\n\t      descriptors are always closed with the session.\n\n\t      If the option -q is given, no informational messages will be\n\t      printed."

In\n\t      this mode, tcp_read can be called repeatedly until it returns\n\t      status 2 which indicates all pending input from all specified\n\t      sessions has been handled.\n\n\t      With the option -b, equivalent to an infinite timeout, the\n\t      function will block until a line is available to read from one\n\t      of the specified sessions.  However, only a single line is\n\t      returned.\n\n\t      The option -d indicates that all pending input should be\n\t      drained.\tIn this case tcp_read may process multiple lines in\n\t      the manner given above; only the last is stored in $TCP_LINE,\n\t      but the complete set is stored in the array $tcp_lines.  This is\n\t      cleared at the start of each call to tcp_read.\n\n\t      The options -t and -T specify a timeout in seconds, which may be\n\t      a floating point number for increased accuracy.  With -t the\n\t      timeout is applied before each line read.  With -T, the timeout\n\t      applies to the overall operation, possibly including multiple\n\t      read operations if the option -d is present; without this\n\t      option, there is no distinction between -t and -T.\n\n\t      The function does not print informational messages, but if the\n\t      option -q is given, no error message is printed for a\n\t      non-existent session.\n\n\t      A return status of 2 indicates a timeout or no data to read.\n\t      Any other non-zero return status indicates some error condition.\n\n\t      See tcp_log for how to control where data is sent by tcp_read.\n\n       tcp_send [ -cnq ] [ -s sess | -l sess[,...] ] data ...\n       tcp_send [ -cnq ] -a data ...\n\t      Send the supplied data strings to all the specified sessions in\n\t      turn.  The underlying operation differs little from a `print -r'\n\t      to the session's file descriptor, although it attempts to\n\t      prevent the shell from dying owing to a SIGPIPE caused by an\n\t      attempt to write to a defunct session.\n\n\t      The option -c causes tcp_send to behave like cat.  It reads\n\t      lines from standard input until end of input and sends them in\n\t      turn to the specified session(s) exactly as if they were given\n\t      as data arguments to individual tcp_send commands.\n\n\t      The option -n prevents tcp_send from putting a newline at the\n\t      end of the data strings.\n\n\t      The remaining options all behave as for tcp_read.\n\n\t      The data arguments are not further processed once they have been\n\t      passed to tcp_send; they are simply passed down to print -r.\n\n\t      If the parameter $TCP_OUTPUT is a non-empty string and logging\n\t      is enabled then the data sent to each session will be echoed to\n\t      the log file(s) with $TCP_OUTPUT in front where appropriate,\n\t      much in the manner of $TCP_PROMPT.\n\n   Session Management\n       tcp_alias [ -q ] alias=sess ...\n       tcp_alias [ -q ] [ alias ... ]\n       tcp_alias -d [ -q ] alias ...\n\t      This function is not particularly well tested.\n\n\t      The first form creates an alias for a session name; alias can\n\t      then be used to refer to the existing session sess.  As many\n\t      aliases may be listed as required.\n\n\t      The second form lists any aliases specified, or all aliases if\n\t      none.\n\n\t      The third form deletes all the aliases listed.  The underlying\n\t      sessions are not affected.\n\n\t      The option -q suppresses an inconsistently chosen subset of\n\t      error messages.\n\n       tcp_log [ -asc ] [ -n | -N ] [ logfile ]\n\t      With an argument logfile, all future input from tcp_read will be\n\t      logged to the named file.  Unless -a (append) is given, this\n\t      file will first be truncated or created empty.  With no\n\t      arguments, show the current status of logging.\n\n\t      With the option -s, per-session logging is enabled.  Input from\n\t      tcp_read is output to the file logfile.sess.  As the session is\n\t      automatically discriminated by the filename, the contents are\n\t      raw (no $TCP_PROMPT).  The option  -a applies as above.\n\t      Per-session logging and logging of all data in one file are not\n\t      mutually exclusive.\n\n\t      The option -c closes all logging, both complete and per-session\n\t      logs.\n\n\t      The options -n and -N respectively turn off or restore output of\n\t      data read by tcp_read to standard output; hence `tcp_log -cn'\n\t      turns off all output by tcp_read.\n\n\t      The function is purely a convenient front end to setting the\n\t      parameters $TCP_LOG, $TCP_LOG_SESS, $TCP_SILENT, which are\n\t      described below.\n\n       tcp_rename old new\n\t      Rename session old to session new.

The current session is marked with a star.\n\t      For use in functions, direct access to the parameters\n\t      $tcp_by_name, $tcp_by_fd and $TCP_SESS is probably more\n\t      convenient; see below.\n\n\t      With a sess argument, set the current session to sess.  This is\n\t      equivalent to changing $TCP_SESS directly.\n\n\t      With additional arguments, temporarily set the current session\n\t      while executing `command arg ...'.  command is re-evaluated so\n\t      as to expand aliases etc., but the remaining args are passed\n\t      through as that appear to tcp_sess.  The original session is\n\t      restored when tcp_sess exits.\n\n   Advanced I/O\n       tcp_command send-option ... send-argument ...\n\t      This is a convenient front-end to tcp_send.  All arguments are\n\t      passed to tcp_send, then the function pauses waiting for data.\n\t      While data is arriving at least every $TCP_TIMEOUT (default 0.3)\n\t      seconds, data is handled and printed out according to the\n\t      current settings.  Status 0 is always returned.\n\n\t      This is generally only useful for interactive use, to prevent\n\t      the display becoming fragmented by output returned from the\n\t      connection.  Within a programme or function it is generally\n\t      better to handle reading data by a more explicit method."

    NAME
           zshzftpsys - zftp function front-end

    DESCRIPTION
           This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source
           distribution as an interface to the zftp builtin command, allowing you
           to perform FTP operations from the shell command line or within
           functions or scripts.  The interface is similar to a traditional FTP
           client (e.g. the ftp command itself, see ftp(1)), but as it is entirely
           done within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing
           features, and so on, are present, and macros are particularly simple to
           write as they are just ordinary shell functions.

           The prerequisite is that the zftp command, as described in
           zshmodules(1) , must be available in the version of zsh installed at
           your site.  If the shell is configured to load new commands at run
           time, it probably is: typing `zmodload zsh/zftp' will make sure (if
           that runs silently, it has worked).  If this is not the case, it is
           possible zftp was linked into the shell anyway: to test this, type
           `which zftp' and if zftp is available you will get the message `zftp:
           shell built-in command'.

    Remote globbing
           The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename generation
           (globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing the
           option -G to each of the commands.  Normally this operates by
           retrieving a complete list of files for the directory in question, then
           matching these locally against the pattern supplied.  This has the
           advantage that the full range of zsh patterns (respecting the setting
           of the option EXTENDED_GLOB) can be used.  However, it means that the
           directory part of a filename will not be expanded and must be given
           exactly.  If the remote server does not support the UNIX directory
           semantics, directory handling is problematic and it is recommended that
           globbing only be used within the current directory.  The list of files
           in the current directory, if retrieved, will be cached, so that
           subsequent globs in the same directory without an intervening zfcd are
           much faster.

This may in some cases be faster, as it avoids\n       retrieving the entire list of directory contents.\n\n   Automatic and temporary reopening\n       As described for the zfopen command, a subsequent zfopen with no\n       parameters will reopen the connection to the last host (this includes\n       connections made with the zfanon command).  Opened in this fashion, the\n       connection starts in the default remote directory and will remain open\n       until explicitly closed.\n\n       Automatic re-opening is also available.\tIf a connection is not\n       currently open and a command requiring a connection is given, the last\n       connection is implicitly reopened.  In this case the directory which\n       was current when the connection was closed again becomes the current\n       directory (unless, of course, the command given changes it).  Automatic\n       reopening will also take place if the connection was close by the\n       remote server for whatever reason (e.g. a timeout).

    REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES
           The function cdr allows you to change the working directory to a
           previous working directory from a list maintained automatically.  It is
           similar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the pushd, popd
           and dirs builtins, but is more configurable, and as it stores all
           entries in files it is maintained across sessions and (by default)
           between terminal emulators in the current session.  Duplicates are
           automatically removed, so that the list reflects the single most recent
           use of each directory.

           Note that the pushd directory stack is not actually modified or used by
           cdr unless you configure it to do so as described in the configuration
           section below.

       Installation
           The system works by means of a hook function that is called every time
           the directory changes.  To install the system, autoload the required
           functions and use the add-zsh-hook function described above:

The\n       context for the style is :zdn:wrapper-name where wrapper-name is the\n       function calling zsh_directory_name_generic; for example:\n\n\t      zstyle :zdn:zdn_mywrapper: mapping zdn_mywrapper_top\n\n       The keys in this associative array correspond to the first component of\n       the name.  The values are matching directories.\tThey may have an\n       optional suffix with a slash followed by a colon and the name of a\n       variable in the same format to give the next component.\t(The slash\n       before the colon is to disambiguate the case where a colon is needed in\n       the path for a drive.  There is otherwise no syntax for escaping this,\n       so path components whose names start with a colon are not supported.)\n       A special component :default: specifies a variable in the form /:var\n       (the path section is ignored and so is usually empty) that will be used\n       for the next component if no variable is given for the path.  Variables\n       referred to within zdn_top have the same format as zdn_top itself, but\n       contain relative paths."

    When one of the gen-applied-string, gen-unapplied-string, and
           set-patch-format hooks is defined, applying %-escaping
           (`foo=${foo//'%'/%%}') to the interpolated values for use in the prompt
           is the responsibility of those hooks (jointly); when neither of those
           hooks is defined, vcs_info handles escaping by itself.  We regret this
           coupling, but it was required for backwards compatibility.

       Quilt Support
           Quilt is not a version control system, therefore this is not
           implemented as a backend. It can help keeping track of a series of
           patches. People use it to keep a set of changes they want to use on top
           of software packages (which is tightly integrated into the package
           build process - the Debian project does this for a large number of
           packages). Quilt can also help individual developers keep track of
           their own patches on top of real version control systems.

           The vcs_info integration tries to support both ways of using quilt by
           having two slightly different modes of operation: `addon' mode and
           `standalone' mode).

    Manpage text:

    When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active.
           To gather more information, vcs_info looks for a directory called
           `.pc'; Quilt uses that directory to track its current state. If this
           directory does not exist we know that quilt has not done anything to
           the working directory (read: no patches have been applied yet).

           If patches are applied, vcs_info will try to find out which. If you
           want to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to
           activate the get-unapplied style in the appropriate context.

           vcs_info allows for very detailed control over how the gathered
           information is presented (see the Configuration and Hooks in vcs_info
           sections), all of which are documented below. Note there are a number
           of other patch tracking systems that work on top of a certain version
           control system (like stgit for git, or mq for hg); the configuration
           for systems like that are generally configured the same way as the
           quilt support.

    Manpage text:

    If the quilt support is working in `addon' mode, the produced string is
           available as a simple format replacement (%Q to be precise), which can
           be used in formats and actionformats; see below for details).

           If, on the other hand, the support code is working in `standalone'
           mode, vcs_info will pretend as if quilt were an actual version control
           system. That means that the version control system identifier (which
           otherwise would be something like `svn' or `cvs') will be set to
           `-quilt-'. This has implications on the used style context where this
           identifier is the second element. vcs_info will have filled in a proper
           value for the "repository's" root directory and the string containing
           the information about quilt's state will be available as the `misc'
           replacement (and %Q for compatibility with `addon' mode).

           What is left to discuss is how `standalone' mode is detected. The
           detection itself is a series of searches for directories. You can have
           this detection enabled all the time in every directory that is not
           otherwise under version control. If you know there is only a limited
           set of trees where you would like vcs_info to try and look for Quilt in
           `standalone' mode to minimise the amount of searching on every call to
           vcs_info, there are a number of ways to do that:

    Manpage text:

    Essentially, `standalone' mode detection is controlled by a style
           called `quilt-standalone'. It is a string style and its value can have
           different effects. The simplest values are: `always' to run detection
           every time vcs_info is run, and `never' to turn the detection off
           entirely.

           If the value of quilt-standalone is something else, it is interpreted
           differently. If the value is the name of a scalar variable the value of
           that variable is checked and that value is used in the same
           `always'/`never' way as described above.

           If the value of quilt-standalone is an array, the elements of that
           array are used as directory names under which you want the detection to
           be active.

           If quilt-standalone is an associative array, the keys are taken as
           directory names under which you want the detection to be active, but
           only if the corresponding value is the string `true'.

           Last, but not least, if the value of quilt-standalone is the name of a
           function, the function is called without arguments and the return value
           decides whether detection should be active. A `0' return value is true;
           a non-zero return value is interpreted as false.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe word-context style is implemented by the function\n\t      match-word-context.  This should not usually need to be called\n\t      directly.\n\n       bracketed-paste-magic\n\t      The bracketed-paste widget (see the subsection `Miscellaneous'\n\t      in zshzle(1)) inserts pasted text literally into the editor\n\t      buffer rather than interpret it as keystrokes.  This disables\n\t      some common usages where the self-insert widget is replaced in\n\t      order to accomplish some extra processing.  An example is the\n\t      contributed url-quote-magic widget described below.\n\n\t      The bracketed-paste-magic widget is meant to replace\n\t      bracketed-paste with a wrapper that re-enables these self-insert\n\t      actions, and other actions as selected by zstyles.  Therefore\n\t      this widget is installed with\n\n\t\t     autoload -Uz bracketed-paste-magic\n\t\t     zle -N bracketed-paste bracketed-paste-magic\n\n\t      Other than enabling some widget processing,\n\t      bracketed-paste-magic attempts to replicate bracketed-paste as\n\t      faithfully as possible.\n\n\t      The following zstyles may be set to control processing of pasted\n\t      text.  All are looked up in the context\n\t      `:bracketed-paste-magic'.\n\n\t      active-widgets\n\t\t     A list of patterns matching widget names that should be\n\t\t     activated during the paste.  All other key sequences are\n\t\t     processed as self-insert-unmeta.  The default is `self-*'\n\t\t     so any user-defined widgets named with that prefix are\n\t\t     active along with the builtin self-insert.\n\n\t\t     If this style is not set (explicitly deleted) or set to\n\t\t     an empty value, no widgets are active and the pasted text\n\t\t     is inserted literally.  If the value includes\n\t\t     `undefined-key', any unknown sequences are discarded from\n\t\t     the pasted text.\n\n\t      inactive-keys\n\t\t     The inverse of active-widgets, a list of key sequences\n\t\t     that always use self-insert-unmeta even when bound to an\n\t\t     active widget.  Note that this is a list of literal key\n\t\t     sequences, not patterns.\n\n\t      paste-init\n\t\t     A list of function names, called in widget context (but\n\t\t     not as widgets).  The functions are called in order until\n\t\t     one of them returns a non-zero status.  The parameter\n\t\t     `PASTED' contains the initial state of the pasted text.\n\t\t     All other ZLE parameters such as `BUFFER' have their\n\t\t     normal values and side-effects, and full history is\n\t\t     available, so for example paste-init functions may move\n\t\t     words from BUFFER into PASTED to make those words visible\n\t\t     to the active-widgets.\n\n\t\t     A non-zero return from a paste-init function does not\n\t\t     prevent the paste itself from proceeding.\n\n\t\t     Loading bracketed-paste-magic defines\n\t\t     backward-extend-paste, a helper function for use in\n\t\t     paste-init.\n\n\t\t\t    zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-init \\\n\t\t\t\t   backward-extend-paste\n\n\t\t     When a paste would insert into the middle of a word or\n\t\t     append text to a word already on the line,\n\t\t     backward-extend-paste moves the prefix from LBUFFER into\n\t\t     PASTED so that the active-widgets see the full word so\n\t\t     far.  This may be useful with url-quote-magic.\n\n\t      paste-finish\n\t\t     Another list of function names called in order until one\n\t\t     returns non-zero.\tThese functions are called after the\n\t\t     pasted text has been processed by the active-widgets, but\n\t\t     before it is inserted into `BUFFER'.  ZLE parameters have\n\t\t     their normal values and side-effects.\n\n\t\t     A non-zero return from a paste-finish function does not\n\t\t     prevent the paste itself from proceeding.\n\n\t\t     Loading bracketed-paste-magic also defines quote-paste, a\n\t\t     helper function for use in paste-finish.\n\n\t\t\t    zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-finish \\\n\t\t\t\t   quote-paste\n\t\t\t    zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic:finish quote-style \\\n\t\t\t\t   qqq\n\n\t\t     When the pasted text is inserted into BUFFER, it is\n\t\t     quoted per the quote-style value.\tTo forcibly turn off\n\t\t     the built-in numeric prefix quoting of bracketed-paste,\n\t\t     use:\n\n\t\t\t    zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic:finish quote-style \\\n\t\t\t\t   none\n\n\t      Important: During active-widgets processing of the paste (after\n\t      paste-init and before paste-finish), BUFFER starts empty and\n\t      history is restricted, so cursor motions, etc., may not pass\n\t      outside of the pasted content.  Text assigned to BUFFER by the\n\t      active widgets is copied back into PASTED before paste-finish.\n\n       copy-earlier-word\n\t      This widget works like a combination of insert-last-word and\n\t      copy-prev-shell-word.  Repeated invocations of the widget\n\t      retrieve earlier words on the relevant history line.  With a\n\t      numeric argument N, insert the Nth word from the history line; N\n\t      may be negative to count from the end of the line.\n\n\t      If insert-last-word has been used to retrieve the last word on a\n\t      previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that\n\t      word with earlier words from the same line.\n\n\t      Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently\n\t      being edited.  The widget style can be set to the name of\n\t      another widget that should be called to retrieve words.  This\n\t      widget must accept the same three arguments as insert-last-word.\n\n       cycle-completion-positions\n\t      After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the\n\t      new function based completion system may know about multiple\n\t      places in this string where characters are missing or differ\n\t      from at least one of the possible matches.  It will then place\n\t      the cursor on the position it considers to be the most\n\t      interesting one, i.e. the one where one can disambiguate between\n\t      as many matches as possible with as little typing as possible.\n\n\t      This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other\n\t      interesting spots.  It can be invoked repeatedly to cycle\n\t      between all positions reported by the completion system.\n\n       delete-whole-word-match\n\t      This is another function which works like the -match functions\n\t      described immediately above, i.e. using styles to decide the\n\t      word boundaries.\tHowever, it is not a replacement for any\n\t      existing function.\n\n\t      The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor.\n\t      There is no numeric argument handling; only the single word\n\t      around the cursor is considered.\tIf the widget contains the\n\t      string kill, the removed text will be placed in the cutbuffer\n\t      for future yanking.  This can be obtained by defining\n\t      kill-whole-word-match as follows:\n\n\t\t     zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match\n\n\t      and then binding the widget kill-whole-word-match.\n\n       up-line-or-beginning-search, down-line-or-beginning-search\n\t      These widgets are similar to the builtin functions\n\t      up-line-or-search and down-line-or-search:  if in a multiline\n\t      buffer they move up or down within the buffer, otherwise they\n\t      search for a history line matching the start of the current\n\t      line.  In this case, however, they search for a line which\n\t      matches the current line up to the current cursor position, in\n\t      the manner of history-beginning-search-backward and -forward,\n\t      rather than the first word on the line.\n\n       edit-command-line\n\t      Edit the command line using your visual editor, as in ksh.\n\n\t\t     bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line\n\n\t      The editor to be used can also be specified using the editor\n\t      style in the context of the widget. It is specified as an array\n\t      of command and arguments:\n\n\t\t     zstyle :zle:edit-command-line editor gvim -f\n\n       expand-absolute-path\n\t      Expand the file name under the cursor to an absolute path,\n\t      resolving symbolic links.  Where possible, the initial path\n\t      segment is turned into a named directory or reference to a\n\t      user's home directory.\n\n       history-search-end\n\t      This function implements the widgets\n\t      history-beginning-search-backward-end and\n\t      history-beginning-search-forward-end.  These commands work by\n\t      first calling the corresponding builtin widget (see `History\n\t      Control' in zshzle(1)) and then moving the cursor to the end of\n\t      the line.  The original cursor position is remembered and\n\t      restored before calling the builtin widget a second time, so\n\t      that the same search is repeated to look farther through the\n\t      history.\n\n\t      Although you autoload only one function, the commands to use it\n\t      are slightly different because it implements two widgets.\n\n\t\t     zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end \\\n\t\t\t    history-search-end\n\t\t     zle -N history-beginning-search-forward-end \\\n\t\t\t    history-search-end\n\t\t     bindkey '\\e^P' history-beginning-search-backward-end\n\t\t     bindkey '\\e^N' history-beginning-search-forward-end\n\n       history-beginning-search-menu\n\t      This function implements yet another form of history searching.\n\t      The text before the cursor is used to select lines from the\n\t      history, as for history-beginning-search-backward except that\n\t      all matches are shown in a numbered menu.  Typing the\n\t      appropriate digits inserts the full history line.  Note that\n\t      leading zeroes must be typed (they are only shown when necessary\n\t      for removing ambiguity).\tThe entire history is searched; there\n\t      is no distinction between forwards and backwards.\n\n\t      With a numeric argument, the search is not anchored to the start\n\t      of the line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere in\n\t      the line in the history.\n\n\t      If the widget name contains `-end' the cursor is moved to the\n\t      end of the line inserted.  If the widget name contains `-space'\n\t      any space in the text typed is treated as a wildcard and can\n\t      match anything (hence a leading space is equivalent to giving a\n\t      numeric argument).  Both forms can be combined, for example:\n\n\t\t     zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end \\\n\t\t\t    history-beginning-search-menu\n\n       history-pattern-search\n\t      The function history-pattern-search implements widgets which\n\t      prompt for a pattern with which to search the history backwards\n\t      or forwards.  The pattern is in the usual zsh format, however\n\t      the first character may be ^ to anchor the search to the start\n\t      of the line, and the last character may be $ to anchor the\n\t      search to the end of the line.  If the search was not anchored\n\t      to the end of the line the cursor is positioned just after the\n\t      pattern found.\n\n\t      The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to those in\n\t      the example immediately above:\n\n\t\t     autoload -U history-pattern-search\n\t\t     zle -N history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search\n\t\t     zle -N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search\n\n       incarg Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor placed on\n\t      or to the left of an integer causes that integer to be\n\t      incremented by one.  With a numeric argument, the number is\n\t      incremented by the amount of the argument (decremented if the\n\t      numeric argument is negative).  The shell parameter incarg may\n\t      be set to change the default increment to something other than\n\t      one.\n\n\t\t     bindkey '^X+' incarg\n\n       incremental-complete-word\n\t      This allows incremental completion of a word.  After starting\n\t      this command, a list of completion choices can be shown after\n\t      every character you type, which you can delete with ^H or DEL.\n\t      Pressing return accepts the completion so far and returns you to\n\t      normal editing (that is, the command line is not immediately\n\t      executed).  You can hit TAB to do normal completion, ^G to abort\n\t      back to the state when you started, and ^D to list the matches.\n\n\t      This works only with the new function based completion system.\n\n\t\t     bindkey '^Xi' incremental-complete-word\n\n       insert-composed-char\n\t      This function allows you to compose characters that don't appear\n\t      on the keyboard to be inserted into the command line.  The\n\t      command is followed by two keys corresponding to ASCII\n\t      characters (there is no prompt).\tFor accented characters, the\n\t      two keys are a base character followed by a code for the accent,\n\t      while for other special characters the two characters together\n\t      form a mnemonic for the character to be inserted.  The\n\t      two-character codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see\n\t      for example http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html).\n\n\t      The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters\n\t      which replace one or both of the characters read from the\n\t      keyboard; if both characters are supplied, no input is read.\n\t      For example, insert-composed-char a: can be used within a widget\n\t      to insert an a with umlaut into the command line.  This has the\n\t      advantages over use of a literal character that it is more\n\t      portable.\n\n\t      For best results zsh should have been built with support for\n\t      multibyte characters (configured with --enable-multibyte);\n\t      however, the function works for the limited range of characters\n\t      available in single-byte character sets such as ISO-8859-1.\n\n\t      The character is converted into the local representation and\n\t      inserted into the command line at the cursor position.  (The\n\t      conversion is done within the shell, using whatever facilities\n\t      the C library provides.)\tWith a numeric argument, the character\n\t      and its code are previewed in the status line\n\n\t      The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints the\n\t      character (together with a newline) to standard output.  Input\n\t      is still read from keystrokes.\n\n\t      See insert-unicode-char for an alternative way of inserting\n\t      Unicode characters using their hexadecimal character number.\n\n\t      The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up to\n\t      Unicode character U+0180, the set of special characters less so.\n\t      However, it is very sporadic from that point.  Adding new\n\t      characters is easy, however; see the function\n\t      define-composed-chars.  Please send any additions to\n\t      zsh-workers@zsh.org.\n\n\t      The codes for the second character when used to accent the first\n\t      are as follows.

An exception is for the most part treated the same\n\t      as a shell error, i.e. an unhandled exception will cause the\n\t      shell to abort all processing in a function or script and to\n\t      return to the top level in an interactive shell.\n\n       catch exception-pattern\n\t      The function catch returns status zero if an exception was\n\t      thrown and the pattern exception-pattern matches its name.\n\t      Otherwise it returns status 1.  exception-pattern is a standard\n\t      shell pattern, respecting the current setting of the\n\t      EXTENDED_GLOB option.  An alias catch is also defined to prevent\n\t      the argument to the function from matching filenames, so\n\t      patterns may be used unquoted.  Note that as exceptions are not\n\t      fundamentally different from other shell errors it is possible\n\t      to catch shell errors by using an empty string as the exception\n\t      name.  The shell variable CAUGHT is set by catch to the name of\n\t      the exception caught.  It is possible to rethrow an exception by\n\t      calling the throw function again once an exception has been\n\t      caught."

The function sum takes zero or more arguments.\n\t      Arguments can be of different types (ints and floats).\n\n\t      Not to be confused with the zsh/mathfunc module, described in\n\t      the section `The zsh/mathfunc Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       zmathfuncdef [ mathfunc [ body ] ]\n\t      A convenient front end to functions -M.\n\n\t      With two arguments, define a mathematical function named\n\t      mathfunc which can be used in any form of arithmetic evaluation.\n\t      body is a mathematical expression to implement the function.

Note that the forms must be strictly\n\t      adhered to for the function to calculate the correct number of\n\t      arguments.  The implementation is held in a shell function named\n\t      zsh_math_func_mathfunc; usually the user will not need to refer\n\t      to the shell function directly.  Any existing function of the\n\t      same name is silently replaced.\n\n\t      With one argument, remove the mathematical function mathfunc as\n\t      well as the shell function implementation.\n\n\t      With no arguments, list all mathfunc functions in a form\n\t      suitable for restoring the definition.  The functions have not\n\t      necessarily been defined by zmathfuncdef.\n\nUSER CONFIGURATION FUNCTIONS\n       The zsh/newuser module comes with a function to aid in configuring\n       shell options for new users.  If the module is installed, this function\n       can also be run by hand.  It is available even if the module's default\n       behaviour, namely running the function for a new user logging in\n       without startup files, is inhibited.\n\n       zsh-newuser-install [ -f ]\n\t      The function presents the user with various options for\n\t      customizing their initialization scripts.  Currently only\n\t      ~/.zshrc is handled.  $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc is used instead if the\n\t      parameter ZDOTDIR is set; this provides a way for the user to\n\t      configure a file without altering an existing .zshrc.\n\n\t      By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the\n\t      files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, or .zlogin in the appropriate\n\t      directory.  The option -f is required in order to force the\n\t      function to continue.  Note this may happen even if .zshrc\n\t      itself does not exist.\n\n\t      As currently configured, the function will exit immediately if\n\t      the user has root privileges; this behaviour cannot be\n\t      overridden.\n\n\t      Once activated, the function's behaviour is supposed to be\n\t      self-explanatory.  Menus are present allowing the user to alter\n\t      the value of options and parameters.  Suggestions for\n\t      improvements are always welcome.\n\n\t      When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save\n\t      the new file or not; changes are not irreversible until this\n\t      point.  However, the script is careful to restrict changes to\n\t      the file only to a group marked by the lines `# Lines configured\n\t      by zsh-newuser-install' and `# End of lines configured by\n\t      zsh-newuser-install'.  In addition, the old version of .zshrc is\n\t      saved to a file with the suffix .zni appended.\n\n\t      If the function edits an existing .zshrc, it is up to the user\n\t      to ensure that the changes made will take effect.  For example,\n\t      if control usually returns early from the existing .zshrc the\n\t      lines will not be executed; or a later initialization file may\n\t      override options or parameters, and so on.  The function itself\n\t      does not attempt to detect any such conflicts.\n\nOTHER FUNCTIONS\n       There are a large number of helpful functions in the Functions/Misc\n       directory of the zsh distribution.  Most are very simple and do not\n       require documentation here, but a few are worthy of special mention.\n\n   Descriptions\n       colors This function initializes several associative arrays to map\n\t      color names to (and from) the ANSI standard eight-color terminal\n\t      codes.  These are used by the prompt theme system (see above).\n\t      You seldom should need to run colors more than once.\n\n\t      The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue,\n\t      magenta, cyan, and white.  Each of these has codes for\n\t      foreground and background.  In addition there are seven\n\t      intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout, underline, blink,\n\t      reverse, and conceal.  Finally, there are seven codes used to\n\t      negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the defaults),\n\t      normal (neither bold nor faint), no-standout, no-underline,\n\t      no-blink, no-reverse, and no-conceal.\n\n\t      Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors and\n\t      intensities.\n\n\t      The associative arrays are:\n\n\t      color\n\t      colour Map all the color names to their integer codes, and\n\t\t     integer codes to the color names.\tThe eight base names\n\t\t     map to the foreground color codes, as do names prefixed\n\t\t     with `fg-', such as `fg-red'.  Names prefixed with `bg-',\n\t\t     such as `bg-blue', refer to the background codes.\tThe\n\t\t     reverse mapping from code to color yields base name for\n\t\t     foreground codes and the bg- form for backgrounds.\n\n\t\t     Although it is a misnomer to call them `colors', these\n\t\t     arrays also map the other fourteen attributes from names\n\t\t     to codes and codes to names.\n\n\t      fg\n\t      fg_bold\n\t      fg_no_bold\n\t\t     Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape\n\t\t     sequences that set the corresponding foreground text\n\t\t     properties.  The fg sequences change the color without\n\t\t     changing the eight intensity attributes.\n\n\t      bg\n\t      bg_bold\n\t      bg_no_bold\n\t\t     Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape\n\t\t     sequences that set the corresponding background\n\t\t     properties.  The bg sequences change the color without\n\t\t     changing the eight intensity attributes.\n\n\t      In addition, the scalar parameters reset_color and bold_color\n\t      are set to the ANSI terminal escapes that turn off all\n\t      attributes and turn on bold intensity, respectively.\n\n       fned [ -x num ] name\n\t      Same as zed -f.

If\n\t      the present string is not provided, $ZSH_VERSION is used.\n\t      Segments are paired left-to-right in the two strings with\n\t      leading non-number parts ignored.  If one string has fewer\n\t      segments than the other, the missing segments are considered\n\t      zero.\n\n\t      This is useful in startup files to set options and other state\n\t      that are not available in all versions of zsh.\n\n\t\t     is-at-least 3.1.6-15 && setopt NO_GLOBAL_RCS\n\t\t     is-at-least 3.1.0 && setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS\n\t\t     is-at-least 2.6-17 || print \"You can't use is-at-least here.\"\n\n       nslookup [ arg ... ]\n\t      This wrapper function for the nslookup command requires the\n\t      zsh/zpty module (see zshmodules(1)).  It behaves exactly like\n\t      the standard nslookup except that it provides customizable\n\t      prompts (including a right-side prompt) and completion of\n\t      nslookup commands, host names, etc. (if you use the\n\t      function-based completion system).  Completion styles may be set\n\t      with the context prefix `:completion:nslookup'.\n\n\t      See also the pager, prompt and rprompt styles below.\n\n       regexp-replace var regexp replace\n\t      Use regular expressions to perform a global search and replace\n\t      operation on a variable.\tPOSIX extended regular expressions\n\t      (ERE) are used, unless the option RE_MATCH_PCRE has been set, in\n\t      which case Perl-compatible regular expressions are used (this\n\t      requires the shell to be linked against the pcre library).\n\n\t      var is the name of the variable containing the string to be\n\t      matched.\tThe variable will be modified directly by the\n\t      function.  The variables MATCH, MBEGIN, MEND, match, mbegin,\n\t      mend should be avoided as these are used by the regular\n\t      expression code.\n\n\t      regexp is the regular expression to match against the string.\n\n\t      replace is the replacement text.\tThis can contain parameter,\n\t      command and arithmetic expressions which will be replaced:  in\n\t      particular, a reference to $MATCH will be replaced by the text\n\t      matched by the pattern.\n\n\t      The return status is 0 if at least one match was performed, else\n\t      1.\n\n\t      Note that if using POSIX EREs, the ^ or word boundary operators\n\t      (where available) may not work properly.\n\n       run-help cmd\n\t      This function is designed to be invoked by the run-help ZLE\n\t      widget, in place of the default alias.  See `Accessing On-Line\n\t      Help' above for setup instructions.\n\n\t      In the discussion which follows, if cmd is a file system path,\n\t      it is first reduced to its rightmost component (the file name).\n\n\t      Help is first sought by looking for a file named cmd in the\n\t      directory named by the HELPDIR parameter.  If no file is found,\n\t      an assistant function, alias, or command named run-help-cmd is\n\t      sought.  If found, the assistant is executed with the rest of\n\t      the current command line (everything after the command name cmd)\n\t      as its arguments.  When neither file nor assistant is found, the\n\t      external command `man cmd' is run.\n\n\t      An example assistant for the \"ssh\" command:\n\n\t\t     run-help-ssh() {\n\t\t\t emulate -LR zsh\n\t\t\t local -a args\n\t\t\t # Delete the \"-l username\" option\n\t\t\t zparseopts -D -E -a args l:\n\t\t\t # Delete other options, leaving: host command\n\t\t\t args=(${@:#-*})\n\t\t\t if [[ ${#args} -lt 2 ]]; then\n\t\t\t     man ssh\n\t\t\t else\n\t\t\t     run-help $args[2]\n\t\t\t fi\n\t\t     }\n\n\t      Several of these assistants are provided in the Functions/Misc\n\t      directory.  These must be autoloaded, or placed as executable\n\t      scripts in your search path, in order to be found and used by\n\t      run-help.\n\n\t      run-help-btrfs\n\t      run-help-git\n\t      run-help-ip\n\t      run-help-openssl\n\t      run-help-p4\n\t      run-help-sudo\n\t      run-help-svk\n\t      run-help-svn\n\t\t     Assistant functions for the btrfs, git, ip, openssl, p4,\n\t\t     sudo, svk, and svn, commands.\n\n       tetris Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as Emacs, because\n\t      it lacked a Tetris game.\tThis function was written to refute\n\t      this vicious slander.\n\n\t      This function must be used as a ZLE widget:\n\n\t\t     autoload -U tetris\n\t\t     zle -N tetris\n\t\t     bindkey keys tetris\n\n\t      To start a game, execute the widget by typing the keys.\n\t      Whatever command line you were editing disappears temporarily,\n\t      and your keymap is also temporarily replaced by the Tetris\n\t      control keys.  The previous editor state is restored when you\n\t      quit the game (by pressing `q') or when you lose.\n\n\t      If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation of the\n\t      tetris widget will continue where you left off.  If you lost, it\n\t      will start a new game.\n\n       tetriscurses\n\t      This is a port of the above to zcurses.  The input handling is\n\t      improved a bit so that moving a block sideways doesn't\n\t      automatically advance a timestep, and the graphics use unicode\n\t      block graphics.\n\n\t      This version does not save the game state between invocations,\n\t      and is not invoked as a widget, but rather as:\n\n\t\t     autoload -U tetriscurses\n\t\t     tetriscurses\n\n       zargs [ option ... -- ] [ input ... ] [ -- command [ arg ... ] ]\n\t      This function has a similar purpose to GNU xargs.  Instead of\n\t      reading lines of arguments from the standard input, it takes\n\t      them from the command line.  This is useful because zsh,\n\t      especially with recursive glob operators, often can construct a\n\t      command line for a shell function that is longer than can be\n\t      accepted by an external command.\n\n\t      The option list represents options of the zargs command itself,\n\t      which are the same as those of xargs.  The input list is the\n\t      collection of strings (often file names) that become the\n\t      arguments of the command, analogous to the standard input of\n\t      xargs.  Finally, the arg list consists of those arguments\n\t      (usually options) that are passed to the command each time it\n\t      runs.  The arg list precedes the elements from the input list in\n\t      each run.  If no command is provided, then no arg list may be\n\t      provided, and in that event the default command is `print' with\n\t      arguments `-r --'.\n\n\t      For example, to get a long ls listing of all non-hidden plain\n\t      files in the current directory or its subdirectories:\n\n\t\t     autoload -U zargs\n\t\t     zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -ld --\n\n\t      The first and third occurrences of `--' are used to mark the end\n\t      of options for zargs and ls respectively to guard against\n\t      filenames starting with `-', while the second is used to\n\t      separate the list of files from the command to run (`ls -ld\n\t      --').\n\n\t      The first `--' would also be needed if there was a chance the\n\t      list might be empty as in:\n\n\t\t     zargs -r -- ./*.back(#qN) -- rm -f\n\n\t      In the event that the string `--' is or may be an input, the -e\n\t      option may be used to change the end-of-inputs marker.  Note\n\t      that this does not change the end-of-options marker.  For\n\t      example, to use `..' as the marker:\n\n\t\t     zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -ld --\n\n\t      This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can\n\t      be named `..', but the best end-marker depends on the\n\t      circumstances.\n\n\t      The options -i, -I, -l, -L, and -n differ slightly from their\n\t      usage in xargs.  There are no input lines for zargs to count, so\n\t      -l and -L count through the input list, and -n counts the number\n\t      of arguments passed to each execution of command, including any\n\t      arg list.  Also, any time -i or -I is used, each input is\n\t      processed separately as if by `-L 1'.\n\n\t      For details of the other zargs options, see the xargs(1) man\n\t      page (but note the difference in function between zargs and\n\t      xargs) or run zargs with the --help option.\n\n       zed [ -f [ -x num ] ] name\n       zed [ -h [ name ] size ]\n       zed -b This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function.\n\n\t      Only one name argument is allowed.  If the -f option is given,\n\t      the name is taken to be that of a function; if the function is\n\t      marked for autoloading, zed searches for it in the fpath and\n\t      loads it.  Note that functions edited this way are installed\n\t      into the current shell, but not written back to the autoload\n\t      file.  In this case the -x option specifies that leading tabs\n\t      indenting the function according to syntax should be converted\n\t      into the given number of spaces; `-x 2' is consistent with the\n\t      layout of functions distributed with the shell.\n\n\t      Without -f, name is the path name of the file to edit, which\n\t      need not exist; it is created on write, if necessary.  With -h,\n\t      the file is presumed to contain history events.\n\n\t      When no file name is provided for -h the current shell history\n\t      is edited in place.  The history is renumbered when zed exits\n\t      successfully.\n\n\t      When editing history, multi-line events must have a trailing\n\t      backslash on every line before the last.\n\n\t      While editing, the function sets the main keymap to zed and the\n\t      vi command keymap to zed-vicmd.  These will be copied from the\n\t      existing main and vicmd keymaps if they do not exist the first\n\t      time zed is run.\tThey can be used to provide special key\n\t      bindings used only in zed.\n\n\t      If it creates the keymap, zed rebinds the return key to insert a\n\t      line break and `^X^W' to accept the edit in the zed keymap, and\n\t      binds `ZZ' to accept the edit in the zed-vicmd keymap.\n\n\t      The bindings alone can be installed by running `zed -b'.\tThis\n\t      is suitable for putting into a startup file.  Note that, if\n\t      rerun, this will overwrite the existing zed and zed-vicmd\n\t      keymaps.\n\n\t      Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context\n\t      prefix `:completion:zed:'.\n\n\t      A zle widget zed-set-file-name is available.  This can be called\n\t      by name from within zed using `\\ex zed-set-file-name' or can be\n\t      bound to a key in either of the zed or zed-vicmd keymaps after\n\t      `zed -b' has been run.  When the widget is called, it prompts\n\t      for a new name for the file being edited.  When zed exits the\n\t      file will be written under that name and the original file will\n\t      be left alone.  The widget has no effect when invoked from `zed\n\t      -f'.  The completion context is changed to\n\t      `:completion:zed-set-file-name:'.  When editing the current\n\t      history with `zed -h', the history is first updated and then the\n\t      file is written, but the global setting of HISTFILE is not\n\t      altered.\n\n\t      While zed-set-file-name is running, zed uses the keymap\n\t      zed-normal-keymap, which is linked from the main keymap in\n\t      effect at the time zed initialised its bindings.\t(This is to\n\t      make the return key operate normally.)  The result is that if\n\t      the main keymap has been changed, the widget won't notice.  This\n\t      is not a concern for most users.\n\n       zcp [ -finqQvwW ] srcpat dest\n       zln [ -finqQsvwW ] srcpat dest\n\t      Same as zmv -C and zmv -L, respectively.\tThese functions do not\n\t      appear in the zsh distribution, but can be created by linking\n\t      zmv to the names zcp and zln in some directory in your fpath.\n\n       zkbd   See `Keyboard Definition' above."
