However, their Perl was either\n       built with one particular dbm library or another, but not both, and you\n       couldn't extend this mechanism to other packages or types of variables.\n\n       Now you can.\n\n       The tie() function binds a variable to a class (package) that will\n       provide the implementation for access methods for that variable.  Once\n       this magic has been performed, accessing a tied variable automatically\n       triggers method calls in the proper class.  The complexity of the class\n       is hidden behind magic methods calls.  The method names are in ALL\n       CAPS, which is a convention that Perl uses to indicate that they're\n       called implicitly rather than explicitly--just like the BEGIN() and\n       END() functions."

    In the tie() call, "VARIABLE" is the name of the variable to be
           enchanted.  "CLASSNAME" is the name of a class implementing objects of
           the correct type.  Any additional arguments in the "LIST" are passed to
           the appropriate constructor method for that class--meaning TIESCALAR(),
           TIEARRAY(), TIEHASH(), or TIEHANDLE().  (Typically these are arguments
           such as might be passed to the dbminit() function of C.) The object
           returned by the "new" method is also returned by the tie() function,
           which would be useful if you wanted to access other methods in
           "CLASSNAME". (You don't actually have to return a reference to a right
           "type" (e.g., HASH or "CLASSNAME") so long as it's a properly blessed
           object.)  You can also retrieve a reference to the underlying object
           using the tied() function.

           Unlike dbmopen(), the tie() function will not "use" or "require" a
           module for you--you need to do that explicitly yourself.

    That's about all there is to it.  Actually, it's more than all there is
           to it, because we've done a few nice things here for the sake of
           completeness, robustness, and general aesthetics.  Simpler TIESCALAR
           classes are certainly possible.

       Tying Arrays
           A class implementing a tied ordinary array should define the following
           methods: TIEARRAY, FETCH, STORE, FETCHSIZE, STORESIZE, CLEAR and
           perhaps UNTIE and/or DESTROY.

           FETCHSIZE and STORESIZE are used to provide $#array and equivalent
           "scalar(@array)" access.

           The methods POP, PUSH, SHIFT, UNSHIFT, SPLICE, DELETE, and EXISTS are
           required if the perl operator with the corresponding (but lowercase)
           name is to operate on the tied array. The Tie::Array class can be used
           as a base class to implement the first five of these in terms of the
           basic methods above.  The default implementations of DELETE and EXISTS
           in Tie::Array simply "croak".

           In addition EXTEND will be called when perl would have pre-extended
           allocation in a real array.
