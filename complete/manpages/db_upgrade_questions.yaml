    -s
           This flag is only meaningful when upgrading databases from releases
           before the Berkeley DB 3.1 release.

           As part of the upgrade from the Berkeley DB 3.0 release to the 3.1
           release, the on-disk format of duplicate data items changed. To
           correctly upgrade the format requires that applications specify whether
           duplicate data items in the database are sorted or not. Specifying the
           -s flag means that the duplicates are sorted; otherwise, they are
           assumed to be unsorted. Incorrectly specifying the value of this flag
           may lead to database corruption.

           Because the db_upgrade utility upgrades a physical file (including all
           the databases it contains), it is not possible to use db_upgrade to
           upgrade files where some of the databases it includes have sorted
           duplicate data items, and some of the databases it includes have
           unsorted duplicate data items. If the file does not have more than a
           single database, if the databases do not support duplicate data items,
           or if all the databases that support duplicate data items support the
           same style of duplicates (either sorted or unsorted), db_upgrade will
           work correctly as long as the -s flag is correctly specified.
           Otherwise, the file cannot be upgraded using db_upgrade, and must be
           upgraded manually using the db_dump and db_load utilities.

    Manpage text:

    -V
           Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

         It is important to realize that Berkeley DB database upgrades are done in
         place, and so are potentially destructive. This means that if the system
         crashes during the upgrade procedure, or if the upgrade procedure runs
         out of disk space, the databases may be left in an inconsistent and
         unrecoverable state. See Upgrading databases for more information.

         The db_upgrade utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
         described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
         the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
         In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
         environment, db_upgrade should always be given the chance to detach from
         the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_upgrade to release all
         environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
         (SIGINT).
