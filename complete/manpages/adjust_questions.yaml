The\n\t      string is taken as one big paragraph, ignoring any newlines.\n\t      Then the line is formatted according to the options used, and\n\t      the command returns a new string with enough lines to contain\n\t      all the printable chars in the input string. A line is a set of\n\t      characters between the beginning of the string and a newline, or\n\t      between 2 newlines, or between a newline and the end of the\n\t      string. If the input string is small enough, the returned string\n\t      won't contain any newlines."
