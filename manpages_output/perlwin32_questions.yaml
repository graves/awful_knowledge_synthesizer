    NAME
           perlwin32 - Perl under Windows

    SYNOPSIS
           These are instructions for building Perl under Windows 2000 and later.

    DESCRIPTION
           Before you start, you should glance through the README file found in
           the top-level directory to which the Perl distribution was extracted.
           Make sure you read and understand the terms under which this software
           is being distributed.

           Also make sure you read "BUGS AND CAVEATS" below for the known
           limitations of this port.

           The INSTALL file in the perl top-level has much information that is
           only relevant to people building Perl on Unix-like systems.  In
           particular, you can safely ignore any information that talks about
           "Configure".

           You may also want to look at one other option for building a perl that
           will work on Windows: the README.cygwin file, which give a different
           set of rules to build a perl for Windows.  This method will probably
           enable you to build a more Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need
           to download and use various other build-time and run-time support
           software described in that file.

This includes both 32-bit and 64-bit\n       Windows operating systems.  The resulting Perl requires no additional\n       software to run (other than what came with your operating system).\n       Currently, this port is capable of using one of the following compilers\n       on the Intel x86 architecture:\n\n\t     Microsoft Visual C++    version 6.0 or later\n\t     Intel C++ Compiler      (experimental)\n\t     Gcc by mingw.org\t     gcc version 3.4.5-5.3.0\n\t     Gcc by mingw-w64.org    gcc version 4.4.3 or later\n\n       Note that the last two of these are actually competing projects both\n       delivering complete gcc toolchain for MS Windows:\n\n       <http://mingw.org>\n\t   Delivers gcc toolchain targeting 32-bit Windows platform.\n\n       <http://mingw-w64.org>\n\t   Delivers gcc toolchain targeting both 64-bit Windows and 32-bit\n\t   Windows platforms (despite the project name \"mingw-w64\" they are\n\t   not only 64-bit oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers\n\t   and cross-compilers that are also supported by perl's makefile."

Therefore, you should be able to build and\n       install most extensions found in the CPAN sites.  See \"Usage Hints for\n       Perl on Windows\" below for general hints about this.\n\n   Setting Up Perl on Windows\n       Make\n\t   You need a \"make\" program to build the sources.

Builds using gcc need gmake. nmake is not supported for gcc\n\t   builds.  Parallel building is only supported with gmake, not nmake."

  manpageQuestion3: What is the process for wrapping a Perl script into a batch file that can be executed on Windows?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlwin32`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\npl2bat foo.pl\n\n\t       will create the file \"FOO.BAT\".\tNote \"pl2bat\" strips any .pl\n\t       suffix and adds a .bat suffix to the generated file.\n\n\t       If you use the 4DOS/NT or similar command shell, note that\n\t       \"pl2bat\" uses the \"%*\" variable in the generated batch file to\n\t       refer to all the command line arguments, so you may need to\n\t       make sure that construct works in batch files.  As of this\n\t       writing, 4DOS/NT users will need a \"ParameterChar = *\"\n\t       statement in their 4NT.INI file or will need to execute \"setdos\n\t       /p*\" in the 4DOS/NT startup file to enable this to work.\n\n       3.      Using \"pl2bat\" has a few problems:  the file name gets changed,\n\t       so scripts that rely on $0 to find what they must do may not\n\t       run properly; running \"pl2bat\" replicates the contents of the\n\t       original script, and so this process can be maintenance\n\t       intensive if the originals get updated often.  A different\n\t       approach that avoids both problems is possible."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlwin32`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nA script called \"runperl.bat\" is available that can be copied\n\t       to any filename (along with the .bat suffix).  For example, if\n\t       you call it \"foo.bat\", it will run the file \"foo\" when it is\n\t       executed.  Since you can run batch files on Windows platforms\n\t       simply by typing the name (without the extension), this\n\t       effectively runs the file \"foo\", when you type either \"foo\" or\n\t       \"foo.bat\".  With this method, \"foo.bat\" can even be in a\n\t       different location than the file \"foo\", as long as \"foo\" is\n\t       available somewhere on the PATH.  If your scripts are on a\n\t       filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even avoid\n\t       copying \"runperl.bat\".\n\n\t       Here's a diversion:  copy \"runperl.bat\" to \"runperl\", and type\n\t       \"runperl\".

This isn't the case.  If you want to start a copy of\n       \"perl\" without opening a command-line window, use the \"wperl\"\n       executable built during the installation process.  Usage is exactly the\n       same as normal \"perl\" on Windows, except that options like \"-h\" don't\n       work (since they need a command-line window to print to).\n\n       If you find bugs in perl, you can report them to\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.\n\nBUGS AND CAVEATS\n       Norton AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly if set\n       to \"AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened\".

Worse, with PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with\n       peculiar messages as the virus checker interacts badly with\n       miniperl.exe writing configure files (it seems to either catch file\n       part written and treat it as suspicious, or virus checker may have it\n       \"locked\" in a way which inhibits miniperl updating it).
