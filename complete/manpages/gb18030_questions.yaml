It is a superset of the older\n     GB 2312-1980 and GBK encodings, and incorporates Unicode's Unihan\n     Extension A completely.  It also provides code space for all Unicode 3.0\n     code points.\n\n     Multibyte characters in the GB18030 encoding can be one byte, two bytes,\n     or four bytes long.  There are a total of over 1.5 million code\n     positions.\n\n     GB 11383-1981 (ASCII) characters are represented by single bytes in the\n     range 0x00 to 0x7F.\n\n     Chinese characters are represented as either two bytes or four bytes.\n     Characters that are represented by two bytes begin with a byte in the\n     range 0x81-0xFE and end with a byte either in the range 0x40-0x7E or\n     0x80-0xFE.\n\n     Characters that are represented by four bytes begin with a byte in the\n     range 0x81-0xFE, have a second byte in the range 0x30-0x39, a third byte\n     in the range 0x81-0xFE and a fourth byte in the range 0x30-0x39."
