This tool can run\n       either manually or in daemon mode. When running in daemon mode, it\n       sleeps in the background and checks the cache directory at regular\n       intervals for cached content to be removed. You can stop the daemon\n       cleanly by sending it a TERM or INT signal. When run manually, a once\n       off check of the cache directory is made for cached content to be\n       removed. If one or more URLs are specified, each URL will be deleted\n       from the cache, if present."

This\n\t      option is mutually exclusive with the -D, -v and -r options. To\n\t      shutdown the daemon cleanly, just send it a SIGTERM or SIGINT.\n\n       -D     Do a dry run and don't delete anything. This option is mutually\n\t      exclusive with the -d option. When doing a dry run and deleting\n\t      directories with -t, the inodes reported deleted in the stats\n\t      cannot take into account the directories deleted, and will be\n\t      marked as an estimate.\n\n       -v     Be verbose and print statistics. This option is mutually\n\t      exclusive with the -d option.\n\n       -r     Clean thoroughly. This assumes that the Apache web server is not\n\t      running (otherwise you may get garbage in the cache). This\n\t      option is mutually exclusive with the -d option and implies the\n\t      -t option.\n\n       -n     Be nice. This causes slower processing in favour of other\n\t      processes. htcacheclean will sleep from time to time so that (a)\n\t      the disk IO will be delayed and (b) the kernel can schedule\n\t      other processes in the meantime.\n\n       -t     Delete all empty directories. By default only cache files are\n\t      removed, however with some configurations the large number of\n\t      directories created may require attention. If your configuration\n\t      requires a very large number of directories, to the point that\n\t      inode or file allocation table exhaustion may become an issue,\n\t      use of this option is advised.\n\n       -ppath Specify path as the root directory of the disk cache. This\n\t      should be the same value as specified with the CacheRoot\n\t      directive.\n\n       -Ppidfile\n\t      Specify pidfile as the name of the file to write the process ID\n\t      to when daemonized.\n\n       -Rround\n\t      Specify round as the amount to round sizes up to, to compensate\n\t      for disk block sizes. Set to the block size of the cache\n\t      partition.\n\n       -llimit\n\t      Specify limit as the total disk cache size limit. The value is\n\t      expressed in bytes by default (or attaching B to the number).\n\t      Attach K for Kbytes, M for MBytes or G for Gbytes.\n\n       -Llimit\n\t      Specify limit as the total disk cache inode limit. K, M or G\n\t      suffix can also be used.\n\n       -i     Be intelligent and run only when there was a modification of the\n\t      disk cache. This option is only possible together with the -d\n\t      option.\n\n       -a     List the URLs currently stored in the cache. Variants of the\n\t      same URL will be listed once for each variant.\n\n       -A     List the URLs currently stored in the cache, along with their\n\t      attributes in the following order: url, header size, body size,\n\t      status, entity version, date, expiry, request time, response\n\t      time, body present, head request.\n\n\nDELETING A SPECIFIC URL\n       If htcacheclean is passed one or more URLs, each URL will be deleted\n       from the cache. If multiple variants of an URL exists, all variants\n       would be deleted.\n\n\n       When a reverse proxied URL is to be deleted, the effective URL is\n       constructed from the Host header, the port, the path and the query.\n       Note the '?' in the URL must always be specified explicitly, whether a\n       query string is present or not. For example, an attempt to delete the\n       path / from the server localhost, the URL to delete would be\n       http://localhost:80/?.\n\n\nLISTING URLS IN THE CACHE\n       By passing the -a or -A options to htcacheclean, the URLs within the\n       cache will be listed as they are found, one URL per line. The -A option\n       dumps the full cache entry after the URL, with fields in the following\n       order:"
