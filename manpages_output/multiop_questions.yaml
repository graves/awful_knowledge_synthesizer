Alternate names would be scatter/gather processor, or maybe\n       even assembler.\n\nCLASS API\n       The main command of the package is:\n\n       ::fileutil::multi::op ?opName? ?word...?\n\t      The command creates a new multi-file operation object with an\n\t      associated global Tcl command whose name is opName.  This\n\t      command can be used to invoke the various possible file\n\t      operations.  It has the following general form:\n\n\t      opName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command.\n\n       If the string %AUTO% is used as the opName then the package will\n       generate a unique name on its own.\n\n       If one or more words are specified they are interpreted as an initial\n       set of file commands to execute. I.e. the method do of the newly\n       constructed object is implicitly invoked using the words as its\n       arguments.\n\nOBJECT API\n       The following methods are possible for multi-file operation objects:\n\n       $opName do ?word...?\n\t      This method interprets the specified words as file commands to\n\t      execute. See the section FILE API for the set of acceptable\n\t      commands, their syntax, and semantics.\n\n\t      The result of the method is the result generated by the last\n\t      file command it executed.\n\nFILE API\n       Both object constructor and method do take a list of words and\n       interpret them as file commands to execute. The names were chosen to\n       allow the construction of operations as sentences in near-natural\n       language. Most of the commands influence just the state of the object,\n       i.e. are simply providing the configuration used by the command\n       triggering the actual action.\n\n       into directory\n\t      Specifies the destination directory for operations.\n\n       in directory\n\t      Alias for into.\n\n       to directory\n\t      Alias for into.\n\n       from directory\n\t      Specifies the source directory for operations.\n\n       not pattern\n\t      Specifies a glob pattern for paths to be excluded from the\n\t      operation.\n\n       for pattern\n\t      Alias for not.\n\n       exclude pattern\n\t      Alias for not.\n\n       but    Has no arguments of its own, but looks ahead in the list of\n\t      words and executes all not commands immediately following it.\n\t      This allows the construction of \"but not\" and \"but exclude\"\n\t      clauses for a more natural sounding specification of excluded\n\t      paths.\n\n       except A semi-alias for but. Has no arguments of its own, but looks\n\t      ahead in the list of words and executes all for commands\n\t      immediately following it. This allows the construction of\n\t      \"except for\" clauses for a more natural sounding specification\n\t      of excluded paths.\n\n       as name\n\t      Specifies a new name for the first file handled by the current\n\t      operation. I.e. for the renaming of a single file during the\n\t      operation.\n\n       recursive\n\t      Signals that file expansion should happen in the whole directory\n\t      hierarchy and not just the directory itself.\n\n       recursively\n\t      An alias for recursive.\n\n       copy   Signals that the operation is the copying of files from source\n\t      to destination directory per the specified inclusion and\n\t      exclusion patterns.\n\n       move   Signals that the operation is the moving of files from source to\n\t      destination directory per the specified inclusion and exclusion\n\t      patterns.\n\n       remove Signals that the operation is the removal of files in the\n\t      destination directory per the specified inclusion and exclusion\n\t      patterns.\n\n       expand Signals that there is no operation but the calculation of the\n\t      set of files from the include and exclude patterns. This\n\t      operation is not available if the-set is used.\n\n       invoke cmdprefix\n\t      Signals that the user-specified command prefix cmdprefix is the\n\t      operation to perform. The command prefix is executed at the\n\t      global level and given the source directory, destination\n\t      directory, and set of files (as dictionary mapping from source\n\t      to destination files), in this order.\n\n       reset  Forces the object into the ground state where all parts of the\n\t      configuration have default values.\n\n       (      Saves a copy of the current object state on a stack.\n\n       )      Takes the state at the top of the state stack and restores it,\n\t      i.e. makes it the new current object state.\n\n       cd directory\n\t      Changes the destination directory to the sub-directory directory\n\t      of the current destination.\n\n       up     Changes the destination directory to the parent directory of the\n\t      current destination.\n\n       for-windows\n\t      Checks that Windows is the current platform. Aborts processing\n\t      if not.\n\n       for-win\n\t      An alias for for-windows.\n\n       for-unix\n\t      Checks that Unix is the current platform. Aborts processing if\n\t      not.\n\n       the pattern\n\t      This command specifies the files to operate on per a glob\n\t      pattern, and is also the active element, i.e. the command which\n\t      actually performs the specified operation. All the other\n\t      commands only modified the object state to set the operation up,\n\t      but di nothing else.\n\n\t      To allow for a more natural sounding syntax this command also\n\t      looks ahead in the list of words looks and executes several\n\t      commands immediately following it before performing its own\n\t      actions.\tThese commands are as, but, exclude, except, from, and\n\t      into (and aliases). That way these commands act like qualifiers,\n\t      and still take effect as if they had been written before this\n\t      command.\n\n\t      After the operation has been performed the object state the\n\t      exclude patterns and the alias name, if specified, are reset to\n\t      their default values (i.e. empty), but nothing else.\n\n       the-set varname\n\t      Like the, however the set of files to use is not specified\n\t      implicitly per a glob pattern, but contained and loaded from the\n\t      specified variable. The operation expand is not available if\n\t      this command is used.\n\n       -> varname\n\t      Saves the set of files from the last expansion into the\n\t      specified variable.\n\n       strict Make file expansion and definition of destination directory (in\n\t      and aliases) strict, i.e. report errors for missing directories,\n\t      and empty expansion.\n\n       !strict\n\t      Complement of strict. A missing destination directory or empty\n\t      expansion are not reported as errors.\n\n       files  Limit the search to files. Default is to accept every type of\n\t      path.\n\n       links  Limit the search to symbolic links. Default is to accept every\n\t      type of path.\n\n       directories\n\t      Limit the search to directories. Default is to accept every type\n\t      of path.\n\n       dirs   An alias for directories.\n\n       all    Accept all types of paths (default).\n\n       state? Returns the current state of the object as dictionary. The\n\t      dictionary keys and their meanings are:\n\n\t      as     Last setting made by as.\n\n\t      excluded\n\t\t     List of currently known exclusion patterns.\n\n\t      from   Current source directory, set by from.\n\n\t      into   Current destination directory, set by into (and aliases).\n\n\t      operation\n\t\t     Current operation to perform, set by copy, move, remove,\n\t\t     expand, or invoke.\n\n\t      recursive\n\t\t     Current recursion status.

For example the second example in\n       this section can re-arranged into:\n\n\t   $F do\t    \\\\\n\t    from /sources \\\\\n\t    into /scratch  \\\\\n\t    but not *.html \\\\\n\t    move\t   \\\\\n\t    the  *\n\n       and the result is not only still a valid specification, but even stays\n       relatively readable.\n\n       Further note that the information collected by the commands but,\n       except, and as is automatically reset after the associated the was\n       executed. However no other state is reset in that manner, allowing the\n       user to avoid repetitions of unchanging information.
