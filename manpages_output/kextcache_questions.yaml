It should no longer be\n     necessary to use.\tSee kmutil(8)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The kextcache program creates kext caches, which speed up kext loading\n     operations.  It is invoked automatically as needed to rebuild system\n     caches.\n\n     Caution: Incorrect use of kextcache can render a volume incapable of\n     startup.  Installers and administrators should not use this program to\n     update system kext caches.  Instead they should run touch(1) on the\n     /System/Library/Extensions/ directory of the installation target volume\n     after they have finished, which invalidates the existing caches and\n     causes the system to update all necessary kext caches.  kextcache\n     -update-volume can be used to wait for this process to complete.  See\n     “Apple Developer Technical Q&A QA1319: Installing an I/O Kit Kext Without\n     Rebooting” for information on updating kext caches on prior releases of\n     macOS."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `kextcache`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nkextcache creates several kinds of kext caches.  The first is the\n     prelinked kernel (also known as a “prelinkedkernel”), which contains the\n     kernel code and the essential files (info dictionary and executable) for\n     an arbitrary set of kexts, with kext executables linked for their run-\n     time locations.  A prelinked kernel speeds early system startup by\n     collecting these many files in one place for the booter to locate, and by\n     having each kext linked in place and ready to start as needed.  To create\n     or update a prelinked kernel, use the -prelinked-kernel or\n     -system-prelinked-kernel option.\n\n     Other kext caches collect specific data from the info dictionaries of\n     kexts.  There are many individual caches for specific subsets of data;\n     they care collectively called system info caches.\tThese caches are used\n     to optimize disk I/O when working with kexts during late system startup\n     and beyond.  To update the system kext info caches for the root volume,\n     use the -system-caches option."
