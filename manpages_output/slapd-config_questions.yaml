This configuration information is also used by the\n       SLAPD tools slapacl(8), slapadd(8), slapauth(8), slapcat(8), slapdn(8),\n       slapindex(8), and slaptest(8).\n\n       The config backend is backward compatible with the older slapd.conf(5)\n       file but provides the ability to change the configuration dynamically\n       at runtime. If slapd is run with only a slapd.conf file dynamic changes\n       will be allowed but they will not persist across a server restart.\n       Dynamic changes are only saved when slapd is running from a slapd.d\n       configuration directory.\n\n       Unlike other backends, there can only be one instance of the config\n       backend, and most of its structure is predefined. The root of the\n       database is hardcoded to cn=config and this root entry contains global\n       settings for slapd. Multiple child entries underneath the root entry\n       are used to carry various other settings:\n\n\t      cn=Module\n\t\t     dynamically loaded modules\n\n\t      cn=Schema\n\t\t     schema definitions\n\n\t      olcBackend=xxx\n\t\t     backend-specific settings\n\n\t      olcDatabase=xxx\n\t\t     database-specific settings\n\n       The cn=Module entries will only appear in configurations where slapd\n       was built with support for dynamically loaded modules. There can be\n       multiple entries, one for each configured module path. Within each\n       entry there will be values recorded for each module loaded on a given\n       path. These entries have no children.\n\n       The cn=Schema entry contains all of the hardcoded schema elements.  The\n       children of this entry contain all user-defined schema elements.  In\n       schema that were loaded from include files, the child entry will be\n       named after the include file from which the schema was loaded.\n       Typically the first child in this subtree will be\n       cn=core,cn=schema,cn=config.\n\n       olcBackend entries are for storing settings specific to a single\n       backend type (and thus global to all database instances of that type).\n       At present there are no backends that implement settings of this\n       nature, so usually there will not be any olcBackend entries.\n\n       olcDatabase entries store settings specific to a single database\n       instance. These entries may have olcOverlay child entries corresponding\n       to any overlays configured on the database. The olcDatabase and\n       olcOverlay entries may also have miscellaneous child entries for other\n       settings as needed. There are two special database entries that are\n       predefined - one is an entry for the config database itself, and the\n       other is for the \"frontend\" database. Settings in the frontend database\n       are inherited by the other databases, unless they are explicitly\n       overridden in a specific database.\n\n       The specific configuration options available are discussed below in the\n       Global Configuration Options, General Backend Options, and General\n       Database Options. Options are set by defining LDAP attributes with\n       specific values.  In general the names of the LDAP attributes are the\n       same as the corresponding slapd.conf keyword, with an \"olc\" prefix\n       added on.\n\n       The parser for many of these attributes is the same as used for parsing\n       the slapd.conf keywords. As such, slapd.conf keywords that allow\n       multiple items to be specified on one line, separated by whitespace,\n       will allow multiple items to be specified in one attribute value.\n       However, when reading the attribute via LDAP, the items will be\n       returned as individual attribute values.\n\n       Backend-specific options are discussed in the slapd-<backend>(5) manual\n       pages.  Refer to the \"OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide\" for more details\n       on configuring slapd.\n\nGLOBAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS\n       Options described in this section apply to the server as a whole.\n       Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets\n       <>.\n\n       These options may only be specified in the cn=config entry. This entry\n       must have an objectClass of olcGlobal."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `slapd-config`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nolcAllows: <features>\n\t      Specify a set of features to allow (default none).  bind_v2\n\t      allows acceptance of LDAPv2 bind requests.  Note that slapd(8)\n\t      does not truly implement LDAPv2 (RFC 1777), now Historic (RFC\n\t      3494).  bind_anon_cred allows anonymous bind when credentials\n\t      are not empty (e.g.  when DN is empty).  bind_anon_dn allows\n\t      unauthenticated (anonymous) bind when DN is not empty.\n\t      update_anon allows unauthenticated (anonymous) update operations\n\t      to be processed (subject to access controls and other\n\t      administrative limits).  proxy_authz_anon allows unauthenticated\n\t      (anonymous) proxy authorization control to be processed (subject\n\t      to access controls, authorization and other administrative\n\t      limits).\n\n       olcArgsFile: <filename>\n\t      The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the slapd server's\n\t      command line (program name and options).\n\n       olcAttributeOptions: <option-name>...\n\t      Define tagging attribute options or option tag/range prefixes.\n\t      Options must not end with `-', prefixes must end with `-'.  The\n\t      `lang-' prefix is predefined.  If you use the\n\t      olcAttributeOptions directive, `lang-' will no longer be defined\n\t      and you must specify it explicitly if you want it defined.\n\n\t      An attribute description with a tagging option is a subtype of\n\t      that attribute description without the option.  Except for that,\n\t      options defined this way have no special semantics.  Prefixes\n\t      defined this way work like the `lang-' options: They define a\n\t      prefix for tagging options starting with the prefix.  That is,\n\t      if you define the prefix `x-foo-', you can use the option\n\t      `x-foo-bar'.  Furthermore, in a search or compare, a prefix or\n\t      range name (with a trailing `-') matches all options starting\n\t      with that name, as well as the option with the range name sans\n\t      the trailing `-'.  That is, `x-foo-bar-' matches `x-foo-bar' and\n\t      `x-foo-bar-baz'.\n\n\t      RFC 4520 reserves options beginning with `x-' for private\n\t      experiments.  Other options should be registered with IANA, see\n\t      RFC 4520 section 3.5.  OpenLDAP also has the `binary' option\n\t      built in, but this is a transfer option, not a tagging option.\n\n       olcAuthIDRewrite: <rewrite-rule>\n\t      Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user\n\t      names to an LDAP DN used for authorization purposes.  Its\n\t      purpose is analogous to that of olcAuthzRegexp (see below).  The\n\t      rewrite-rule is a set of rules analogous to those described in\n\t      slapo-rwm(5) for data rewriting (after stripping the rwm-\n\t      prefix).\tolcAuthIDRewrite and olcAuthzRegexp should not be\n\t      intermixed.\n\n       olcAuthzPolicy: <policy>\n\t      Used to specify which rules to use for Proxy Authorization.\n\t      Proxy authorization allows a client to authenticate to the\n\t      server using one user's credentials, but specify a different\n\t      identity to use for authorization and access control purposes.\n\t      It essentially allows user A to login as user B, using user A's\n\t      password.  The none flag disables proxy authorization. This is\n\t      the default setting.  The from flag will use rules in the\n\t      authzFrom attribute of the authorization DN.  The to flag will\n\t      use rules in the authzTo attribute of the authentication DN.\n\t      The any flag, an alias for the deprecated value of both, will\n\t      allow any of the above, whatever succeeds first (checked in to,\n\t      from sequence.  The all flag requires both authorizations to\n\t      succeed.\n\n\t      The rules are mechanisms to specify which identities are allowed\n\t      to perform proxy authorization.  The authzFrom attribute in an\n\t      entry specifies which other users are allowed to proxy login to\n\t      this entry. The authzTo attribute in an entry specifies which\n\t      other users this user can authorize as.  Use of authzTo rules\n\t      can be easily abused if users are allowed to write arbitrary\n\t      values to this attribute.  In general the authzTo attribute must\n\t      be protected with ACLs such that only privileged users can\n\t      modify it.  The value of authzFrom and authzTo describes an\n\t      identity or a set of identities; it can take five forms:\n\n\t\t     ldap:///<base>??[<scope>]?<filter>\n\t\t     dn[.<dnstyle>]:<pattern>\n\t\t     u[<mech>[<realm>]]:<pattern>\n\t\t     group[/objectClass[/attributeType]]:<pattern>\n\t\t     <pattern>\n\n\t\t     <dnstyle>:={exact|onelevel|children|subtree|regex}\n\n\t      The first form is a valid LDAP URI where the <host>:<port>, the\n\t      <attrs> and the <extensions> portions must be absent, so that\n\t      the search occurs locally on either authzFrom or authzTo.  The\n\t      second form is a DN, with the optional style modifiers exact,\n\t      onelevel, children, and subtree for exact, onelevel, children\n\t      and subtree matches, which cause <pattern> to be normalized\n\t      according to the DN normalization rules, or the special regex\n\t      style, which causes the <pattern> to be treated as a POSIX\n\t      (''extended'') regular expression, as discussed in regex(7)\n\t      and/or re_format(7).  A pattern of * means any non-anonymous DN.\n\t      The third form is a SASL id, with the optional fields <mech> and\n\t      <realm> that allow to specify a SASL mechanism, and eventually a\n\t      SASL realm, for those mechanisms that support one.  The need to\n\t      allow the specification of a mechanism is still debated, and\n\t      users are strongly discouraged to rely on this possibility.  The\n\t      fourth form is a group specification, consisting of the keyword\n\t      group, optionally followed by the specification of the group\n\t      objectClass and member attributeType.  The group with DN\n\t      <pattern> is searched with base scope, and in case of match, the\n\t      values of the member attributeType are searched for the asserted\n\t      DN.  For backwards compatibility, if no identity type is\n\t      provided, i.e. only <pattern> is present, an exact DN is\n\t      assumed; as a consequence, <pattern> is subjected to DN\n\t      normalization.  Since the interpretation of authzFrom and\n\t      authzTo can impact security, users are strongly encouraged to\n\t      explicitly set the type of identity specification that is being\n\t      used.  A subset of these rules can be used as third arg in the\n\t      olcAuthzRegexp statement (see below); significantly, the URI and\n\t      the dn.exact:<dn> forms.\n\n       olcAuthzRegexp: <match> <replace>\n\t      Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user\n\t      names, such as provided by SASL subsystem, to an LDAP DN used\n\t      for authorization purposes.  Note that the resultant DN need not\n\t      refer to an existing entry to be considered valid.  When an\n\t      authorization request is received from the SASL subsystem, the\n\t      SASL USERNAME, REALM, and MECHANISM are taken, when available,\n\t      and combined into a name of the form\n\n\t\t     UID=<username>[[,CN=<realm>],CN=<mechanism>],CN=auth\n\n\t      This name is then compared against the match POSIX\n\t      (''extended'') regular expression, and if the match is\n\t      successful, the name is replaced with the replace string.  If\n\t      there are wildcard strings in the match regular expression that\n\t      are enclosed in parenthesis, e.g.\n\n\t\t     UID=([^,]*),CN=.*\n\n\t      then the portion of the name that matched the wildcard will be\n\t      stored in the numbered placeholder variable $1. If there are\n\t      other wildcard strings in parenthesis, the matching strings will\n\t      be in $2, $3, etc. up to $9. The placeholders can then be used\n\t      in the replace string, e.g.\n\n\t\t     UID=$1,OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com\n\n\t      The replaced name can be either a DN, i.e. a string prefixed by\n\t      \"dn:\", or an LDAP URI.  If the latter, the server will use the\n\t      URI to search its own database(s) and, if the search returns\n\t      exactly one entry, the name is replaced by the DN of that entry.\n\t      The LDAP URI must have no hostport, attrs, or extensions\n\t      components, but the filter is mandatory, e.g.\n\n\t\t     ldap:///OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com??one?(UID=$1)\n\n\t      The protocol portion of the URI must be strictly ldap.  Note\n\t      that this search is subject to access controls.  Specifically,\n\t      the authentication identity must have \"auth\" access in the\n\t      subject.\n\n\t      Multiple olcAuthzRegexp values can be specified to allow for\n\t      multiple matching and replacement patterns. The matching\n\t      patterns are checked in the order they appear in the attribute,\n\t      stopping at the first successful match.\n\n\n       olcConcurrency: <integer>\n\t      Specify a desired level of concurrency.  Provided to the\n\t      underlying thread system as a hint.  The default is not to\n\t      provide any hint. This setting is only meaningful on some\n\t      platforms where there is not a one to one correspondence between\n\t      user threads and kernel threads.\n\n       olcConnMaxPending: <integer>\n\t      Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an anonymous\n\t      session.\tIf requests are submitted faster than the server can\n\t      process them, they will be queued up to this limit. If the limit\n\t      is exceeded, the session is closed. The default is 100.\n\n       olcConnMaxPendingAuth: <integer>\n\t      Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an\n\t      authenticated session.  The default is 1000.\n\n       olcDisallows: <features>\n\t      Specify a set of features to disallow (default none).  bind_anon\n\t      disables acceptance of anonymous bind requests.  Note that this\n\t      setting does not prohibit anonymous directory access (See\n\t      \"require authc\").  bind_simple disables simple (bind)\n\t      authentication.  tls_2_anon disables forcing session to\n\t      anonymous status (see also tls_authc) upon StartTLS operation\n\t      receipt.\ttls_authc disallows the StartTLS operation if\n\t      authenticated (see also tls_2_anon).\n\n       olcExtraAttrs: <attr>\n\t      Lists what attributes need to be added to search requests.\n\t      Local storage backends return the entire entry to the frontend.\n\t      The frontend takes care of only returning the requested\n\t      attributes that are allowed by ACLs.  However, features like\n\t      access checking and so may need specific attributes that are not\n\t      automatically returned by remote storage backends, like proxy\n\t      backends and so on.  <attr> is an attribute that is needed for\n\t      internal purposes and thus always needs to be collected, even\n\t      when not explicitly requested by clients.  This attribute is\n\t      multi-valued.\n\n       olcGentleHUP: { TRUE | FALSE }\n\t      A SIGHUP signal will only cause a 'gentle' shutdown-attempt:\n\t      Slapd will stop listening for new connections, but will not\n\t      close the connections to the current clients.  Future write\n\t      operations return unwilling-to-perform, though.  Slapd\n\t      terminates when all clients have closed their connections (if\n\t      they ever do), or - as before - if it receives a SIGTERM signal.\n\t      This can be useful if you wish to terminate the server and start\n\t      a new slapd server with another database, without disrupting the\n\t      currently active clients.  The default is FALSE.\tYou may wish\n\t      to use olcIdleTimeout along with this option.\n\n       olcIdleTimeout: <integer>\n\t      Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing an\n\t      idle client connection.  A setting of 0 disables this feature.\n\t      The default is 0. You may also want to set the olcWriteTimeout\n\t      option.\n\n       olcIndexIntLen: <integer>\n\t      Specify the key length for ordered integer indices. The most\n\t      significant bytes of the binary integer will be used for index\n\t      keys. The default value is 4, which provides exact indexing for\n\t      31 bit values.  A floating point representation is used to index\n\t      too large values.\n\n       olcIndexSubstrIfMaxlen: <integer>\n\t      Specify the maximum length for subinitial and subfinal indices.\n\t      Only this many characters of an attribute value will be\n\t      processed by the indexing functions; any excess characters are\n\t      ignored. The default is 4.\n\n       olcIndexSubstrIfMinlen: <integer>\n\t      Specify the minimum length for subinitial and subfinal indices.\n\t      An attribute value must have at least this many characters in\n\t      order to be processed by the indexing functions. The default is\n\t      2.\n\n       olcIndexSubstrAnyLen: <integer>\n\t      Specify the length used for subany indices. An attribute value\n\t      must have at least this many characters in order to be\n\t      processed. Attribute values longer than this length will be\n\t      processed in segments of this length. The default is 4. The\n\t      subany index will also be used in subinitial and subfinal index\n\t      lookups when the filter string is longer than the\n\t      olcIndexSubstrIfMaxlen value.\n\n       olcIndexSubstrAnyStep: <integer>\n\t      Specify the steps used in subany index lookups. This value sets\n\t      the offset for the segments of a filter string that are\n\t      processed for a subany index lookup. The default is 2. For\n\t      example, with the default values, a search using this filter\n\t      \"cn=*abcdefgh*\" would generate index lookups for \"abcd\", \"cdef\",\n\t      and \"efgh\".\n\n\n       Note: Indexing support depends on the particular backend in use. Also,\n       changing these settings will generally require deleting any indices\n       that depend on these parameters and recreating them with slapindex(8).\n\n\n       olcListenerThreads: <integer>\n\t      Specify the number of threads to use for the connection manager.\n\t      The default is 1 and this is typically adequate for up to 16 CPU\n\t      cores.  The value should be set to a power of 2.\n\n       olcLocalSSF: <SSF>\n\t      Specifies the Security Strength Factor (SSF) to be given local\n\t      LDAP sessions, such as those to the ldapi:// listener.  For a\n\t      description of SSF values, see olcSaslSecProps's minssf option\n\t      description.  The default is 71.\n\n       olcLogFile: <filename>\n\t      Specify a file for recording debug log messages. By default\n\t      these messages only go to stderr and are not recorded anywhere\n\t      else. Specifying a logfile copies messages to both stderr and\n\t      the logfile.\n\n       olcLogLevel: <integer> [...]\n\t      Specify the level at which debugging statements and operation\n\t      statistics should be syslogged (currently logged to the\n\t      syslogd(8) LOG_LOCAL4 facility).\tThey must be considered\n\t      subsystems rather than increasingly verbose log levels.  Some\n\t      messages with higher priority are logged regardless of the\n\t      configured loglevel as soon as any logging is configured.

These attributes are returned in\n\t      addition to the attributes normally produced by slapd.\n\n\t      The root DSE is an entry with information about the server and\n\t      its capabilities, in operational attributes.  It has the empty\n\t      DN, and can be read with e.g.:\n\t\t  ldapsearch -x -b \"\" -s base \"+\"\n\t      See RFC 4512 section 5.1 for details.\n\n       olcSaslAuxprops: <plugin> [...]\n\t      Specify which auxprop plugins to use for authentication lookups.\n\t      The default is empty, which just uses slapd's internal support.\n\t      Usually no other auxprop plugins are needed.\n\n       olcSaslHost: <fqdn>\n\t      Used to specify the fully qualified domain name used for SASL\n\t      processing.\n\n       olcSaslRealm: <realm>\n\t      Specify SASL realm.

The none flag\n\t      (without any other properties) causes the flag properties\n\t      default, \"noanonymous,noplain\", to be cleared.  The noplain flag\n\t      disables mechanisms susceptible to simple passive attacks.  The\n\t      noactive flag disables mechanisms susceptible to active attacks.\n\t      The nodict flag disables mechanisms susceptible to passive\n\t      dictionary attacks.  The noanonymous flag disables mechanisms\n\t      which support anonymous login.  The forwardsec flag require\n\t      forward secrecy between sessions.  The passcred require\n\t      mechanisms which pass client credentials (and allow mechanisms\n\t      which can pass credentials to do so).  The minssf=<factor>\n\t      property specifies the minimum acceptable security strength\n\t      factor as an integer approximate to effective key length used\n\t      for encryption.  0 (zero) implies no protection, 1 implies\n\t      integrity protection only, 56 allows DES or other weak ciphers,\n\t      112 allows triple DES and other strong ciphers, 128 allows RC4,\n\t      Blowfish and other modern strong ciphers.  The default is 0.\n\t      The maxssf=<factor> property specifies the maximum acceptable\n\t      security strength factor as an integer (see minssf description).\n\t      The default is INT_MAX.  The maxbufsize=<size> property\n\t      specifies the maximum security layer receive buffer size\n\t      allowed.\t0 disables security layers.  The default is 65536.\n\n       olcServerID: <integer> [<URL>]\n\t      Specify an integer ID from 0 to 4095 for this server (limited to\n\t      3 hexadecimal digits).  The ID may also be specified as a\n\t      hexadecimal ID by prefixing the value with \"0x\".\tThese IDs are\n\t      required when using multimaster replication and each master must\n\t      have a unique ID. Note that this requirement also applies to\n\t      separate masters contributing to a glued set of databases.  If\n\t      the URL is provided, this directive may be specified multiple\n\t      times, providing a complete list of participating servers and\n\t      their IDs. The fully qualified hostname of each server should be\n\t      used in the supplied URLs. The IDs are used in the \"replica id\"\n\t      field of all CSNs generated by the specified server. The default\n\t      value is zero.  Example:\n\n\t    olcServerID: 1 ldap://ldap1.example.com\n\t    olcServerID: 2 ldap://ldap2.example.com\n\n       olcSockbufMaxIncoming: <integer>\n\t      Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for anonymous\n\t      sessions.  The default is 262143.\n\n       olcSockbufMaxIncomingAuth: <integer>\n\t      Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for authenticated\n\t      sessions.  The default is 4194303.\n\n       olcTCPBuffer [listener=<URL>] [{read|write}=]<size>\n\t      Specify the size of the TCP buffer.  A global value for both\n\t      read and write TCP buffers related to any listener is defined,\n\t      unless the listener is explicitly specified, or either the read\n\t      or write qualifiers are used.  See tcp(7) for details.  Note\n\t      that some OS-es implement automatic TCP buffer tuning.\n\n       olcThreads: <integer>\n\t      Specify the maximum size of the primary thread pool.  The\n\t      default is 16; the minimum value is 2.\n\n       olcToolThreads: <integer>\n\t      Specify the maximum number of threads to use in tool mode.  This\n\t      should not be greater than the number of CPUs in the system.\n\t      The default is 1.\n\n       olcWriteTimeout: <integer>\n\t      Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing a\n\t      connection with an outstanding write.  This allows recovery from\n\t      various network hang conditions.\tA setting of 0 disables this\n\t      feature.\tThe default is 0.\n\nTLS OPTIONS\n       If slapd is built with support for Transport Layer Security, there are\n       more options you can specify.\n\n       olcTLSCipherSuite: <cipher-suite-spec>\n\t      Permits configuring what ciphers will be accepted and the\n\t      preference order.  <cipher-suite-spec> should be a cipher\n\t      specification for the TLS library in use (SecureTransport,\n\t      OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or Mozilla NSS).  Example:\n\n\t\t     OpenSSL:\n\t\t\t    olcTLSCipherSuite: HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2\n\n\t\t     GnuTLS:\n\t\t\t    TLSCiphersuite SECURE256:!AES-128-CBC\n\n\t      To check what ciphers a given spec selects in OpenSSL, use:\n\n\t\t   openssl ciphers -v <cipher-suite-spec>\n\n\t      With GnuTLS the available specs can be found in the manual page\n\t      of gnutls-cli(1) (see the description of the option --priority).\n\n\t      In older versions of GnuTLS, where gnutls-cli does not support\n\t      the option --priority, you can obtain the — more limited — list\n\t      of ciphers by calling:\n\n\t\t   gnutls-cli -l\n\n\t      When using Mozilla NSS, the OpenSSL cipher suite specifications\n\t      are used and translated into the format used internally by\n\t      Mozilla NSS.  There isn't an easy way to list the cipher suites\n\t      from the command line.  The authoritative list is in the source\n\t      code for Mozilla NSS in the file sslinfo.c in the structure\n\t\t      static const SSLCipherSuiteInfo suiteInfo[]\n\n\t      When using SecureTransport this directive uses cipher names\n\t      known to the Security framework unless you prefix the value with\n\t      OpenSSL: in which case it uses cipher names known to OpenSSL.\n\n       olcTLSCACertificateFile: <filename>\n\t      Specifies the file that contains certificates for all of the\n\t      Certificate Authorities that slapd will recognize.\n\n\t      When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead\n\t      use the olcTLSTrustedCerts option.\n\n       olcTLSCACertificatePath: <path>\n\t      Specifies the path of a directory that contains Certificate\n\t      Authority certificates in separate individual files. Usually\n\t      only one of this or the olcTLSCACertificateFile is defined. If\n\t      both are specified, both locations will be used. This directive\n\t      is not supported when using GnuTLS.\n\n\t      When using Mozilla NSS, <path> may contain a Mozilla NSS\n\t      cert/key database.  If <path> contains a Mozilla NSS cert/key\n\t      database and CA cert files, OpenLDAP will use the cert/key\n\t      database and will ignore the CA cert files.\n\n\t      When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead\n\t      use the olcTLSTrustedCerts option.\n\n       olcTLSCertificateFile: <filename>\n\t      Specifies the file that contains the slapd server certificate.\n\n\t      When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database (specified\n\t      with olcTLSCACertificatePath), olcTLSCertificateFile specifies\n\t      the name of the certificate to use:\n\t\t   olcTLSCertificateFile: Server-Cert\n\t      If using a token other than the internal built in token, specify\n\t      the token name first, followed by a colon:\n\t\t   olcTLSCertificateFile: my hardware device:Server-Cert\n\t      Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:\n\t\t   certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L\n\n\t      When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead\n\t      use the olcTLSIdentity option.\n\n       olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: <filename>\n\t      Specifies the file that contains the slapd server private key\n\t      that matches the certificate stored in the olcTLSCertificateFile\n\t      file. If the private key is protected with a password, the\n\t      password must be manually typed in when slapd starts.  Usually\n\t      the private key is not protected with a password, to allow slapd\n\t      to start without manual intervention, so it is of critical\n\t      importance that the file is protected carefully.\n\n\t      When using Mozilla NSS, olcTLSCertificateKeyFile specifies the\n\t      name of a file that contains the password for the key for the\n\t      certificate specified with olcTLSCertificateFile.  The modutil\n\t      command can be used to turn off password protection for the\n\t      cert/key database.  For example, if olcTLSCACertificatePath\n\t      specifes /etc/openldap/certdb as the location of the cert/key\n\t      database, use modutil to change the password to the empty\n\t      string:\n\t\t   modutil -dbdir /etc/openldap/certdb -changepw 'NSS Certificate DB'\n\t      You must have the old password, if any.  Ignore the WARNING\n\t      about the running browser.  Press 'Enter' for the new password.\n\n\t      When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead\n\t      use the olcTLSIdentity option.\n\n       olcTLSDHParamFile: <filename>\n\t      This directive specifies the file that contains parameters for\n\t      Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This is required in\n\t      order to use a DSA certificate on the server. If multiple sets\n\t      of parameters are present in the file, all of them will be\n\t      processed.  Note that setting this option may also enable\n\t      Anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchanges in certain non-default\n\t      cipher suites.  You should append \"!ADH\" to your cipher suites\n\t      if you have changed them from the default, otherwise no\n\t      certificate exchanges or verification will be done. When using\n\t      GnuTLS or Mozilla NSS these parameters are always generated\n\t      randomly so this directive is ignored.\n\n       olcTLSRandFile: <filename>\n\t      Specifies the file to obtain random bits from when\n\t      /dev/[u]random is not available.\tGenerally set to the name of\n\t      the EGD/PRNGD socket.  The environment variable RANDFILE can\n\t      also be used to specify the filename.  This directive is ignored\n\t      with SecureTransport, GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.\n\n       olcTLSVerifyClient: <level>\n\t      Specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an\n\t      incoming TLS session, if any.  The <level> can be specified as\n\t      one of the following keywords:\n\n\t      never  This is the default.  slapd will not ask the client for a\n\t\t     certificate.\n\n\t      allow  The client certificate is requested.  If no certificate\n\t\t     is provided, the session proceeds normally.  If a bad\n\t\t     certificate is provided, it will be ignored and the\n\t\t     session proceeds normally.\n\n\t      try    The client certificate is requested.  If no certificate\n\t\t     is provided, the session proceeds normally.  If a bad\n\t\t     certificate is provided, the session is immediately\n\t\t     terminated.\n\n\t      demand | hard | true\n\t\t     These keywords are all equivalent, for compatibility\n\t\t     reasons.  The client certificate is requested.  If no\n\t\t     certificate is provided, or a bad certificate is\n\t\t     provided, the session is immediately terminated.\n\n\t\t     Note that a valid client certificate is required in order\n\t\t     to use the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism with a\n\t\t     TLS session.  As such, a non-default olcTLSVerifyClient\n\t\t     setting must be chosen to enable SASL EXTERNAL\n\t\t     authentication.\n\n       olcTLSCRLCheck: <level>\n\t      Specifies if the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) of the CA\n\t      should be used to verify if the client certificates have not\n\t      been revoked. This requires olcTLSCACertificatePath parameter to\n\t      be set. This parameter is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.\n\t      <level> can be specified as one of the following keywords:\n\n\t      none   No CRL checks are performed\n\n\t      peer   Check the CRL of the peer certificate\n\n\t      all    Check the CRL for a whole certificate chain\n\n       olcTLSCRLFile: <filename>\n\t      Specifies a file containing a Certificate Revocation List to be\n\t      used for verifying that certificates have not been revoked. This\n\t      parameter is only valid when using GnuTLS or Mozilla NSS.\n\n       olcTLSIdentity\n\t      Names the identity in the system keychain.  An identity is a\n\t      certificate paired with a private key.\n\n\t      Used by SecureTransport instead of olcTLSCertificateFile and\n\t      olcTLSCertificateKeyFile.  Ignored by OpenSSL, GnuTLS and\n\t      Mozilla NSS.\n\n       olcTLSTrustedCerts\n\t      Lists the trusted certificates in the system keychain separated\n\t      by '|'.  For example: olcTLSTrustedCerts Frobozz, Inc.|Widgets R\n\t      Us|www.example.com\n\n\t      Used by SecureTransport instead of olcTLSCACertificateFile and\n\t      olcTLSCACertificatePath.\tIgnored by OpenSSL, GnuTLS and Mozilla\n\t      NSS.\n\nDYNAMIC MODULE OPTIONS\n       If slapd is compiled with --enable-modules then the module-related\n       entries will be available. These entries are named\n       cn=module{x},cn=config and must have the olcModuleList objectClass. One\n       entry should be created per olcModulePath.  Normally the config engine\n       generates the \"{x}\" index in the RDN automatically, so it can be\n       omitted when initially loading these entries.\n\n       olcModuleLoad: <filename>\n\t      Specify the name of a dynamically loadable module to load. The\n\t      filename may be an absolute path name or a simple filename. Non-\n\t      absolute names are searched for in the directories specified by\n\t      the olcModulePath option.\n\n       olcModulePath: <pathspec>\n\t      Specify a list of directories to search for loadable modules.\n\t      Typically the path is colon-separated but this depends on the\n\t      operating system.  The default is MODULEDIR, which is where the\n\t      standard OpenLDAP install will place its modules.\n\nSCHEMA OPTIONS\n       Schema definitions are created as entries in the cn=schema,cn=config\n       subtree. These entries must have the olcSchemaConfig objectClass.  As\n       noted above, the actual cn=schema,cn=config entry is predefined and any\n       values specified for it are ignored."

The <hash> must be one of {SSHA}, {SHA},\n\t      {SMD5}, {MD5}, {CRYPT}, and {CLEARTEXT}.\tThe default is {SSHA}.\n\n\t      {SHA} and {SSHA} use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the\n\t      latter with a seed.\n\n\t      {MD5} and {SMD5} use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the latter\n\t      with a seed.\n\n\t      {CRYPT} uses the crypt(3).\n\n\t      {CLEARTEXT} indicates that the new password should be added to\n\t      userPassword as clear text.\n\n\t      Note that this option does not alter the normal user\n\t      applications handling of userPassword during LDAP Add, Modify,\n\t      or other LDAP operations.  This setting is only allowed in the\n\t      frontend entry.\n\n       olcReadOnly: TRUE | FALSE\n\t      This option puts the database into \"read-only\" mode.  Any\n\t      attempts to modify the database will return an \"unwilling to\n\t      perform\" error.  By default, olcReadOnly is FALSE. Note that\n\t      when this option is set TRUE on the frontend, it cannot be reset\n\t      without restarting the server, since further writes to the\n\t      config database will be rejected.\n\n       olcRequires: <conditions>\n\t      Specify a set of conditions to require (default none).  The\n\t      directive may be specified globally and/or per-database;\n\t      databases inherit global conditions, so per-database\n\t      specifications are additive.  bind requires bind operation prior\n\t      to directory operations.\tLDAPv3 requires session to be using\n\t      LDAP version 3.  authc requires authentication prior to\n\t      directory operations.  SASL requires SASL authentication prior\n\t      to directory operations.\tstrong requires strong authentication\n\t      prior to directory operations.  The strong keyword allows\n\t      protected \"simple\" authentication as well as SASL\n\t      authentication.  none may be used to require no conditions\n\t      (useful to clear out globally set conditions within a particular\n\t      database); it must occur first in the list of conditions.\n\n       olcRestrict: <oplist>\n\t      Specify a list of operations that are restricted.  Restrictions\n\t      on a specific database override any frontend setting.\n\t      Operations can be any of add, bind, compare, delete,\n\t      extended[=<OID>], modify, rename, search, or the special pseudo-\n\t      operations read and write, which respectively summarize read and\n\t      write operations.  The use of restrict write is equivalent to\n\t      olcReadOnly: TRUE (see above).  The extended keyword allows to\n\t      indicate the OID of the specific operation to be restricted.\n\n       olcSchemaDN: <dn>\n\t      Specify the distinguished name for the subschema subentry that\n\t      controls the entries on this server.  The default is\n\t      \"cn=Subschema\".\n\n       olcSecurity: <factors>\n\t      Specify a set of security strength factors (separated by white\n\t      space) to require (see olcSaslSecprops's minssf option for a\n\t      description of security strength factors).  The directive may be\n\t      specified globally and/or per-database.  ssf=<n> specifies the\n\t      overall security strength factor.  transport=<n> specifies the\n\t      transport security strength factor.  tls=<n> specifies the TLS\n\t      security strength factor.  sasl=<n> specifies the SASL security\n\t      strength factor.\tupdate_ssf=<n> specifies the overall security\n\t      strength factor to require for directory updates.\n\t      update_transport=<n> specifies the transport security strength\n\t      factor to require for directory updates.\tupdate_tls=<n>\n\t      specifies the TLS security strength factor to require for\n\t      directory updates.  update_sasl=<n> specifies the SASL security\n\t      strength factor to require for directory updates.\n\t      simple_bind=<n> specifies the security strength factor required\n\t      for simple username/password authentication.  Note that the\n\t      transport factor is measure of security provided by the\n\t      underlying transport, e.g. ldapi:// (and eventually IPSEC).  It\n\t      is not normally used.\n\n       olcSizeLimit: {<integer>|unlimited}\n\n       olcSizeLimit: size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer> [...]\n\t      Specify the maximum number of entries to return from a search\n\t      operation.  The default size limit is 500.  Use unlimited to\n\t      specify no limits.  The second format allows a fine grain\n\t      setting of the size limits.  Extra args can be added in the same\n\t      value or as additional values.  See olcLimits for an explanation\n\t      of the different flags.\n\n       olcSortVals: <attr> [...]\n\t      Specify a list of multi-valued attributes whose values will\n\t      always be maintained in sorted order. Using this option will\n\t      allow Modify, Compare, and filter evaluations on these\n\t      attributes to be performed more efficiently. The resulting sort\n\t      order depends on the attributes' syntax and matching rules and\n\t      may not correspond to lexical order or any other recognizable\n\t      order.  This setting is only allowed in the frontend entry.\n\n       olcTimeLimit: {<integer>|unlimited}\n\n       olcTimeLimit: time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> [...]\n\t      Specify the maximum number of seconds (in real time) slapd will\n\t      spend answering a search request.  The default time limit is\n\t      3600.  Use unlimited to specify no limits.  The second format\n\t      allows a fine grain setting of the time limits.  Extra args can\n\t      be added in the same value or as additional values.  See\n\t      olcLimits for an explanation of the different flags."

The term anonymous matches\n\t      all unauthenticated clients.  The term users matches all\n\t      authenticated clients; otherwise an exact dn pattern is assumed\n\t      unless otherwise specified by qualifying the (optional) key\n\t      string dn with exact or base (which are synonyms), to require an\n\t      exact match; with onelevel, to require exactly one level of\n\t      depth match; with subtree, to allow any level of depth match,\n\t      including the exact match; with children, to allow any level of\n\t      depth match, not including the exact match; regex explicitly\n\t      requires the (default) match based on POSIX (''extended'')\n\t      regular expression pattern.  Finally, anonymous matches unbound\n\t      operations; the pattern field is ignored.  The same behavior is\n\t      obtained by using the anonymous form of the <selector> clause.\n\t      The term group, with the optional objectClass oc and\n\t      attributeType at fields, followed by pattern, sets the limits\n\t      for any DN listed in the values of the at attribute (default\n\t      member) of the oc group objectClass (default groupOfNames) whose\n\t      DN exactly matches pattern.\n\n\t      The currently supported limits are size and time.\n\n\t      The syntax for time limits is time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer>,\n\t      where integer is the number of seconds slapd will spend\n\t      answering a search request.  If no time limit is explicitly\n\t      requested by the client, the soft limit is used; if the\n\t      requested time limit exceeds the hard limit, the value of the\n\t      limit is used instead.  If the hard limit is set to the keyword\n\t      soft, the soft limit is used in either case; if it is set to the\n\t      keyword unlimited, no hard limit is enforced.  Explicit requests\n\t      for time limits smaller or equal to the hard limit are honored.\n\t      If no limit specifier is set, the value is assigned to the soft\n\t      limit, and the hard limit is set to soft, to preserve the\n\t      original behavior.\n\n\t      The syntax for size limits is\n\t      size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer>, where integer is the\n\t      maximum number of entries slapd will return answering a search\n\t      request.\tIf no size limit is explicitly requested by the\n\t      client, the soft limit is used; if the requested size limit\n\t      exceeds the hard limit, the value of the limit is used instead.\n\t      If the hard limit is set to the keyword soft, the soft limit is\n\t      used in either case; if it is set to the keyword unlimited, no\n\t      hard limit is enforced.  Explicit requests for size limits\n\t      smaller or equal to the hard limit are honored.  The unchecked\n\t      specifier sets a limit on the number of candidates a search\n\t      request is allowed to examine.  The rationale behind it is that\n\t      searches for non-properly indexed attributes may result in large\n\t      sets of candidates, which must be examined by slapd(8) to\n\t      determine whether they match the search filter or not.  The\n\t      unchecked limit provides a means to drop such operations before\n\t      they are even started.  If the selected candidates exceed the\n\t      unchecked limit, the search will abort with Unwilling to\n\t      perform.\tIf it is set to the keyword unlimited, no limit is\n\t      applied (the default).  If it is set to disable, the search is\n\t      not even performed; this can be used to disallow searches for a\n\t      specific set of users.  If no limit specifier is set, the value\n\t      is assigned to the soft limit, and the hard limit is set to\n\t      soft, to preserve the original behavior.\n\n\t      In case of no match, the global limits are used.\tThe default\n\t      values are the same as for olcSizeLimit and olcTimeLimit; no\n\t      limit is set on unchecked.\n\n\t      If pagedResults control is requested, the hard size limit is\n\t      used by default, because the request of a specific page size is\n\t      considered an explicit request for a limitation on the number of\n\t      entries to be returned.  However, the size limit applies to the\n\t      total count of entries returned within the search, and not to a\n\t      single page.  Additional size limits may be enforced; the syntax\n\t      is size.pr={<integer>|noEstimate|unlimited}, where integer is\n\t      the max page size if no explicit limit is set; the keyword\n\t      noEstimate inhibits the server from returning an estimate of the\n\t      total number of entries that might be returned (note: the\n\t      current implementation does not return any estimate).  The\n\t      keyword unlimited indicates that no limit is applied to the\n\t      pagedResults control page size.  The syntax\n\t      size.prtotal={<integer>|unlimited|disabled} allows to set a\n\t      limit on the total number of entries that a pagedResults control\n\t      allows to return.  By default it is set to the hard limit.  When\n\t      set, integer is the max number of entries that the whole search\n\t      with pagedResults control can return.  Use unlimited to allow\n\t      unlimited number of entries to be returned, e.g. to allow the\n\t      use of the pagedResults control as a means to circumvent size\n\t      limitations on regular searches; the keyword disabled disables\n\t      the control, i.e. no paged results can be returned.  Note that\n\t      the total number of entries returned when the pagedResults\n\t      control is requested cannot exceed the hard size limit of\n\t      regular searches unless extended by the prtotal switch.\n\n       olcMaxDerefDepth: <depth>\n\t      Specifies the maximum number of aliases to dereference when\n\t      trying to resolve an entry, used to avoid infinite alias loops.\n\t      The default is 15.\n\n       olcMirrorMode: TRUE | FALSE\n\t      This option puts a replica database into \"mirror\" mode.  Update\n\t      operations will be accepted from any user, not just the\n\t      updatedn.  The database must already be configured as syncrepl\n\t      consumer before this keyword may be set.\tThis mode also\n\t      requires a olcServerID (see above) to be configured.  By\n\t      default, this setting is FALSE.\n\n       olcPlugin: <plugin_type> <lib_path> <init_function> [<arguments>]\n\t      Configure a SLAPI plugin. See the slapd.plugin(5) manpage for\n\t      more details.\n\n       olcRootDN: <dn>\n\t      Specify the distinguished name that is not subject to access\n\t      control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on\n\t      this database.  This DN may or may not be associated with an\n\t      entry.  An empty root DN (the default) specifies no root access\n\t      is to be granted.  It is recommended that the rootdn only be\n\t      specified when needed (such as when initially populating a\n\t      database).  If the rootdn is within a namingContext (suffix) of\n\t      the database, a simple bind password may also be provided using\n\t      the olcRootPW directive. Note that the rootdn is always needed\n\t      when using syncrepl.  The olcRootDN of the cn=config database\n\t      defaults to cn=config itself.\n\n       olcRootPW: <password>\n\t      Specify a password (or hash of the password) for the rootdn.\n\t      The password can only be set if the rootdn is within the\n\t      namingContext (suffix) of the database.  This option accepts all\n\t      RFC 2307 userPassword formats known to the server (see\n\t      olcPasswordHash description) as well as cleartext.\n\t      slappasswd(8) may be used to generate a hash of a password.\n\t      Cleartext and {CRYPT} passwords are not recommended.  If empty\n\t      (the default), authentication of the root DN is by other means\n\t      (e.g. SASL).  Use of SASL is encouraged.\n\n       olcSubordinate: [TRUE | FALSE | advertise]\n\t      Specify that the current backend database is a subordinate of\n\t      another backend database. A subordinate  database may have only\n\t      one suffix. This option may be used to glue multiple databases\n\t      into a single namingContext.  If the suffix of the current\n\t      database is within the namingContext of a superior database,\n\t      searches against the superior database will be propagated to the\n\t      subordinate as well. All of the databases associated with a\n\t      single namingContext should have identical rootdns.  Behavior of\n\t      other LDAP operations is unaffected by this setting. In\n\t      particular, it is not possible to use moddn to move an entry\n\t      from one subordinate to another subordinate within the\n\t      namingContext.\n\n\t      If the optional advertise flag is supplied, the naming context\n\t      of this database is advertised in the root DSE. The default is\n\t      to hide this database context, so that only the superior context\n\t      is visible.\n\n\t      If the slap tools slapcat(8), slapadd(8), or slapindex(8) are\n\t      used on the superior database, any glued subordinates that\n\t      support these tools are opened as well.\n\n\t      Databases that are glued together should usually be configured\n\t      with the same indices (assuming they support indexing), even for\n\t      attributes that only exist in some of these databases. In\n\t      general, all of the glued databases should be configured as\n\t      similarly as possible, since the intent is to provide the\n\t      appearance of a single directory.\n\n\t      Note that the subordinate functionality is implemented\n\t      internally by the glue overlay and as such its behavior will\n\t      interact with other overlays in use. By default, the glue\n\t      overlay is automatically configured as the last overlay on the\n\t      superior database. Its position on the database can be\n\t      explicitly configured by setting an overlay glue directive at\n\t      the desired position. This explicit configuration is necessary\n\t      e.g.  when using the syncprov overlay, which needs to follow\n\t      glue in order to work over all of the glued databases. E.g.\n\t\t   dn: olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config\n\t\t   olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com\n\t\t   ...\n\n\t\t   dn: olcOverlay={0}glue,olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config\n\t\t   ...\n\n\t\t   dn: olcOverlay={1}syncprov,olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config\n\t\t   ...\n       See the Overlays section below for more details.\n\n       olcSuffix: <dn suffix>\n\t      Specify the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this\n\t      backend database.  Multiple suffix lines can be given and at\n\t      least one is required for each database definition.\n\n\t      If the suffix of one database is \"inside\" that of another, the\n\t      database with the inner suffix must come first in the\n\t      configuration file.  You may also want to glue such databases\n\t      together with the olcSubordinate attribute.\n\n       olcSyncUseSubentry: TRUE | FALSE\n\t      Store the syncrepl contextCSN in a subentry instead of the\n\t      context entry of the database. The subentry's RDN will be\n\t      \"cn=ldapsync\".

The replica content is kept synchronized to\n\t      the master content using the LDAP Content Synchronization\n\t      protocol. Refer to the \"OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide\" for\n\t      detailed information on setting up a replicated slapd directory\n\t      service using the syncrepl replication engine.\n\n\t      rid identifies the current syncrepl directive within the\n\t      replication consumer site.  It is a non-negative integer having\n\t      no more than three decimal digits.\n\n\t      provider specifies the replication provider site containing the\n\t      master content as an LDAP URI. If <port> is not given, the\n\t      standard LDAP port number (389 or 636) is used.\n\n\t      The content of the syncrepl replica is defined using a search\n\t      specification as its result set. The consumer slapd will send\n\t      search requests to the provider slapd according to the search\n\t      specification. The search specification includes searchbase,\n\t      scope, filter, attrs, attrsonly, sizelimit, and timelimit\n\t      parameters as in the normal search specification. The exattrs\n\t      option may also be used to specify attributes that should be\n\t      omitted from incoming entries.  The scope defaults to sub, the\n\t      filter defaults to (objectclass=*), and there is no default\n\t      searchbase. The attrs list defaults to \"*,+\" to return all user\n\t      and operational attributes, and attrsonly and exattrs are unset\n\t      by default.  The sizelimit and timelimit only accept \"unlimited\"\n\t      and positive integers, and both default to \"unlimited\".  Note,\n\t      however, that any provider-side limits for the replication\n\t      identity will be enforced by the provider regardless of the\n\t      limits requested by the LDAP Content Synchronization operation,\n\t      much like for any other search operation.\n\n\t      The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation\n\t      types.  In the refreshOnly operation, the next synchronization\n\t      search operation is periodically rescheduled at an interval time\n\t      (specified by interval parameter; 1 day by default) after each\n\t      synchronization operation finishes.  In the refreshAndPersist\n\t      operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the\n\t      provider slapd.  Further updates to the master replica will\n\t      generate searchResultEntry to the consumer slapd as the search\n\t      responses to the persistent synchronization search.\n\n\t      If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt\n\t      to reconnect according to the retry parameter which is a list of\n\t      the <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs.  For example,\n\t      retry=\"60 10 300 3\" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for\n\t      the first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next\n\t      3 times before stop retrying. The `+' in <# of retries> means\n\t      indefinite number of retries until success.\n\n\t      The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer\n\t      site by turning on the schemachecking parameter. The default is\n\t      off.\n\n\t      The network-timeout parameter sets how long the consumer will\n\t      wait to establish a network connection to the provider. Once a\n\t      connection is established, the timeout parameter determines how\n\t      long the consumer will wait for the initial Bind request to\n\t      complete. The defaults for these parameters come from\n\t      ldap.conf(5).\n\n\t      A bindmethod of simple requires the options binddn and\n\t      credentials and should only be used when adequate security\n\t      services (e.g. TLS or IPSEC) are in place.  A bindmethod of sasl\n\t      requires the option saslmech.  Depending on the mechanism, an\n\t      authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified\n\t      using authcid and credentials.  The authzid parameter may be\n\t      used to specify an authorization identity.  Specific security\n\t      properties (as with the sasl-secprops keyword above) for a SASL\n\t      bind can be set with the secprops option. A non default SASL\n\t      realm can be set with the realm option.  The provider, other\n\t      than allow authentication of the syncrepl identity, should grant\n\t      that identity appropriate access privileges to the data that is\n\t      being replicated (access directive), and appropriate time and\n\t      size limits (limits directive).\n\n\t      The keepalive parameter sets the values of idle, probes, and\n\t      interval used to check whether a socket is alive; idle is the\n\t      number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle before TCP\n\t      starts sending keepalive probes; probes is the maximum number of\n\t      keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection;\n\t      interval is interval in seconds between individual keepalive\n\t      probes.  Only some systems support the customization of these\n\t      values; the keepalive parameter is ignored otherwise, and\n\t      system-wide settings are used.\n\n\t      The starttls parameter specifies use of the StartTLS extended\n\t      operation to establish a TLS session before Binding to the\n\t      provider. If the critical argument is supplied, the session will\n\t      be aborted if the StartTLS request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl\n\t      session continues without TLS. The tls_reqcert setting defaults\n\t      to \"demand\" and the other TLS settings default to the same as\n\t      the main slapd TLS settings.\n\n\t      The suffixmassage parameter allows the consumer to pull entries\n\t      from a remote directory whose DN suffix differs from the local\n\t      directory. The portion of the remote entries' DNs that matches\n\t      the searchbase will be replaced with the suffixmassage DN.\n\n\t      Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query\n\t      logs of data modifications. This mode of operation is referred\n\t      to as delta syncrepl. In addition to the above parameters, the\n\t      logbase and logfilter parameters must be set appropriately for\n\t      the log that will be used. The syncdata parameter must be set to\n\t      either \"accesslog\" if the log conforms to the slapo-accesslog(5)\n\t      log format, or \"changelog\" if the log conforms to the obsolete\n\t      changelog format. If the syncdata parameter is omitted or set to\n\t      \"default\" then the log parameters are ignored.\n\n       olcUpdateDN: <dn>\n\t      This option is only applicable in a slave database.  It\n\t      specifies the DN permitted to update (subject to access\n\t      controls) the replica.  It is only needed in certain push-mode\n\t      replication scenarios.  Generally, this DN should not be the\n\t      same as the rootdn used at the master.\n\n       olcUpdateRef: <url>\n\t      Specify the referral to pass back when slapd(8) is asked to\n\t      modify a replicated local database.  If multiple values are\n\t      specified, each url is provided."

Overlays are pushed onto a stack over\n       the database, and so they will execute in the reverse of the order in\n       which they were configured and the database itself will receive control\n       last of all.\n\n       Overlays must be configured as child entries of a specific database.\n       The entry's RDN must be of the form olcOverlay={x}<overlaytype> and the\n       entry must have the olcOverlayConfig objectClass. Normally the config\n       engine generates the \"{x}\" index in the RDN automatically, so it can be\n       omitted when initially loading these entries.\n\n       See the slapd.overlays(5) manual page for an overview of available\n       overlays.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Here is a short example of a configuration in LDIF suitable for use\n       with slapadd(8) :\n\n\t      dn: cn=config\n\t      objectClass: olcGlobal\n\t      cn: config\n\t      olcPidFile: /var/db/openldap/run/slapd.pid\n\t      olcAttributeOptions: x-hidden lang-\n\n\t      dn: cn=schema,cn=config\n\t      objectClass: olcSchemaConfig\n\t      cn: schema\n\n\t      include: /etc/openldap/schema/core.ldif\n\n\t      dn: olcDatabase=frontend,cn=config\n\t      objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig\n\t      objectClass: olcFrontendConfig\n\t      olcDatabase: frontend\n\t      # Subtypes of \"name\" (e.g. \"cn\" and \"ou\") with the\n\t      # option \";x-hidden\" can be searched for/compared,\n\t      # but are not shown.
