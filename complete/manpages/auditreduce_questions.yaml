Matching audit records are printed to the\n     standard output in their raw binary form.\tIf no file argument is\n     specified, the standard input is used by default.\tUse the praudit(1)\n     utility to print the selected audit records in human-readable form.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -A      Select all records.\n\n     -a YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]\n\t     Select records that occurred after or on the given datetime.\n\n     -b YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]\n\t     Select records that occurred before the given datetime."
