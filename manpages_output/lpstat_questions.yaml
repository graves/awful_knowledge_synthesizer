When run with no arguments, lpstat will list active jobs\n       queued by the current user.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The lpstat command supports the following options:\n\n       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.\n\n       -H   Shows the server hostname and port.\n\n       -R   Shows the ranking of print jobs.\n\n       -U username\n\t    Specifies an alternate username.\n\n       -W which-jobs\n\t    Specifies which jobs to show, \"completed\" or \"not-completed\" (the\n\t    default).  This option must appear before the -o option and/or any\n\t    printer names, otherwise the default (\"not-completed\") value will\n\t    be used in the request to the scheduler."
