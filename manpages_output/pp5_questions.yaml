However, when multiple programs\n       are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the\n       same basename as $0 (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If nothing\n       matches, it dies with the error \"Can't open perl script \"$0\"\".\n\nOPTIONS\n       Options are available in a short form and a long form.  For example,\n       the three lines below are all equivalent:\n\n\t   % pp -o output.exe input.pl\n\t   % pp --output output.exe input.pl\n\t   % pp --output=output.exe input.pl\n\n       Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the\n       limits imposed by some shells, it is possible to have pp read some of\n       its options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just\n       include an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will\n       be interpreted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options\n       and @file options is possible. This is implemented using the\n       Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.\n\n       -a, --addfile=FILE|DIR\n\t   Add an extra file into the package.\tIf the file is a directory,\n\t   recursively add all files inside that directory, with links turned\n\t   into actual files.\n\n\t   By default, files are placed under \"/\" inside the package with\n\t   their original names.  You may override this by appending the\n\t   target filename after a \";\", like this:\n\n\t       % pp -a \"old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt\"\n\t       % pp -a \"old_dirname;new_dirname\"\n\n\t   You may specify \"-a\" multiple times.\n\n       -A, --addlist=FILE\n\t   Read a list of file/directory names from FILE, adding them into the\n\t   package.  Each line in FILE is taken as an argument to -a above.\n\n\t   You may specify \"-A\" multiple times.\n\n       -B, --bundle\n\t   Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is\n\t   enabled by default, except when \"-p\" or \"-P\" is specified.\n\n\t   Since PAR version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the\n\t   list of module search paths @INC before running the contained\n\t   script.\n\n       -C, --clean\n\t   Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.\n\t   By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this\n\t   allows the program to start up faster next time.\n\n       -c, --compile\n\t   Run \"perl -c inputfile\" to determine additional run-time\n\t   dependencies.\n\n       -cd, --cachedeps=FILE\n\t   Use FILE to cache detected dependencies. Creates FILE unless\n\t   present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent\n\t   runs.\n\n       -d, --dependent\n\t   Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl\n\t   interpreter.  Executables built this way will need a separate\n\t   perl5x.dll or libperl.so to function correctly.  This option is\n\t   only available if perl is built as a shared library.\n\n       -e, --eval=STRING\n\t   Package a one-liner, much the same as \"perl -e '...'\"\n\n       -E, --evalfeature=STRING\n\t   Behaves just like \"-e\", except that it implicitly enables all\n\t   optional features (in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and\n\t   later.  See feature.\n\n       -x, --execute\n\t   Run \"perl inputfile\" to determine additional run-time dependencies.\n\n\t   Using this option, pp may be able to detect the use of modules that\n\t   can't be determined by static analysis of \"inputfile\". Examples are\n\t   stuff loaded by run-time loaders like Module::Runtime or \"plugin\"\n\t   loaders like Module::Loader. Note that which modules are detected\n\t   depends on which parts of your program are exercised when running\n\t   \"inputfile\". E.g. if your program immediately terminates when run\n\t   as \"perl inputfile\" because it lacks mandatory arguments, then this\n\t   option will probably have no effect. You may use --xargs to supply\n\t   arguments in this case.\n\n       --xargs=STRING\n\t   If -x is given, splits the \"STRING\" using the function \"shellwords\"\n\t   from Text::ParseWords and passes the result as @ARGV when running\n\t   \"perl inputfile\".\n\n       -X, --exclude=MODULE\n\t   Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from\n\t   the package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable,\n\t   all the files in the given file (except MANIFEST, META.yml and\n\t   script/*) will be excluded and the output file will \"use\" the given\n\t   file at runtime.\n\n       -f, --filter=FILTER\n\t   Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may\n\t   specify multiple such filters.\n\n\t   If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will\n\t   do:\n\n\t       % pp -f Bleach source.pl\n\n\t   If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should\n\t   have a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure\n\t   you understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!\n\n       -g, --gui\n\t   Build an executable that does not have a console window. This\n\t   option is ignored on non-MSWin32 platforms or when \"-p\" is\n\t   specified.\n\n       -h, --help\n\t   Show basic usage information.\n\n       -I, --lib=DIR\n\t   Add the given directory to the perl module search path.  May be\n\t   specified multiple times.\n\n       -l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY\n\t   Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or DLL) into the\n\t   packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.  \"-l\n\t   ncurses\" means the same thing as \"-l libncurses.so\" or \"-l\n\t   /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so\" in most Unixes.  May be specified\n\t   multiple times.\n\n       -L, --log=FILE\n\t   Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.\n\n       -F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],\n\t   Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.\tYou\n\t   may specify multiple such filters.\n\n\t   By default, the PodStrip filter is applied.\tIn case that causes\n\t   trouble, you can turn this off by setting the environment variable\n\t   \"PAR_VERBATIM\" to 1.\n\n\t   Since PAR 0.958, you can use an optional regular expression (REGEX\n\t   above) to select the files in the archive which should be filtered.\n\t   Example:\n\n\t     pp -o foo.exe -F Bleach=warnings\\.pm$ foo.pl\n\n\t   This creates a binary executable foo.exe from foo.pl packaging all\n\t   files as usual except for files ending in \"warnings.pm\" which are\n\t   filtered with PAR::Filter::Bleach.\n\n       -M, --module=MODULE\n\t   Add the specified module into the package, along with its\n\t   dependencies.\n\n\t   The following variants may be used to add whole module namespaces:\n\n\t   -M Foo::**\n\t       Add every module in the \"Foo\" namespace except \"Foo\" itself,\n\t       i.e.  add \"Foo::Bar\", \"Foo::Bar::Quux\" etc up to any depth.\n\n\t   -M Foo::*\n\t       Add every module at level 1 in the \"Foo\" namespace, i.e.  add\n\t       \"Foo::Bar\", but neither \"Foo::Bar::Quux\" nor \"Foo\".\n\n\t   -M Foo::\n\t       Shorthand for \"-M Foo -M Foo:**\": every module in the \"Foo\"\n\t       namespace including \"Foo\" itself.\n\n\t   Instead of a module name, MODULE may also be specified as a\n\t   filename relative to the @INC path, i.e.  \"-M Module/ScanDeps.pm\"\n\t   means the same thing as \"-M Module::ScanDeps\".\n\n\t   If MODULE has an extension that is not \".pm\"/\".ix\"/\".al\", it will\n\t   not be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under \"/\"\n\t   instead of \"/lib/\" inside the PAR file.  This use is deprecated --\n\t   consider using the -a option instead.\n\n\t   You may specify \"-M\" multiple times.\n\n       -m, --multiarch\n\t   Build a multi-architecture PAR file.  Implies -p.\n\n       -n, --noscan\n\t   Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time\n\t   dependencies from -c or -x exclusively.\n\n       -N, --namespace=NAMESPACE\n\t   Add all modules in the namespace into the package, along with their\n\t   dependencies. If \"NAMESPACE\" is something like \"Foo::Bar\" then this\n\t   will add all modules \"Foo/Bar/Quux.pm\", \"Foo/Bar/Fred/Barnie.pm\"\n\t   etc that can be located in your module search path. It mimics the\n\t   behaviour of \"plugin\" loaders like Module::Loader.\n\n\t   This is different from using \"-M Foo::Bar::\", as the latter insists\n\t   on adding \"Foo/Bar.pm\" which might not exist in the above \"plugin\"\n\t   scenario.\n\n\t   You may specify \"-N\" multiple times.\n\n       -o, --output=FILE\n\t   File name for the final packaged executable.\n\n       -p, --par\n\t   Create PAR archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.\n\n       -P, --perlscript\n\t   Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone\n\t   binary.\n\n       -r, --run\n\t   Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.\n\n       --reusable\n\t   EXPERIMENTAL\n\n\t   Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary,\n\t   external Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:\n\n\t     pp -o myapp --reusable someapp.pl\n\t     ./myapp --par-options --reuse otherapp.pl\n\n\t   The second line will run otherapp.pl instead of someapp.pl.\n\n       -S, --save\n\t   Do not delete generated PAR file after packaging.\n\n       -s, --sign\n\t   Cryptographically sign the generated PAR or binary file using\n\t   Module::Signature.\n\n       -T, --tempcache\n\t   Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is\n\t   used if the program is run without -C. If not set, a hash of the\n\t   executable is used.\n\n\t   When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary\n\t   directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly\n\t   /tmp/par-USER/cache-XXXXXXX.  USER is replaced by the name of the\n\t   user running the program, but \"spelled\" in hex.  XXXXXXX is either\n\t   a hash of the executable or the value passed to the \"-T\" or\n\t   \"--tempcache\" switch.\n\n       -u, --unicode\n\t   Package Unicode support (essentially utf8_heavy.pl and everything\n\t   below the directory unicore in your perl library).\n\n\t   This option exists because it is impossible to detect using static\n\t   analysis if your program needs Unicode support at runtime. (Note:\n\t   If your program contains \"use utf8\" this does not imply it needs\n\t   Unicode support. It merely says that your program is written in\n\t   UTF-8.)\n\n\t   If your packed program exits with an error message like\n\n\t     Can't locate utf8_heavy.pl in @INC (@INC contains: ...)\n\n\t   try to pack it with \"-u\" (or use \"-x\").\n\n       -v, --verbose[=NUMBER]\n\t   Increase verbosity of output; NUMBER is an integer from 1 to 3, 3\n\t   being the most verbose.  Defaults to 1 if specified without an\n\t   argument.  Alternatively, -vv sets verbose level to 2, and -vvv\n\t   sets it to 3.\n\n       -V, --version\n\t   Display the version number and copyrights of this program.\n\n       -z, --compress=NUMBER\n\t   Set zip compression level; NUMBER is an integer from 0 to 9, 0 = no\n\t   compression, 9 = max compression.  Defaults to 6 if -z is not used.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n       PP_OPTS\n\t   Command-line options (switches).  Switches in this variable are\n\t   taken as if they were on every pp command line.\n\nNOTES\n       Here are some recipes showing how to utilize pp to bundle source.pl\n       with all its dependencies, on target machines with different expected\n       settings:\n\n       Stone-alone setup:\n\t   To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a machine\n\t   that doesn't have perl installed:\n\n\t       % pp -o packed.exe source.pl\t   # makes packed.exe\n\t       # Now, deploy 'packed.exe' to target machine...\n\t       $ packed.exe\t\t\t   # run it\n\n       Perl interpreter only, without core modules:\n\t   To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable for\n\t   running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where you\n\t   want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that your\n\t   program uses:\n\n\t       % pp -B -P -o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl\n\t       # Now, deploy 'packed.pl' to target machine...\n\t       $ perl packed.pl \t\t   # run it\n\n       Perl with core modules installed:\n\t   To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the\n\t   target machine's perl interpreter and its core libraries.  This\n\t   produces a significantly smaller file than the previous version:\n\n\t       % pp -P -o packed.pl source.pl\t   # makes packed.pl\n\t       # Now, deploy 'packed.pl' to target machine...\n\t       $ perl packed.pl \t\t   # run it\n\n       Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:\n\t   Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive.

But even in this case, the\n       underlying system libraries such as libc must be compatible between the\n       host and target machines.  Use \"--dependent\" if you are willing to ship\n       the shared library with the application, which can significantly reduce\n       the executable size.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       tkpp, par.pl, parl, perlcc\n\n       PAR, PAR::Packer, Module::ScanDeps\n\n       Getopt::Long, Getopt::ArgvFile\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n       Simon Cozens, Tom Christiansen and Edward Peschko for writing perlcc;\n       this program try to mimic its interface as close as possible, and\n       copied liberally from their code.\n\n       Jan Dubois for writing the exetype.pl utility, which has been partially\n       adapted into the \"-g\" flag.\n\n       Mattia Barbon for providing the \"myldr\" binary loader code.\n\n       Jeff Goff for suggesting the name pp.\n\nAUTHORS\n       Audrey Tang <cpan@audreyt.org>, Steffen Mueller <smueller@cpan.org>\n       Roderich Schupp <rschupp@cpan.org>\n\n       You can write to the mailing list at <par@perl.org>, or send an empty\n       mail to <par-subscribe@perl.org> to participate in the discussion.\n\n       Please submit bug reports to <bug-par-packer@rt.cpan.org>.\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright 2002-2009 by Audrey Tang <cpan@audreyt.org>.\n\n       Neither this program nor the associated parl program impose any\n       licensing restrictions on files generated by their execution, in\n       accordance with the 8th article of the Artistic License:\n\n\t   \"Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is\n\t   always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded;\n\t   that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's\n\t   interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.\n\t   Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\"\n\n       Therefore, you are absolutely free to place any license on the\n       resulting executable, as long as the packed 3rd-party libraries are\n       also available under the Artistic License.\n\n       This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n       under the same terms as Perl itself.\n\n       See LICENSE.\n\nperl v5.34.0\t\t\t  2020-03-08\t\t\t\t pp(3)"
