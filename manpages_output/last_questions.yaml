Each line of output contains the user name, the\n     tty from which the session was conducted, any hostname, the start and\n     stop times for the session, and the duration of the session.  If the\n     session is still continuing or was cut short by a crash or shutdown, last\n     will so indicate.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     --libxo\t Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different\n\t\t human and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for\n\t\t details on command line arguments.\n\n     -d date\t Specify the snapshot date and time.  All users logged in at\n\t\t the snapshot date and time will be reported.  This may be\n\t\t used with the -f option to derive the results from stored\n\t\t utx.log files.  When this argument is provided, all other\n\t\t options except for -f and -n are ignored.  The argument\n\t\t should be in the form [[CC]YY][MMDD]hhmm[.SS] where each pair\n\t\t of letters represents the following:"
