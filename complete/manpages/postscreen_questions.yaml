One postscreen(8) process handles multiple\n       inbound SMTP connections, and decides which clients may talk to a\n       Postfix SMTP server process.  By keeping spambots away, postscreen(8)\n       leaves more SMTP server processes available for legitimate clients, and\n       delays the onset of server overload conditions.\n\n       This program should not be used on SMTP ports that receive mail from\n       end-user clients (MUAs). In a typical deployment, postscreen(8) handles\n       the MX service on TCP port 25, and smtpd(8) receives mail from MUAs on\n       the submission service (TCP port 587) which requires client\n       authentication.\tAlternatively, a site could set up a dedicated,\n       non-postscreen, \"port 25\" server that provides submission service and\n       client authentication, but no MX service.\n\n       postscreen(8) maintains a temporary whitelist for clients that have\n       passed a number of tests.  When an SMTP client IP address is\n       whitelisted, postscreen(8) hands off the connection immediately to a\n       Postfix SMTP server process. This minimizes the overhead for legitimate\n       mail.\n\n       By default, postscreen(8) logs statistics and hands off each connection\n       to a Postfix SMTP server process, while excluding clients in mynetworks\n       from all tests (primarily, to avoid problems with non-standard SMTP\n       implementations in network appliances).\tThis default mode blocks no\n       clients, and is useful for non-destructive testing.\n\n       In a typical production setting, postscreen(8) is configured to reject\n       mail from clients that fail one or more tests. postscreen(8) logs\n       rejected mail with the client address, helo, sender and recipient\n       information.\n\n       postscreen(8) is not an SMTP proxy; this is intentional.  The purpose\n       is to keep spambots away from Postfix SMTP server processes, while\n       minimizing overhead for legitimate traffic.\n\nSECURITY\n       The postscreen(8) server is moderately security-sensitive.  It talks to\n       untrusted clients on the network. The process can be run chrooted at\n       fixed low privilege.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 821 (SMTP protocol)\n       RFC 1123 (Host requirements)\n       RFC 1652 (8bit-MIME transport)\n       RFC 1869 (SMTP service extensions)\n       RFC 1870 (Message Size Declaration)\n       RFC 1985 (ETRN command)\n       RFC 2034 (SMTP Enhanced Status Codes)\n       RFC 2821 (SMTP protocol)\n       Not: RFC 2920 (SMTP Pipelining)\n       RFC 3207 (STARTTLS command)\n       RFC 3461 (SMTP DSN Extension)\n       RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)\n       RFC 5321 (SMTP protocol, including multi-line 220 banners)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\nBUGS\n       The postscreen(8) built-in SMTP protocol engine currently does not\n       announce support for AUTH, XCLIENT or XFORWARD.\tIf you need to make\n       these services available on port 25, then do not enable the optional\n       \"after 220 server greeting\" tests.\n\n       The optional \"after 220 server greeting\" tests may result in unexpected\n       delivery delays from senders that retry email delivery from a different\n       IP address.  Reason: after passing these tests a new client must\n       disconnect, and reconnect from the same IP address before it can\n       deliver mail. See POSTSCREEN_README, section \"Tests after the 220 SMTP\n       server greeting\", for a discussion.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically, as postscreen(8)\n       processes may run for several hours.  Use the command \"postfix reload\"\n       after a configuration change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\n       NOTE: Some postscreen(8) parameters implement stress-dependent\n       behavior.  This is supported only when the default parameter value is\n       stress-dependent (that is, it looks like ${stress?{X}:{Y}}, or it is\n       the $name of an smtpd parameter with a stress-dependent default).\n       Other parameters always evaluate as if the stress parameter value is\n       the empty string.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY CONTROLS\n\n       postscreen_command_filter ($smtpd_command_filter)\n\t      A mechanism to transform commands from remote SMTP clients.\n\n       postscreen_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps\n       ($smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps)\n\t      Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP client address, with\n\t      case insensitive lists of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls,\n\t      auth, etc.) that the postscreen(8) server will not send in the\n\t      EHLO response to a remote SMTP client.\n\n       postscreen_discard_ehlo_keywords ($smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords)\n\t      A case insensitive list of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls,\n\t      auth, etc.) that the postscreen(8) server will not send in the\n\t      EHLO response to a remote SMTP client.\n\n       Available in Postfix version 3.1 and later:\n\n       dns_ncache_ttl_fix_enable (no)\n\t      Enable a workaround for future libc incompatibility.\n\nTROUBLE SHOOTING CONTROLS\n\n       postscreen_expansion_filter (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      List of characters that are permitted in\n\t      postscreen_reject_footer attribute expansions.\n\n       postscreen_reject_footer ($smtpd_reject_footer)\n\t      Optional information that is appended after a 4XX or 5XX\n\t      postscreen(8) server response.\n\n       soft_bounce (no)\n\t      Safety net to keep mail queued that would otherwise be returned\n\t      to the sender.\n\nBEFORE-POSTSCREEN PROXY AGENT\n       Available in Postfix version 2.10 and later:\n\n       postscreen_upstream_proxy_protocol (empty)\n\t      The name of the proxy protocol used by an optional\n\t      before-postscreen proxy agent.\n\n       postscreen_upstream_proxy_timeout (5s)\n\t      The time limit for the proxy protocol specified with the\n\t      postscreen_upstream_proxy_protocol parameter.\n\nPERMANENT WHITE/BLACKLIST TEST\n       This test is executed immediately after a remote SMTP client connects.\n       If a client is permanently whitelisted, the client will be handed off\n       immediately to a Postfix SMTP server process.\n\n       postscreen_access_list (permit_mynetworks)\n\t      Permanent white/blacklist for remote SMTP client IP addresses.\n\n       postscreen_blacklist_action (ignore)\n\t      The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client is\n\t      permanently blacklisted with the postscreen_access_list\n\t      parameter.\n\nMAIL EXCHANGER POLICY TESTS\n       When postscreen(8) is configured to monitor all primary and backup MX\n       addresses, it can refuse to whitelist clients that connect to a backup\n       MX address only. For small sites, this requires configuring primary and\n       backup MX addresses on the same MTA. Larger sites would have to share\n       the postscreen(8) cache between primary and backup MTAs, which would\n       introduce a common point of failure.\n\n       postscreen_whitelist_interfaces (static:all)\n\t      A list of local postscreen(8) server IP addresses where a\n\t      non-whitelisted remote SMTP client can obtain postscreen(8)'s\n\t      temporary whitelist status.\n\nBEFORE 220 GREETING TESTS\n       These tests are executed before the remote SMTP client receives the\n       \"220 servername\" greeting. If no tests remain after the successful\n       completion of this phase, the client will be handed off immediately to\n       a Postfix SMTP server process.\n\n       dnsblog_service_name (dnsblog)\n\t      The name of the dnsblog(8) service entry in master.cf.\n\n       postscreen_dnsbl_action (ignore)\n\t      The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client's\n\t      combined DNSBL score is equal to or greater than a threshold (as\n\t      defined with the postscreen_dnsbl_sites and\n\t      postscreen_dnsbl_threshold parameters).\n\n       postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map (empty)\n\t      A mapping from actual DNSBL domain name which includes a secret\n\t      password, to the DNSBL domain name that postscreen will reply\n\t      with when it rejects mail.\n\n       postscreen_dnsbl_sites (empty)\n\t      Optional list of DNS white/blacklist domains, filters and weight\n\t      factors.\n\n       postscreen_dnsbl_threshold (1)\n\t      The inclusive lower bound for blocking a remote SMTP client,\n\t      based on its combined DNSBL score as defined with the\n\t      postscreen_dnsbl_sites parameter.\n\n       postscreen_greet_action (ignore)\n\t      The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client\n\t      speaks before its turn within the time specified with the\n\t      postscreen_greet_wait parameter.\n\n       postscreen_greet_banner ($smtpd_banner)\n\t      The text in the optional \"220-text...\" server response that\n\t      postscreen(8) sends ahead of the real Postfix SMTP server's \"220\n\t      text...\" response, in an attempt to confuse bad SMTP clients so\n\t      that they speak before their turn (pre-greet).\n\n       postscreen_greet_wait (normal: 6s, overload: 2s)\n\t      The amount of time that postscreen(8) will wait for an SMTP\n\t      client to send a command before its turn, and for DNS blocklist\n\t      lookup results to arrive (default: up to 2 seconds under stress,\n\t      up to 6 seconds otherwise).\n\n       smtpd_service_name (smtpd)\n\t      The internal service that postscreen(8) hands off allowed\n\t      connections to.\n\n       Available in Postfix version 2.11 and later:\n\n       postscreen_dnsbl_whitelist_threshold (0)\n\t      Allow a remote SMTP client to skip \"before\" and \"after 220\n\t      greeting\" protocol tests, based on its combined DNSBL score as\n\t      defined with the postscreen_dnsbl_sites parameter.\n\n       Available in Postfix version 3.0 and later:\n\n       postscreen_dnsbl_timeout (10s)\n\t      The time limit for DNSBL or DNSWL lookups.\n\nAFTER 220 GREETING TESTS\n       These tests are executed after the remote SMTP client receives the \"220\n       servername\" greeting. If a client passes all tests during this phase,\n       it will receive a 4XX response to all RCPT TO commands.
