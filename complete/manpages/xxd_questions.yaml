It can also\n       convert a hex dump back to its original binary form.  Like uuencode(1)\n       and uudecode(1) it allows the transmission of binary data in a `mail-\n       safe' ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to\n       standard output.  Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file\n       patching.\n\nOPTIONS\n       If no infile is given, standard input is read.  If infile is specified\n       as a `-' character, then input is taken from standard input.  If no\n       outfile is given (or a `-' character is in its place), results are sent\n       to standard output.\n\n       Note that a \"lazy\" parser is used which does not check for more than\n       the first option letter, unless the option is followed by a parameter.\n       Spaces between a single option letter and its parameter are optional.\n       Parameters to options can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal or octal\n       notation.  Thus -c8, -c 8, -c 010 and -cols 8 are all equivalent."

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `xxd`.



    Manpage text:

    Hex dump from file position 0x480 (=1024+128) onwards.  The `+' sign
           means "relative to the current position", thus the `128' adds to the 1k
           where dd left off.
           % sh -c "dd of=plain_snippet bs=1k count=1; xxd -s +128 > hex_snippet"
           < file

           Hex dump from file position 0x100 (=1024-768) onwards.
           % sh -c "dd of=plain_snippet bs=1k count=1; xxd -s +-768 > hex_snippet"
           < file

           However, this is a rare situation and the use of `+' is rarely needed.
           The author prefers to monitor the effect of xxd with strace(1) or
           truss(1), whenever -s is used.

    EXAMPLES
           Print everything but the first three lines (hex 0x30 bytes) of file.
           % xxd -s 0x30 file

           Print 3 lines (hex 0x30 bytes) from the end of file.
           % xxd -s -0x30 file

           Note: The results of the examples below are relevant to the xxd.1 man
