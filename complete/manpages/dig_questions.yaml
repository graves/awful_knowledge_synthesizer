It performs\n       DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name\n       server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to\n       troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and\n       clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality\n       than dig.\n\n       Although dig is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has\n       a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A\n       brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when\n       the -h option is given. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9\n       implementation of dig allows multiple lookups to be issued from the\n       command line."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dig`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n+[no]tcp\n\t   Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. The default\n\t   behavior is to use UDP unless an ixfr=N query is requested, in\n\t   which case the default is TCP. AXFR queries always use TCP.\n\n       +time=T\n\t   Sets the timeout for a query to T seconds. The default timeout is 5\n\t   seconds. An attempt to set T to less than 1 will result in a query\n\t   timeout of 1 second being applied.\n\n       +[no]topdown\n\t   When chasing DNSSEC signature chains perform a top-down validation.\n\t   Requires dig be compiled with -DDIG_SIGCHASE. This feature is\n\t   deprecated. Use delv instead.\n\n       +[no]trace\n\t   Toggle tracing of the delegation path from the root name servers\n\t   for the name being looked up. Tracing is disabled by default. When\n\t   tracing is enabled, dig makes iterative queries to resolve the name\n\t   being looked up. It will follow referrals from the root servers,\n\t   showing the answer from each server that was used to resolve the\n\t   lookup.\n\n\t   If @server is also specified, it affects only the initial query for\n\t   the root zone name servers."

This alternate\n\t   syntax to +[no]tcp is provided for backwards compatibility. The\n\t   \"vc\" stands for \"virtual circuit\".\n\nMULTIPLE QUERIES\n       The BIND 9 implementation of dig  supports specifying multiple queries\n       on the command line (in addition to supporting the -f batch file\n       option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of\n       flags, options and query options."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dig`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIn this case, each query argument represent an individual query in the\n       command-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of the\n       standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query\n       type and class and any query options that should be applied to that\n       query.\n\n       A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries,\n       can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the first\n       tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied\n       on the command line. Any global query options (except the +[no]cmd\n       option) can be overridden by a query-specific set of query options. For\n       example:\n\n\t   dig +qr www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr\n\n       shows how dig could be used from the command line to make three\n       lookups: an ANY query for www.isc.org, a reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1\n       and a query for the NS records of isc.org. A global query option of +qr\n       is applied, so that dig shows the initial query it made for each\n       lookup. The final query has a local query option of +noqr which means\n       that dig will not print the initial query when it looks up the NS\n       records for isc.org."
