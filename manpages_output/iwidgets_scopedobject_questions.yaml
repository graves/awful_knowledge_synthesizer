The default is {}.\n\n       Name:\t enterscopecommand:\n       Command-Line Switch:\t-enterscopecommand\n\n\t      Specifies a Tcl command to invoke when an object exits scope\n\t      (i.e. when it is deleted..). The default is {}.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The scopedobject command creates a base class for defining Itcl classes\n       which posses scoped behavior like Tcl variables.  The objects are only\n       accessible within the procedure in which they are instantiated and are\n       deleted when the procedure returns.  This class was designed to be a\n       general purpose base class for supporting scoped incr Tcl classes.  The\n       options include the execute a Tcl script command when an object enters\n       and exits its scope.\n\nMETHODS\n       The scopedobject command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       object.\tIt has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for scopedobject objects:\n\nOBJECT-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      scopedobject command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the object.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName.  If option is specified with no\n\t      value, then the command returns a list describing the one named\n\t      option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist\n\t      of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one or\n\t      more option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies\n\t      the given objects option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this\n\t      case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have any\n\t      of the values accepted by the scopedobject command.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\t      The scopedobject was primarily meant to be a base class.\tThe\n\t      following is an example of usage without inheritance:\n\n\n\t\tproc scopedobject_demo {} {\n\t\t  iwidgets::scopedobject #auto\t       -exitscopecommand {puts \"enter scopedobject_demo\"}\t  -exitscopecommand {puts \"exit scopedobject_demo\"}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tscopedobject_demo"
