Each\n       element argument will become a separate element of the new list.  If\n       index is less than or equal to zero, then the new elements are inserted\n       at the beginning of the list.  The interpretation of the index value is │\n       the same as for the command string index, supporting simple index       │\n       arithmetic and indices relative to the end of the list.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       Putting some values into a list, first indexing from the start and then\n       indexing from the end, and then chaining them together:\n\t      set oldList {the fox jumps over the dog}\n\t      set midList [linsert $oldList 1 quick]\n\t      set newList [linsert $midList end-1 lazy]\n\t      # The old lists still exist though...\n\t      set newerList [linsert [linsert $oldList end-1 quick] 1 lazy]"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the linsert command in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the linsert command to insert the element 'slow' at position 2 in the list {the cat sat on the mat}?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using linsert to insert elements 'lazy' and 'slow' at position 3 of the list {the dog runs fast}?
