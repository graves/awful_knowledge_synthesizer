Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package implements the converter from parsing expression grammars\n       to CPARAM markup.\n\n       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools, and\n       can be used either directly with the other packages of this layer, or\n       indirectly through the export manager provided by pt::peg::export. The\n       latter is intented for use in untrusted environments and done through\n       the corresponding export plugin pt::peg::export::cparam sitting between\n       converter and export manager.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       Converter API found in the Parser Tools Export API specification.\n\n       pt::peg::to::cparam reset\n\t      This command resets the configuration of the package to its\n\t      default settings.\n\n       pt::peg::to::cparam configure\n\t      This command returns a dictionary containing the current\n\t      configuration of the package.\n\n       pt::peg::to::cparam configure option\n\t      This command returns the current value of the specified\n\t      configuration option of the package. For the set of legal\n\t      options, please read the section Options.\n\n       pt::peg::to::cparam configure option value...\n\t      This command sets the given configuration options of the\n\t      package, to the specified values. For the set of legal options,\n\t      please read the section Options.\n\n       pt::peg::to::cparam convert serial\n\t      This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing\n\t      expression grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization\n\t      format, and contained in serial, and generates CPARAM markup\n\t      encoding the grammar, per the current package configuration.\n\t      The created string is then returned as the result of the\n\t      command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The converter to C code recognizes the following configuration\n       variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -template string\n\t      The value of this option is a string into which to put the\n\t      generated text and the other configuration settings. The various\n\t      locations for user-data are expected to be specified with the\n\t      placeholders listed below.

In\n\t      essence type and argument name.  The default value is the string\n\t      RDE_PARAM p.\n\n       -state-ref string\n\t      A C string representing the argument named used in the generated\n\t      parsing functions to refer to the parsing state.\tThe default\n\t      value is the string p.\n\n       -self-command string\n\t      A C string representing the reference needed to call the\n\t      generated parser function (methods ...) from another parser\n\t      fonction, per the chosen framework (template).  The default\n\t      value is the empty string.\n\n       -fun-qualifier string\n\t      A C string containing the attributes to give to the generated\n\t      functions (methods ...), per the chosen framework (template).\n\t      The default value is static.\n\n       -namespace string\n\t      The name of the C namespace the parser functions (methods, ...)\n\t      shall reside in, or a general prefix to add to the function\n\t      names.  The default value is the empty string.\n\n       -main string\n\t      The name of the main function (method, ...) to be called by the\n\t      chosen framework (template) to start parsing input.  The default\n\t      value is __main.\n\n       -string-varname string\n\t      The name of the variable used for the table of strings used by\n\t      the generated parser, i.e. error messages, symbol names, etc.\n\t      The default value is p_string.\n\n       -prelude string\n\t      A snippet of code to be inserted at the head of each generated\n\t      parsing function.  The default value is the empty string.\n\n       -indent integer\n\t      The number of characters to indent each line of the generated\n\t      code by.\tThe default value is 0.\n\n       While the high parameterizability of this converter, as shown by the\n       multitude of options it supports, is an advantage to the advanced user,\n       allowing her to customize the output of the converter as needed, a\n       novice user will likely not see the forest for the trees.\n\n       To help these latter users an adjunct package is provided, containing a\n       canned configuration which will generate immediately useful full\n       parsers. It is\n\n       pt::cparam::configuration::critcl\n\t      Generated parsers are embedded into a Critcl-based framework.\n\nC/PARAM CODE REPRESENTATION OF PARSING EXPRESSION GRAMMARS\n       The c format is executable code, a parser for the grammar. The parser\n       implementation is written in C and can be tweaked to the users' needs\n       through a multitude of options.\n\n       The critcl format, for example, is implemented as a canned\n       configuration of these options on top of the generator for c.\n\n       The bulk of such a framework has to be specified through the option\n       -template. The additional options\n\n       -fun-qualifier string\n\n       -indent integer\n\n       -main string\n\n       -namespace string\n\n       -prelude string\n\n       -self-command string\n\n       -state-decl string\n\n       -state-ref string\n\n       -string-varname string\n\n       provide code snippets which help to glue framework and generated code\n       together. Their placeholders are in the generated code.\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       We are forgoing an example of this representation, with apologies.  It\n       would be way to large for this document.\n\nPEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize\n       Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport,\n       comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       PEG may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of\n       them will be canonical.\n\n       regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.\n\n\t      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and\n\t\t     its value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.\n\n\t      [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding\n\t\t     the set of nonterminal symbols and the starting\n\t\t     expression. The relevant keys and their values are\n\n\t\t     rules  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the\n\t\t\t    names of the nonterminal symbols known to the\n\t\t\t    grammar.\n\n\t\t\t    [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only\n\t\t\t\t   once.\n\n\t\t\t    [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal\n\t\t\t\t   symbol.\n\n\t\t\t    [3]    The value for each symbol is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary itself. The relevant keys and\n\t\t\t\t   their values in this dictionary are\n\n\t\t\t\t   is\t  The value is the serialization of\n\t\t\t\t\t  the parsing expression describing\n\t\t\t\t\t  the symbols sentennial structure, as\n\t\t\t\t\t  specified in the section PE\n\t\t\t\t\t  serialization format.\n\n\t\t\t\t   mode   The value can be one of three values\n\t\t\t\t\t  specifying how a parser should\n\t\t\t\t\t  handle the semantic value produced\n\t\t\t\t\t  by the symbol.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  value  The semantic value of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t nonterminal symbol is an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t abstract syntax tree\n\t\t\t\t\t\t consisting of a single node\n\t\t\t\t\t\t node for the nonterminal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t itself, which has the ASTs of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t the symbol's right hand side\n\t\t\t\t\t\t as its children.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  leaf\t The semantic value of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t nonterminal symbol is an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t abstract syntax tree\n\t\t\t\t\t\t consisting of a single node\n\t\t\t\t\t\t node for the nonterminal,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t without any children. Any\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ASTs generated by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t symbol's right hand side are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t discarded.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  void\t The nonterminal has no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t semantic value. Any ASTs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t generated by the symbol's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t right hand side are discarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t (as well).\n\n\t\t     start  The value is the serialization of the start\n\t\t\t    parsing expression of the grammar, as specified in\n\t\t\t    the section PE serialization format.\n\n\t      [4]    The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified\n\t\t     implicitly as the set of all terminal symbols used in the\n\t\t     start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.\n\n       canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as\n\t      specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies\n\t      the constraints below, which make it unique among all the\n\t      possible serializations of this grammar.\n\n\t      [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are\n\t\t     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by\n\t\t     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.\n\n\t      [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical\n\t\t     representation of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not\n\t\t     contain superfluous whitespace.\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions"
