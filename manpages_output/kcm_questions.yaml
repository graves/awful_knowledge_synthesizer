To use it, set the KRB5CCNAME\n     enviroment variable to ‘KCM:uid’ or add the stanza\n\n\n     [libdefaults]\n\t     default_cc_name = KCM:%{uid}\n\n     to the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and make sure kcm is started in\n     the system startup files.\n\n     The kcm daemon can hold the credentials for all users in the system.\n     Access control is done with Unix-like permissions.  The daemon checks the\n     access on all operations based on the uid of the user.  The tickets are\n     renewed as long as is permitted by the KDC's policy.\n\n     The kcm daemon can also keep a SYSTEM credential that server processes\n     can use to access services.  One example of usage might be an nss_ldap\n     module that quickly needs to get credentials and doesn't want to renew\n     the ticket itself.\n\n     Supported options:\n\n     --cache-name=cachename\n\t     system cache name\n\n     -c file, --config-file=file\n\t     location of config file\n\n     -g group, --group=group\n\t     system cache group\n\n     --max-request=size\n\t     max size for a kcm-request\n\n     --disallow-getting-krbtgt\n\t     disallow extracting any krbtgt from the\n\n     --use-uid-matching\n\t     use uid only to determine if a user can access a credential or\n\t     not kcm daemon.\n\n     --detach\n\t     detach from console\n\n     -h, --help\n\n     -k principal, --system-principal=principal\n\t     system principal name\n\n     -l time, --lifetime=time\n\t     lifetime of system tickets\n\n     -n, --no-name-constraints\n\t     disable credentials cache name constraints\n\n     -r time, --renewable-life=time\n\t     renewable lifetime of system tickets\n\n     -s path, --socket-path=path\n\t     path to kcm domain socket\n\n     --door-path=path\n\t     path to kcm door socket\n\n     -S principal, --server=principal\n\t     server to get system ticket for\n\n     -t keytab, --keytab=keytab\n\t     system keytab name\n\n     -u user, --user=user\n\t     system cache owner\n\n     -v, --version\n\nHeimdal \t\t\t May 29, 2005\t\t\t       Heimdal"
