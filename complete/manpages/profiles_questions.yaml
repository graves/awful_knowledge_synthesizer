Starting\n     with macOS 11.0 (profiles tool 8.0 or later), this tool cannot be\n\t used to install configuration profiles.  You should add your profiles\n     using the System Settings Profiles\n\t preference pane.    Additionally, startup profiles are no longer\n     supported.\n\nVERBS\n     Each command verb is listed with its description and optional individual\n     arguments.   Most commands use the -type option to determine which kind\n     of profile should be used in the command.\tFor those commands, if no type\n     is specified, the default will be to use the configuration profile type.\n\n     help\n\t\tShows abbreviated help\n\n     list\t-type profile_type -user user_name -output output_path\n\t\tList profiles for a user or when running as root, the device.\n\n     show\t-type profile_type -user user_name -output output_path -cached\n\t\tShow expanded information for profiles.   If the type is set\n\t\tto enrollment, this will instead show the current server DEP\n\t\tconfiguration.\tObtaining the enrollment information may be\n\t\trate limited to 10 times every 23 hours, at which point it\n\t\twill try to display the information from the local cache.\n\t\tShould this occur, a note will be displayed with the\n\t\tenrollment information.  If the -cached option is set, the\n\t\tenrollment information will only be obtained from the local\n\t\tcache."
