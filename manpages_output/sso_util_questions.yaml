This tool can\n     configure services, create and consume encrypted config records and tear\n     down Kerberos installations\n\n     Commands for sso_util :\n\n     info [-p] [-g | -l | -L | -r dir_node_path [dir_node_path]]\n\t      Returns information about the current Single Sign On environment\n\n\t      info command arguments:\n\n\t      -p       Returns the data in XML format\n\n\t      -g       Returns the default Kerberos realm name\n\n\t      -l       Returns a list of the services sso_util knows how to\n\t\t       Kerberize\n\n\t      -L       Returns the default Kerberos log file paths\n\n\t      -r dir_node_path\n\t\t       Returns whether or not the given node has a Kerberos\n\t\t       record associated with it. If it does, it returns the\n\t\t       default realm name.  If dir_node_path is '.' (default)\n\t\t       it also returns all the realm names available on the\n\t\t       search path"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the sso_util tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the sso_util command to retrieve the default Kerberos realm name in XML format?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the sso_util command to check if the current directory node has a Kerberos record and retrieve the default realm name?
