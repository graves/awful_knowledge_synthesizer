ESP protects IP payload from wire-tapping by\n     encrypting it by secret key cryptography algorithms.  AH guarantees\n     integrity of IP packet and protects it from intermediate alteration or\n     impersonation, by attaching cryptographic checksum computed by one-way\n     hash functions.  ipsec has two operation modes: transport mode and tunnel\n     mode.  Transport mode is for protecting peer-to-peer communication\n     between end nodes.  Tunnel mode includes IP-in-IP encapsulation operation\n     and is designed for security gateways, like VPN configurations."

    Kernel interface
         ipsec is controlled by key management engine and policy engine, in the
         operating system kernel.

         Key management engine can be accessed from the userland by using PF_KEY
         sockets.  The PF_KEY socket API is defined in RFC2367.

         Policy engine can be controlled by extended part of PF_KEY API,
         setsockopt(2) operations, and sysctl(3) interface.  The kernel implements
         extended version of PF_KEY interface, and allows you to define IPsec
         policy like per-packet filters.  setsockopt(2) interface is used to
         define per-socket behavior, and sysctl(3) interface is used to define
         host-wide default behavior.

         The kernel code does not implement dynamic encryption key exchange
         protocol like IKE (Internet Key Exchange).  That should be implemented as
         userland programs (usually as daemons), by using the above described
         APIs.

       Policy management
         The kernel implements experimental policy management code.  You can
         manage the IPsec policy in two ways.  One is to configure per-socket
         policy using setsockopt(2).  The other is to configure kernel packet
         filter-based policy using PF_KEY interface, via setkey(8).  In both
         cases, IPsec policy must be specified with syntax described in
         ipsec_set_policy(3).

    BUGS
         The IPsec support is subject to change as the IPsec protocols develop.

         There is no single standard for policy engine API, so the policy engine
         API described herein is just for KAME implementation.

         AH and tunnel mode encapsulation may not work as you might expect.  If
         you configure inbound “require” policy against AH tunnel or any IPsec
         encapsulating policy with AH (like “esp/tunnel/A-B/use
         ah/transport/A-B/require”), tunnelled packets will be rejected.  This is
         because we enforce policy check on inner packet on reception, and AH
         authenticates encapsulating (outer) packet, not the encapsulated (inner)
         packet (so for the receiving kernel there's no sign of authenticity).
         The issue will be solved when we revamp our policy engine to keep all the
         packet decapsulation history.

         Under certain condition, truncated result may be raised from the kernel
         against SADB_DUMP and SADB_SPDDUMP operation on PF_KEY socket.  This
         occurs if there are too many database entries in the kernel and socket
         buffer for the PF_KEY socket is insufficient.  If you manipulate many
         IPsec key/policy database entries, increase the size of socket buffer.

  manpageQuestion2: How can you ensure that the PF_KEY socket buffer is large enough to avoid truncated results when using SADB_DUMP or SADB_SPDDUMP?
