If no files are specified, gzip will compress from\n     standard input, or decompress to standard output.\tWhen in compression\n     mode, each file will be replaced with another file with the suffix, set\n     by the -S suffix option, added, if possible.\n\n     In decompression mode, each file will be checked for existence, as will\n     the file with the suffix added.  Each file argument must contain a\n     separate complete archive; when multiple files are indicated, each is\n     decompressed in turn.\n\n     In the case of gzcat the resulting data is then concatenated in the\n     manner of cat(1)."

The default compression level is 6.\n\n     -c, --stdout, --to-stdout\n\t\t       This option specifies that output will go to the\n\t\t       standard output stream, leaving files intact.\n\n     -d, --decompress, --uncompress\n\t\t       This option selects decompression rather than\n\t\t       compression.\n\n     -f, --force       This option turns on force mode.  This allows files\n\t\t       with multiple links, symbolic links to regular files,\n\t\t       overwriting of pre-existing files, reading from or\n\t\t       writing to a terminal, and when combined with the -c\n\t\t       option, allowing non-compressed data to pass through\n\t\t       unchanged."
