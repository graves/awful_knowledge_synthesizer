         sc_auth accept [-v] [-u user] [-d domain] -h hash
         sc_auth remove [-v] [-u user] [-d domain]
         sc_auth hash   [-k keyname]

    DESCRIPTION
         Configures a local user account to permit authentication using a
         supported SmartCard.  Authentication is via asymmetric key (also known as
         public-key) encryption.

       CTK Identity
         CTK Identity allows to create and manipulate CryptoTokenKit identities.
         CryptoTokenKit identities can use non-exportable or exportable private
         keys. The non-exportable private key is protected by the Secure Enclave
         and the key never leves the Secure Enclave in open form. The exportable
         private key is encrypted with Elliptic Curve Encryption Standard Variable
         IVX963 algorithm which is backed by a Secure Enclave key. CryptoTokenKit
         Identities and private keys can be used for TLS authentication, email
         protection and SSL using ssh-keychain(8) library.
