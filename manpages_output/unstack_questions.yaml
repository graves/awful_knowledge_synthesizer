Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `unstack`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nunstack(n)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    unstack(n)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nNAME\n       unstack - Unstacking channels\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       package require Tcl  ?8.2?\n\n       package require Trf  ?2.1.4?\n\n       unstack channel\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The command unstack is an interface to the public Tcl API function\n       TclUnstackChannel. It unstacks the topmost transformation from the\n       specified channel if there is any.\n\n       unstack channel\n\t      Removes the topmost transformation from the specified channel.\n\t      If the channel has no transformation associated with it it will\n\t      be closed. In other words, in this situation the command is\n\t      equivalent to close.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       trf-intro\n\nKEYWORDS\n       removal, transformation, unstacking\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 1996-2003, Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>\n\n\nTrf transformer commands\t     2.1.4\t\t\t    unstack(n)"
