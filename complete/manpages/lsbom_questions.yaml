Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lsbom`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nLSBOM(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t      LSBOM(8)\n\n\n\n\nNAME\n     lsbom â€“ list contents of a bom file\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     lsbom [-b] [-c] [-d] [-f] [-l] [-m] [-s] [-x] [--arch archVal]\n\t   [-p parameters] bom ...\n     lsbom -h | --help\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The lsbom command interprets the contents of binary bom (bom(5)) files.\n     For each file in a bom, lsbom prints the file path and/or requested\n     information.\n\n     If no options are given, lsbom will display the output formatted such\n     that each line contains the path of the entry, its mode (octal), and its\n     UID/GID. There are slight differences in the output for plain files,\n     directories, symbolic links, and device files as follows:\n\n     plain files     the UID/GID is followed by the file size and a 32-bit CRC\n\t\t     checksum of the file's contents.\n\n     symbolic links  the UID/GID is followed by the size and checksum of the\n\t\t     link path, and the link path itself.\n\n     device files    the UID/GID file number is followed by the device number.\n\n     The -p option can be used to specify a user-defined format for lsbom's\n     output. The format string consists of one or more characters described\n     below where each character represents a data type. Data types will be\n     separated by tab characters, and each line will end with a newline\n     character. One can use this mechanism to create output similar to the\n     ls(1) command.\n\n     The options are:\n\n     -h \t     print full usage\n\n     -b \t     list block devices\n\n     -c \t     list character devices\n\n     -d \t     list directories\n\n     -f \t     list files\n\n     -l \t     list symbolic links\n\n     -m \t     print modified times (for plain files only)\n\n     -s \t     print only the path of each file\n\n     -x \t     suppress modes for directories and symlinks\n\n     --arch archVal  when displaying plain files that represent Universal\n\t\t     Mach-O binaries, print the size and checksum of the file\n\t\t     contents for the specified archVal (either \"ppc\",\n\t\t     \"ppc64\", or \"i386\")\n\n     -p parameters   print only some of the results Note: each option can only\n\t\t     be used once:\n\t\t\t   c\t   32-bit checksum\n\t\t\t   f\t   file name\n\t\t\t   F\t   file name with quotes (i.e. \"/mach_kernel\")\n\t\t\t   g\t   group id\n\t\t\t   G\t   group name\n\t\t\t   m\t   file mode (permissions)\n\t\t\t   M\t   symbolic file mode (i.e. \"dr-xr-xr-x\" )\n\t\t\t   s\t   file size\n\t\t\t   S\t   formatted size\n\t\t\t   t\t   mod time\n\t\t\t   T\t   formatted mod time\n\t\t\t   u\t   user id\n\t\t\t   U\t   user name\n\t\t\t   /\t   user id/group id\n\t\t\t   ?\t   user name/group name\n\nEXAMPLES\n     lsbom bomfile\t     list the contents of bomfile\n\n     lsbom -s bomfile\t     list only the paths of the contents of the\n\t\t\t     bomfile\n\n     lsbom -f -l bomfile     list the plain files and symbolic links of the\n\t\t\t     bomfiles (but not directories or devices)\n\n     lsbom -p MUGsf bomfiles\n\t\t\t     list the contents of bomfile displaying only the\n\t\t\t     files' modes, user name, group name, size, and\n\t\t\t     filename\n\nSEE ALSO\n     bom(5), ditto(8), mkbom(8), pkgutil(1)\n\nHISTORY\n     The lsbom command appeared in NeXTSTEP as a tool to browse the contents\n     of bom files used during installation.\n\n     The -p flag appeared in Mac OS X 10.1 in an attempt to make lsbom's\n     output more convenient for human beings.\n\nMac OS X\t\t\t  May 7, 2008\t\t\t      Mac OS X"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lsbom command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use lsbom to list only the file paths from a bom file?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using lsbom with the -p option to display specific information about files in a bom file?
