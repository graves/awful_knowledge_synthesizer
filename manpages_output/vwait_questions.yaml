It continues processing events\n       until some event handler sets the value of variable varName.  Once\n       varName has been set, the vwait command will return as soon as the\n       event handler that modified varName completes.  varName must be\n       globally scoped (either with a call to global for the varName, or with\n       the full namespace path specification).\n\n       In some cases the vwait command may not return immediately after\n       varName is set.\tThis can happen if the event handler that sets varName\n       does not complete immediately.  For example, if an event handler sets\n       varName and then itself calls vwait to wait for a different variable,\n       then it may not return for a long time.\tDuring this time the top-level\n       vwait is blocked waiting for the event handler to complete, so it\n       cannot return either.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Run the event-loop continually until some event calls exit.  (You can\n       use any variable not mentioned elsewhere, but the name forever reminds\n       you at a glance of the intent.)\n\t      vwait forever\n\n       Wait five seconds for a connection to a server socket, otherwise close\n       the socket and continue running the script:\n\t      # Initialise the state\n\t      after 5000 set state timeout\n\t      set server [socket -server accept 12345]\n\t      proc accept {args} {\n\t\t global state connectionInfo\n\t\t set state accepted\n\t\t set connectionInfo $args\n\t      }\n\n\t      # Wait for something to happen\n\t      vwait state\n\n\t      # Clean up events that could have happened\n\t      close $server\n\t      after cancel set state timeout\n\n\t      # Do something based on how the vwait finished...\n\t      switch $state {\n\t\t timeout {\n\t\t    puts \"no connection on port 12345\"\n\t\t }\n\t\t accepted {\n\t\t    puts \"connection: $connectionInfo\"\n\t\t    puts [lindex $connectionInfo 0] \"Hello there!\"\n\t\t }\n\t      }"
