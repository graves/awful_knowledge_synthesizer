Specifying - as an input file\n     reads from stdin.\n\n     The first argument indicates the operation to perform, one of:\n\n     -help\t   Show the usage information for the command and exit.\n\n     -p \t   Print the property list in a human-readable fashion. The\n\t\t   output format is not stable and not designed for machine\n\t\t   parsing. The purpose of this command is to be able to\n\t\t   easily read the contents of a plist file, no matter what\n\t\t   format it is in.\n\n     -lint\t   Check the named property list files for syntax errors.\n\t\t   This is the default command option if none is specified.\n\n     -convert fmt  Convert the named file to the indicated format and write\n\t\t   back to the file system.  If the file can't be loaded due\n\t\t   to invalid syntax, the operation fails. This is the only\n\t\t   option to support objc swift formats."
