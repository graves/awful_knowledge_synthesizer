Future\n\t      versions of this program may generate alternative syntaxes by\n\t      default.\tThis option is provided for forward compatibility.\n\n       -s_secret\n\t      The secret to hash.  If this, -g and -T are absent, the user\n\t      will be prompted for the secret to hash.\t-s, -g and -T are\n\t      mutually exclusive flags.\n\n       -g     Generate the secret.

The\n\t      default is {SSHA}.\n\n\t      Note that scheme names may need to be protected, due to { and },\n\t      from expansion by the user's command interpreter.\n\n\t      {SHA} and {SSHA} use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the\n\t      latter with a seed.\n\n\t      {MD5} and {SMD5} use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the latter\n\t      with a seed.\n\n\t      {CRYPT} uses the crypt(3).\n\n\t      {CLEARTEXT} indicates that the new password should be added to\n\t      userPassword as clear text.  Unless {CLEARTEXT} is used, this\n\t      flag is incompatible with option -g.\n\n       -c_crypt-salt-format\n\t      Specify the format of the salt passed to crypt(3) when\n\t      generating {CRYPT} passwords.  This string needs to be in\n\t      sprintf(3) format and may include one (and only one) %s\n\t      conversion.  This conversion will be substituted with a string\n\t      of random characters from [A-Za-z0-9./].\tFor example, '%.2s'\n\t      provides a two character salt and '$1$%.8s' tells some versions\n\t      of crypt(3) to use an MD5 algorithm and provides 8 random\n\t      characters of salt.  The default is '%s', which provides 31\n\t      characters of salt."

A new attribute type, authPassword, to hold hashed\n       passwords has been defined (RFC 3112), but is not yet implemented in\n       slapd(8).\n\n       It should also be noted that the behavior of crypt(3) is platform\n       specific.\n\nSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n       Use of hashed passwords does not protect passwords during protocol\n       transfer.  TLS or other eavesdropping protections should be in-place\n       before using LDAP simple bind.\n\n       The hashed password values should be protected as if they were clear\n       text passwords.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       ldappasswd(1), ldapmodify(1), slapd(8), slapd.conf(5), slapd-config(5),\n       RFC 2307, RFC 4519, RFC 3112\n\n       \"OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide\" (http://www.OpenLDAP.org/doc/admin/)"
