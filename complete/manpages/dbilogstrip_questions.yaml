Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dbilogstrip`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDBILOGSTRIP(1)\t      User Contributed Perl Documentation\tDBILOGSTRIP(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       dbilogstrip - filter to normalize DBI trace logs for diff'ing\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       Read DBI trace file \"dbitrace.log\" and write out a stripped version to\n       \"dbitrace_stripped.log\"\n\n\t dbilogstrip dbitrace.log > dbitrace_stripped.log\n\n       Run \"yourscript.pl\" twice, each with different sets of arguments, with\n       DBI_TRACE enabled. Filter the output and trace through \"dbilogstrip\"\n       into a separate file for each run. Then compare using diff. (This\n       example assumes you're using a standard shell.)\n\n\t DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args1... 2>&1 | dbilogstrip > dbitrace1.log\n\t DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args2... 2>&1 | dbilogstrip > dbitrace2.log\n\t diff -u dbitrace1.log dbitrace2.log\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Replaces any hex addresses, e.g, 0x128f72ce with \"0xN\".\n\n       Replaces any references to process id or thread id, like \"pid#6254\"\n       with \"pidN\".\n\n       So a DBI trace line like this:\n\n\t -> STORE for DBD::DBM::st (DBI::st=HASH(0x19162a0)~0x191f9c8 'f_params' ARRAY(0x1922018)) thr#1800400\n\n       will look like this:\n\n\t -> STORE for DBD::DBM::st (DBI::st=HASH(0xN)~0xN 'f_params' ARRAY(0xN)) thrN\n\nperl v5.34.0\t\t\t  2024-12-14\t\t\tDBILOGSTRIP(1)"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the dbilogstrip tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use dbilogstrip to normalize a DBI trace log file for comparison with another log?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using dbilogstrip to process the output of a Perl script with DBI_TRACE enabled?
