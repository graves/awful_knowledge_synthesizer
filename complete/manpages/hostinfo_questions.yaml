Active processors\n\t   are members of a processor set and are ready to dispatch threads.\n\t   On a single processor system, the active processor, is processor 0.\n\n\t   Primary memory available:\n\t   The amount of physical memory that is configured for use on the\n\t   host system.\n\n\t   Default processor set:\n\t   Displays the number of tasks currently assigned to the host\n\t   processor set, the number of threads currently assigned to the host\n\t   processor set, and the number of processors included in the host\n\t   processor set.\n\n\t   Load average:\n\t   Measures the average number of threads in the run queue.\n\n\t   Mach factor:\n\t   A variant of the load average which measures the processing\n\t   resources available to a new thread.  Mach factor is based on the\n\t   number of CPUs divided by (1 + the number of runnablethreads) or\n\t   the number of CPUs minus the number of runnable threads when the\n\t   number of runnable threads is less than the number of CPUs.\tThe\n\t   closer the Mach factor value is to zero, the higher the load.  On\n\t   an idle system with a fixed number of active processors, the mach\n\t   factor will be equal to the number of CPUs."
