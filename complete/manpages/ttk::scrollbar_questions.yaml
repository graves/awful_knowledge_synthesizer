A scrollbar displays a thumb in the middle portion of the\n       scrollbar, whose position and size provides information about the\n       portion of the document visible in the associated window.  The thumb\n       may be dragged by the user to control the visible region.  Depending on\n       the theme, two or more arrow buttons may also be present; these are\n       used to scroll the visible region in discrete units.\n\nSTANDARD OPTIONS\n       -class\t\t     -cursor\t\t  -style\n       -takefocus"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ttk::scrollbar`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\npathName fraction x y\n\t      Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point\n\t      given by x and y lies in the trough area of the scrollbar, where\n\t      0.0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough and 1.0\n\t      corresponds to the bottom or right.  X and y are pixel\n\t      coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget.  If x and y refer\n\t      to a point outside the trough, the closest point in the trough\n\t      is used.\n\nSCROLLING COMMANDS\n       When the user interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the\n       thumb, the scrollbar notifies the associated widget that it must change\n       its view.  The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a Tcl\n       command generated from the scrollbar's -command option.\tThe command\n       may take any of the following forms.  In each case, prefix is the\n       contents of the -command option, which usually has a form like .t yview\n\n       prefix moveto fraction\n\t      Fraction is a real number between 0 and 1.  The widget should\n\t      adjust its view so that the point given by fraction appears at\n\t      the beginning of the widget.  If fraction is 0 it refers to the\n\t      beginning of the document.  1.0 refers to the end of the\n\t      document, 0.333 refers to a point one-third of the way through\n\t      the document, and so on."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ttk::scrollbar`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nprefix scroll number units\n\t      The widget should adjust its view by number units.  The units\n\t      are defined in whatever way makes sense for the widget, such as\n\t      characters or lines in a text widget.  Number is either 1, which\n\t      means one unit should scroll off the top or left of the window,\n\t      or -1, which means that one unit should scroll off the bottom or\n\t      right of the window.\n\n       prefix scroll number pages\n\t      The widget should adjust its view by number pages.  It is up to\n\t      the widget to define the meaning of a page;  typically it is\n\t      slightly less than what fits in the window, so that there is a\n\t      slight overlap between the old and new views.  Number is either\n\t      1, which means the next page should become visible, or -1, which\n\t      means that the previous page should become visible.\n\nWIDGET STATES\n       The scrollbar automatically sets the disabled state bit.  when the\n       entire range is visible (range is 0.0 to 1.0), and clears it otherwise.\n       It also sets the active and pressed state flags of individual elements,\n       based on the position and state of the mouse pointer."
