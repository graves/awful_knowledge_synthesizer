[extra_libraries]]\n\n       h2xs -h|-?|--help\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       h2xs builds a Perl extension from C header files.  The extension will\n       include functions which can be used to retrieve the value of any\n       #define statement which was in the C header files.\n\n       The module_name will be used for the name of the extension.  If\n       module_name is not supplied then the name of the first header file will\n       be used, with the first character capitalized.\n\n       If the extension might need extra libraries, they should be included\n       here.  The extension Makefile.PL will take care of checking whether the\n       libraries actually exist and how they should be loaded.\tThe extra\n       libraries should be specified in the form -lm -lposix, etc, just as on\n       the cc command line.  By default, the Makefile.PL will search through\n       the library path determined by Configure.  That path can be augmented\n       by including arguments of the form -L/another/library/path in the\n       extra-libraries argument.\n\n       In spite of its name, h2xs may also be used to create a skeleton pure\n       Perl module. See the -X option.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -A, --omit-autoload\n\t    Omit all autoload facilities.  This is the same as -c but also\n\t    removes the \"use AutoLoader\" statement from the .pm file.\n\n       -B, --beta-version\n\t    Use an alpha/beta style version number.  Causes version number to\n\t    be \"0.00_01\" unless -v is specified.\n\n       -C, --omit-changes\n\t    Omits creation of the Changes file, and adds a HISTORY section to\n\t    the POD template.\n\n       -F, --cpp-flags=addflags\n\t    Additional flags to specify to C preprocessor when scanning header\n\t    for function declarations.\tWrites these options in the generated\n\t    Makefile.PL too.\n\n       -M, --func-mask=regular expression\n\t    selects functions/macros to process.\n\n       -O, --overwrite-ok\n\t    Allows a pre-existing extension directory to be overwritten.\n\n       -P, --omit-pod\n\t    Omit the autogenerated stub POD section.\n\n       -X, --omit-XS\n\t    Omit the XS portion. Used to generate a skeleton pure Perl module.\n\t    \"-c\" and \"-f\" are implicitly enabled.\n\n       -a, --gen-accessors\n\t    Generate an accessor method for each element of structs and\n\t    unions. The generated methods are named after the element name;\n\t    will return the current value of the element if called without\n\t    additional arguments; and will set the element to the supplied\n\t    value (and return the new value) if called with an additional\n\t    argument. Embedded structures and unions are returned as a pointer\n\t    rather than the complete structure, to facilitate chained calls.\n\n\t    These methods all apply to the Ptr type for the structure;\n\t    additionally two methods are constructed for the structure type\n\t    itself, \"_to_ptr\" which returns a Ptr type pointing to the same\n\t    structure, and a \"new\" method to construct and return a new\n\t    structure, initialised to zeroes.\n\n       -b, --compat-version=version\n\t    Generates a .pm file which is backwards compatible with the\n\t    specified perl version.\n\n\t    For versions < 5.6.0, the changes are.\n\t\t- no use of 'our' (uses 'use vars' instead)\n\t\t- no 'use warnings'\n\n\t    Specifying a compatibility version higher than the version of perl\n\t    you are using to run h2xs will have no effect.  If unspecified\n\t    h2xs will default to compatibility with the version of perl you\n\t    are using to run h2xs.\n\n       -c, --omit-constant\n\t    Omit \"constant()\" from the .xs file and corresponding specialised\n\t    \"AUTOLOAD\" from the .pm file.\n\n       -d, --debugging\n\t    Turn on debugging messages.\n\n       -e, --omit-enums=[regular expression]\n\t    If regular expression is not given, skip all constants that are\n\t    defined in a C enumeration. Otherwise skip only those constants\n\t    that are defined in an enum whose name matches regular expression.\n\n\t    Since regular expression is optional, make sure that this switch\n\t    is followed by at least one other switch if you omit regular\n\t    expression and have some pending arguments such as header-file\n\t    names. This is ok:\n\n\t\th2xs -e -n Module::Foo foo.h\n\n\t    This is not ok:\n\n\t\th2xs -n Module::Foo -e foo.h\n\n\t    In the latter, foo.h is taken as regular expression.\n\n       -f, --force\n\t    Allows an extension to be created for a header even if that header\n\t    is not found in standard include directories.\n\n       -g, --global\n\t    Include code for safely storing static data in the .xs file.\n\t    Extensions that do no make use of static data can ignore this\n\t    option.\n\n       -h, -?, --help\n\t    Print the usage, help and version for this h2xs and exit.\n\n       -k, --omit-const-func\n\t    For function arguments declared as \"const\", omit the const\n\t    attribute in the generated XS code.\n\n       -m, --gen-tied-var\n\t    Experimental: for each variable declared in the header file(s),\n\t    declare a perl variable of the same name magically tied to the C\n\t    variable.\n\n       -n, --name=module_name\n\t    Specifies a name to be used for the extension, e.g., -n RPC::DCE\n\n       -o, --opaque-re=regular expression\n\t    Use \"opaque\" data type for the C types matched by the regular\n\t    expression, even if these types are \"typedef\"-equivalent to types\n\t    from typemaps.  Should not be used without -x.\n\n\t    This may be useful since, say, types which are\n\t    \"typedef\"-equivalent to integers may represent OS-related handles,\n\t    and one may want to work with these handles in OO-way, as in\n\t    \"$handle->do_something()\".\tUse \"-o .\" if you want to handle all\n\t    the \"typedef\"ed types as opaque types.\n\n\t    The type-to-match is whitewashed (except for commas, which have no\n\t    whitespace before them, and multiple \"*\" which have no whitespace\n\t    between them).\n\n       -p, --remove-prefix=prefix\n\t    Specify a prefix which should be removed from the Perl function\n\t    names, e.g., -p sec_rgy_ This sets up the XS PREFIX keyword and\n\t    removes the prefix from functions that are autoloaded via the\n\t    \"constant()\" mechanism.\n\n       -s, --const-subs=sub1,sub2\n\t    Create a perl subroutine for the specified macros rather than\n\t    autoload with the constant() subroutine.  These macros are assumed\n\t    to have a return type of char *, e.g.,\n\t    -s sec_rgy_wildcard_name,sec_rgy_wildcard_sid.\n\n       -t, --default-type=type\n\t    Specify the internal type that the constant() mechanism uses for\n\t    macros.  The default is IV (signed integer).  Currently all macros\n\t    found during the header scanning process will be assumed to have\n\t    this type.\tFuture versions of \"h2xs\" may gain the ability to make\n\t    educated guesses.\n\n       --use-new-tests\n\t    When --compat-version (-b) is present the generated tests will use\n\t    \"Test::More\" rather than \"Test\" which is the default for versions\n\t    before 5.6.2.  \"Test::More\" will be added to PREREQ_PM in the\n\t    generated \"Makefile.PL\".\n\n       --use-old-tests\n\t    Will force the generation of test code that uses the older \"Test\"\n\t    module.\n\n       --skip-exporter\n\t    Do not use \"Exporter\" and/or export any symbol.\n\n       --skip-ppport\n\t    Do not use \"Devel::PPPort\": no portability to older version.\n\n       --skip-autoloader\n\t    Do not use the module \"AutoLoader\"; but keep the constant()\n\t    function and \"sub AUTOLOAD\" for constants.\n\n       --skip-strict\n\t    Do not use the pragma \"strict\".\n\n       --skip-warnings\n\t    Do not use the pragma \"warnings\".\n\n       -v, --version=version\n\t    Specify a version number for this extension.  This version number\n\t    is added to the templates.\tThe default is 0.01, or 0.00_01 if\n\t    \"-B\" is specified.\tThe version specified should be numeric.\n\n       -x, --autogen-xsubs\n\t    Automatically generate XSUBs basing on function declarations in\n\t    the header file.  The package \"C::Scan\" should be installed. If\n\t    this option is specified, the name of the header file may look\n\t    like \"NAME1,NAME2\". In this case NAME1 is used instead of the\n\t    specified string, but XSUBs are emitted only for the declarations\n\t    included from file NAME2.\n\n\t    Note that some types of arguments/return-values for functions may\n\t    result in XSUB-declarations/typemap-entries which need hand-\n\t    editing. Such may be objects which cannot be converted from/to a\n\t    pointer (like \"long long\"), pointers to functions, or arrays.  See\n\t    also the section on \"LIMITATIONS of -x\".\n\nEXAMPLES\n\t   # Default behavior, extension is Rusers\n\t   h2xs rpcsvc/rusers\n\n\t   # Same, but extension is RUSERS\n\t   h2xs -n RUSERS rpcsvc/rusers\n\n\t   # Extension is rpcsvc::rusers.

The example below assumes that\n       the header files are interface_simple.h and interface_hairy.h, and you\n       want the perl module be named as \"Ext::Ension\".\tIf you need some\n       preprocessor directives and/or linking with external libraries, see the\n       flags \"-F\", \"-L\" and \"-l\" in \"OPTIONS\".\n\n       Find the directory name\n\t   Start with a dummy run of h2xs:\n\n\t     h2xs -Afn Ext::Ension\n\n\t   The only purpose of this step is to create the needed directories,\n\t   and let you know the names of these directories.  From the output\n\t   you can see that the directory for the extension is Ext/Ension.\n\n       Copy C files\n\t   Copy your header files and C files to this directory Ext/Ension.\n\n       Create the extension\n\t   Run h2xs, overwriting older autogenerated files:\n\n\t     h2xs -Oxan Ext::Ension interface_simple.h interface_hairy.h\n\n\t   h2xs looks for header files after changing to the extension\n\t   directory, so it will find your header files OK.\n\n       Archive and test\n\t   As usual, run\n\n\t     cd Ext/Ension\n\t     perl Makefile.PL\n\t     make dist\n\t     make\n\t     make test\n\n       Hints\n\t   It is important to do \"make dist\" as early as possible.  This way\n\t   you can easily merge(1) your changes to autogenerated files if you\n\t   decide to edit your \".h\" files and rerun h2xs.\n\n\t   Do not forget to edit the documentation in the generated .pm file.\n\n\t   Consider the autogenerated files as skeletons only, you may invent\n\t   better interfaces than what h2xs could guess.\n\n\t   Consider this section as a guideline only, some other options of\n\t   h2xs may better suit your needs.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n       No environment variables are used.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Larry Wall and others\n\nSEE ALSO\n       perl, perlxstut, ExtUtils::MakeMaker, and AutoLoader.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       The usual warnings if it cannot read or write the files involved.\n\nLIMITATIONS of -x\n       h2xs would not distinguish whether an argument to a C function which is\n       of the form, say, \"int *\", is an input, output, or input/output\n       parameter.  In particular, argument declarations of the form\n\n\t   int\n\t   foo(n)\n\t       int *n\n\n       should be better rewritten as\n\n\t   int\n\t   foo(n)\n\t       int &n\n\n       if \"n\" is an input parameter.\n\n       Additionally, h2xs has no facilities to intuit that a function\n\n\t  int\n\t  foo(addr,l)\n\t       char *addr\n\t       int   l\n\n       takes a pair of address and length of data at this address, so it is\n       better to rewrite this function as\n\n\t   int\n\t   foo(sv)\n\t\t   SV *addr\n\t       PREINIT:\n\t\t   STRLEN len;\n\t\t   char *s;\n\t       CODE:\n\t\t   s = SvPV(sv,len);\n\t\t   RETVAL = foo(s, len);\n\t       OUTPUT:\n\t\t   RETVAL\n\n       or alternately\n\n\t   static int\n\t   my_foo(SV *sv)\n\t   {\n\t       STRLEN len;\n\t       char *s = SvPV(sv,len);\n\n\t       return foo(s, len);\n\t   }\n\n\t   MODULE = foo        PACKAGE = foo   PREFIX = my_\n\n\t   int\n\t   foo(sv)\n\t       SV *sv\n\n       See perlxs and perlxstut for additional details.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2024-12-14\t\t\t       H2XS(1)"
