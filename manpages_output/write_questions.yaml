The other\n     user will see the message ‘EOF’ indicating that the conversation is over.\n\n     You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from writing to you\n     with the mesg(1) command.\n\n     If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one terminal,\n     you can specify which terminal to write to by specifying the terminal\n     name as the second operand to the write command.  Alternatively, you can\n     let write select one of the terminals - it will pick the one with the\n     shortest idle time.  This is so that if the user is logged in at work and\n     also dialed up from home, the message will go to the right place."
