At its simplest, the AGENT specification will\n       consist of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  In this situation, the\n       command will attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to\n       port 161 of the given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of\n       the possible formats for AGENT.\n\n       OID is an object identifier which uniquely identifies the object type\n       within a MIB. Multiple OIDs can be specified on a single snmpdelta\n       command."
