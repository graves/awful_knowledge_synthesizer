This manual page merely describes the overall nature of\n       them, so that the other manual pages don't have to.\n\nDIRECTORIES SEARCHED\n       First off, there are numerous places that configuration files can be\n       found and read from.  By default, the applications look for\n       configuration files in the following 4 directories, in order:\n       /etc/snmp, /usr/share/snmp, /usr/lib/snmp, and $HOME/.snmp.  In each of\n       these directories, it looks for files with the extension of both conf\n       and local.conf (reading the second ones last).  In this manner, there\n       are 8 default places a configuration file can exist for any given\n       configuration file type.\n\n       Additionally, the above default search path can be overridden by\n       setting the environment variable SNMPCONFPATH to a colon-separated list\n       of directories to search for.  The path for the persistent data should\n       be included when running applications that use persistent storage, such\n       as snmpd."

For example, /var/net-snmp/snmpd.conf.\n\nCONFIGURATION FILE TYPES\n       Each application may use multiple configuration files, which will\n       configure various different aspects of the application.\tFor instance,\n       the SNMP agent (snmpd) knows how to understand configuration directives\n       in both the snmpd.conf and the snmp.conf files.\tIn fact, most\n       applications understand how to read the contents of the snmp.conf\n       files.  Note, however, that configuration directives understood in one\n       file may not be understood in another file.  For further information,\n       read the associated manual page with each configuration file type.\n       Also, most of the applications support a -H switch on the command line\n       that will list the configuration files it will look for and the\n       directives in each one that it understands."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snmp_config`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe snmp.conf configuration file is intended to be a application suite\n       wide configuration file that supports directives that are useful for\n       controlling the fundamental nature of all of the SNMP applications,\n       such as how they all manipulate and parse the textual SNMP MIB files.\n\nSWITCHING CONFIGURATION TYPES IN MID-FILE\n       It's possible to switch in mid-file the configuration type that the\n       parser is supposed to be reading.  Since that sentence doesn't make\n       much sense, lets give you an example: say that you wanted to turn on\n       packet dumping output for the agent by default, but you didn't want to\n       do that for the rest of the applications (ie, snmpget, snmpwalk, ...).\n       Normally to enable packet dumping in the configuration file you'd need\n       to put a line like:\n\n\t      dumpPacket true\n\n       into the snmp.conf file.  But, this would turn it on for all of the\n       applications.  So, instead, you can put the same line in the snmpd.conf\n       file so that it only applies to the snmpd daemon.  However, you need to\n       tell the parser to expect this line.  You do this by putting a special\n       type specification token inside a [] set.  In other words, inside your\n       snmpd.conf file you could put the above snmp.conf directive by adding a\n       line like so:"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snmp_config`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n[snmp] dumpPacket true\n\n       This tells the parser to parse the above line as if it were inside a\n       snmp.conf file instead of an snmpd.conf file.  If you want to parse a\n       bunch of lines rather than just one then you can make the context\n       switch apply to the remainder of the file or until the next context\n       switch directive by putting the special token on a line by itself:\n\n\t      # make this file handle snmp.conf tokens:\n\t      [snmp]\n\t      dumpPacket true\n\t      logTimestamp true\n\t      # return to our original snmpd.conf tokens:\n\t      [snmpd]\n\t      rocommunity mypublic\n\nCOMMENTS\n       Any lines beginning with the character '#' in the configuration files\n       are treated as a comment and are not parsed.\n\nINCLUDING OTHER CONFIGURATION FILES\n       It is possible to include other configuration files for processing\n       during normal configuration file processing.:\n\n\t      # include site specific config\n\t      include site.conf\n\n       This will search every directory in the configuration path for files\n       named site.conf, and will process those files before returning to the\n       processing of the original file. Note that if '.conf' is omitted,\n       it will be appended. That is, all configuration files must end\n       in '.conf'."
