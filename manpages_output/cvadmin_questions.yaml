(Note: Xsan system services must be\n       started prior to running cvadmin.  In particular, the local fsmpm(8)\n       process must be active.)\n\n       The initial output shows the running FSMs grouped by the cluster in\n       which they are located. The hostnames or IP addresses are those that\n       are advertised to clients. When more than one location is listed, one\n       or more these will be marked as preferred. This means that this address\n       is on the metadata network and should be used, if possible, by a client\n       to make a connection to the FSM. The remaining addresses can be used if\n       a connection can not be made using a preferred address.\n\n       Note: An administrator can filter out addresses that are not to be\n       advertised by using the snfs_metadata_network_filter.json(5)\n       configuration file.\n\n       Then (optionally) use the select command described below to pick an FSM\n       to connect to.  Once connected, the command will display basic\n       information about the selected volume and prompt for further commands.\n\n       Note that a few commands such as paths, disks, start, and stop require\n       information obtained from the local fsmpm(8) only, so there is is no\n       need to select an FSM prior to using them.\n\nUSAGE\n       -H FSMHostName\n\t      Connect to the FSM located on the machine FSMHostName. By\n\t      default cvadmin will attempt to connect to an FSM located on the\n\t      local machine.\n\n       -F VolumeName\n\t      Automatically set the volume VolumeName as the active volume in\n\t      cvadmin.\n\n       -M     When listing file systems with the select command, display\n\t      [managed] next to each file system with DataMigration enabled.\n\t      This option is currently only intended for use by support\n\t      personnel.\n\n       -f filename\n\t      Read commands from filename\n\n       -e command\n\t      Execute command(s) and exit\n\n       -n     Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic\n\t      host\n\n       -x     Enable extended commands.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       The cvadmin commands can be used to display and modify the Xsan active\n       configuration. When a modification is made, it exists only as long as\n       the FSM is running. More permanent changes can be made in the\n       configuration file. Refer to the snfs_config(5) man page for details.\n       The following commands are supported.\n\n       The syntax for volume_name is: name[@cluster[/addom]]"

Rebuilds can be performed online while clients are\n\t      active in the file system.\n\n\t      When metadataArchiveDays is set to a value greater than zero,\n\t      requesting a new rebuild will cause the FSM to delete the\n\t      current metadata archive before starting the rebuild. All\n\t      metadata history that existed prior to the new rebuild will be\n\t      lost but the rebuild will shrink the mdarchive down to its\n\t      minimum size. Requesting a new rebuild has no effect when\n\t      metadataArchiveDays is set to zero because the existing metadata\n\t      archive is always deleted before starting the rebuild in that\n\t      case.\n\n\t      WARNING: When using the new argument to the rebuild command, all\n\t      metadata history that existed prior to the rebuild will be lost.\n\t      This will prevent external applications like snaudit and\n\t      snhistory from reporting events that occurred prior to the\n\t      rebuild and will prevent snrecover from recovering files that\n\t      were deleted prior to the rebuild.\n\n       mdarchive rebuild wait\n\t      Wait for an ongoing rebuild to complete and report status\n\t      periodically.\n\n       mdarchive backup [full|partial] pathname\n\t      For an FSM with a current mdarchive, request a backup copy be\n\t      generated as a compressed tar file.

Throttling is disabled when delay is equal\n\t      to 0 which is the default.  In addition to using the cvadmin\n\t      mdarchive command, throttling can be set at FSM startup using\n\t      the MDARCHIVE_THROTTLE_THRESHOLD and MDARCHIVE_THROTTLE_DELAY\n\t      environment variables.

If clientid is\n\t      specified (where clientid is the client's login id), a client\n\t      trace is also also generated.  This command creates an SNQBM_xxx\n\t      file in the debug directory.  Currently, only Windows clients\n\t      generate internal traces.  This command is for Quantum use only.\n\n       qbm show stripe-group-num\n\t      Show the QBM allocation table for a stripe group given the\n\t      stripe-group index.  All bandwidth (BW) is in MB/sec.  The\n\t      display includes the following sub-tables:\n\n\t      Stripe Group (SG) Table: SG max (capacity), BW currently free,\n\t      the total BW in the reserve pools, and the total over-\n\t      subscripted (over capacity) amount.\n\n\t      Priority (Pri) Table: table class name, count of clients in the\n\t      priority, total bandwidth allocated at this priority, minimum\n\t      BW, maximum BW, extra (over min) BW, reserved BW used/total\n\t      reserve allocated to this priority, and current BW used.\n\n\t      Client Entry: list number, IP address, client login number,\n\t      bandwidth information - minimum, maximum and current BW, restore\n\t      BW, flag (l - client asked for less, m - client asked for more,\n\t      g - client given more BW over minimum BW).\n\n       qbm newconfig\n\t      Re-read the <_file_system_name_>_qbm.conf file and update the\n\t      clients.\n\n       qos    Display per-stripe group QOS statistics.\tPer-client QoS\n\t      statistics are also displayed under each qos-configured stripe\n\t      group.\n\n       quit   This command will disconnect cvadmin from the FSM and exit.\n\n       ras enq [ nomerge ] event \"detail string\"\n\t      Generate an SNFS RAS event.  If \"nomerge\" is specified, multiple\n\t      instances of the RAS event are not merged into a single ticket.\n\t      For internal use only.\n\n       ras enq [ nomerge ] event reporting_FRU violating_FRU \"detail string\"\n\t      Generate a generic RAS event.  If \"nomerge\" is specified,\n\t      multiple instances of the RAS event are not merged into a single\n\t      ticket.  For internal use only.\n\n       regapigw\n\t      Register the filesystem with the fsmpm to enable registration\n\t      with an api gateway.  To be used when the fsmpm is not aware of\n\t      this filesystem for api gateway registration purposes.  This can\n\t      be confirmed using the 'snrest gateway status -d' command and\n\t      noting the absence of the filesystem.  The fsmpm performs the\n\t      api gateway registration on behalf of the filesystem.  This\n\t      situation should not occur, but if it does this command allows\n\t      recovery from the situation without requiring a restart of the\n\t      filesystem.\n\n       repblocked\n\t      Generate a report of files that may be causing open operations\n\t      to block due to an unresponsive client that is slow to\n\t      acknowledge a request to change state.  Such clients should be\n\t      inspected to determine whether there is a reason for their lack\n\t      of response. One common cause of unresponsiveness is that Xsan\n\t      clients have entered sleep mode. The settings on these clients\n\t      should be adjusted so they never sleep. If the client is known\n\t      to be hung, the connection to the FSM can be reset using the\n\t      discon command.\n\n       repfl  Generate a report that displays the file locks currently held.\n\t      Note: this command is only intended for debugging purposes by\n\t      support personnel.  In future releases, the format of the report\n\t      may change or the command may be removed entirely. Running the\n\t      repfl command will write out a report file and display the\n\t      output filename.\n\n       repof  Generate a report that displays all files that are currently\n\t      open on each Xsan client.  Running the repof command will write\n\t      out a report file and display the output filename containing\n\t      that report.\n\t      The information displayed for each file is: the pathname, inode\n\t      number, the number of \"writers\" (which is the # of times this\n\t      client has opened the file for write -- usually 1 or 0), and\n\t      stat information.\n\t      Next a line is printed showing the open state across all\n\t      clients.\tThe open state contains: the count of different\n\t      clients with this file open, the # of those clients that are\n\t      writers, and which client, if non-zero, has the file open\n\t      exclusively or that owns the ioToken.  The open state flags are\n\t      displayed followed by a set of strings indicating the meaning of\n\t      some of the bits in the flags field.  Some examples:\n\n\t      flags 0x2000: shared_read\n\t      flags 0x5000: I/O token shared_excl\n\t      flags 0x5009: revoking I/O token shared_excl\n\t      flags 0x9: revoking OLD Exclusive\n\n\t      If revoking is indicated, that means the client(s) has been sent\n\t      a message and a response is being awaited.  If client is zero\n\t      with revoking, a message was sent to one or more clients in\n\t      shared_read.\n\t      See also the repblocked command.\n\n\t      In future releases, the format of the report may change.\n\n       resetrpl [clear]\n\t      Repopulate Reverse Path Lookup (RPL) information.  The optional\n\t      clear argument causes existing RPL data to be cleared before\n\t      starting repopulation.  Note: resetrpl is only available when\n\t      cvadmin is invoked with the -x option.  Running resetrpl may\n\t      significantly delay FSM activation.  This command is not\n\t      intended for general use.  Only run resetrpl when recommended by\n\t      Technical Support.\n\n       restartd daemon [once]\n\t      Restart the daemon process.  For internal use only.\n\n       select [volume_name|N]\n\t      Select an active FSM to view and modify.\tIf no argument is\n\t      specified, a numbered list of FSMs and running utilities will be\n\t      displayed. If there is only one active volume in the list, it\n\t      will automatically be selected.\n\n\t      When a running utility is displayed by the select command, it\n\t      will show the following information. First the name of the file\n\t      system is displayed. Following that, in brackets \"[]\", is the\n\t      name of the utility that is running. Third, a letter indicating\n\t      the access type of the operation. The options here are (W) for\n\t      read-write access, (R) for read-only access and (U) for unique\n\t      access. Finally, the location and process id of the running\n\t      utility is displayed.\n\n\t      If volume_name is specified, then cvadmin will connect to the\n\t      current active FSM for that volume.  If N (a number) is\n\t      specified, cvadmin will connect to the Nth FSM in the list.\n\t      However, only active FSMs may be selected in this form.\n\n       show [poolname] [long]\n\t      Display information about the storage pools associated with the\n\t      selected volume. If a storage pool name poolname is given only\n\t      that storage pool's information will be given. Omitting the\n\t      poolname argument will display all storage pools associated with\n\t      the active file system. Using the long modifier will\n\t      additionally display detailed information about the disk units\n\t      associated with displayed storage pools.\n\n       start volume_name [on hostname_or_IP_address]\n\t      Start a File System Manager for the volume volume_name.  When\n\t      the command is running on an MDC of an HA cluster, the local FSM\n\t      is started, and then an attempt is made to start the FSM on the\n\t      peer MDC as identified by the /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_peer\n\t      file.  When the optional hostname_or_IP_address is specified,\n\t      the FSM is started on that MDC only.  The volume's configuration\n\t      file must be operational and placed in\n\t      /Library/Preferences/Xsan/<volume_name>.cfg before invoking this\n\t      command.\tSee snfs_config(5) for information on how to create a\n\t      configuration file for an Xsan volume.\n\n       startd daemon [once]\n\t      Start the daemon process.  For internal use only.\n\n       stat   Display the general status of the volume. The output will show\n\t      the number of clients connected to the volume. This count\n\t      includes any administrative programs, such as cvadmin. Also\n\t      shown are some of the static file-system-wide values such as the\n\t      block size, number of storage pools, number of mirrored storage\n\t      pools and number of disk devices.  The output also shows total\n\t      blocks and free blocks for the entire volume.\n\n       stats client_IP_address [clear]\n\t      Display read/write statistics for the selected file system.\n\t      This command connects to the host FSMPM who then collects\n\t      statistics from the file system client. The ten most active\n\t      files by bytes read and written and by the number of read/write\n\t      requests are displayed.  If clear is specified, zero the stats\n\t      after printing.\n\n       stop volume_name [on hostname_or_IP_address]\n\t      Stop the File System Manager for volume_name.  This will shut\n\t      down the FSM for the specified volume on every MDC.  When the\n\t      optional hostname or IP address is specified, the FSM is stopped\n\t      on that MDC only.  Further operations to the volume will be\n\t      blocked in clients until an FSM for the volume is activated.\n\n       stopd daemon\n\t      Start the daemon process.  For internal use only.\n\n       winidmap __username__\n\t      Show the MDC-mapped user id and group information for the\n\t      username.\n\n       who    Query client list for the active volume. The output will show\n\t      the following information for each client.\n\n\t      Type\t-  Type of connection. The client types are:\n\t\t FSM - File System Manager(FSM) process\n\t\t ADM - Administrative(cvadmin) connection\n\t\t CLI - Volume client connection. May be followed by a CLI\n\t\t       type character:\n\t\t       S - Disk Proxy Server\n\t\t       C - Disk Proxy Client\n\t\t       H - Disk Proxy Hybrid Client. This is a client that has\n\t\t\t   been configured as a proxy client but is operating\n\t\t\t   as a SAN client.\n\t      Location\t- The client's hostname or IP address that was used by\n\t      this client to connect to the FSM.\n\t      Up Time\t- The time since the client connection was initiated\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Invoke the cvadmin command for volume named snfs1."
