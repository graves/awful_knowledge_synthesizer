When a RAS event\n       occurs, an entry is added to the event log\n       (/System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/ras/raslog) on the Name\n       Server coordinators (see fsnameservers(4)).  It is also possible to\n       configure the coordinators to automatically send e-mail for RAS events\n       or pass the RAS event to any script or executable as described in the\n       NOTES section below.  In an environment that includes the StorNext\n       Management Suite (SNMS), RAS events also generate Service Request RAS\n       tickets that can be viewed through the SNMS GUI by selecting \"System\n       Status\" from the Service menu.\n\nEVENTS\n       The following list contains the currently supported events.\n\n       Event:  SL_EVT_NO_RESPONSE (Not responding)\n\n       Occurs:\n\t      When a reply from the FSM is delayed.\n\n       Example detail:\n\t      client2.foo.com (kernel): Timeout while attempting to force data\n\t      flush for file ´file1´ (inode \"895468127\") for file system\n\t      ´snfs1´ on host client1.\tAllowing host client2 to open file.\n\t      This may cause data coherency issues. The data path for host\n\t      client1 should be inspected to confirm that I/O is working\n\t      correctly."
