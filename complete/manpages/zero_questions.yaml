Use the CVS to get the sources.\n\n       zero   creates a zero channel which absorbs everything written into it.\n\t      Reading from a zero channel will return the requested number of\n\t      null bytes. These channels are essentially Tcl-specific variants\n\t      of the zero device for unixoid operating systems (/dev/zero).\n\t      Transfering the generated channel between interpreters is\n\t      possible but does not make much sense.\n\nOPTIONS\n       Memory channels created by zero provide one additional option to set or\n       query.\n\n       -delay ?milliseconds?\n\t      A zero channel is always writable and readable. This means that\n\t      all fileevent-handlers will fire continuously.  To avoid\n\t      starvation of other event sources the events raised by this\n\t      channel type have a configurable delay. This option is set in\n\t      milliseconds and defaults to 5.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       fifo, fifo2, memchan, null, random\n\nKEYWORDS\n       channel, i/o, in-memory channel, null, zero\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2004 Pat Thoyts <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>"
