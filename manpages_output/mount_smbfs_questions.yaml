At run time, mount_smbfs reads the\n\t     ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf file for additional configuration\n\t     parameters and a password.  If no password is found, mount_smbfs\n\t     prompts for it.\n\n     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option\n\t     followed by a comma separated string of options. See the mount(8)\n\t     man page for possible options and their meanings.\tAll listed\n\t     options are currently supported except for the ``force, update,\n\t     strictatime, sync and [no]async'' options.  Additional options\n\t     supported by the mount_smbfs are as follows:"
