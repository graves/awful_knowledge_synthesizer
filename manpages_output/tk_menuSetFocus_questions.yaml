The command is\n       invoked by the post widget command before posting the menu. Note that\n       in Tk 8.0 on Macintosh and Windows, all post-commands in a system of\n       menus are executed before any of those menus are posted.  This is due\n       to the limitations in the individual platforms' menu managers.\n       [-selectcolor selectColor] For menu entries that are check buttons or\n       radio buttons, this option specifies the color to display in the\n       indicator when the check button or radio button is selected.\n       [-tearoff tearOff] This option must have a proper boolean value, which\n       specifies whether or not the menu should include a tear-off entry at\n       the top.  If so, it will exist as entry 0 of the menu and the other\n       entries will number starting at 1.  The default menu bindings arrange\n       for the menu to be torn off when the tear-off entry is invoked.\n       [-tearoffcommand tearOffCommand] If this option has a non-empty value,\n       then it specifies a Tcl command to invoke whenever the menu is torn\n       off.  The actual command will consist of the value of this option,\n       followed by a space, followed by the name of the menu window, followed\n       by a space, followed by the name of the name of the torn off menu\n       window.\tFor example, if the option's value is “a b” and menu .x.y is\n       torn off to create a new menu .x.tearoff1, then the command “a b .x.y\n       .x.tearoff1” will be invoked.  [-title title] The string will be used\n       to title the window created when this menu is torn off. If the title is\n       NULL, then the window will have the title of the menubutton or the text\n       of the cascade item from which this menu was invoked.  [-type type]\n       This option can be one of menubar, tearoff, or normal, and is set when\n       the menu is created. While the string returned by the configuration\n       database will change if this option is changed, this does not affect\n       the menu widget's behavior. This is used by the cloning mechanism and\n       is not normally set outside of the Tk library.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the menu such as its colors and font.\n       The menu command returns its pathName argument.\tAt the time this\n       command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName, but\n       pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A menu is a widget that displays a collection of one-line entries\n       arranged in one or more columns.  There exist several different types\n       of entries, each with different properties.  Entries of different types\n       may be combined in a single menu.  Menu entries are not the same as\n       entry widgets.  In fact, menu entries are not even distinct widgets;\n       the entire menu is one widget.\n\n       Menu entries are displayed with up to three separate fields.  The main\n       field is a label in the form of a text string, a bitmap, or an image,\n       controlled by the -label, -bitmap, and -image options for the entry.\n       If the  -accelerator option is specified for an entry then a second\n       textual field is displayed to the right of the label.  The accelerator\n       typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be typed in the\n       application to cause the same result as invoking the menu entry.  The\n       third field is an indicator.  The indicator is present only for\n       checkbutton or radiobutton entries.  It indicates whether the entry is\n       selected or not, and is displayed to the left of the entry's string."

    Manpage text:

    In normal use, an entry becomes active (displays itself differently)
           whenever the mouse pointer is over the entry.  If a mouse button is
           released over the entry then the entry is invoked.  The effect of
           invocation is different for each type of entry; these effects are
           described below in the sections on individual entries.

           Entries may be disabled, which causes their labels and accelerators to
           be displayed with dimmer colors.  The default menu bindings will not
           allow a disabled entry to be activated or invoked.  Disabled entries
           may be re-enabled, at which point it becomes possible to activate and
           invoke them again.

           Whenever a menu's active entry is changed, a <<MenuSelect>> virtual
           event is send to the menu. The active item can then be queried from the
           menu, and an action can be taken, such as setting context-sensitive
           help text for the entry.

    TYPES OF ENTRIES
       COMMAND ENTRIES
           The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which behaves
           much like a button widget.  When a command entry is invoked, a Tcl
           command is executed.  The Tcl command is specified with the -command
           option.

A separator may not be activated or invoked, and it has no\n       behavior other than its display appearance.\n\n   CHECKBUTTON ENTRIES\n       A checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton widget.  When\n       it is invoked it toggles back and forth between the selected and\n       deselected states.  When the entry is selected, a particular value is\n       stored in a particular global variable (as determined by the -onvalue\n       and -variable options for the entry);  when the entry is deselected\n       another value (determined by the -offvalue option) is stored in the\n       global variable.  An indicator box is displayed to the left of the\n       label in a checkbutton entry.  If the entry is selected then the\n       indicator's center is displayed in the color given by the -selectcolor\n       option for the entry; otherwise the indicator's center is displayed in\n       the background color for the menu.

Whenever a particular entry becomes selected it\n       stores a particular value into a particular global variable (as\n       determined by the -value and -variable options for the entry).

    Manpage text:

    As noted, menubars may behave differently on different platforms.  One
           example of this concerns the handling of checkbuttons and radiobuttons
           within the menu.  While it is permitted to put these menu elements on
           menubars, they may not be drawn with indicators on some platforms, due
           to system restrictions.

       SPECIAL MENUS IN MENUBARS
           Certain menus in a menubar will be treated specially.  On the
           Macintosh, access to the special Application, Window and Help menus is
           provided. On Windows, access to the Windows System menu in each window
           is provided. On X Windows, a special right-justified help menu may be
           provided if Motif menu compatibility is enabled. In all cases, these
           menus must be created with the command name of the menubar menu
           concatenated with the special name. So for a menubar named .menubar, on
           the Macintosh, the special menus would be .menubar.apple,

           When Tk sees a .menubar.apple menu as the first menu in a menubar on
           the Macintosh, that menu's contents make up the first items of the
           Application menu whenever the window containing the menubar is in
           front.  After all of the Tk-defined items, the menu will have a
           separator, followed by all standard Application menu items.  Such a
           .apple menu must be present in a menu when that menu is first
           configured as a toplevel's menubar, otherwise a default application
           menu (hidden from Tk) will be inserted into the menubar at that time
           and subsequent addition of a .apple menu will no longer result in it
           becoming the Application menu.

    When Tk sees a .menubar.window menu on the Macintosh, the menu's
           contents are inserted into the standard Window menu of the user's
           menubar whenever the window's menubar is in front. The first items in
           the menu are provided by Mac OS X, and the names of the current
           toplevels are automatically appended after all the Tk-defined items and

           provided by Mac OS X.

           When Tk sees a System menu on Windows, its items are appended to the
           system menu that the menubar is attached to. This menu has an icon
           representing a spacebar, and can be invoked with the mouse or by typing
           Alt+Spacebar.  Due to limitations in the Windows API, any font changes,
           colors, images, bitmaps, or tearoff images will not appear in the
