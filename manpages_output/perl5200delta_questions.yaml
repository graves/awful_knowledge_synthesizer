    NAME
           perl5200delta - what is new for perl v5.20.0

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.18.0 release and the
           5.20.0 release.

           If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read
           perl5180delta, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.18.0.

    Core Enhancements
       Experimental Subroutine signatures
           Declarative syntax to unwrap argument list into lexical variables.
           "sub foo ($a,$b) {...}" checks the number of arguments and puts the
           arguments into lexical variables.  Signatures are not equivalent to the
           existing idiom of "sub foo { my($a,$b) = @_; ... }".  Signatures are
           only available by enabling a non-default feature, and generate warnings
           about being experimental.  The syntactic clash with prototypes is
           managed by disabling the short prototype syntax when signatures are
           enabled.

           See "Signatures" in perlsub for details.

       "sub"s now take a "prototype" attribute
           When declaring or defining a "sub", the prototype can now be specified
           inside of a "prototype" attribute instead of in parens following the
           name.

    For example, "sub foo($$){}" could be rewritten as "sub foo :
           prototype($$){}".

       More consistent prototype parsing
           Multiple semicolons in subroutine prototypes have long been tolerated
           and treated as a single semicolon.  There was one case where this did
           not happen.  A subroutine whose prototype begins with "*" or ";*" can
           affect whether a bareword is considered a method name or sub call.
           This now applies also to ";;;*".

           Whitespace has long been allowed inside subroutine prototypes, so "sub(
           $ $ )" is equivalent to "sub($$)", but until now it was stripped when
           the subroutine was parsed.  Hence, whitespace was not allowed in
           prototypes set by "Scalar::Util::set_prototype".  Now it is permitted,
           and the parser no longer strips whitespace.  This means "prototype
           &mysub" returns the original prototype, whitespace and all.

       "rand" now uses a consistent random number generator
           Previously perl would use a platform specific random number generator,
           varying between the libc rand(), random() or drand48().

    The regular expression engine now supports strings longer than 2**31
           characters.  [perl #112790, #116907]

           The functions PerlIO_get_bufsiz, PerlIO_get_cnt, PerlIO_set_cnt and
           PerlIO_set_ptrcnt now have SSize_t, rather than int, return values and
           parameters.

       "use locale" now works on UTF-8 locales
           Until this release, only single-byte locales, such as the ISO 8859
           series were supported.  Now, the increasingly common multi-byte UTF-8
           locales are also supported.  A UTF-8 locale is one in which the
           character set is Unicode and the encoding is UTF-8.  The POSIX
           "LC_CTYPE" category operations (case changing (like "lc()", "\U"), and
           character classification ("\w", "\D", "qr/[[:punct:]]/")) under such a
           locale work just as if not under locale, but instead as if under
           "use feature 'unicode_strings'", except taint rules are followed.
           Sorting remains by code point order in this release.  [perl #56820].

       "use locale" now compiles on systems without locale ability
           Previously doing this caused the program to not compile.  Within its
           scope the program behaves as if in the "C" locale.  Thus programs
           written for platforms that support locales can run on locale-less
           platforms without change.  Attempts to change the locale away from the
           "C" locale will, of course, fail.

    More locale initialization fallback options
           If there was an error with locales during Perl start-up, it immediately
           gave up and tried to use the "C" locale.  Now it first tries using
           other locales given by the environment variables, as detailed in
           "ENVIRONMENT" in perllocale.  For example, if "LC_ALL" and "LANG" are
           both set, and using the "LC_ALL" locale fails, Perl will now try the
           "LANG" locale, and only if that fails, will it fall back to "C".  On
           Windows machines, Perl will try, ahead of using "C", the system default
           locale if all the locales given by environment variables fail.

       "-DL" runtime option now added for tracing locale setting
           This is designed for Perl core developers to aid in field debugging
           bugs regarding locales.

       -F now implies -a and -a implies -n
           Previously -F without -a was a no-op, and -a without -n or -p was a no-
           op, with this change, if you supply -F then both -a and -n are implied
           and if you supply -a then -n is implied.

       $a and $b warnings exemption
           The special variables $a and $b, used in "sort", are now exempt from
           "used once" warnings, even where "sort" is not used.  This makes it
           easier for CPAN modules to provide functions using $a and $b for
           similar purposes.  [perl #120462]

    Security
       Avoid possible read of free()d memory during parsing
           It was possible that free()d memory could be read during parsing in the
           unusual circumstance of the Perl program ending with a heredoc and the
           last line of the file on disk having no terminating newline character.
           This has now been fixed.

    Incompatible Changes
       "do" can no longer be used to call subroutines
           The "do SUBROUTINE(LIST)" form has resulted in a deprecation warning
           since Perl v5.0.0, and is now a syntax error.

       Quote-like escape changes
           The character after "\c" in a double-quoted string ("..." or qq(...))
           or regular expression must now be a printable character and may not be

    Details are in "Beyond Unicode code points" in perlunicode.

       "\p{All}" has been expanded to match all possible code points
           The Perl-defined regular expression pattern element "\p{All}", unused
           on CPAN, used to match just the Unicode code points; now it matches all
           possible code points; that is, it is equivalent to "qr/./s".  Thus

           the program is running under is not supposed to be visible to Perl code
           except within the scope of a "use locale".  However, until now under

    Assignments of Windows sockets error codes to $! now prefer errno.h values
           over WSAGetLastError() values
           In previous versions of Perl, Windows sockets error codes as returned
           by WSAGetLastError() were assigned to $!, and some constants such as
           ECONNABORTED, not in errno.h in VC++ (or the various Windows ports of
           gcc) were defined to corresponding WSAE* values to allow $! to be
           tested against the E* constants exported by Errno and POSIX.

           This worked well until VC++ 2010 and later, which introduced new E*
           constants with values > 100 into errno.h, including some being
           (re)defined by perl to WSAE* values.  That caused problems when linking
           XS code against other libraries which used the original definitions of
           errno.h constants.

           To avoid this incompatibility, perl now maps WSAE* error codes to E*
           values where possible, and assigns those values to $!.  The E*
           constants exported by Errno and POSIX are updated to match so that
           testing $! against them, wherever previously possible, will continue to
           work as expected, and all E* constants found in errno.h are now

    In order to avoid breakage in existing Perl code which assigns WSAE*
           values to $!, perl now intercepts the assignment and performs the same
           mapping to E* values as it uses internally when assigning to $! itself.

           However, one backwards-incompatibility remains: existing Perl code
           which compares $! against the numeric values of the WSAE* error codes
           that were previously assigned to $! will now be broken in those cases
           where a corresponding E* value has been assigned instead.  This is only
           an issue for those E* values < 100, which were always exported from
           Errno and POSIX with their original errno.h values, and therefore could
           not be used for WSAE* error code tests (e.g. WSAEINVAL is 10022, but
           the corresponding EINVAL is 22).  (E* values > 100, if present, were
           redefined to WSAE* values anyway, so compatibility can be achieved by

    Functions "PerlIO_vsprintf" and "PerlIO_sprintf" have been removed
           These two functions, undocumented, unused in CPAN, and problematic,
           have been removed.

    Deprecations
       The "/\C/" character class
           The "/\C/" regular expression character class is deprecated. From perl
           5.22 onwards it will generate a warning, and from perl 5.24 onwards it
           will be a regular expression compiler error. If you need to examine the
           individual bytes that make up a UTF8-encoded character, then use
           "utf8::encode()" on the string (or a copy) first.

       Literal control characters in variable names
           This deprecation affects things like $\cT, where \cT is a literal
           control (such as a "NAK" or "NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE" character) in the
           source code.  Surprisingly, it appears that originally this was
           intended as the canonical way of accessing variables like $^T, with the
           caret form only being added as an alternative.

           The literal control form is being deprecated for two main reasons.  It
           has what are likely unfixable bugs, such as $\cI not working as an
           alias for $^I, and their usage not being portable to non-ASCII
           platforms: While $^T will work everywhere, \cT is whitespace in EBCDIC.

           address of the references in future it may behave differently, so we
           have forbidden this usage.

       Character matching routines in POSIX
           Use of any of these functions in the "POSIX" module is now deprecated:
           "isalnum", "isalpha", "iscntrl", "isdigit", "isgraph", "islower",
           "isprint", "ispunct", "isspace", "isupper", and "isxdigit".  The

    Obituary
           Diana Rosa, 27, of Rio de Janeiro, went to her long rest on May 10,
           2014, along with the plush camel she kept hanging on her computer
           screen all the time. She was a passionate Perl hacker who loved the
           language and its community, and who never missed a Rio.pm event. She
           was a true artist, an enthusiast about writing code, singing arias and
           graffiting walls. We'll never forget you.

           Greg McCarroll died on August 28, 2013.

           Greg was well known for many good reasons. He was one of the organisers
           of the first YAPC::Europe, which concluded with an unscheduled auction
           where he frantically tried to raise extra money to avoid the conference
           making a loss. It was Greg who mistakenly arrived for a london.pm
           meeting a week late; some years later he was the one who sold the
           choice of official meeting date at a YAPC::Europe auction, and
           eventually as glorious leader of london.pm he got to inherit the
           irreverent confusion that he had created.

    Manpage text:

    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
           generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
           include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
           reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

           Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
           modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
           community for helping Perl to flourish.

           For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
           please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
           recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
           database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
           information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.
