However, in this case the\n       external program listens on a Unix domain socket.  This makes it\n       possible to have a pool of processes, which persist between requests.\n       This allows multithreaded operation and a higher level of efficiency.\n       The external program must have been started independently; slapd(8)\n       itself will not start it.\n\n       This module may also be used as an overlay on top of some other\n       database.  Use as an overlay allows external actions to be triggered in\n       response to operations on the main database.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       These slapd.conf options apply to the SOCK backend database.  That is,\n       they must follow a \"database sock\" line and come before any subsequent\n       \"backend\" or \"database\" lines.  Other database options are described in\n       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\n       Alternatively, to use this module as an overlay, these directives must\n       follow an \"overlay sock\" line within an existing database definition.\n\n       extensions [ binddn | peername | ssf | connid ]*\n\t      Enables the sending of additional meta-attributes with each\n\t      request.\n\t      binddn: <bound DN>\n\t      peername: IP=<address>:<port>\n\t      ssf: <SSF value>\n\t      connid: <connection ID>\n\n       socketpath <pathname>\n\t      Gives the path to a Unix domain socket to which the commands\n\t      will be sent and from which replies are received.\n\n\t      When used as an overlay, these additional directives are\n\t      defined:\n\n       sockops\t [ bind | unbind | search | compare | modify | modrdn | add |\n       delete ]*\n\t      Specify which request types to send to the external program. The\n\t      default is empty (no requests are sent).\n\n       sockresps [ result | search ]*\n\t      Specify which response types to send to the external program.\n\t      \"result\" sends just the results of an operation. \"search\" sends\n\t      all entries that the database returned for a search request. The\n\t      default is empty (no responses are sent)."

    ACCESS CONTROL
           The sock backend does not honor all ACL semantics as described in
           slapd.access(5).  In general, access to objects is checked by using a
           dummy object that contains only the DN, so access rules that rely on
           the contents of the object are not honored.  In detail:

           The add operation does not require write (=w) access to the children
           pseudo-attribute of the parent entry.

           The bind operation requires auth (=x) access to the entry pseudo-
           attribute of the entry whose identity is being assessed; auth (=x)
           access to the credentials is not checked, but rather delegated to the
           underlying program.

           The compare operation requires compare (=c) access to the entry pseudo-
           attribute of the object whose value is being asserted; compare (=c)
           access to the attribute whose value is being asserted is not checked.

           The delete operation does not require write (=w) access to the children
           pseudo-attribute of the parent entry.

           The modify operation requires write (=w) access to the entry pseudo-
           attribute; write (=w) access to the specific attributes that are
           modified is not checked.

           The modrdn operation does not require write (=w) access to the children
           pseudo-attribute of the parent entry, nor to that of the new parent, if
           different; write (=w) access to the distinguished values of the naming
           attributes is not checked.

           The search operation does not require search (=s) access to the entry
           pseudo_attribute of the searchBase; search (=s) access to the
           attributes and values used in the filter is not checked.
