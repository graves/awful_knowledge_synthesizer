Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package provides additional commands to work with the\n       serializations of parsing expressions as managed by the PEG and related\n       packages, and specified in section PE serialization format.\n\n       This is an internal package, for use by the higher level packages\n       handling PEGs, their conversion into and out of various other formats,\n       or other uses.\n\nAPI\n       ::pt::pe::op drop dropset pe\n\t      This command removes all occurences of any of the nonterminals\n\t      symbols in the set dropset from the parsing expression pe, and\n\t      simplifies it. This may result in the expression becoming\n\t      \"epsilon\", i.e. matching nothing.\n\n       ::pt::pe::op rename nt ntnew pe\n\t      This command renames all occurences of the nonterminal nt in the\n\t      parsing expression pe into ntnew.\n\n       ::pt::pe::op called pe\n\t      This command extracts the set of all nonterminal symbols used,\n\t      i.e. 'called', in the parsing expression pe.\n\n       ::pt::pe::op flatten pe\n\t      This command transforms the parsing expression by eliminating\n\t      sequences nested in sequences, and choices in choices, lifting\n\t      the children of the nested expression into the parent. It\n\t      further eliminates all sequences and choices with only one\n\t      child, as these are redundant.\n\n\t      The resulting parsing expression is returned as the result of\n\t      the command.\n\n       ::pt::pe::op fusechars pe\n\t      This command transforms the parsing expression by fusing\n\t      adjacent terminals in sequences and adjacent terminals and\n\t      ranges in choices, it (re)constructs highlevel strings and\n\t      character classes.\n\n\t      The resulting pseudo-parsing expression is returned as the\n\t      result of the command and may contain the pseudo-operators str\n\t      for character sequences, aka strings, and cl for character\n\t      choices, aka character classes.\n\n\t      The result is called a pseudo-parsing expression because it is\n\t      not a true parsing expression anymore, and will fail a check\n\t      with ::pt::peg verify if the new pseudo-operators are present in\n\t      the result, but is otherwise of sound structure for a parsing\n\t      expression.  Notably, the commands ::pt::peg bottomup and\n\t      ::pt::peg topdown will process them without trouble.\n\nPE SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize\n       Parsing Expressions as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       parsing expression may have more than one regular serialization only\n       exactly one of them will be canonical.\n\n       Regular serialization\n\n\t      Atomic Parsing Expressions\n\n\t\t     [1]    The string epsilon is an atomic parsing\n\t\t\t    expression.

It matches the nonterminal A.\n\n\t      Combined Parsing Expressions\n\n\t\t     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of\n\t\t\t    [list / e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as\n\t\t\t    well.  This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized\n\t\t\t    choice.\n\n\t\t     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of\n\t\t\t    [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as\n\t\t\t    well.  This is the sequence.\n\n\t\t     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list *\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    kleene closure, describing zero or more\n\t\t\t    repetitions.\n\n\t\t     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list +\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.

This is the\n\t\t\t    optional input.\n\n       Canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the\n\t      format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally\n\t      satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all\n\t      the possible serializations of this parsing expression.\n\n\t      [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical\n\t\t     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not\n\t\t     contain superfluous whitespace.\n\n\t      [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end\n\t\t     of the range are identical).\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the\n       rule"
