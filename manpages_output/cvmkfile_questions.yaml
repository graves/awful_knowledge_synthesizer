Additionally, a file can be placed onto a specific\n       storage pool by specifying the key value, which is used as the affinity\n       locator. See snfs_config(5) for more details about affinities.\n\n       WARNING: This will destroy all existing data for the specified file\n       unless the -e option is used.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -e     The -e option tells cvmkfile not to clobber an existing file,\n\t      just expand or verify the requested space.  The default behavior\n\t      is to unlink and re-create an existing file (see WARNING above).\n\n       -k key The -k key optionally tells the file system where to place the\n\t      data file.  If an Affinity Key is specified, the file is placed\n\t      on storage pools that are specified to support this key. If\n\t      there is no storage pool with the key specified, then the file\n\t      is placed in non-exclusive data pools. If there are no non-\n\t      exclusive data pools, then ENOSPC (no space) is returned."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use cvmkfile to create a pre-allocated file of 10 megabytes on an Xsan volume without overwriting existing data?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using cvmkfile to assign a specific affinity key 'MyKey' to a 5 gigabyte file?

The allocation extent\n\t      will always line up on and be a perfect multiple of the number\n\t      of blocks specified in PerfectFitSize.\n\n       -r     The -r option causes the file to be written with pseudo-random\n\t      data. This can take a significant amount of time.\n\n       -s     The -s option forces the allocation to line up on the beginning\n\t      block modulus of the storage pool. This can help performance in\n\t      situations where the I/O size perfectly spans the width of the\n\t      storage pool's disks.\n\n       -w     The -w option sets the file size to be equal to size.  Without\n\t      this option the blocks are allocated but the size is set to\n\t      zero.  NOTE: Unless the -z option is used, the new file will\n\t      contain undefined data.  Using the -w option is not recommended\n\t      unless absolutely needed, and beware that it could cause some\n\t      write operations to become read-modify-write operations."
