The database is recomputed periodically (usually\n     weekly or daily), and contains the pathnames of all files which are\n     publicly accessible.\n\n     Shell globbing and quoting characters (“*”, “?”, “\\”, “[” and “]”) may be\n     used in pattern, although they will have to be escaped from the shell.\n     Preceding any character with a backslash (“\\”) eliminates any special\n     meaning which it may have.  The matching differs in that no characters\n     must be matched explicitly, including slashes (“/”).\n\n     As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (“foo”) is\n     matched as though it were “*foo*”.\n\n     Historically, locate only stored characters between 32 and 127.  The\n     current implementation stores any character except newline (‘\\n’) and NUL\n     (‘\\0’).  The 8-bit character support does not waste extra space for plain\n     ASCII file names.\tCharacters less than 32 or greater than 127 are stored\n     in 2 bytes."

Many new features were\n     added in FreeBSD 2.2.\n\nBUGS\n     The locate program may fail to list some files that are present, or may\n     list files that have been removed from the system.  This is because\n     locate only reports files that are present in the database, which is\n     typically only regenerated once a week by the\n     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist job.\tUse find(1) to\n     locate files that are of a more transitory nature.\n\n     The locate database is typically built by user “nobody” and the\n     locate.updatedb(8) utility skips directories which are not readable for\n     user “nobody”, group “nobody”, or world.  For example, if your HOME\n     directory is not world-readable, none of your files are in the database.\n\n     The locate database is not byte order independent.  It is not possible to\n     share the databases between machines with different byte order.  The\n     current locate implementation understands databases in host byte order or\n     network byte order if both architectures use the same integer size.  So\n     on a FreeBSD/i386 machine (little endian), you can read a locate database\n     which was built on SunOS/sparc machine (big endian, net)."
