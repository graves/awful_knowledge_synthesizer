It covers common problems, debugging, profiling,\n       and more.\n\n       If you haven't read perlhack and perlhacktut yet, you might want to do\n       that first.\n\nCOMMON PROBLEMS\n       Perl source plays by ANSI C89 rules: no C99 (or C++) extensions.  You\n       don't care about some particular platform having broken Perl? I hear\n       there is still a strong demand for J2EE programmers.\n\n   Perl environment problems\n       •   Not compiling with threading\n\n\t   Compiling with threading (-Duseithreads) completely rewrites the\n\t   function prototypes of Perl.  You better try your changes with\n\t   that.  Related to this is the difference between \"Perl_-less\" and\n\t   \"Perl_-ly\" APIs, for example:\n\n\t     Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...);\n\t     sv_setiv(...);\n\n\t   The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is needed for\n\t   e.g. threaded builds.  The second one does that implicitly; do not\n\t   get them mixed.  If you are not passing in a aTHX_, you will need\n\t   to do a dTHX as the first thing in the function."

They are bad form and complicate multithreading and other\n\t   forms of concurrency.  The right way is to introduce them as new\n\t   interpreter variables, see intrpvar.h (at the very end for binary\n\t   compatibility).\n\n\t   Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long as you\n\t   verify with e.g. \"nm libperl.a|egrep -v ' [TURtr] '\" (if your \"nm\"\n\t   has BSD-style output) that the data you added really is read-only.\n\t   (If it is, it shouldn't show up in the output of that command.)\n\n\t   If you want to have static strings, make them constant:\n\n\t     static const char etc[] = \"...\";"

    Portability problems
           The following are common causes of compilation and/or execution
           failures, not common to Perl as such.  The C FAQ is good bedtime
           reading.  Please test your changes with as many C compilers and
           platforms as possible; we will, anyway, and it's nice to save oneself
           from public embarrassment.

           If using gcc, you can add the "-std=c89" option which will hopefully
           catch most of these unportabilities.  (However it might also catch
           incompatibilities in your system's header files.)

           Use the Configure "-Dgccansipedantic" flag to enable the gcc "-ansi
           -pedantic" flags which enforce stricter ANSI rules.

           If using the "gcc -Wall" note that not all the possible warnings (like
           "-Wuninitialized") are given unless you also compile with "-O".

           Note that if using gcc, starting from Perl 5.9.5 the Perl core source
           code files (the ones at the top level of the source code distribution,
           but not e.g. the extensions under ext/) are automatically compiled with
           as many as possible of the "-std=c89", "-ansi", "-pedantic", and a
           selection of "-W" flags (see cflags.SH).

Sometimes, though,\n\t   a test can't use a function and it's inconvenient to have different\n\t   test versions depending on the platform.  There are 20 code points\n\t   that are the same in all 4 character sets currently recognized by\n\t   Perl (the 3 EBCDIC code pages plus ISO 8859-1 (ASCII/Latin1)).\n\t   These can be used in such tests, though there is a small\n\t   possibility that Perl will become available in yet another\n\t   character set, breaking your test.  All but one of these code\n\t   points are C0 control characters.  The most significant controls\n\t   that are the same are \"\\0\", \"\\r\", and \"\\N{VT}\" (also specifiable as\n\t   \"\\cK\", \"\\x0B\", \"\\N{U+0B}\", or \"\\013\").  The single non-control is\n\t   U+00B6 PILCROW SIGN.  The controls that are the same have the same\n\t   bit pattern in all 4 character sets, regardless of the UTF8ness of\n\t   the string containing them.\tThe bit pattern for U+B6 is the same\n\t   in all 4 for non-UTF8 strings, but differs in each when its\n\t   containing string is UTF-8 encoded.\tThe only other code points\n\t   that have some sort of sameness across all 4 character sets are the\n\t   pair 0xDC and 0xFC.\tTogether these represent upper- and lowercase\n\t   LATIN LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS, but which is upper and which is\n\t   lower may be reversed: 0xDC is the capital in Latin1 and 0xFC is\n\t   the small letter, while 0xFC is the capital in EBCDIC and 0xDC is\n\t   the small one.

Perl has light-weight wrappers for some of these\n\t   functions, and which don't make copies of the static memory.  A\n\t   good example is the interface to the environment variables that are\n\t   in effect for the program.  Perl has \"PerlEnv_getenv\" to get values\n\t   from the environment.

If you are using the value to immediately test\n\t   for something, that's fine, but if you save the value and expect it\n\t   to be unchanged by later processing, you would be wrong, but\n\t   perhaps you wouldn't know it because different C library\n\t   implementations behave differently, and the one on the platform\n\t   you're testing on might work for your situation.  But on some\n\t   platforms, a subsequent call to \"PerlEnv_getenv\" or related\n\t   function WILL overwrite the memory that your first call points to.\n\t   This has led to some hard-to-debug problems.  Do a \"savepv\" in\n\t   perlapi to make a copy, thus avoiding these problems.  You will\n\t   have to free the copy when you're done to avoid memory leaks.

But when \"c\" is a\n\t   \"NUL\", \"strchr\" returns a pointer to the terminating \"NUL\" in\n\t   \"list\".   This likely will result in a segfault or a security issue\n\t   when the caller uses that end pointer as the starting point to read\n\t   from.\n\n\t   A solution to this and many similar issues is to use the \"mem\"-foo\n\t   C library functions instead.  In this case \"memchr\" can be used to\n\t   see if \"c\" is in \"list\" and works even if \"c\" is \"NUL\".  These\n\t   functions need an additional parameter to give the string length.\n\t   In the case of literal string parameters, perl has defined macros\n\t   that calculate the length for you.

    Warnings of other C compilers
           Other C compilers (yes, there are other C compilers than gcc) often
           have their "strict ANSI" or "strict ANSI with some portability
           extensions" modes on, like for example the Sun Workshop has its "-Xa"
           mode on (though implicitly), or the DEC (these days, HP...) has its
           "-std1" mode on.

    MEMORY DEBUGGERS
           NOTE 1: Running under older memory debuggers such as Purify, valgrind
           or Third Degree greatly slows down the execution: seconds become
           minutes, minutes become hours.  For example as of Perl 5.8.1, the
           ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes extraordinarily long to complete under
           e.g. Purify, Third Degree, and valgrind.  Under valgrind it takes more
           than six hours, even on a snappy computer.  The said test must be doing
           something that is quite unfriendly for memory debuggers.  If you don't
           feel like waiting, that you can simply kill away the perl process.

    Manpage text:

    The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU program counter,
           and since the program counter can be correlated with the code generated
           for functions, we get a statistical view of in which functions the
           program is spending its time.  The caveats are that very small/fast
           functions have lower probability of showing up in the profile, and that
           periodically interrupting the program (this is usually done rather
           frequently, in the scale of milliseconds) imposes an additional
           overhead that may skew the results.  The first problem can be
           alleviated by running the code for longer (in general this is a good
           idea for profiling), the second problem is usually kept in guard by the
           profiling tools themselves.

           The second method divides up the generated code into basic blocks.
           Basic blocks are sections of code that are entered only in the
           beginning and exited only at the end.  For example, a conditional jump
           starts a basic block.  Basic block profiling usually works by
           instrumenting the code by adding enter basic block #nnnn book-keeping
           code to the generated code.  During the execution of the code the basic
           block counters are then updated appropriately.  The caveat is that the
           added extra code can skew the results: again, the profiling tools
           usually try to factor their own effects out of the results.

       C backtrace
           On some platforms Perl supports retrieving the C level backtrace
           (similar to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).

           The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames, with the
           symbol names (function names), the object names (like "perl"), and if
           it can, also the source code locations (file:line).

           The supported platforms are Linux, and OS X (some *BSD might work at
           least partly, but they have not yet been tested).

           This feature hasn't been tested with multiple threads, but it will only
           show the backtrace of the thread doing the backtracing.

           The feature needs to be enabled with "Configure -Dusecbacktrace".
