This is only possible when frame pointers\n     are pushed to the stack, alongside the return addresses.  clang(1),\n     disables this behavior with the -fomit-frame-pointer flag, so it will\n     prevent these functions from working.  Furthermore, leaf functions and\n     inlined function calls can also prevent backtracing from reporting the\n     source-level function control flow.  backtrace_user() operates on user\n     call stacks, while backtrace() captures the current kernel call stack.\n     backtrace_packed() writes a more compact representation of the return\n     addresses to a buffer, which can be unpacked with backtrace_unpack(9).\n     Calling backtrace_user() on a kernel thread (which lacks a user context)\n     is undefined."
