This form\n     is assumed when the last operand does not name an already existing\n     directory.\n\n     In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to a\n     destination file in the existing directory named by the directory\n     operand.  The destination path for each operand is the pathname produced\n     by the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname\n     component of the named file.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -f      Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination\n\t     path.  (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n options.)\n\n     -h      If the target operand is a symbolic link to a directory, do not\n\t     follow it.  This causes the mv utility to rename the file source\n\t     to the destination path target rather than moving source into the\n\t     directory referenced by target."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mv`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-i      Cause mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file\n\t     that would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from the\n\t     standard input begins with the character ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the move is\n\t     attempted.  (The -i option overrides any previous -f or -n\n\t     options.)\n\n     -n      Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any\n\t     previous -f or -i options.)\n\n     -v      Cause mv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.\n\n     It is an error for the source operand to specify a directory if the\n     target exists and is not a directory.\n\n     If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mv\n     prompts the user for confirmation as specified for the -i option.\n\n     As the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mv uses cp(1)\n     and rm(1) to accomplish the move.\tThe effect is equivalent to:\n\n\t   rm -f destination_path && \\\n\t   cp -pRP source_file destination && \\\n\t   rm -rf source_file\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The mv utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs."

The mv utility will no longer strip resource forks off\n     of HFS files.  For an alternative method, refer to cp(1).\n\nSEE ALSO\n     cp(1), rm(1), symlink(7)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The mv utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”) compatible.\n\nHISTORY\n     A mv command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\tMarch 15, 2013\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
