  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the fold command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the fold command to limit the output width to 30 columns?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the -b option with fold to handle text with tabs correctly?

It was rewritten for\n     4.3BSD-Reno to improve speed and modernize style.\tThe -b and -s options\n     were added to NetBSD 1.0 for IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”) compliance.\n\nAUTHORS\n     Bill Joy wrote the original version of fold on June 28, 1977.

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the fold command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the fold command to wrap a paragraph of text so that each line does not exceed 30 characters, while preserving the original spacing and ensuring that lines are broken after the last blank character?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the difference between using the -s and -b options with the fold command, and how would you use them in practice?
