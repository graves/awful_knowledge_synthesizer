    Manpage text:

    The first character is followed by an optional event designator (see
           the section `Event Designators') and then an optional word designator
           (the section `Word Designators'); if neither of these designators is
           present, no history expansion occurs.

           Input lines containing history expansions are echoed after being
           expanded, but before any other expansions take place and before the
           command is executed.  It is this expanded form that is recorded as the
           history event for later references.

           History expansions do not nest.

           By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to the
           same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if
           it is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the
           previous command.  However, if the option CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY is set,
           then every history reference with no event specification always refers
           to the previous command.

           For example, `!' is the event designator for the previous command, so
           `!!:1' always refers to the first word of the previous command, and
           `!!$' always refers to the last word of the previous command.  With
           CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY set, then `!:1' and `!$' function in the same manner
           as `!!:1' and `!!$', respectively.  Conversely, if CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY
           is unset, then `!:1' and `!$' refer to the first and last words,
           respectively, of the same event referenced by the nearest other history
           reference preceding them on the current command line, or to the
           previous command if there is no preceding reference.

    Also note that the order of expansions affects the interpretation of l
           and r.  When used in a history expansion, which occurs before any other
           expansions, l and r are treated as literal strings (except as explained
           for HIST_SUBST_PATTERN below).  When used in parameter expansion, the
           replacement of r into the parameter's value is done first, and then any
           additional process, parameter, command, arithmetic, or brace references
           are applied, which may evaluate those substitutions and expansions more
           than once if l appears more than once in the starting value.  When used
           in a glob qualifier, any substitutions or expansions are performed once
           at the time the qualifier is parsed, even before the `:s' expression
           itself is divided into l and r sides.

           If the option HIST_SUBST_PATTERN is set, l is treated as a pattern of
           the usual form described in the section FILENAME GENERATION below.
           This can be used in all the places where modifiers are available; note,
           however, that in globbing qualifiers parameter substitution has already
           taken place, so parameters in the replacement string should be quoted
           to ensure they are replaced at the correct time.  Note also that
           complicated patterns used in globbing qualifiers may need the extended
           glob qualifier notation (#q:s/.../.../) in order for the shell to
           recognize the expression as a glob qualifier.  Further, note that bad

    Parameter expansions can involve flags, as in `${(@kv)aliases}', and
           other operators, such as `${PREFIX:-"/usr/local"}'.  Parameter
           expansions can also be nested.  These topics will be introduced below.
           The full rules are complicated and are noted at the end.

           In the expansions discussed below that require a pattern, the form of
           the pattern is the same as that used for filename generation; see the
           section `Filename Generation'.  Note that these patterns, along with
           the replacement text of any substitutions, are themselves subject to
           parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
           In addition to the following operations, the colon modifiers described
           in the section `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion' can be
           applied:  for example, ${i:s/foo/bar/} performs string substitution on
           the expansion of parameter $i.

           In the following descriptions, `word' refers to a single word

           word.

           can be specified in any of the three numbers, specifying it in the

    If a brace expression matches none of the above forms, it is left

           the individual characters between the braces sorted into the order of
           the characters in the ASCII character set (multibyte characters are not
           currently handled).  The syntax is similar to a [...] expression in
           filename generation: `-' is treated specially to denote a range of
           characters, but `^' or `!' as the first character is treated normally.
           For example, `{abcdef0-9}' expands to 16 words 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b

           In particular, note that this is liable to produce a `no match' error

           contrasted with */(foo|bar), which is treated as a single pattern but

If so, then the prefix portion is\n       replaced with a `~' followed by the name of the directory.  The shorter\n       of the two ways of referring to the directory is used, i.e. either the\n       directory name or the full path; the name is used if they are the same\n       length.\tThe parameters $PWD and $OLDPWD are never abbreviated in this\n       fashion."

    FILENAME GENERATION
           If a word contains an unquoted instance of one of the characters `*',
           `(', `|', `<', `[', or `?', it is regarded as a pattern for filename
           generation, unless the GLOB option is unset.  If the EXTENDED_GLOB
           option is set, the `^' and `#' characters also denote a pattern;
           otherwise they are not treated specially by the shell.

           The word is replaced with a list of sorted filenames that match the
           pattern.  If no matching pattern is found, the shell gives an error
           message, unless the NULL_GLOB option is set, in which case the word is
           deleted; or unless the NOMATCH option is unset, in which case the word
           is left unchanged.

           In filename generation, the character `/' must be matched explicitly;
           also, a `.' must be matched explicitly at the beginning of a pattern or
           after a `/', unless the GLOB_DOTS option is set.  No filename
           generation pattern matches the files `.' or `..'.  In other instances
           of pattern matching, the `/' and `.' are not treated specially.

The `(#s)' flag succeeds only at the start of the test\n\t      string, and the `(#e)' flag succeeds only at the end of the test\n\t      string; they correspond to `^' and `$' in standard regular\n\t      expressions.  They are useful for matching path segments in\n\t      patterns other than those in filename generation (where path\n\t      segments are in any case treated separately).  For example,\n\t      `*((#s)|/)test((#e)|/)*' matches a path segment `test' in any of\n\t      the following strings: test, test/at/start, at/end/test,\n\t      in/test/middle.\n\n\t      Another use is in parameter substitution; for example\n\t      `${array/(#s)A*Z(#e)}' will remove only elements of an array\n\t      which match the complete pattern `A*Z'.
