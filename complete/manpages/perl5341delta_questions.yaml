[GH #18874 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18874>]\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.34.1 represents approximately 10 months of development since\n       Perl 5.34.0 and contains approximately 4,600 lines of changes across 60\n       files from 23 authors.\n\n       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there\n       were approximately 1,100 lines of changes to 18 .pm, .t, .c and .h\n       files.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers. The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.34.1:\n\n       Andrew Fresh, Atsushi Sugawara, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book, Hugo\n       van der Sanden, James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Leon Timmermans,\n       Matthew Horsfall, Max Maischein, Michiel Beijen, Neil Bowers, Nicolas\n       R., Paul Evans, Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes, Richard Leach, Sawyer X,\n       Sergey Poznyakoff, Steve Hay, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.\n\n       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically\n       generated from version control history. In particular, it does not\n       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who\n       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.\n\n       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN\n       modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug\n       database at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be\n       information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.\tBe sure to trim your bug down\n       to a tiny but sufficient test case.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see \"SECURITY\n       VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\" in perlsec for details of how to\n       report the issue.\n\nGive Thanks\n       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in\n       Perl 5, you can do so by running the \"perlthanks\" program:\n\n\t   perlthanks\n\n       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of\n       thanks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-03-06\t\t      PERL5341DELTA(1)"
