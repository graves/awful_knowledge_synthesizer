As this document\n       is intended to be a reference the commands are listed in alphabetical\n       order, and the descriptions are relatively short.  A beginner should\n       read the much more informally written doctoc language introduction\n       first.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       comment plaintext\n\t      Toc markup. The argument text is marked up as a comment standing\n\t      outside of the actual text of the document. Main use is in free-\n\t      form text.\n\n       division_end\n\t      Toc structure. This command closes the division opened by the\n\t      last division_begin command coming before it, and not yet\n\t      closed.\n\n       division_start text ?symfile?\n\t      Toc structure. This command opens a division in the table of\n\t      contents. Its counterpart is division_end. Together they allow a\n\t      user to give a table of contents additional structure.\n\n\t      The title of the new division is provided by the argument text.\n\n\t      If the symbolic filename symfile is present then the section\n\t      title should link to the referenced document, if links are\n\t      supported by the output format.\n\n       include filename\n\t      Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as\n\t      text written in the doctoc markup and processed in the place of\n\t      the include command. The markup in the file has to be self-\n\t      contained. It is not possible for a markup command to cross the\n\t      file boundaries.\n\n       item file text desc\n\t      Toc structure. This command adds an individual element to the\n\t      table of contents. Each such element refers to a document. The\n\t      document is specified through the symbolic name file. The text\n\t      argument is used to label the reference, whereas the desc\n\t      provides a short descriptive text of that document.\n\n\t      The symbolic names are used to preserve the convertibility of\n\t      this format to any output format. The actual name of the file\n\t      will be inserted by the chosen formatting engine when converting\n\t      the input. This will be based on a mapping from symbolic to\n\t      actual names given to the engine.\n\n       lb     Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use in free-\n\t      form text. Required to avoid interpretation of a left bracket as\n\t      the start of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the\n\t      arguments of other markup commands.\n\n       rb     Text. The command is replaced with a right bracket. Use in free-\n\t      form text. Required to avoid interpretation of a right bracket\n\t      as the end of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the\n\t      arguments of other commands.\n\n       toc_begin text title\n\t      Document structure. The command to start a table of contents.\n\t      The arguments are a label for the whole group of documents the\n\t      index refers to (text) and the overall title text for the index\n\t      (title), without markup.\n\n\t      The label often is the name of the package (or extension) the\n\t      documents belong to.\n\n       toc_end\n\t      Document structure. Command to end a table of contents. Anything\n\t      in the document coming after this command is in error.\n\n       vset varname value\n\t      Templating. In this form the command sets the named document\n\t      variable to the specified value. It does not generate output.\n\t      I.e. the command is replaced by the empty string.\n\n       vset varname\n\t      Templating. In this form the command is replaced by the value of\n\t      the named document variable\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category doctools\n       of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
