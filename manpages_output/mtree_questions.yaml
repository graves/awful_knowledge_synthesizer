Messages\n     are written to the standard output for any files whose characteristics do\n     not match the specifications, or which are missing from either the file\n     hierarchy or the specification.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -c    Print a specification for the file hierarchy to the standard\n\t   output.\n\n     -d    Ignore everything except directory type files.\n\n     -e    Do not complain about files that are in the file hierarchy, but not\n\t   in the specification.\n\n     -f file\n\t   Read the specification from file, instead of from the standard\n\t   input.\n\n\t   If this option is specified twice, the two specifications are\n\t   compared with each other, rather than to the file hierarchy.  The\n\t   specifications be sorted like output generated using -c.  The\n\t   output format in this case is somewhat remniscent of comm(1),\n\t   having \"in first spec only\", \"in second spec only\", and \"different\"\n\t   columns, prefixed by zero, one and two TAB characters respectively.\n\t   Each entry in the \"different\" column occupies two lines, one from\n\t   each specification."

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mtree`.



    Manpage text:

    The first type of line sets a global value for a keyword, and consists of
         the string ``/set'' followed by whitespace, followed by sets of
         keyword/value pairs, separated by whitespace.  Keyword/value pairs
         consist of a keyword, followed by an equals sign (``=''), followed by a
         value, without whitespace characters.  Once a keyword has been set, its
         value remains unchanged until either reset or unset.

         The second type of line unsets keywords and consists of the string
         ``/unset'', followed by whitespace, followed by one or more keywords,
         separated by whitespace.

         The third type of line is a file specification and consists of a file
         name, followed by whitespace, followed by zero or more whitespace
         separated keyword/value pairs.  The file name may be preceded by
         whitespace characters.  The file name may contain any of the standard
         file name matching characters (``['', ``]'', ``?'' or ``*''), in which
         case files in the hierarchy will be associated with the first pattern
         that they match.

    Manpage text:

    Each of the keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an
         equals sign (``=''), followed by the keyword's value, without whitespace
         characters.  These values override, without changing, the global value of
         the corresponding keyword.

         All paths are relative.  Specifying a directory will cause subsequent
         files to be searched for in that directory hierarchy.  Which brings us to
         the last type of line in a specification: a line containing only the
         string “..” causes the current directory path to ascend one level.

         Empty lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is a hash mark
         (``#'') are ignored.

         The mtree utility exits with a status of 0 on success, 1 if any error
         occurred, and 2 if the file hierarchy did not match the specification.  A
         status of 2 is converted to a status of 0 if the -U option is used.

    FILES
