If device is an APFS volume, fsck_apfs will quickly\n\t       check the APFS container and the specified APFS volume.\tIf\n\t       device is an APFS container, fsck_apfs will quickly check the\n\t       APFS container and all the APFS volumes in it.  By default, no\n\t       repairs are attempted during a quick check."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use fsck_apfs to perform a quick check on an APFS volume without attempting any repairs?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using fsck_apfs to check and repair an APFS container with verbose output for debugging?
