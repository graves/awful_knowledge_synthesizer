Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       iosnoop [-a|-A|-Deghinostv] [-d device] [-f filename] [-m mount_point]\n       [-n name] [-p PID]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       iosnoop prints I/O events as they happen, with useful details such as\n       UID, PID, block number, size, filename, etc.\n\n       This is useful to determine the process responsible for using the\n       disks, as well as details on what activity the process is requesting.\n       Behaviour such as random or sequential I/O can be observed by reading\n       the block numbers.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a     print all data\n\n       -A     dump all data, space delimited\n\n       -D     print time delta, us (elapsed)\n\n       -e     print device name\n\n       -i     print device instance\n\n       -N     print major and minor numbers\n\n       -o     print disk delta time, us\n\n       -s     print start time, us\n\n       -t     print completion time, us\n\n       -v     print completion time, string\n\n       -d device\n\t      instance name to snoop (eg, dad0)\n\n       -f filename\n\t      full pathname of file to snoop\n\n       -m mount_point\n\t      mountpoint for filesystem to snoop\n\n       -n name\n\t      process name\n\n       -p PID process ID\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Default output, print I/O activity as it occurs,\n\t      # iosnoop\n\n       Print human readable timestamps,\n\t      # iosnoop -v\n\n       Print major and minor numbers,\n\t      # iosnoop -N\n\n       Snoop events on the root filesystem only,\n\t      # iosnoop -m /\n\nFIELDS\n       UID    User ID\n\n       PID    Process ID\n\n       PPID   Parent Process ID\n\n       COMM   command name for the process\n\n       ARGS   argument listing for the process\n\n       SIZE   size of the operation, bytes\n\n       BLOCK  disk block for the operation (location. relative to this\n\t      filesystem.  more useful with the -N option to print major and\n\t      minor numbers)\n\n       STIME  timestamp for the disk request, us\n\n       TIME   timestamp for the disk completion, us\n\n       DELTA  elapsed time from request to completion, us (this is the elapsed\n\t      time from the disk request (strategy) to the disk completion\n\t      (iodone))\n\n       DTIME  time for disk to complete request, us (this is the time for the\n\t      disk to complete that event since it's last event (time between\n\t      iodones), or, the time to the strategy if the disk had been\n\t      idle)\n\n       STRTIME\n\t      timestamp for the disk completion, string\n\n       DEVICE device name\n\n       INS    device instance number\n\n       D      direction, Read or Write\n\n       MOUNT  mount point\n\n       FILE   filename (basename) for I/O operation\n\nNOTES\n       When filtering on PID or process name, be aware that poor disk event\n       times may be due to events that have been filtered away, for example\n       another process that may be seeking the disk heads elsewhere.\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       iosnoop will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       iotop(1M), dtrace(1M)"
