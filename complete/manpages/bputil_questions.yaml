It is\n     possible to make your system security much weaker and therefore easier to\n     compromise using this tool. This tool is not to be used in production\n     environments. It is possible to render your system unbootable with this\n     tool. It should only be used to understand how the security of Apple\n     Silicon Macs works. Use at your own risk!\n\n     bputil performs actions by calling the BootPolicy library. This modifies\n     the security configuration of the system, which is stored in a file\n     called the LocalPolicy. This file is digitally signed by the Secure\n     Enclave Processor (SEP). The private key which is used to sign the\n     LocalPolicy is protected by a separate key which is only accessible when\n     a user has put in their password as part of a successful authentication.\n     This is why this tool must either have a username and password specified\n     on the command line, or via the interactive prompt."

    Manpage text:

    macOS 12 Monterey introduced a new concept of “paired recoveryOS”, and a
         new set of restrictions related to it. Every installation of macOS 12 has
         its own paired recoveryOS with matching version stored on the same APFS
         volume group. Installations of macOS 11 Big Sur are paired to a single
         recoveryOS stored on a separate APFS volume group called “system
         recoveryOS”.

         By design, the SEP application which is responsible for making changes to
         the LocalPolicy will inspect the boot state of the main Application
         Processor (AP), and the pairing status between the booted OS and the
         target LocalPolicy. It will only allow the below security-downgrading
         operations if it detects that the AP is in the intended boot state, and
         the OS pairing status is valid. When System Integrity Protection (SIP)
         was first introduced to Macs, it was decided that requiring a reboot to
         recoveryOS would provide intentional friction which would make it harder
         for malicious software to downgrade the system. That precedent is
         extended here to detect the special boot to recoveryOS via holding the
         power key at boot time. We refer to this as One True Recovery (1TR), and
         most of the below downgrade options will only work when booted into 1TR,
         not when called from normal macOS or any other OS environment. This helps
         ensure that only a physically-present user, not malicious software
         running in macOS, can permanently downgrade the security settings. The
         below CLI options specify what boot environments a downgrade can be
         performed from.

If a\n\tmacOS 11 installation is selected to boot by default, then the system\n\trecoveryOS will be booted by holding down the power key at boot time.\n\tThe system recoveryOS can downgrade security settings of any macOS 11\n\tinstallations, but not any installations of macOS 12.\n\n     - Every installation of macOS 12 is paired to a recoveryOS stored on the\n\tcorresponding APFS volume group.

The paired recoveryOS can\n\tdowngrade security settings for the paired macOS installation, but not\n\tany other macOS installation.\n\n     The SEP-signed LocalPolicy is evaluated at boot time by iBoot.\n     Configurations within the LocalPolicy change iBoot's behavior, such as\n     whether it will require that all boot objects must be signed with\n     metadata specific to the particular machine (a “personalized” signature,\n     which is the default, and the always-required policy on iOS), or whether\n     it will accept “global” signatures which are valid for all units of a\n     specific hardware model. The LocalPolicy can also influence other boot or\n     OS security behavior as described in the below options."
