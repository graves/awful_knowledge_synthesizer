This is repeated until standard input is\n     exhausted.\n\n     Spaces, tabs and newlines may be embedded in arguments using single\n     (`` ' '') or double (``\"'') quotes or backslashes (``\\'').  Single quotes\n     escape all non-single quote characters, excluding newlines, up to the\n     matching single quote.  Double quotes escape all non-double quote\n     characters, excluding newlines, up to the matching double quote.  Any\n     single character, including newlines, may be escaped by a backslash."

It will not be recognized if, for\n\t     instance, it is in the middle of a quoted string.\tFurthermore,\n\t     only the first occurrence of the replstr will be replaced.  For\n\t     example, the following command will copy the list of files and\n\t     directories which start with an uppercase letter in the current\n\t     directory to destdir:\n\n\t\t   /bin/ls -1d [A-Z]* | xargs -J % cp -Rp % destdir\n\n     -L number\n\t     Call utility for every number lines read.\tIf EOF is reached and\n\t     fewer lines have been read than number then utility will be\n\t     called with the available lines."
