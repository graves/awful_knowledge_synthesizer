If the permissions of the file do not permit\n     writing, and the standard input device is a terminal, the user is\n     prompted (on the standard error output) for confirmation.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -d      Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.\n\n     -f      Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,\n\t     regardless of the file's permissions.  If the file does not\n\t     exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify the exit\n\t     status to reflect an error.  The -f option overrides any previous\n\t     -i options.\n\n     -i      Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file,\n\t     regardless of the file's permissions, or whether or not the\n\t     standard input device is a terminal.  The -i option overrides any\n\t     previous -f options."

If the -i option\n\t     is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation before each\n\t     directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt\n\t     is made to remove the directory).\tIf the user does not respond\n\t     affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in that directory is\n\t     skipped.\n\n     -r      Equivalent to -R.\n\n     -v      Be verbose when deleting files, showing them as they are removed.\n\n     -W      Attempt to undelete the named files.  Currently, this option can\n\t     only be used to recover files covered by whiteouts in a union\n\t     file system (see undelete(2))."

No options may be supplied in this\n     simple mode of operation, which performs an unlink(2) operation on the\n     passed argument.  However, the usual option-end delimiter, --, may\n     optionally precede the argument.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The rm utility exits 0 if all of the named files or file hierarchies were\n     removed, or if the -f option was specified and all of the existing files\n     or file hierarchies were removed.\tIf an error occurs, rm exits with a\n     value >0.\n\nNOTES\n     The rm command uses getopt(3) to parse its arguments, which allows it to\n     accept the ‘--’ option which will cause it to stop processing flag\n     options at that point.  This will allow the removal of file names that\n     begin with a dash (‘-’).  For example:"
