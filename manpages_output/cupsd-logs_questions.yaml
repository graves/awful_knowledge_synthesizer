    Manpage text:

    The host field will normally only be an IP address unless you have
           enabled the HostNameLookups directive in the cupsd.conf file or if the
           IP address corresponds to your local machine.

           The group field always contains "-".

           The user field is the authenticated username of the requesting user.
           If no username and password is supplied for the request then this field
           contains "-".

           The date-time field is the date and time of the request in local time
           and is in the format "[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ]".

           The method field is the HTTP method used: "GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS",
           "POST", or "PUT".  "GET" requests are used to get files from the
           server, both for the web interface and to get configuration and log
           files.  "HEAD" requests are used to get information about a resource
           prior to a "GET".  "OPTIONS" requests are used to upgrade connections
           to TLS encryption.  "POST" requests are used for web interface forms
           and IPP requests.  "PUT" requests are used to upload configuration
           files.
