This program is deprecated and will be removed in a\n       future release of CUPS.\n\nOPTIONS\n       ppdpo supports the following options:\n\n       -D name[=value]\n\t    Sets the named variable for use in the source file.  It is\n\t    equivalent to using the #define directive in the source file.\n\n       -I include-directory\n\t    Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can\n\t    be supplied to add additional directories.\n\n       -o output-file\n\t    Specifies the output file.\tThe supported extensions are .po or\n\t    .po.gz for GNU gettext format message catalogs and .strings for\n\t    macOS strings files."
