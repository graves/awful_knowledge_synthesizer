It is a command language interpreter usable both\n       as an interactive login shell and a shell script command processor.  It\n       includes a command-line editor (see The command-line editor),\n       programmable word completion (see Completion and listing), spelling\n       correction (see Spelling correction), a history mechanism (see History\n       substitution), job control (see Jobs) and a C-like syntax.  The NEW\n       FEATURES section describes major enhancements of tcsh over csh(1).\n       Throughout this manual, features of tcsh not found in most csh(1)\n       implementations (specifically, the 4.4BSD csh) are labeled with `(+)',\n       and features which are present in csh(1) but not usually documented are\n       labeled with `(u)'.\n\n   Argument list processing\n       If the first argument (argument 0) to the shell is `-' then it is a\n       login shell.  A login shell can be also specified by invoking the shell\n       with the -l flag as the only argument.\n\n       The rest of the flag arguments are interpreted as follows:\n\n       -b  Forces a ``break'' from option processing, causing any further\n\t   shell arguments to be treated as non-option arguments.  The\n\t   remaining arguments will not be interpreted as shell options.  This\n\t   may be used to pass options to a shell script without confusion or\n\t   possible subterfuge.  The shell will not run a set-user ID script\n\t   without this option.\n\n       -c  Commands are read from the following argument (which must be\n\t   present, and must be a single argument), stored in the command\n\t   shell variable for reference, and executed.\tAny remaining\n\t   arguments are placed in the argv shell variable.\n\n       -d  The shell loads the directory stack from ~/.cshdirs as described\n\t   under Startup and shutdown, whether or not it is a login shell. (+)\n\n       -Dname[=value]\n\t   Sets the environment variable name to value. (Domain/OS only) (+)\n\n       -e  The shell exits if any invoked command terminates abnormally or\n\t   yields a non-zero exit status.\n\n       -f  The shell does not load any resource or startup files, or perform\n\t   any command hashing, and thus starts faster.\n\n       -F  The shell uses fork(2) instead of vfork(2) to spawn processes. This\n\t   is now the default and this option is ignored. (+)\n\n       -i  The shell is interactive and prompts for its top-level input, even\n\t   if it appears to not be a terminal.\tShells are interactive without\n\t   this option if their inputs and outputs are terminals.\n\n       -l  The shell is a login shell.\tApplicable only if -l is the only flag\n\t   specified.\n\n       -m  The shell loads ~/.tcshrc even if it does not belong to the\n\t   effective user.  Newer versions of su(1) can pass -m to the shell.\n\t   (+)\n\n       -n  The shell parses commands but does not execute them.  This aids in\n\t   debugging shell scripts.\n\n       -q  The shell accepts SIGQUIT (see Signal handling) and behaves when it\n\t   is used under a debugger.  Job control is disabled. (u)\n\n       -s  Command input is taken from the standard input.\n\n       -t  The shell reads and executes a single line of input.  A `\\' may be\n\t   used to escape the newline at the end of this line and continue\n\t   onto another line.\n\n       -v  Sets the verbose shell variable, so that command input is echoed\n\t   after history substitution.\n\n       -x  Sets the echo shell variable, so that commands are echoed\n\t   immediately before execution.\n\n       -V  Sets the verbose shell variable even before executing ~/.tcshrc.\n\n       -X  Is to -x as -V is to -v.\n\n       --help\n\t   Print a help message on the standard output and exit. (+)\n\n       --version\n\t   Print the version/platform/compilation options on the standard\n\t   output and exit.  This information is also contained in the version\n\t   shell variable. (+)\n\n       After processing of flag arguments, if arguments remain but none of the\n       -c, -i, -s, or -t options were given, the first argument is taken as\n       the name of a file of commands, or ``script'', to be executed.  The\n       shell opens this file and saves its name for possible resubstitution by\n       `$0'.  Because many systems use either the standard version 6 or\n       version 7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible with this\n       shell, the shell uses such a `standard' shell to execute a script whose\n       first character is not a `#', i.e., that does not start with a comment.\n\n       Remaining arguments are placed in the argv shell variable.\n\n   Startup and shutdown\n       A login shell begins by executing commands from the system files\n       /etc/csh.cshrc and /etc/csh.login.  It then executes commands from\n       files in the user's home directory: first ~/.tcshrc (+) or, if\n       ~/.tcshrc is not found, ~/.cshrc, then the contents of ~/.history (or\n       the value of the histfile shell variable) are loaded into memory, then\n       ~/.login, and finally ~/.cshdirs (or the value of the dirsfile shell\n       variable) (+).  The shell may read /etc/csh.login before instead of\n       after /etc/csh.cshrc, and ~/.login before instead of after ~/.tcshrc or\n       ~/.cshrc and ~/.history, if so compiled; see the version shell\n       variable. (+)\n\n       Non-login shells read only /etc/csh.cshrc and ~/.tcshrc or ~/.cshrc on\n       startup.\n\n       For examples of startup files, please consult\n       http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net.\n\n       Commands like stty(1) and tset(1), which need be run only once per\n       login, usually go in one's ~/.login file.  Users who need to use the\n       same set of files with both csh(1) and tcsh can have only a ~/.cshrc\n       which checks for the existence of the tcsh shell variable (q.v.) before\n       using tcsh-specific commands, or can have both a ~/.cshrc and a\n       ~/.tcshrc which sources (see the builtin command) ~/.cshrc.  The rest\n       of this manual uses `~/.tcshrc' to mean `~/.tcshrc or, if ~/.tcshrc is\n       not found, ~/.cshrc'.\n\n       In the normal case, the shell begins reading commands from the\n       terminal, prompting with `> '.  (Processing of arguments and the use of\n       the shell to process files containing command scripts are described\n       later.)\tThe shell repeatedly reads a line of command input, breaks it\n       into words, places it on the command history list, parses it and\n       executes each command in the line.\n\n       One can log out by typing `^D' on an empty line, `logout' or `login' or\n       via the shell's autologout mechanism (see the autologout shell\n       variable).  When a login shell terminates it sets the logout shell\n       variable to `normal' or `automatic' as appropriate, then executes\n       commands from the files /etc/csh.logout and ~/.logout.  The shell may\n       drop DTR on logout if so compiled; see the version shell variable.\n\n       The names of the system login and logout files vary from system to\n       system for compatibility with different csh(1) variants; see FILES.\n\n   Editing\n       We first describe The command-line editor.  The Completion and listing\n       and Spelling correction sections describe two sets of functionality\n       that are implemented as editor commands but which deserve their own\n       treatment.  Finally, Editor commands lists and describes the editor\n       commands specific to the shell and their default bindings.\n\n   The command-line editor (+)\n       Command-line input can be edited using key sequences much like those\n       used in emacs(1) or vi(1).  The editor is active only when the edit\n       shell variable is set, which it is by default in interactive shells.\n       The bindkey builtin can display and change key bindings.\n       emacs(1)-style key bindings are used by default (unless the shell was\n       compiled otherwise; see the version shell variable), but bindkey can\n       change the key bindings to vi(1)-style bindings en masse.\n\n       The shell always binds the arrow keys (as defined in the TERMCAP\n       environment variable) to\n\n\t   down    down-history\n\t   up\t   up-history\n\t   left    backward-char\n\t   right   forward-char\n\n       unless doing so would alter another single-character binding.  One can\n       set the arrow key escape sequences to the empty string with settc to\n       prevent these bindings.\tThe ANSI/VT100 sequences for arrow keys are\n       always bound.\n\n       Other key bindings are, for the most part, what emacs(1) and vi(1)\n       users would expect and can easily be displayed by bindkey, so there is\n       no need to list them here.  Likewise, bindkey can list the editor\n       commands with a short description of each.  Certain key bindings have\n       different behavior depending if emacs(1) or vi(1) style bindings are\n       being used; see vimode for more information.\n\n       Note that editor commands do not have the same notion of a ``word'' as\n       does the shell.\tThe editor delimits words with any non-alphanumeric\n       characters not in the shell variable wordchars, while the shell\n       recognizes only whitespace and some of the characters with special\n       meanings to it, listed under Lexical structure.\n\n   Completion and listing (+)\n       The shell is often able to complete words when given a unique\n       abbreviation.  Type part of a word (for example `ls /usr/lost') and hit\n       the tab key to run the complete-word editor command.  The shell\n       completes the filename `/usr/lost' to `/usr/lost+found/', replacing the\n       incomplete word with the complete word in the input buffer.  (Note the\n       terminal `/'; completion adds a `/' to the end of completed directories\n       and a space to the end of other completed words, to speed typing and\n       provide a visual indicator of successful completion.  The addsuffix\n       shell variable can be unset to prevent this.)  If no match is found\n       (perhaps `/usr/lost+found' doesn't exist), the terminal bell rings.  If\n       the word is already complete (perhaps there is a `/usr/lost' on your\n       system, or perhaps you were thinking too far ahead and typed the whole\n       thing) a `/' or space is added to the end if it isn't already there.\n\n       Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the end; completed\n       text pushes the rest of the line to the right.  Completion in the\n       middle of a word often results in leftover characters to the right of\n       the cursor that need to be deleted.\n\n       Commands and variables can be completed in much the same way.  For\n       example, typing `em[tab]' would complete `em' to `emacs' if emacs were\n       the only command on your system beginning with `em'.  Completion can\n       find a command in any directory in path or if given a full pathname.\n       Typing `echo $ar[tab]' would complete `$ar' to `$argv' if no other\n       variable began with `ar'.\n\n       The shell parses the input buffer to determine whether the word you\n       want to complete should be completed as a filename, command or\n       variable.  The first word in the buffer and the first word following\n       `;', `|', `|&', `&&' or `||' is considered to be a command.  A word\n       beginning with `$' is considered to be a variable.  Anything else is a\n       filename.  An empty line is `completed' as a filename.\n\n       You can list the possible completions of a word at any time by typing\n       `^D' to run the delete-char-or-list-or-eof editor command.  The shell\n       lists the possible completions using the ls-F builtin (q.v.)  and\n       reprints the prompt and unfinished command line, for example:"

Additional characters may be typed to extend the\n\t       search, i-search-back may be typed to continue searching with\n\t       the same pattern, wrapping around the history list if\n\t       necessary, (i-search-back must be bound to a single character\n\t       for this to work) or one of the following special characters\n\t       may be typed:\n\n\t\t   ^W\t   Appends the rest of the word under the cursor to\n\t\t\t   the search pattern.\n\t\t   delete (or any character bound to backward-delete-char)\n\t\t\t   Undoes the effect of the last character typed and\n\t\t\t   deletes a character from the search pattern if\n\t\t\t   appropriate.\n\t\t   ^G\t   If the previous search was successful, aborts the\n\t\t\t   entire search.

In particular, a carriage\n\t       return causes the current line to be executed.  See also i-\n\t       search-fwd and history-search-backward.\tWord boundary behavior\n\t       modified by vimode.\n\n       i-search-fwd (not bound)\n\t       Like i-search-back, but searches forward.

See also copy-prev-word.\n\n       list-choices (M-^D)\n\t       Lists completion possibilities as described under Completion\n\t       and listing.  See also delete-char-or-list-or-eof and list-\n\t       choices-raw.\n\n       list-choices-raw (^X-^D)\n\t       Like list-choices, but ignores user-defined completions.\n\n       list-glob (^X-g, ^X-G)\n\t       Lists (via the ls-F builtin) matches to the glob-pattern (see\n\t       Filename substitution) to the left of the cursor.\n\n       list-or-eof (not bound)\n\t       Does list-choices or end-of-file on an empty line.  See also\n\t       delete-char-or-list-or-eof.\n\n       magic-space (not bound)\n\t       Expands history substitutions in the current line, like expand-\n\t       history, and inserts a space.  magic-space is designed to be\n\t       bound to the space bar, but is not bound by default.\n\n       normalize-command (^X-?)\n\t       Searches for the current word in PATH and, if it is found,\n\t       replaces it with the full path to the executable.  Special\n\t       characters are quoted.  Aliases are expanded and quoted but\n\t       commands within aliases are not.  This command is useful with\n\t       commands that take commands as arguments, e.g., `dbx' and `sh\n\t       -x'.\n\n       normalize-path (^X-n, ^X-N)\n\t       Expands the current word as described under the `expand'\n\t       setting of the symlinks shell variable.\n\n       overwrite-mode (unbound)\n\t       Toggles between input and overwrite modes.\n\n       run-fg-editor (M-^Z)\n\t       Saves the current input line and looks for a stopped job where\n\t       the file name portion of its first word is found in the editors\n\t       shell variable.\tIf editors is not set, then the file name\n\t       portion of the EDITOR environment variable (`ed' if unset) and\n\t       the VISUAL environment variable (`vi' if unset) will be used.\n\t       If such a job is found, it is restarted as if `fg %job' had\n\t       been typed.  This is used to toggle back and forth between an\n\t       editor and the shell easily.  Some people bind this command to\n\t       `^Z' so they can do this even more easily.\n\n       run-help (M-h, M-H)\n\t       Searches for documentation on the current command, using the\n\t       same notion of `current command' as the completion routines,\n\t       and prints it.  There is no way to use a pager; run-help is\n\t       designed for short help files.  If the special alias\n\t       helpcommand is defined, it is run with the command name as a\n\t       sole argument.  Else, documentation should be in a file named\n\t       command.help, command.1, command.6, command.8 or command, which\n\t       should be in one of the directories listed in the HPATH\n\t       environment variable.  If there is more than one help file only\n\t       the first is printed.\n\n       self-insert-command (text characters)\n\t       In insert mode (the default), inserts the typed character into\n\t       the input line after the character under the cursor.  In\n\t       overwrite mode, replaces the character under the cursor with\n\t       the typed character.  The input mode is normally preserved\n\t       between lines, but the inputmode shell variable can be set to\n\t       `insert' or `overwrite' to put the editor in that mode at the\n\t       beginning of each line.\tSee also overwrite-mode.\n\n       sequence-lead-in (arrow prefix, meta prefix, ^X)\n\t       Indicates that the following characters are part of a multi-key\n\t       sequence.  Binding a command to a multi-key sequence really\n\t       creates two bindings: the first character to sequence-lead-in\n\t       and the whole sequence to the command.  All sequences beginning\n\t       with a character bound to sequence-lead-in are effectively\n\t       bound to undefined-key unless bound to another command.\n\n       spell-line (M-$)\n\t       Attempts to correct the spelling of each word in the input\n\t       buffer, like spell-word, but ignores words whose first\n\t       character is one of `-', `!', `^' or `%', or which contain `\\',\n\t       `*' or `?', to avoid problems with switches, substitutions and\n\t       the like.  See Spelling correction.\n\n       spell-word (M-s, M-S)\n\t       Attempts to correct the spelling of the current word as\n\t       described under Spelling correction.  Checks each component of\n\t       a word which appears to be a pathname.\n\n       toggle-literal-history (M-r, M-R)\n\t       Expands or `unexpands' history substitutions in the input\n\t       buffer.\tSee also expand-history and the autoexpand shell\n\t       variable.\n\n       undefined-key (any unbound key)\n\t       Beeps.\n\n       up-history (up-arrow, ^P)\n\t       Copies the previous entry in the history list into the input\n\t       buffer.\tIf histlit is set, uses the literal form of the entry.\n\t       May be repeated to step up through the history list, stopping\n\t       at the top.\n\n       upcase-word (M-u, M-U)\n\t       Uppercase the characters from cursor to end of current word.\n\t       Word boundary behavior modified by vimode.\n\n       vi-beginning-of-next-word (not bound)\n\t       Vi goto the beginning of next word.  Word boundary and cursor\n\t       behavior modified by vimode.\n\n       vi-eword (not bound)\n\t       Vi move to the end of the current word.\tWord boundary behavior\n\t       modified by vimode.\n\n       vi-search-back (?)\n\t       Prompts with `?' for a search string (which may be a glob-\n\t       pattern, as with history-search-backward), searches for it and\n\t       copies it into the input buffer.  The bell rings if no match is\n\t       found.  Hitting return ends the search and leaves the last\n\t       match in the input buffer.  Hitting escape ends the search and\n\t       executes the match.  vi mode only.\n\n       vi-search-fwd (/)\n\t       Like vi-search-back, but searches forward.\n\n       which-command (M-?)\n\t       Does a which (see the description of the builtin command) on\n\t       the first word of the input buffer.\n\n       yank-pop (M-y)\n\t       When executed immediately after a yank or another yank-pop,\n\t       replaces the yanked string with the next previous string from\n\t       the killring. This also has the effect of rotating the\n\t       killring, such that this string will be considered the most\n\t       recently killed by a later yank command. Repeating yank-pop\n\t       will cycle through the killring any number of times.\n\n   Lexical structure\n       The shell splits input lines into words at blanks and tabs.  The\n       special characters `&', `|', `;', `<', `>', `(', and `)' and the\n       doubled characters `&&', `||', `<<' and `>>' are always separate words,\n       whether or not they are surrounded by whitespace.\n\n       When the shell's input is not a terminal, the character `#' is taken to\n       begin a comment.  Each `#' and the rest of the input line on which it\n       appears is discarded before further parsing.\n\n       A special character (including a blank or tab) may be prevented from\n       having its special meaning, and possibly made part of another word, by\n       preceding it with a backslash (`\\') or enclosing it in single (`''),\n       double (`\"') or backward (``') quotes.  When not otherwise quoted a\n       newline preceded by a `\\' is equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes\n       this sequence results in a newline.\n\n       Furthermore, all Substitutions (see below) except History substitution\n       can be prevented by enclosing the strings (or parts of strings) in\n       which they appear with single quotes or by quoting the crucial\n       character(s) (e.g., `$' or ``' for Variable substitution or Command\n       substitution respectively) with `\\'.  (Alias substitution is no\n       exception: quoting in any way any character of a word for which an\n       alias has been defined prevents substitution of the alias.  The usual\n       way of quoting an alias is to precede it with a backslash.) History\n       substitution is prevented by backslashes but not by single quotes.\n       Strings quoted with double or backward quotes undergo Variable\n       substitution and Command substitution, but other substitutions are\n       prevented.\n\n       Text inside single or double quotes becomes a single word (or part of\n       one).  Metacharacters in these strings, including blanks and tabs, do\n       not form separate words.  Only in one special case (see Command\n       substitution below) can a double-quoted string yield parts of more than\n       one word; single-quoted strings never do.  Backward quotes are special:\n       they signal Command substitution (q.v.), which may result in more than\n       one word.\n\n       Quoting complex strings, particularly strings which themselves contain\n       quoting characters, can be confusing.  Remember that quotes need not be\n       used as they are in human writing!  It may be easier to quote not an\n       entire string, but only those parts of the string which need quoting,\n       using different types of quoting to do so if appropriate.\n\n       The backslash_quote shell variable (q.v.) can be set to make\n       backslashes always quote `\\', `'', and `\"'.  (+) This may make complex\n       quoting tasks easier, but it can cause syntax errors in csh(1) scripts.\n\n   Substitutions\n       We now describe the various transformations the shell performs on the\n       input in the order in which they occur.\tWe note in passing the data\n       structures involved and the commands and variables which affect them.\n       Remember that substitutions can be prevented by quoting as described\n       under Lexical structure.\n\n   History substitution\n       Each command, or ``event'', input from the terminal is saved in the\n       history list.  The previous command is always saved, and the history\n       shell variable can be set to a number to save that many commands.  The\n       histdup shell variable can be set to not save duplicate events or\n       consecutive duplicate events.\n\n       Saved commands are numbered sequentially from 1 and stamped with the\n       time.  It is not usually necessary to use event numbers, but the\n       current event number can be made part of the prompt by placing an `!'\n       in the prompt shell variable.\n\n       The shell actually saves history in expanded and literal (unexpanded)\n       forms.  If the histlit shell variable is set, commands that display and\n       store history use the literal form.\n\n       The history builtin command can print, store in a file, restore and\n       clear the history list at any time, and the savehist and histfile shell\n       variables can be set to store the history list automatically on logout\n       and restore it on login.\n\n       History substitutions introduce words from the history list into the\n       input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, repeat arguments of a\n       previous command in the current command, or fix spelling mistakes in\n       the previous command with little typing and a high degree of\n       confidence.\n\n       History substitutions begin with the character `!'.  They may begin\n       anywhere in the input stream, but they do not nest.  The `!' may be\n       preceded by a `\\' to prevent its special meaning; for convenience, a\n       `!' is passed unchanged when it is followed by a blank, tab, newline,\n       `=' or `('.  History substitutions also occur when an input line begins\n       with `^'.  This special abbreviation will be described later.  The\n       characters used to signal history substitution (`!' and `^') can be\n       changed by setting the histchars shell variable.  Any input line which\n       contains a history substitution is printed before it is executed.\n\n       A history substitution may have an ``event specification'', which\n       indicates the event from which words are to be taken, a ``word\n       designator'', which selects particular words from the chosen event,\n       and/or a ``modifier'', which manipulates the selected words.\n\n       An event specification can be\n\n\t   n\t   A number, referring to a particular event\n\t   -n\t   An offset, referring to the event n before the current\n\t\t   event\n\t   #\t   The current event.  This should be used carefully in\n\t\t   csh(1), where there is no check for recursion.  tcsh allows\n\t\t   10 levels of recursion.  (+)\n\t   !\t   The previous event (equivalent to `-1')\n\t   s\t   The most recent event whose first word begins with the\n\t\t   string s\n\t   ?s?\t   The most recent event which contains the string s.  The\n\t\t   second `?' can be omitted if it is immediately followed by\n\t\t   a newline.\n\n       For example, consider this bit of someone's history list:"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tcsh`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n9  8:30    nroff -man wumpus.man\n\t   10  8:31    cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old\n\t   11  8:36    vi wumpus.man\n\t   12  8:37    diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.man\n\n       The commands are shown with their event numbers and time stamps.  The\n       current event, which we haven't typed in yet, is event 13.  `!11' and\n       `!-2' refer to event 11.  `!!' refers to the previous event, 12.  `!!'\n       can be abbreviated `!' if it is followed by `:' (`:' is described\n       below).\t`!n' refers to event 9, which begins with `n'.\t`!?old?' also\n       refers to event 12, which contains `old'.  Without word designators or\n       modifiers history references simply expand to the entire event, so we\n       might type `!cp' to redo the copy command or `!!|more' if the `diff'\n       output scrolled off the top of the screen.\n\n       History references may be insulated from the surrounding text with\n       braces if necessary.  For example, `!vdoc' would look for a command\n       beginning with `vdoc', and, in this example, not find one, but\n       `!{v}doc' would expand unambiguously to `vi wumpus.mandoc'.  Even in\n       braces, history substitutions do not nest.\n\n       (+) While csh(1) expands, for example, `!3d' to event 3 with the letter\n       `d' appended to it, tcsh expands it to the last event beginning with\n       `3d'; only completely numeric arguments are treated as event numbers.\n       This makes it possible to recall events beginning with numbers.\tTo\n       expand `!3d' as in csh(1) say `!{3}d'.\n\n       To select words from an event we can follow the event specification by\n       a `:' and a designator for the desired words.  The words of an input\n       line are numbered from 0, the first (usually command) word being 0, the\n       second word (first argument) being 1, etc.  The basic word designators\n       are:\n\n\t   0\t   The first (command) word\n\t   n\t   The nth argument\n\t   ^\t   The first argument, equivalent to `1'\n\t   $\t   The last argument\n\t   %\t   The word matched by an ?s? search\n\t   x-y\t   A range of words\n\t   -y\t   Equivalent to `0-y'\n\t   *\t   Equivalent to `^-$', but returns nothing if the event\n\t\t   contains only 1 word\n\t   x*\t   Equivalent to `x-$'\n\t   x-\t   Equivalent to `x*', but omitting the last word (`$')\n\n       Selected words are inserted into the command line separated by single\n       blanks.\tFor example, the `diff' command in the previous example might\n       have been typed as `diff !!:1.old !!:1' (using `:1' to select the first\n       argument from the previous event) or `diff !-2:2 !-2:1' to select and\n       swap the arguments from the `cp' command.  If we didn't care about the\n       order of the `diff' we might have said `diff !-2:1-2' or simply `diff\n       !-2:*'.\tThe `cp' command might have been written `cp wumpus.man\n       !#:1.old', using `#' to refer to the current event.  `!n:- hurkle.man'\n       would reuse the first two words from the `nroff' command to say `nroff\n       -man hurkle.man'.\n\n       The `:' separating the event specification from the word designator can\n       be omitted if the argument selector begins with a `^', `$', `*', `%' or\n       `-'.  For example, our `diff' command might have been `diff !!^.old\n       !!^' or, equivalently, `diff !!$.old !!$'.  However, if `!!' is\n       abbreviated `!', an argument selector beginning with `-' will be\n       interpreted as an event specification.\n\n       A history reference may have a word designator but no event\n       specification.  It then references the previous command.  Continuing\n       our `diff' example, we could have said simply `diff !^.old !^' or, to\n       get the arguments in the opposite order, just `diff !*'.\n\n       The word or words in a history reference can be edited, or\n       ``modified'', by following it with one or more modifiers, each preceded\n       by a `:':\n\n\t   h\t   Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.\n\t   t\t   Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.\n\t   r\t   Remove a filename extension `.xxx', leaving the root name.\n\t   e\t   Remove all but the extension.\n\t   u\t   Uppercase the first lowercase letter.\n\t   l\t   Lowercase the first uppercase letter.\n\t   s/l/r/  Substitute l for r.\tl is simply a string like r, not a\n\t\t   regular expression as in the eponymous ed(1) command.  Any\n\t\t   character may be used as the delimiter in place of `/'; a\n\t\t   `\\' can be used to quote the delimiter inside l and r.  The\n\t\t   character `&' in the r is replaced by l; `\\' also quotes\n\t\t   `&'.  If l is empty (``''), the l from a previous\n\t\t   substitution or the s from a previous search or event\n\t\t   number in event specification is used.  The trailing\n\t\t   delimiter may be omitted if it is immediately followed by a\n\t\t   newline.\n\t   &\t   Repeat the previous substitution.\n\t   g\t   Apply the following modifier once to each word.\n\t   a (+)   Apply the following modifier as many times as possible to a\n\t\t   single word.  `a' and `g' can be used together to apply a\n\t\t   modifier globally.  With the `s' modifier, only the\n\t\t   patterns contained in the original word are substituted,\n\t\t   not patterns that contain any substitution result.\n\t   p\t   Print the new command line but do not execute it.\n\t   q\t   Quote the substituted words, preventing further\n\t\t   substitutions.\n\t   x\t   Like q, but break into words at blanks, tabs and newlines.\n\n       Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word (unless `g' is\n       used).  It is an error for no word to be modifiable.\n\n       For example, the `diff' command might have been written as `diff\n       wumpus.man.old !#^:r', using `:r' to remove `.old' from the first\n       argument on the same line (`!#^').  We could say `echo hello out\n       there', then `echo !*:u' to capitalize `hello', `echo !*:au' to say it\n       out loud, or `echo !*:agu' to really shout.  We might follow `mail -s\n       \"I forgot my password\" rot' with `!:s/rot/root' to correct the spelling\n       of `root' (but see Spelling correction for a different approach).\n\n       There is a special abbreviation for substitutions.  `^', when it is the\n       first character on an input line, is equivalent to `!:s^'.  Thus we\n       might have said `^rot^root' to make the spelling correction in the\n       previous example.  This is the only history substitution which does not\n       explicitly begin with `!'.\n\n       (+) In csh as such, only one modifier may be applied to each history or\n       variable expansion.  In tcsh, more than one may be used, for example"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tcsh`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n% mv wumpus.man /usr/man/man1/wumpus.1\n\t   % man !$:t:r\n\t   man wumpus\n\n       In csh, the result would be `wumpus.1:r'.  A substitution followed by a\n       colon may need to be insulated from it with braces:\n\n\n\t   > mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus\n\t   > setenv PATH !$:h:$PATH\n\t   Bad ! modifier: $.\n\t   > setenv PATH !{-2$:h}:$PATH\n\t   setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.\n\n       The first attempt would succeed in csh but fails in tcsh, because tcsh\n       expects another modifier after the second colon rather than `$'.\n\n       Finally, history can be accessed through the editor as well as through\n       the substitutions just described.  The up- and down-history, history-\n       search-backward and -forward, i-search-back and -fwd, vi-search-back\n       and -fwd, copy-prev-word and insert-last-word editor commands search\n       for events in the history list and copy them into the input buffer.\n       The toggle-literal-history editor command switches between the expanded\n       and literal forms of history lines in the input buffer.\texpand-history\n       and expand-line expand history substitutions in the current word and in\n       the entire input buffer respectively.\n\n   Alias substitution\n       The shell maintains a list of aliases which can be set, unset and\n       printed by the alias and unalias commands.  After a command line is\n       parsed into simple commands (see Commands) the first word of each\n       command, left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so,\n       the first word is replaced by the alias.  If the alias contains a\n       history reference, it undergoes History substitution (q.v.) as though\n       the original command were the previous input line.  If the alias does\n       not contain a history reference, the argument list is left untouched.\n\n       Thus if the alias for `ls' were `ls -l' the command `ls /usr' would\n       become `ls -l /usr', the argument list here being undisturbed.  If the\n       alias for `lookup' were `grep !^ /etc/passwd' then `lookup bill' would\n       become `grep bill /etc/passwd'.\tAliases can be used to introduce\n       parser metasyntax.  For example, `alias print 'pr \\!* | lpr'' defines a\n       ``command'' (`print') which pr(1)s its arguments to the line printer.\n\n       Alias substitution is repeated until the first word of the command has\n       no alias.  If an alias substitution does not change the first word (as\n       in the previous example) it is flagged to prevent a loop.  Other loops\n       are detected and cause an error.\n\n       Some aliases are referred to by the shell; see Special aliases.\n\n   Variable substitution\n       The shell maintains a list of variables, each of which has as value a\n       list of zero or more words.  The values of shell variables can be\n       displayed and changed with the set and unset commands.  The system\n       maintains its own list of ``environment'' variables.  These can be\n       displayed and changed with printenv, setenv and unsetenv.\n\n       (+) Variables may be made read-only with `set -r' (q.v.).  Read-only\n       variables may not be modified or unset; attempting to do so will cause\n       an error.  Once made read-only, a variable cannot be made writable, so\n       `set -r' should be used with caution.  Environment variables cannot be\n       made read-only.\n\n       Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by it.  For\n       instance, the argv variable is an image of the shell's argument list,\n       and words of this variable's value are referred to in special ways.\n       Some of the variables referred to by the shell are toggles; the shell\n       does not care what their value is, only whether they are set or not.\n       For instance, the verbose variable is a toggle which causes command\n       input to be echoed.  The -v command line option sets this variable.\n       Special shell variables lists all variables which are referred to by\n       the shell.\n\n       Other operations treat variables numerically.  The `@' command permits\n       numeric calculations to be performed and the result assigned to a\n       variable.  Variable values are, however, always represented as (zero or\n       more) strings.  For the purposes of numeric operations, the null string\n       is considered to be zero, and the second and subsequent words of multi-\n       word values are ignored.\n\n       After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each command is\n       executed, variable substitution is performed keyed by `$' characters.\n       This expansion can be prevented by preceding the `$' with a `\\' except\n       within `\"'s where it always occurs, and within `''s where it never\n       occurs.\tStrings quoted by ``' are interpreted later (see Command\n       substitution below) so `$' substitution does not occur there until\n       later, if at all.  A `$' is passed unchanged if followed by a blank,\n       tab, or end-of-line.\n\n       Input/output redirections are recognized before variable expansion, and\n       are variable expanded separately.  Otherwise, the command name and\n       entire argument list are expanded together.  It is thus possible for\n       the first (command) word (to this point) to generate more than one\n       word, the first of which becomes the command name, and the rest of\n       which become arguments.\n\n       Unless enclosed in `\"' or given the `:q' modifier the results of\n       variable substitution may eventually be command and filename\n       substituted.  Within `\"', a variable whose value consists of multiple\n       words expands to a (portion of a) single word, with the words of the\n       variable's value separated by blanks.  When the `:q' modifier is\n       applied to a substitution the variable will expand to multiple words\n       with each word separated by a blank and quoted to prevent later command\n       or filename substitution.\n\n       The following metasequences are provided for introducing variable\n       values into the shell input.  Except as noted, it is an error to\n       reference a variable which is not set.\n\n       $name\n       ${name} Substitutes the words of the value of variable name, each\n\t       separated by a blank.  Braces insulate name from following\n\t       characters which would otherwise be part of it.\tShell\n\t       variables have names consisting of letters and digits starting\n\t       with a letter.  The underscore character is considered a\n\t       letter.\tIf name is not a shell variable, but is set in the\n\t       environment, then that value is returned (but some of the other\n\t       forms given below are not available in this case).\n       $name[selector]\n       ${name[selector]}\n\t       Substitutes only the selected words from the value of name.\n\t       The selector is subjected to `$' substitution and may consist\n\t       of a single number or two numbers separated by a `-'.  The\n\t       first word of a variable's value is numbered `1'.  If the first\n\t       number of a range is omitted it defaults to `1'.  If the last\n\t       member of a range is omitted it defaults to `$#name'.  The\n\t       selector `*' selects all words.\tIt is not an error for a range\n\t       to be empty if the second argument is omitted or in range.\n       $0      Substitutes the name of the file from which command input is\n\t       being read.  An error occurs if the name is not known.\n       $number\n       ${number}\n\t       Equivalent to `$argv[number]'.\n       $*      Equivalent to `$argv', which is equivalent to `$argv[*]'.\n\n       The `:' modifiers described under History substitution, except for\n       `:p', can be applied to the substitutions above.

(+)\n       $<      Substitutes a line from the standard input, with no further\n\t       interpretation thereafter.  It can be used to read from the\n\t       keyboard in a shell script.  (+) While csh always quotes $<, as\n\t       if it were equivalent to `$<:q', tcsh does not.\tFurthermore,\n\t       when tcsh is waiting for a line to be typed the user may type\n\t       an interrupt to interrupt the sequence into which the line is\n\t       to be substituted, but csh does not allow this.\n\n       The editor command expand-variables, normally bound to `^X-$', can be\n       used to interactively expand individual variables.\n\n   Command, filename and directory stack substitution\n       The remaining substitutions are applied selectively to the arguments of\n       builtin commands.  This means that portions of expressions which are\n       not evaluated are not subjected to these expansions.  For commands\n       which are not internal to the shell, the command name is substituted\n       separately from the argument list.  This occurs very late, after input-\n       output redirection is performed, and in a child of the main shell.\n\n   Command substitution\n       Command substitution is indicated by a command enclosed in ``'.\tThe\n       output from such a command is broken into separate words at blanks,\n       tabs and newlines, and null words are discarded.  The output is\n       variable and command substituted and put in place of the original\n       string.\n\n       Command substitutions inside double quotes (`\"') retain blanks and\n       tabs; only newlines force new words.  The single final newline does not\n       force a new word in any case.  It is thus possible for a command\n       substitution to yield only part of a word, even if the command outputs\n       a complete line.\n\n       By default, the shell since version 6.12 replaces all newline and\n       carriage return characters in the command by spaces.  If this is\n       switched off by unsetting csubstnonl, newlines separate commands as\n       usual.\n\n   Filename substitution\n       If a word contains any of the characters `*', `?', `[' or `{' or begins\n       with the character `~' it is a candidate for filename substitution,\n       also known as ``globbing''.  This word is then regarded as a pattern\n       (``glob-pattern''), and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of\n       file names which match the pattern.\n\n       In matching filenames, the character `.' at the beginning of a filename\n       or immediately following a `/', as well as the character `/' must be\n       matched explicitly (unless either globdot or globstar or both are\n       set(+)).  The character `*' matches any string of characters, including\n       the null string.  The character `?' matches any single character.  The\n       sequence `[...]' matches any one of the characters enclosed.  Within\n       `[...]', a pair of characters separated by `-' matches any character\n       lexically between the two.\n\n       (+) Some glob-patterns can be negated: The sequence `[^...]' matches\n       any single character not specified by the characters and/or ranges of\n       characters in the braces.\n\n       An entire glob-pattern can also be negated with `^':"

Standing alone, i.e., `~', it expands to the invoker's\n       home directory as reflected in the value of the home shell variable.\n       When followed by a name consisting of letters, digits and `-'\n       characters the shell searches for a user with that name and substitutes\n       their home directory; thus `~ken' might expand to `/usr/ken' and\n       `~ken/chmach' to `/usr/ken/chmach'.  If the character `~' is followed\n       by a character other than a letter or `/' or appears elsewhere than at\n       the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed.  A command like\n       `setenv MANPATH /usr/man:/usr/local/man:~/lib/man' does not, therefore,\n       do home directory substitution as one might hope.\n\n       It is an error for a glob-pattern containing `*', `?', `[' or `~', with\n       or without `^', not to match any files.\tHowever, only one pattern in a\n       list of glob-patterns must match a file (so that, e.g., `rm *.a *.c\n       *.o' would fail only if there were no files in the current directory\n       ending in `.a', `.c', or `.o'), and if the nonomatch shell variable is\n       set a pattern (or list of patterns) which matches nothing is left\n       unchanged rather than causing an error.\n\n       The globstar shell variable can be set to allow `**' or `***' as a file\n       glob pattern that matches any string of characters including `/',\n       recursively traversing any existing sub-directories.  For example, `ls\n       **.c' will list all the .c files in the current directory tree.\tIf\n       used by itself, it will match zero or more sub-directories (e.g. `ls\n       /usr/include/**/time.h' will list any file named `time.h' in the\n       /usr/include directory tree; `ls /usr/include/**time.h' will match any\n       file in the /usr/include directory tree ending in `time.h'; and `ls\n       /usr/include/**time**.h' will match any .h file with `time' either in a\n       subdirectory name or in the filename itself).

Any\n       filename may be expanded to a full path when the symlinks variable\n       (q.v.) is set to `expand'.  Quoting prevents this expansion, and the\n       normalize-path editor command does it on demand.  The normalize-command\n       editor command expands commands in PATH into full paths on demand.\n       Finally, cd and pushd interpret `-' as the old working directory\n       (equivalent to the shell variable owd).\tThis is not a substitution at\n       all, but an abbreviation recognized by only those commands.\n       Nonetheless, it too can be prevented by quoting.\n\n   Commands\n       The next three sections describe how the shell executes commands and\n       deals with their input and output.\n\n   Simple commands, pipelines and sequences\n       A simple command is a sequence of words, the first of which specifies\n       the command to be executed.  A series of simple commands joined by `|'\n       characters forms a pipeline.  The output of each command in a pipeline\n       is connected to the input of the next.\n\n       Simple commands and pipelines may be joined into sequences with `;',\n       and will be executed sequentially.  Commands and pipelines can also be\n       joined into sequences with `||' or `&&', indicating, as in the C\n       language, that the second is to be executed only if the first fails or\n       succeeds respectively.\n\n       A simple command, pipeline or sequence may be placed in parentheses,\n       `()', to form a simple command, which may in turn be a component of a\n       pipeline or sequence.  A command, pipeline or sequence can be executed\n       without waiting for it to terminate by following it with an `&'.\n\n   Builtin and non-builtin command execution\n       Builtin commands are executed within the shell.\tIf any component of a\n       pipeline except the last is a builtin command, the pipeline is executed\n       in a subshell.\n\n       Parenthesized commands are always executed in a subshell."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tcsh`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n(cd; pwd); pwd\n\n       thus prints the home directory, leaving you where you were (printing\n       this after the home directory), while\n\n\n\t   cd; pwd\n\n       leaves you in the home directory.  Parenthesized commands are most\n       often used to prevent cd from affecting the current shell.\n\n       When a command to be executed is found not to be a builtin command the\n       shell attempts to execute the command via execve(2).  Each word in the\n       variable path names a directory in which the shell will look for the\n       command.  If the shell is not given a -f option, the shell hashes the\n       names in these directories into an internal table so that it will try\n       an execve(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility that the\n       command resides there.  This greatly speeds command location when a\n       large number of directories are present in the search path. This\n       hashing mechanism is not used:\n\n       1.  If hashing is turned explicitly off via unhash.\n\n       2.  If the shell was given a -f argument.\n\n       3.  For each directory component of path which does not begin with a\n\t   `/'.\n\n       4.  If the command contains a `/'.\n\n       In the above four cases the shell concatenates each component of the\n       path vector with the given command name to form a path name of a file\n       which it then attempts to execute it. If execution is successful, the\n       search stops.\n\n       If the file has execute permissions but is not an executable to the\n       system (i.e., it is neither an executable binary nor a script that\n       specifies its interpreter), then it is assumed to be a file containing\n       shell commands and a new shell is spawned to read it.  The shell\n       special alias may be set to specify an interpreter other than the shell\n       itself.\n\n       On systems which do not understand the `#!' script interpreter\n       convention the shell may be compiled to emulate it; see the version\n       shell variable.\tIf so, the shell checks the first line of the file to\n       see if it is of the form `#!interpreter arg ...'.  If it is, the shell\n       starts interpreter with the given args and feeds the file to it on\n       standard input.\n\n   Input/output\n       The standard input and standard output of a command may be redirected\n       with the following syntax:\n\n       < name  Open file name (which is first variable, command and filename\n\t       expanded) as the standard input.\n       << word Read the shell input up to a line which is identical to word.\n\t       word is not subjected to variable, filename or command\n\t       substitution, and each input line is compared to word before\n\t       any substitutions are done on this input line.  Unless a\n\t       quoting `\\', `\"', `' or ``' appears in word variable and\n\t       command substitution is performed on the intervening lines,\n\t       allowing `\\' to quote `$', `\\' and ``'.\tCommands which are\n\t       substituted have all blanks, tabs, and newlines preserved,\n\t       except for the final newline which is dropped.  The resultant\n\t       text is placed in an anonymous temporary file which is given to\n\t       the command as standard input.\n       > name\n       >! name\n       >& name\n       >&! name\n\t       The file name is used as standard output.  If the file does not\n\t       exist then it is created; if the file exists, it is truncated,\n\t       its previous contents being lost.\n\n\t       If the shell variable noclobber is set, then the file must not\n\t       exist or be a character special file (e.g., a terminal or\n\t       `/dev/null') or an error results.  This helps prevent\n\t       accidental destruction of files.  In this case the `!' forms\n\t       can be used to suppress this check.  If notempty is given in\n\t       noclobber, `>' is allowed on empty files; if ask is set, an\n\t       interacive confirmation is presented, rather than an error.\n\n\t       The forms involving `&' route the diagnostic output into the\n\t       specified file as well as the standard output.  name is\n\t       expanded in the same way as `<' input filenames are.\n       >> name\n       >>& name\n       >>! name\n       >>&! name\n\t       Like `>', but appends output to the end of name.  If the shell\n\t       variable noclobber is set, then it is an error for the file not\n\t       to exist, unless one of the `!' forms is given.\n\n       A command receives the environment in which the shell was invoked as\n       modified by the input-output parameters and the presence of the command\n       in a pipeline.  Thus, unlike some previous shells, commands run from a\n       file of shell commands have no access to the text of the commands by\n       default; rather they receive the original standard input of the shell.\n       The `<<' mechanism should be used to present inline data.  This permits\n       shell command scripts to function as components of pipelines and allows\n       the shell to block read its input.  Note that the default standard\n       input for a command run detached is not the empty file /dev/null, but\n       the original standard input of the shell.  If this is a terminal and if\n       the process attempts to read from the terminal, then the process will\n       block and the user will be notified (see Jobs).\n\n       Diagnostic output may be directed through a pipe with the standard\n       output.\tSimply use the form `|&' rather than just `|'.\n\n       The shell cannot presently redirect diagnostic output without also\n       redirecting standard output, but `(command > output-file) >& error-\n       file' is often an acceptable workaround.  Either output-file or error-\n       file may be `/dev/tty' to send output to the terminal.\n\n   Features\n       Having described how the shell accepts, parses and executes command\n       lines, we now turn to a variety of its useful features.\n\n   Control flow\n       The shell contains a number of commands which can be used to regulate\n       the flow of control in command files (shell scripts) and (in limited\n       but useful ways) from terminal input.  These commands all operate by\n       forcing the shell to reread or skip in its input and, due to the\n       implementation, restrict the placement of some of the commands.\n\n       The foreach, switch, and while statements, as well as the if-then-else\n       form of the if statement, require that the major keywords appear in a\n       single simple command on an input line as shown below.\n\n       If the shell's input is not seekable, the shell buffers up input\n       whenever a loop is being read and performs seeks in this internal\n       buffer to accomplish the rereading implied by the loop.\t(To the extent\n       that this allows, backward gotos will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)\n\n   Expressions\n       The if, while and exit builtin commands use expressions with a common\n       syntax.\tThe expressions can include any of the operators described in\n       the next three sections.  Note that the @ builtin command (q.v.) has\n       its own separate syntax.\n\n   Logical, arithmetical and comparison operators\n       These operators are similar to those of C and have the same precedence.\n       They include"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tcsh`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n||  &&  |  ^  &  ==\t!=  =~\t!~  <=\t>=\n\t   <  > <<  >>\t+  -  *  /  %  !  ~  (\t)\n\n       Here the precedence increases to the right, `==' `!=' `=~' and `!~',\n       `<=' `>=' `<' and `>', `<<' and `>>', `+' and `-', `*' `/' and `%'\n       being, in groups, at the same level.  The `==' `!=' `=~' and `!~'\n       operators compare their arguments as strings; all others operate on\n       numbers.  The operators `=~' and `!~' are like `!=' and `==' except\n       that the right hand side is a glob-pattern (see Filename substitution)\n       against which the left hand operand is matched.\tThis reduces the need\n       for use of the switch builtin command in shell scripts when all that is\n       really needed is pattern matching.\n\n       Null or missing arguments are considered `0'.  The results of all\n       expressions are strings, which represent decimal numbers.  It is\n       important to note that no two components of an expression can appear in\n       the same word; except when adjacent to components of expressions which\n       are syntactically significant to the parser (`&' `|' `<' `>' `(' `)')\n       they should be surrounded by spaces.\n\n   Command exit status\n       Commands can be executed in expressions and their exit status returned\n       by enclosing them in braces (`{}').  Remember that the braces should be\n       separated from the words of the command by spaces.  Command executions\n       succeed, returning true, i.e., `1', if the command exits with status 0,\n       otherwise they fail, returning false, i.e., `0'.  If more detailed\n       status information is required then the command should be executed\n       outside of an expression and the status shell variable examined.\n\n   File inquiry operators\n       Some of these operators perform true/false tests on files and related\n       objects.  They are of the form -op file, where op is one of\n\n\t   r   Read access\n\t   w   Write access\n\t   x   Execute access\n\t   X   Executable in the path or shell builtin, e.g., `-X ls' and `-X\n\t       ls-F' are generally true, but `-X /bin/ls' is not (+)\n\t   e   Existence\n\t   o   Ownership\n\t   z   Zero size\n\t   s   Non-zero size (+)\n\t   f   Plain file\n\t   d   Directory\n\t   l   Symbolic link (+) *\n\t   b   Block special file (+)\n\t   c   Character special file (+)\n\t   p   Named pipe (fifo) (+) *\n\t   S   Socket special file (+) *\n\t   u   Set-user-ID bit is set (+)\n\t   g   Set-group-ID bit is set (+)\n\t   k   Sticky bit is set (+)\n\t   t   file (which must be a digit) is an open file descriptor for a\n\t       terminal device (+)\n\t   R   Has been migrated (Convex only) (+)\n\t   L   Applies subsequent operators in a multiple-operator test to a\n\t       symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link points\n\t       (+) *\n\n       file is command and filename expanded and then tested to see if it has\n       the specified relationship to the real user.  If file does not exist or\n       is inaccessible or, for the operators indicated by `*', if the\n       specified file type does not exist on the current system, then all\n       inquiries return false, i.e., `0'.\n\n       These operators may be combined for conciseness: `-xy file' is\n       equivalent to `-x file && -y file'.  (+) For example, `-fx' is true\n       (returns `1') for plain executable files, but not for directories.\n\n       L may be used in a multiple-operator test to apply subsequent operators\n       to a symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link points.\n       For example, `-lLo' is true for links owned by the invoking user.  Lr,\n       Lw and Lx are always true for links and false for non-links.  L has a\n       different meaning when it is the last operator in a multiple-operator\n       test; see below.\n\n       It is possible but not useful, and sometimes misleading, to combine\n       operators which expect file to be a file with operators which do not\n       (e.g., X and t).  Following L with a non-file operator can lead to\n       particularly strange results.\n\n       Other operators return other information, i.e., not just `0' or `1'.\n       (+) They have the same format as before; op may be one of\n\n\t   A\t   Last file access time, as the number of seconds since the\n\t\t   epoch\n\t   A:\t   Like A, but in timestamp format, e.g., `Fri May 14 16:36:10\n\t\t   1993'\n\t   M\t   Last file modification time\n\t   M:\t   Like M, but in timestamp format\n\t   C\t   Last inode modification time\n\t   C:\t   Like C, but in timestamp format\n\t   D\t   Device number\n\t   I\t   Inode number\n\t   F\t   Composite file identifier, in the form device:inode\n\t   L\t   The name of the file pointed to by a symbolic link\n\t   N\t   Number of (hard) links\n\t   P\t   Permissions, in octal, without leading zero\n\t   P:\t   Like P, with leading zero\n\t   Pmode   Equivalent to `-P file & mode', e.g., `-P22 file' returns\n\t\t   `22' if file is writable by group and other, `20' if by\n\t\t   group only, and `0' if by neither\n\t   Pmode:  Like Pmode, with leading zero\n\t   U\t   Numeric userid\n\t   U:\t   Username, or the numeric userid if the username is unknown\n\t   G\t   Numeric groupid\n\t   G:\t   Groupname, or the numeric groupid if the groupname is\n\t\t   unknown\n\t   Z\t   Size, in bytes\n\n       Only one of these operators may appear in a multiple-operator test, and\n       it must be the last.  Note that L has a different meaning at the end of\n       and elsewhere in a multiple-operator test.  Because `0' is a valid\n       return value for many of these operators, they do not return `0' when\n       they fail: most return `-1', and F returns `:'.\n\n       If the shell is compiled with POSIX defined (see the version shell\n       variable), the result of a file inquiry is based on the permission bits\n       of the file and not on the result of the access(2) system call.\tFor\n       example, if one tests a file with -w whose permissions would ordinarily\n       allow writing but which is on a file system mounted read-only, the test\n       will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail in a non-POSIX shell.\n\n       File inquiry operators can also be evaluated with the filetest builtin\n       command (q.v.) (+).\n\n   Jobs\n       The shell associates a job with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of\n       current jobs, printed by the jobs command, and assigns them small\n       integer numbers.  When a job is started asynchronously with `&', the\n       shell prints a line which looks like"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tcsh`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n[1] 1234\n\n       indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number\n       1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.\n\n       If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the\n       suspend key (usually `^Z'), which sends a STOP signal to the current\n       job.  The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been\n       `Suspended' and print another prompt.  If the listjobs shell variable\n       is set, all jobs will be listed like the jobs builtin command; if it is\n       set to `long' the listing will be in long format, like `jobs -l'.  You\n       can then manipulate the state of the suspended job.  You can put it in\n       the ``background'' with the bg command or run some other commands and\n       eventually bring the job back into the ``foreground'' with fg.  (See\n       also the run-fg-editor editor command.)\tA `^Z' takes effect\n       immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread\n       input are discarded when it is typed.  The wait builtin command causes\n       the shell to wait for all background jobs to complete.\n\n       The `^]' key sends a delayed suspend signal, which does not generate a\n       STOP signal until a program attempts to read(2) it, to the current job.\n       This can usefully be typed ahead when you have prepared some commands\n       for a job which you wish to stop after it has read them.  The `^Y' key\n       performs this function in csh(1); in tcsh, `^Y' is an editing command.\n       (+)\n\n       A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from the\n       terminal.  Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but\n       this can be disabled by giving the command `stty tostop'.  If you set\n       this tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to\n       produce output like they do when they try to read input.\n\n       There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  The character\n       `%' introduces a job name.  If you wish to refer to job number 1, you\n       can name it as `%1'.  Just naming a job brings it to the foreground;\n       thus `%1' is a synonym for `fg %1', bringing job 1 back into the\n       foreground.  Similarly, saying `%1 &' resumes job 1 in the background,\n       just like `bg %1'.  A job can also be named by an unambiguous prefix of\n       the string typed in to start it: `%ex' would normally restart a\n       suspended ex(1) job, if there were only one suspended job whose name\n       began with the string `ex'.  It is also possible to say `%?string' to\n       specify a job whose text contains string, if there is only one such\n       job.\n\n       The shell maintains a notion of the current and previous jobs.  In\n       output pertaining to jobs, the current job is marked with a `+' and the\n       previous job with a `-'.  The abbreviations `%+', `%', and (by analogy\n       with the syntax of the history mechanism) `%%' all refer to the current\n       job, and `%-' refers to the previous job.\n\n       The job control mechanism requires that the stty(1) option `new' be set\n       on some systems.  It is an artifact from a `new' implementation of the\n       tty driver which allows generation of interrupt characters from the\n       keyboard to tell jobs to stop.  See stty(1) and the setty builtin\n       command for details on setting options in the new tty driver.\n\n   Status reporting\n       The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.  It\n       normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further\n       progress is possible, but only right before it prints a prompt.\tThis\n       is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.  If, however,\n       you set the shell variable notify, the shell will notify you\n       immediately of changes of status in background jobs.  There is also a\n       shell command notify which marks a single process so that its status\n       changes will be immediately reported.  By default notify marks the\n       current process; simply say `notify' after starting a background job to\n       mark it.\n\n       When you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped, you will be\n       warned that `There are suspended jobs.' You may use the jobs command to\n       see what they are.  If you do this or immediately try to exit again,\n       the shell will not warn you a second time, and the suspended jobs will\n       be terminated.\n\n   Automatic, periodic and timed events (+)\n       There are various ways to run commands and take other actions\n       automatically at various times in the ``life cycle'' of the shell.\n       They are summarized here, and described in detail under the appropriate\n       Builtin commands, Special shell variables and Special aliases.\n\n       The sched builtin command puts commands in a scheduled-event list, to\n       be executed by the shell at a given time.\n\n       The beepcmd, cwdcmd, periodic, precmd, postcmd, and jobcmd Special\n       aliases can be set, respectively, to execute commands when the shell\n       wants to ring the bell, when the working directory changes, every\n       tperiod minutes, before each prompt, before each command gets executed,\n       after each command gets executed, and when a job is started or is\n       brought into the foreground.\n\n       The autologout shell variable can be set to log out or lock the shell\n       after a given number of minutes of inactivity.\n\n       The mail shell variable can be set to check for new mail periodically.\n\n       The printexitvalue shell variable can be set to print the exit status\n       of commands which exit with a status other than zero.\n\n       The rmstar shell variable can be set to ask the user, when `rm *' is\n       typed, if that is really what was meant.\n\n       The time shell variable can be set to execute the time builtin command\n       after the completion of any process that takes more than a given number\n       of CPU seconds.\n\n       The watch and who shell variables can be set to report when selected\n       users log in or out, and the log builtin command reports on those users\n       at any time.\n\n   Native Language System support (+)\n       The shell is eight bit clean (if so compiled; see the version shell\n       variable) and thus supports character sets needing this capability.\n       NLS support differs depending on whether or not the shell was compiled\n       to use the system's NLS (again, see version).  In either case, 7-bit\n       ASCII is the default character code (e.g., the classification of which\n       characters are printable) and sorting, and changing the LANG or\n       LC_CTYPE environment variables causes a check for possible changes in\n       these respects.\n\n       When using the system's NLS, the setlocale(3) function is called to\n       determine appropriate character code/classification and sorting (e.g.,\n       a 'en_CA.UTF-8' would yield \"UTF-8\" as a character code).  This\n       function typically examines the LANG and LC_CTYPE environment\n       variables; refer to the system documentation for further details.  When\n       not using the system's NLS, the shell simulates it by assuming that the\n       ISO 8859-1 character set is used whenever either of the LANG and\n       LC_CTYPE variables are set, regardless of their values.\tSorting is not\n       affected for the simulated NLS.\n\n       In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all printable characters\n       in the range \\200-\\377, i.e., those that have M-char bindings, are\n       automatically rebound to self-insert-command.  The corresponding\n       binding for the escape-char sequence, if any, is left alone.  These\n       characters are not rebound if the NOREBIND environment variable is set.\n       This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive real NLS which\n       assumes full ISO 8859-1.  Otherwise, all M-char bindings in the range\n       \\240-\\377 are effectively undone.  Explicitly rebinding the relevant\n       keys with bindkey is of course still possible.\n\n       Unknown characters (i.e., those that are neither printable nor control\n       characters) are printed in the format \\nnn.  If the tty is not in 8 bit\n       mode, other 8 bit characters are printed by converting them to ASCII\n       and using standout mode.  The shell never changes the 7/8 bit mode of\n       the tty and tracks user-initiated changes of 7/8 bit mode.  NLS users\n       (or, for that matter, those who want to use a meta key) may need to\n       explicitly set the tty in 8 bit mode through the appropriate stty(1)\n       command in, e.g., the ~/.login file.\n\n   OS variant support (+)\n       A number of new builtin commands are provided to support features in\n       particular operating systems.  All are described in detail in the\n       Builtin commands section.\n\n       On systems that support TCF (aix-ibm370, aix-ps2), getspath and\n       setspath get and set the system execution path, getxvers and setxvers\n       get and set the experimental version prefix and migrate migrates\n       processes between sites.  The jobs builtin prints the site on which\n       each job is executing.\n\n       Under BS2000, bs2cmd executes commands of the underlying BS2000/OSD\n       operating system.\n\n       Under Domain/OS, inlib adds shared libraries to the current\n       environment, rootnode changes the rootnode and ver changes the systype.\n\n       Under Mach, setpath is equivalent to Mach's setpath(1).\n\n       Under Masscomp/RTU and Harris CX/UX, universe sets the universe.\n\n       Under Harris CX/UX, ucb or att runs a command under the specified\n       universe.\n\n       Under Convex/OS, warp prints or sets the universe.\n\n       The VENDOR, OSTYPE and MACHTYPE environment variables indicate\n       respectively the vendor, operating system and machine type\n       (microprocessor class or machine model) of the system on which the\n       shell thinks it is running.  These are particularly useful when sharing\n       one's home directory between several types of machines; one can, for\n       example,"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tcsh`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nset path = (~/bin.$MACHTYPE /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin .)\n\n       in one's ~/.login and put executables compiled for each machine in the\n       appropriate directory.\n\n       The version shell variable indicates what options were chosen when the\n       shell was compiled.\n\n       Note also the newgrp builtin, the afsuser and echo_style shell\n       variables and the system-dependent locations of the shell's input files\n       (see FILES).\n\n   Signal handling\n       Login shells ignore interrupts when reading the file ~/.logout.\tThe\n       shell ignores quit signals unless started with -q.  Login shells catch\n       the terminate signal, but non-login shells inherit the terminate\n       behavior from their parents.  Other signals have the values which the\n       shell inherited from its parent.\n\n       In shell scripts, the shell's handling of interrupt and terminate\n       signals can be controlled with onintr, and its handling of hangups can\n       be controlled with hup and nohup.\n\n       The shell exits on a hangup (see also the logout shell variable).  By\n       default, the shell's children do too, but the shell does not send them\n       a hangup when it exits.\thup arranges for the shell to send a hangup to\n       a child when it exits, and nohup sets a child to ignore hangups.\n\n   Terminal management (+)\n       The shell uses three different sets of terminal (``tty'') modes:\n       `edit', used when editing, `quote', used when quoting literal\n       characters, and `execute', used when executing commands.  The shell\n       holds some settings in each mode constant, so commands which leave the\n       tty in a confused state do not interfere with the shell.  The shell\n       also matches changes in the speed and padding of the tty.  The list of\n       tty modes that are kept constant can be examined and modified with the\n       setty builtin.  Note that although the editor uses CBREAK mode (or its\n       equivalent), it takes typed-ahead characters anyway.\n\n       The echotc, settc and telltc commands can be used to manipulate and\n       debug terminal capabilities from the command line.\n\n       On systems that support SIGWINCH or SIGWINDOW, the shell adapts to\n       window resizing automatically and adjusts the environment variables\n       LINES and COLUMNS if set.  If the environment variable TERMCAP contains\n       li# and co# fields, the shell adjusts them to reflect the new window\n       size.\n\nREFERENCE\n       The next sections of this manual describe all of the available Builtin\n       commands, Special aliases and Special shell variables.\n\n   Builtin commands\n       %job    A synonym for the fg builtin command.\n\n       %job &  A synonym for the bg builtin command.\n\n       :       Does nothing, successfully.\n\n       @\n       @ name = expr\n       @ name[index] = expr\n       @ name++|--\n       @ name[index]++|--\n\t       The first form prints the values of all shell variables.\n\n\t       The second form assigns the value of expr to name.  The third\n\t       form assigns the value of expr to the index'th component of\n\t       name; both name and its index'th component must already exist.\n\n\t       expr may contain the operators `*', `+', etc., as in C.\tIf\n\t       expr contains `<', `>', `&' or `' then at least that part of\n\t       expr must be placed within `()'.  Note that the syntax of expr\n\t       has nothing to do with that described under Expressions.\n\n\t       The fourth and fifth forms increment (`++') or decrement (`--')\n\t       name or its index'th component.\n\n\t       The space between `@' and name is required.  The spaces between\n\t       name and `=' and between `=' and expr are optional.  Components\n\t       of expr must be separated by spaces.\n\n       alias [name [wordlist]]\n\t       Without arguments, prints all aliases.  With name, prints the\n\t       alias for name.\tWith name and wordlist, assigns wordlist as\n\t       the alias of name.  wordlist is command and filename\n\t       substituted.  name may not be `alias' or `unalias'.  See also\n\t       the unalias builtin command.\n\n       alloc   Shows the amount of dynamic memory acquired, broken down into\n\t       used and free memory.  With an argument shows the number of\n\t       free and used blocks in each size category.  The categories\n\t       start at size 8 and double at each step.  This command's output\n\t       may vary across system types, because systems other than the\n\t       VAX may use a different memory allocator.\n\n       bg [%job ...]\n\t       Puts the specified jobs (or, without arguments, the current\n\t       job) into the background, continuing each if it is stopped.\n\t       job may be a number, a string, `', `%', `+' or `-' as described\n\t       under Jobs.\n\n       bindkey [-l|-d|-e|-v|-u] (+)\n       bindkey [-a] [-b] [-k] [-r] [--] key (+)\n       bindkey [-a] [-b] [-k] [-c|-s] [--] key command (+)\n\t       Without options, the first form lists all bound keys and the\n\t       editor command to which each is bound, the second form lists\n\t       the editor command to which key is bound and the third form\n\t       binds the editor command command to key.  Options include:\n\n\t       -l  Lists all editor commands and a short description of each.\n\t       -d  Binds all keys to the standard bindings for the default\n\t\t   editor, as per -e and -v below.\n\t       -e  Binds all keys to emacs(1)-style bindings.  Unsets vimode.\n\t       -v  Binds all keys to vi(1)-style bindings.  Sets vimode.\n\t       -a  Lists or changes key-bindings in the alternative key map.\n\t\t   This is the key map used in vimode command mode.\n\t       -b  key is interpreted as a control character written\n\t\t   ^character (e.g., `^A') or C-character (e.g., `C-A'), a\n\t\t   meta character written M-character (e.g., `M-A'), a\n\t\t   function key written F-string (e.g., `F-string'), or an\n\t\t   extended prefix key written X-character (e.g., `X-A').\n\t       -k  key is interpreted as a symbolic arrow key name, which may\n\t\t   be one of `down', `up', `left' or `right'.\n\t       -r  Removes key's binding.  Be careful: `bindkey -r' does not\n\t\t   bind key to self-insert-command (q.v.), it unbinds key\n\t\t   completely.\n\t       -c  command is interpreted as a builtin or external command\n\t\t   instead of an editor command.\n\t       -s  command is taken as a literal string and treated as\n\t\t   terminal input when key is typed.  Bound keys in command\n\t\t   are themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten\n\t\t   levels of interpretation.\n\t       --  Forces a break from option processing, so the next word is\n\t\t   taken as key even if it begins with '-'.\n\t       -u (or any invalid option)\n\t\t   Prints a usage message.\n\n\t       key may be a single character or a string.  If a command is\n\t       bound to a string, the first character of the string is bound\n\t       to sequence-lead-in and the entire string is bound to the\n\t       command.\n\n\t       Control characters in key can be literal (they can be typed by\n\t       preceding them with the editor command quoted-insert, normally\n\t       bound to `^V') or written caret-character style, e.g., `^A'.\n\t       Delete is written `^?' (caret-question mark).  key and command\n\t       can contain backslashed escape sequences (in the style of\n\t       System V echo(1)) as follows:\n\n\t\t   \\a\t   Bell\n\t\t   \\b\t   Backspace\n\t\t   \\e\t   Escape\n\t\t   \\f\t   Form feed\n\t\t   \\n\t   Newline\n\t\t   \\r\t   Carriage return\n\t\t   \\t\t   Horizontal tab\n\t\t   \\v\t   Vertical tab\n\t\t   \\nnn    The ASCII character corresponding to the octal\n\t\t\t   number nnn\n\n\t       `\\' nullifies the special meaning of the following character,\n\t       if it has any, notably `\\' and `^'.\n\n       bs2cmd bs2000-command (+)\n\t       Passes bs2000-command to the BS2000 command interpreter for\n\t       execution. Only non-interactive commands can be executed, and\n\t       it is not possible to execute any command that would overlay\n\t       the image of the current process, like /EXECUTE or /CALL-\n\t       PROCEDURE. (BS2000 only)\n\n       break   Causes execution to resume after the end of the nearest\n\t       enclosing foreach or while.  The remaining commands on the\n\t       current line are executed.  Multi-level breaks are thus\n\t       possible by writing them all on one line.\n\n       breaksw Causes a break from a switch, resuming after the endsw.\n\n       builtins (+)\n\t       Prints the names of all builtin commands.\n\n       bye (+) A synonym for the logout builtin command.  Available only if\n\t       the shell was so compiled; see the version shell variable.\n\n       case label:\n\t       A label in a switch statement as discussed below.\n\n       cd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [I--] [name]\n\t       If a directory name is given, changes the shell's working\n\t       directory to name.  If not, changes to home, unless the\n\t       cdtohome variable is not set, in which case a name is required.\n\t       If name is `-' it is interpreted as the previous working\n\t       directory (see Other substitutions).  (+) If name is not a\n\t       subdirectory of the current directory (and does not begin with\n\t       `/', `./' or `../'), each component of the variable cdpath is\n\t       checked to see if it has a subdirectory name.  Finally, if all\n\t       else fails but name is a shell variable whose value begins with\n\t       `/' or '.', then this is tried to see if it is a directory, and\n\t       the -p option is implied.\n\n\t       With -p, prints the final directory stack, just like dirs.  The\n\t       -l, -n and -v flags have the same effect on cd as on dirs, and\n\t       they imply -p.  (+) Using -- forces a break from option\n\t       processing so the next word is taken as the directory name even\n\t       if it begins with '-'.

Command is always executed in a sub-\n\t       shell, and the restrictions placed on commands in simple if\n\t       statements apply.\n\n       nohup [command]\n\t       With command, runs command such that it will ignore hangup\n\t       signals.

If set to `erase' and the same\n\t       event is found in the history list, that old event gets erased\n\t       and the current one gets inserted.  Note that the `prev' and\n\t       `all' options renumber history events so there are no gaps.\n\n       histfile (+)\n\t       The default location in which `history -S' and `history -L'\n\t       look for a history file.  If unset, ~/.history is used.\n\t       histfile is useful when sharing the same home directory between\n\t       different machines, or when saving separate histories on\n\t       different terminals.  Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally\n\t       sourced before ~/.history, histfile should be set in ~/.tcshrc\n\t       rather than ~/.login.\n\n       histlit (+)\n\t       If set, builtin and editor commands and the savehist mechanism\n\t       use the literal (unexpanded) form of lines in the history list.\n\t       See also the toggle-literal-history editor command.\n\n       history The first word indicates the number of history events to save.\n\t       The optional second word (+) indicates the format in which\n\t       history is printed; if not given, `%h\\t%T\\t%R\\n' is used.

Historically this\n\t       setting exited after 26 successive EOF's to avoid infinite\n\t       loops.  If set to a number n, the shell ignores n - 1\n\t       consecutive end-of-files and exits on the nth.  (+) If unset,\n\t       `1' is used, i.e., the shell exits on a single `^D'.\n\n       implicitcd (+)\n\t       If set, the shell treats a directory name typed as a command as\n\t       though it were a request to change to that directory.  If set\n\t       to verbose, the change of directory is echoed to the standard\n\t       output.\tThis behavior is inhibited in non-interactive shell\n\t       scripts, or for command strings with more than one word.\n\t       Changing directory takes precedence over executing a like-named\n\t       command, but it is done after alias substitutions.  Tilde and\n\t       variable expansions work as expected.\n\n       inputmode (+)\n\t       If set to `insert' or `overwrite', puts the editor into that\n\t       input mode at the beginning of each line.\n\n       killdup (+)\n\t       Controls handling of duplicate entries in the kill ring.  If\n\t       set to `all' only unique strings are entered in the kill ring.\n\t       If set to `prev' and the last killed string is the same as the\n\t       current killed string, then the current string is not entered\n\t       in the ring.

Set\n\t       to `30' by default.  If unset or set to less than `2', the\n\t       shell will only keep the most recently killed string.

The yank\n\t       editor command will yank the most recently killed string into\n\t       the command-line, while yank-pop (see Editor commands) can be\n\t       used to yank earlier killed strings.\n\n       listflags (+)\n\t       If set to `x', `a' or `A', or any combination thereof (e.g.,\n\t       `xA'), they are used as flags to ls-F, making it act like `ls\n\t       -xF', `ls -Fa', `ls -FA' or a combination (e.g., `ls -FxA'):\n\t       `a' shows all files (even if they start with a `.'), `A' shows\n\t       all files but `.' and `..', and `x' sorts across instead of\n\t       down.  If the second word of listflags is set, it is used as\n\t       the path to `ls(1)'.\n\n       listjobs (+)\n\t       If set, all jobs are listed when a job is suspended.  If set to\n\t       `long', the listing is in long format.\n\n       listlinks (+)\n\t       If set, the ls-F builtin command shows the type of file to\n\t       which each symbolic link points.\n\n       listmax (+)\n\t       The maximum number of items which the list-choices editor\n\t       command will list without asking first.\n\n       listmaxrows (+)\n\t       The maximum number of rows of items which the list-choices\n\t       editor command will list without asking first.\n\n       loginsh (+)\n\t       Set by the shell if it is a login shell.  Setting or unsetting\n\t       it within a shell has no effect.

See\n\t       also the autologout shell variable.\n\n       mail    A list of files and directories to check for incoming mail,\n\t       optionally preceded by a numeric word.  Before each prompt, if\n\t       10 minutes have passed since the last check, the shell checks\n\t       each file and says `You have new mail.'

See\n\t       also loginsh.\n\n       status  The exit status from the last command or backquote expansion,\n\t       or any command in a pipeline is propagated to status.  (This is\n\t       also the default csh behavior.)\tThis default does not match\n\t       what POSIX mandates (to return the status of the last command\n\t       only). To match the POSIX behavior, you need to unset anyerror.\n\n\t       If the anyerror variable is unset, the exit status of a\n\t       pipeline is determined only from the last command in the\n\t       pipeline, and the exit status of a backquote expansion is not\n\t       propagated to status.\n\n\t       If a command terminated abnormally, then 0200 is added to the\n\t       status.\tBuiltin commands which fail return exit status `1',\n\t       all other builtin commands return status `0'.\n\n       symlinks (+)\n\t       Can be set to several different values to control symbolic link\n\t       (`symlink') resolution:\n\n\t       If set to `chase', whenever the current directory changes to a\n\t       directory containing a symbolic link, it is expanded to the\n\t       real name of the directory to which the link points.  This does\n\t       not work for the user's home directory; this is a bug.\n\n\t       If set to `ignore', the shell tries to construct a current\n\t       directory relative to the current directory before the link was\n\t       crossed.  This means that cding through a symbolic link and\n\t       then `cd ..'ing returns one to the original directory.  This\n\t       affects only builtin commands and filename completion.\n\n\t       If set to `expand', the shell tries to fix symbolic links by\n\t       actually expanding arguments which look like path names.  This\n\t       affects any command, not just builtins.\tUnfortunately, this\n\t       does not work for hard-to-recognize filenames, such as those\n\t       embedded in command options.  Expansion may be prevented by\n\t       quoting.  While this setting is usually the most convenient, it\n\t       is sometimes misleading and sometimes confusing when it fails\n\t       to recognize an argument which should be expanded.  A\n\t       compromise is to use `ignore' and use the editor command\n\t       normalize-path (bound by default to ^X-n) when necessary.\n\n\t       Some examples are in order.

    The order in which startup files are read may differ if the shell was
           so compiled; see Startup and shutdown and the version shell variable.

    NEW FEATURES (+)
           This manual describes tcsh as a single entity, but experienced csh(1)
           users will want to pay special attention to tcsh's new features.

           A command-line editor, which supports emacs(1)-style or vi(1)-style key
           bindings.  See The command-line editor and Editor commands.

           Programmable, interactive word completion and listing.  See Completion
           and listing and the complete and uncomplete builtin commands.

           Spelling correction (q.v.) of filenames, commands and variables.

           Editor commands (q.v.) which perform other useful functions in the
           middle of typed commands, including documentation lookup (run-help),
           quick editor restarting (run-fg-editor) and command resolution (which-
           command).

           An enhanced history mechanism.  Events in the history list are time-
           stamped.  See also the history command and its associated shell
           variables, the previously undocumented `#' event specifier and new
           modifiers under History substitution, the *-history, history-search-*,
           i-search-*, vi-search-* and toggle-literal-history editor commands and
           the histlit shell variable.

    Manpage text:

    Enhanced directory parsing and directory stack handling.  See the cd,
           pushd, popd and dirs commands and their associated shell variables, the
           description of Directory stack substitution, the dirstack, owd and
           symlinks shell variables and the normalize-command and normalize-path
           editor commands.

           Negation in glob-patterns.  See Filename substitution.

           New File inquiry operators (q.v.) and a filetest builtin which uses
           them.

           A variety of Automatic, periodic and timed events (q.v.) including
           scheduled events, special aliases, automatic logout and terminal
           locking, command timing and watching for logins and logouts.

           Support for the Native Language System (see Native Language System
           support), OS variant features (see OS variant support and the
           echo_style shell variable) and system-dependent file locations (see
           FILES).

           Extensive terminal-management capabilities.  See Terminal management.

    Manpage text:

    New builtin commands including builtins, hup, ls-F, newgrp, printenv,
           which and where (q.v.).

           New variables that make useful information easily available to the
           shell.  See the gid, loginsh, oid, shlvl, tcsh, tty, uid and version
           shell variables and the HOST, REMOTEHOST, VENDOR, OSTYPE and MACHTYPE
           environment variables.

           A new syntax for including useful information in the prompt string (see
           prompt), and special prompts for loops and spelling correction (see
           prompt2 and prompt3).

           Read-only variables.  See Variable substitution.

    BUGS
           When a suspended command is restarted, the shell prints the directory
           it started in if this is different from the current directory.  This
           can be misleading (i.e., wrong) as the job may have changed directories
           internally.

           Shell builtin functions are not stoppable/restartable.  Command
           sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are also not handled gracefully when
           stopping is attempted.  If you suspend `b', the shell will then
           immediately execute `c'.  This is especially noticeable if this
           expansion results from an alias.  It suffices to place the sequence of
           commands in ()'s to force it to a subshell, i.e., `( a ; b ; c )'.

    Manpage text:

    Control over tty output after processes are started is primitive;
           perhaps this will inspire someone to work on a good virtual terminal
           interface.  In a virtual terminal interface much more interesting
           things could be done with output control.

           Alias substitution is most often used to clumsily simulate shell
           procedures; shell procedures should be provided rather than aliases.

           Control structures should be parsed rather than being recognized as
           built-in commands.  This would allow control commands to be placed
           anywhere, to be combined with `|', and to be used with `&' and `;'
           metasyntax.

           foreach doesn't ignore here documents when looking for its end.

           It should be possible to use the `:' modifiers on the output of command
           substitutions.

           The screen update for lines longer than the screen width is very poor
           if the terminal cannot move the cursor up (i.e., terminal type `dumb').

           HPATH and NOREBIND don't need to be environment variables.
