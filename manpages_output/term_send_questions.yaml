They are in essence convenient wrappers\n       around the builtin command puts.\n\n       ::term::send::wrch chan str\n\t      Send the text str to the channel specified by the handle chan.\n\t      In contrast to the builtin command puts this command does not\n\t      terminate the string with a line terminator. It also forces an\n\t      flush of Tcl internal and OS buffers to ensure that the\n\t      characters are processed immediately.\n\n       ::term::send::wr str\n\t      This convenience command is like ::term::send::wrch, except that\n\t      the destination channel is fixed to stdout.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category term of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       character output, control, terminal\n\nCATEGORY\n       Terminal control\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2006 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the term::send package?

  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the term::send package to send a string to a specific channel, ensuring immediate output without buffering?
