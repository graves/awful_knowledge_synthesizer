This is exposed by a Tcl stubs library table to reduce version\n       dependency as is available for Tcl itself.\n\nCOMMAND\n       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateMemoryChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp, int\n       initialSize)\n\n       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateFifoChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)\n\n       void Memchan_CreateFifo2Channel (Tcl_Interp *interp, Tcl_Channel *aPtr,\n       Tcl_Channel *bPtr)\n\n       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateNullChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)\n\n       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateZeroChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)\n\n       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateRandomChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)\n\n       Each of these functions creates an returns a channel exactly as\n       described in the Tcl command pages for each of the memchan commands.\n       The Tcl commands internally call these functions to create the\n       channels.\n\n       The memchan channel accepts an initialSize argument to permit pre-\n       allocating space for the internal buffer. Normally this may be set to\n       0.\n\n       The fifo2 API function looks a little different because it must return\n       two linked channels.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Tcl_GetChannelName\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2004 Pat Thoyts <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>"
