It reads\n     one requirement from a file or command arguments, converts it into\n     internal form, checks it, and then optionally outputs it in a different\n     form.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -b path\n\t     Requests that the requirement read be written in binary form to\n\t     the path given.\n\n     -r requirement-input\n\t     Specifies the input requirement. See \"specifying requirements\"\n\t     below. This is exactly the same format as is accepted by the -r\n\t     and -R options of the codesign(1) command.\n\n     -t      Requests that the requirement read be written as text to standard\n\t     output.\n\n     -v      Increases the verbosity of output. Multiple instances of -v\n\t     produce increasing levels of commentary output."

    Manpage text:

    In the first synopsis form, csreq reads a Code Requirement and writes it
         to standard output as canonical source text.  Note that with text input,
         this actually compiles the requirement into internal form and then
         converts it back to text, giving you the system's view of the requirement
         code.

         In the second synopsis form, csreq reads a Code Requirement and writes
         its binary representation to a file. This is the same form produced by
         the SecRequirementCopyData API, and is readily acceptable as input to
         Code Signing verification APIs. It can also be used as input to
         subsequent invocations of csreq by passing the filename to the -r option.

    SPECIFYING REQUIREMENTS
         The requirement argument (-r) can be given in various forms. A plain text
         argument is taken to be a path to a file containing the requirement. This
         program will accept both binary files containing properly compiled
         requirements code, and source files that are automatically compiled for
         use.  An argument of "-" requests that the requirement(s) are read from
         standard input.  Again, standard input can contain either binary form or
         text.  Finally, an argument that begins with an equal sign "=" is taken
         as a literal requirements source text, and is compiled accordingly for
         use.
