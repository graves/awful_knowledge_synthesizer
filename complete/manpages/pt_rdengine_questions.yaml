    DESCRIPTION
           Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
           that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to
           Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the
           current package is a part of.

           This package provides a class whose instances provide the runtime
           support for recursive descent parsers with backtracking, as is needed
           for the execution of, for example, parsing expression grammars. It
           implements the PackRat Machine Specification, as such that document is
           required reading to understand both this manpage, and the package
           itself. The description below does make numerous shorthand references
           to the PARAM's instructions and the various parts of its architectural
           state.

           The package resides in the Execution section of the Core Layer of
           Parser Tools.
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the pt_rdengine resource?
  manpageQuestion2: How can the pt_rdengine be utilized to support recursive descent parsing with backtracking in a grammar?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how the pt_rdengine package contributes to the execution of expression grammars?

The topmost entry of the stack will\n\t      be the first element of the returned list.\n\n       objectName ok\n\t      This method returns ST.\n\n       objectName value\n\t      This method returns SV.\n\n       objectName error\n\t      This method returns ER. This is either the empty string for an\n\t      empty ER, or a list of 2 elements, the location the error is\n\t      for, and a set of messages which specify which symbols were\n\t      expected at the location. The messages are encoded as one of the\n\t      possible atomic parsing expressions (special operators,\n\t      terminal, range, and nonterminal operator).\n\n       objectName errors\n\t      This method returns ES. The topmost entry of the stack will be\n\t      the first element of the returned list.

If to is not specified it\n\t      is taken as identical to from. If neither argument is specified\n\t      the whole of TC is returned.\n\n\t      Each token in the returned list is a list of three elements\n\t      itself, containing the character at the location, and the\n\t      associated line and column numbers, in this order.\n\n       objectName symbols\n\t      This method returns a dictionary containing NC. Keys are two-\n\t      element lists containing nonterminal symbol and location, in\n\t      this order. The values are 4-tuples containing CL, ST, ER, and\n\t      SV, in this order.

They all have\n       the prefix \"i_\".\n\n       The control flow is mainly provided by Tcl's builtin commands, like if,\n       while, etc., plus a few guarded variants of PARAM instructions and Tcl\n       commands.. That means that these instruction variants will do nothing\n       if their guard condition is not fulfilled. They can be recognized by\n       the prefix \"i:ok_\" and \"i:fail_\", which denote the value ST has to have\n       for the instruction to execute.\n\n       The instructions are listed in the same order they occur in the PackRat\n       Machine Specification, with the guard variants listed after their\n       regular implementation, if any, or in their place.\n\n       objectName i_input_next msg\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction input_next.\n\n       objectName i_test_alnum\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_alnum.\n\n       objectName i_test_alpha\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_alpha.\n\n       objectName i_test_ascii\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_ascii.\n\n       objectName i_test_char char\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_char.\n\n       objectName i_test_ddigit\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_ddigit.\n\n       objectName i_test_digit\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_digit.\n\n       objectName i_test_graph\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_graph.\n\n       objectName i_test_lower\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_lower.\n\n       objectName i_test_print\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_print.\n\n       objectName i_test_punct\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_punct.\n\n       objectName i_test_range chars chare\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_range.\n\n       objectName i_test_space\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_space.\n\n       objectName i_test_upper\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_upper.\n\n       objectName i_test_wordchar\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_wordchar.\n\n       objectName i_test_xdigit\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction test_xdigit.\n\n       objectName i_error_clear\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction error_clear.\n\n       objectName i_error_push\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction error_push.\n\n       objectName i_error_pop_merge\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction error_pop_merge.\n\n       objectName i_error_nonterminal symbol\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction error_nonterminal.\n\n       objectName i_status_ok\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction status_ok.\n\n       objectName i_status_fail\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction status_fail.\n\n       objectName i_status_negate\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction status_negate.\n\n       objectName i_loc_push\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction loc_push.\n\n       objectName i_loc_pop_discard\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction loc_pop_discard.\n\n       objectName i_loc_pop_rewind\n\t      This method implements the PARAM instruction loc_pop_rewind.\n\n       objectName i:ok_loc_pop_rewind\n\t      This guarded method, a variant of i_loc_pop_rewind, executes\n\t      only for \"ST == ok\".\n\n       objectName i_loc_pop_rewind/discard\n\t      This method is a convenient combination of control flow and the\n\t      two PARAM instructions loc_pop_rewind and loc_pop_discard.

The upcoming set is much broader in scope, folding as much as six\n       or more PARAM instructions into a single method call.\n\n       In this we can see the reasoning behind their use well:\n\n       [1]    By using less instructions the generated parsers become smaller,\n\t      as the common parts are now truly part of the common runtime,\n\t      and not explicitly written in the parser's code over and over\n\t      again.\n\n       [2]    Using less instructions additionally reduces the overhead\n\t      associated with calls into the runtime, i.e. the cost of method\n\t      dispatch and of setting up the variable context.\n\n       [3]    Another effect of the super instructions is that their internals\n\t      can be optimized as well, especially regarding control flow, and\n\t      stack use, as the runtime internals are accessible to all\n\t      instructions folded into the sequence.\n\n       objectName si:void_state_push\n\t      This method combines\n\n\t      i_loc_push\n\t      i_error_clear\n\t      i_error_push\n\n\t      Parsers use it at the beginning of void sequences and choices\n\t      with a void initial branch.\n\n       objectName
