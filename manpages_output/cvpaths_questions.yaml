If the\n       cvpaths file is executable, then it will be executed expecting it to be\n       a shell script that will produce the cvpaths syntax on standard output,\n       otherwise it will simply be read as input.\n\nSYNTAX\n       The format rules for a line in the cvpaths file is:"

  manpageQuestion2: How would you configure the cvpaths file to include a specific device path like /dev/rdisk3 in the disk discovery process?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how to create an executable cvpaths script that outputs custom device paths for the Xsan File System?
