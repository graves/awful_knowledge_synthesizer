However during that time a number\n       of perl extensions switched to using it, so the API is mostly fixed to\n       maintain (source) compatibility.\n\n       The aim of the implementation is to provide the PerlIO API in a\n       flexible and platform neutral manner. It is also a trial of an \"Object\n       Oriented C, with vtables\" approach which may be applied to Raku.\n\n   Basic Structure\n       PerlIO is a stack of layers.\n\n       The low levels of the stack work with the low-level operating system\n       calls (file descriptors in C) getting bytes in and out, the higher\n       layers of the stack buffer, filter, and otherwise manipulate the I/O,\n       and return characters (or bytes) to Perl.  Terms above and below are\n       used to refer to the relative positioning of the stack layers."

The functions in the\n       vtable implement operations like \"open\", \"read\", and \"write\".\n\n       When I/O, for example \"read\", is requested, the request goes from Perl\n       first down the stack using \"read\" functions of each layer, then at the\n       bottom the input is requested from the operating system services, then\n       the result is returned up the stack, finally being interpreted as Perl\n       data.\n\n       The requests do not necessarily go always all the way down to the\n       operating system: that's where PerlIO buffering comes into play.\n\n       When you do an open() and specify extra PerlIO layers to be deployed,\n       the layers you specify are \"pushed\" on top of the already existing\n       default stack.  One way to see it is that \"operating system is on the\n       left\" and \"Perl is on the right\".\n\n       What exact layers are in this default stack depends on a lot of things:\n       your operating system, Perl version, Perl compile time configuration,\n       and Perl runtime configuration.\tSee PerlIO, \"PERLIO\" in perlrun, and\n       open for more information."

As an example there is a layer called\n       \"raw\" which repeatedly \"pops\" layers until it reaches the first layer\n       that has declared itself capable of handling binary data.  The \"pushed\"\n       layers are processed in left-to-right order.\n\n       sysopen() operates (unsurprisingly) at a lower level in the stack than\n       open().\tFor example in Unix or Unix-like systems sysopen() operates\n       directly at the level of file descriptors: in the terms of PerlIO\n       layers, it uses only the \"unix\" layer, which is a rather thin wrapper\n       on top of the Unix file descriptors.\n\n   Layers vs Disciplines\n       Initial discussion of the ability to modify IO streams behaviour used\n       the term \"discipline\" for the entities which were added. This came (I\n       believe) from the use of the term in \"sfio\", which in turn borrowed it\n       from \"line disciplines\" on Unix terminals. However, this document (and\n       the C code) uses the term \"layer\"."

Layers can modify that behaviour\n\t   by defining their own Binmode entry.\n\n       \"utf8\"\n\t   Another dummy layer. When pushed it pops itself and sets the\n\t   \"PERLIO_F_UTF8\" flag on the layer which was (and now is once more)\n\t   the top of the stack.\n\n       In addition perlio.c also provides a number of \"PerlIOBase_xxxx()\"\n       functions which are intended to be used in the table slots of classes\n       which do not need to do anything special for a particular method."

When an unknown\n       layer is encountered the PerlIO code will perform the equivalent of :\n\n\t  use PerlIO 'layer';\n\n       Where layer is the unknown layer.

It is an example of a layer which takes an argument as it\n\t   is called thus:\n\n\t      open( $fh, \"<:encoding(iso-8859-7)\", $pathname );\n\n       \":scalar\"\n\t   Provides support for reading data from and writing data to a\n\t   scalar.\n\n\t      open( $fh, \"+<:scalar\", \\$scalar );\n\n\t   When a handle is so opened, then reads get bytes from the string\n\t   value of $scalar, and writes change the value. In both cases the\n\t   position in $scalar starts as zero but can be altered via \"seek\",\n\t   and determined via \"tell\"."
