NAME
       stringprep - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stringprep.h>

       int stringprep(char * in, size_t maxlen, Stringprep_profile_flags
       flags, const Stringprep_profile * profile);

ARGUMENTS
       char * in   input/output array with string to prepare.

       size_t maxlen
		   maximum length of input/output array.

       Stringprep_profile_flags flags
		   a Stringprep_profile_flags value, or 0.

       const Stringprep_profile * profile
		   pointer to Stringprep_profile to use.

DESCRIPTION
       Prepare the input zero terminated UTF-8 string according to the
       stringprep profile, and write back the result to the input string.

       Note that you must convert strings entered in the systems locale into
       UTF-8 before using this function, see stringprep_locale_to_utf8().

       Since the stringprep operation can expand the string,  maxlen indicate
       how large the buffer holding the string is.  This function will not
       read or write to characters outside that size.

       The  flags are one of Stringprep_profile_flags values, or 0.

       The  profile contain the Stringprep_profile instructions to perform.
       Your application can define new profiles, possibly re-using the generic
       stringprep tables that always will be part of the library, or use one
       of the currently supported profiles.

       Return value: Returns STRINGPREP_OK iff successful, or an error code.
