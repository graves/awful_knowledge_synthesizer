Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This document describes two APIs. First the API shared by all packages\n       for the conversion of some other format into Parsing Expression\n       Grammars , and then the API shared by the packages which implement the\n       import plugins sitting on top of the conversion packages.\n\n       Its intended audience are people who wish to create their own converter\n       for some type of input, and/or an import plugin for their or some other\n       converter.\n\n       It resides in the Import section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_import\n\nCONVERTER API\n       Any (grammar) import converter has to follow the rules set out below:\n\n       [1]    A converter is a package. Its name is arbitrary, however it is\n\t      recommended to put it under the ::pt::peg::from namespace.\n\n       [2]    The package provides either a single Tcl command following the\n\t      API outlined below, or a class command whose instances follow\n\t      the same API. The commands which follow the API are called\n\t      converter commands.\n\n       [3]    A converter command has to provide the following single method\n\t      with the given signature and semantic. Converter commands are\n\t      allowed to provide more methods of their own, but not less, and\n\t      they may not provide different semantics for the standardized\n\t      method.\n\n\t      CONVERTER convert text\n\t\t     This method has to accept some text, a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar in some format.  The result of the method has to\n\t\t     be the canonical serialization of a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization\n\t\t     format, the result of reading and converting the input\n\t\t     text.\n\nPLUGIN API\n       Any (grammar) import plugin has to follow the rules set out below:\n\n       [1]    A plugin is a package.\n\n       [2]    The name of a plugin package has the form pt::peg::import::FOO,\n\t      where FOO is the name of the format the plugin will accept input\n\t      for.\n\n       [3]    The plugin can expect that the package pt::peg::import::plugin\n\t      is present, as indicator that it was invoked from a genuine\n\t      plugin manager.\n\n\t      It is recommended that a plugin does check for the presence of\n\t      this package.\n\n       [4]    The plugin can expect that a command named IncludeFile is\n\t      present, with the signature\n\n\t      IncludeFile currentfile path\n\t\t     This command has to be invoked by the plugin when it has\n\t\t     to process an included file, if the format has the\n\t\t     concept of such.\n\n\t\t     The plugin has to supply the following arguments\n\n\t\t     string currentfile\n\t\t\t    The path of the file it is currently processing.\n\t\t\t    This may be the empty string if no such is known.\n\n\t\t     string path\n\t\t\t    The path of the include file as specified in the\n\t\t\t    include directive being processed.\n\t      The result of the command will be a 5-element list containing\n\n\t\t     [1]    A boolean flag indicating the success (True) or\n\t\t\t    failure (False) of the operation.\n\n\t\t     [2]    In case of success the contents of the included\n\t\t\t    file, and the empty string otherwise.\n\n\t\t     [3]    The resolved, i.e. absolute path of the included\n\t\t\t    file, if possible, or the unchanged path argument.\n\t\t\t    This is for display in an error message, or as the\n\t\t\t    currentfile argument of another call to\n\t\t\t    IncludeFile should this file contain more files.\n\n\t\t     [4]    In case of success an empty string, and for\n\t\t\t    failure a code indicating the reason for it, one\n\t\t\t    of\n\n\t\t\t    notfound\n\t\t\t\t   The specified file could not be found.\n\n\t\t\t    notread\n\t\t\t\t   The specified file was found, but not be\n\t\t\t\t   read into memory.\n\n\t\t     [5]    An empty string in case of success of a notfound\n\t\t\t    failure, and an additional error message\n\t\t\t    describing the reason for a notread error in more\n\t\t\t    detail.\n\n       [5]    A plugin has to provide a single command, in the global\n\t      namespace, with the signature shown below.
