It is designed to provide access to a large subset of the\n       functionality of the Latent Semantic Mapping API, mainly for rapid\n       prototyping and diagnostic purposes, but possibly also for simple shell\n       script based applications of Latent Semantic Mapping.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       lsm provides a variety of commands (lsm_command in the Synopsis), each\n       of which often has a wealth of options (see the Command Options below).\n       Command names may be abbreviated to unambiguous prefixes.\n\n       lsm create map_file input_files\n\t   Create a new LSM map from the specified input_files.\n\n       lsm update map_file input_files\n\t   Add the specified input_files to an existing LSM map.\n\n       lsm evaluate map_file input_files\n\t   Classify the specified input_files into the categories of the LSM\n\t   map.\n\n       lsm cluster [--k-means=N | --agglomerative=N] [--apply]\n\t   Compute clusters for the map, and, if the --apply option is\n\t   specified, transform the map accordingly. Multiple levels of\n\t   clustering may be applied for faster performance on large maps,\n\t   e.g.\n\n\t      lsm cluster --k-means=100 --each --agglomerative=100 --agglomerative=1000 my.map\n\n\t   first computes 100 clusters using (fast) k-means clustering,\n\t   computes 100 subclusters for each first stage cluster using\n\t   agglomerative clustering, and finally reduces those 10000 clusters\n\t   to 1000 using agglomerative clustering.\n\n       lsm dump map_file [input_files]\n\t   Without input_files, dumps all words in the map with their counts.\n\t   With input_files, dump, for each file, the words that appear in the\n\t   map, their counts in the map, and their relative frequencies in the\n\t   input file.\n\n       lsm info map_file\n\t   Bypass the Latent Semantic Mapping framework to extract and print\n\t   information about the file and perform a number of consistency\n\t   checks on it. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)\n\nCOMMAND OPTIONS\n       This section describes the command_options that are available for the\n       lsm commands. Not all commands support all of these options; each\n       option is only supported for commands where it makes sense.  However,\n       when a command has one of these options you can count on the same\n       meaning for the option as in other commands.\n\n       --append-categories\n\t   Directs the update command to put the data into new categories\n\t   appended after the existing ones, instead of adding the data to the\n\t   existing categories.\n\n       --categories count\n\t   Directs the evaluate command to only list the top count categories.\n\n       --category-delimiter delimiter\n\t   Specify the delimiter to be used to between categories in the\n\t   input_files passed to the create and update commands.\n\n\t   group   Categories are separated by a `;' argument.\n\n\t   file    Each input_file represents a separate category. This is the\n\t\t   default if the --category-delimiter option is not given.\n\n\t   line    Each line represents a separate category.\n\n\t   string  Categories are separated by the specified string.\n\n       --clobber\n\t   When creating a map, overwrite an existing file at the path, even\n\t   if it's not an LSM map.  By default, create will only overwrite an\n\t   existing file if it's believed to be an LSM map, which guards\n\t   against frequent operator errors such as:\n\n\t      lsm create /usr/include/*.h\n\n       --dimensions dim\n\t   Direct the create and update commands to use the given number of\n\t   dimensions for computing the map (Defaults to the number of\n\t   categories). This option is useful to manage the size and\n\t   computational overhead of maps with large number of categories.\n\n       --discard-counts\n\t   Direct the create and update commands to omit the raw word / token\n\t   counts when writing the map. This results in a map that is more\n\t   compact, but cannot be updated any further.\n\n       --hash\n\t   Direct the create and update commands to write the map in a format\n\t   that is not human readable with default file manipulation tools\n\t   like cat or hexdump. This is useful in applications such as junk\n\t   mail filtering, where input data may contain naughty words and\n\t   where the contents of the map may tip off spammers what words to\n\t   avoid.\n\n       --help\n\t   List an overview of the options available for a command. Available\n\t   for all commands.\n\n       --html\n\t   Strip HTML codes from the input_files. Useful for mail and web\n\t   input. Available for the create, update, evaluate, and dump\n\t   commands.\n\n       --junk-mail\n\t   When parsing the input files, apply heuristics to counteract common\n\t   methods used by spammers to disguise incriminating words such as:\n\n\t      Zer0 1nt3rest l0ans     Substituting letters with digits\n\t      W E A L T H\t      Adding spaces between letters\n\t      m.o.r.t.g.a.g.e\t      Adding punctuation between letters\n\n\t   Available for the create, update, evaluate, and dump commands.\n\n       --pairs\n\t   If specified with the create command when building the map, store\n\t   counts for pairs of words as well as the words themselves. This can\n\t   increase accuracy for certain classes of problems, but will\n\t   generate unreasonably large maps unless the vocabulary is fairly\n\t   limited.\n\n       --stop-words stop_word_file\n\t   If specified with the create command, stop_word_file is parsed and\n\t   all words found are excluded from texts evaluated against the map.\n\t   This is useful for excluding frequent, semantically meaningless\n\t   words.\n\n       --sweep-cutoff threshold\n       --sweep-frequency days\n\t   Available for the create and update commands. Every specified\n\t   number of days (by default 7), scan the map and remove from it any\n\t   entries that have been in the map for at least 2 previous scans and\n\t   whose total counts are smaller than threshold.  threshold defaults\n\t   to 0, so by default the map is not scanned.\n\n       --text-delimiter delimiter\n\t   Specify the delimiter to be used to between texts in the\n\t   input_files passed to the create, update, evaluate, and dump\n\t   commands.\n\n\t   file    Each input_file represents a separate text. This is the\n\t\t   default if the --text-delimiter option is not given.\n\n\t   line    Each line represents a separate text.\n\n\t   string  Texts are separated by the specified string.\n\n       --triplets\n\t   If specified with the create command when building the map, store\n\t   counts for triplets and pairs of words as well as the words\n\t   themselves. This can increase accuracy for certain classes of\n\t   problems, but will generate unreasonably large maps unless the\n\t   vocabulary is fairly limited.\n\n       --weight weight\n\t   Scale counts of input words for the create and update commands by\n\t   the specified weight, which may be a positive or negative floating\n\t   point number.\n\n       --words\n\t   Directs the evaluate or cluster commands to apply to words, instead\n\t   of categories.\n\n       --words=count\n\t   Directs the evaluate command to list the top count words, instead\n\t   of categories.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       \"lsm evaluate --html --junk-mail ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/LSMMap2\n       msg*.txt\"\n\t   Simulate the Mail.app junk mail filter by evaluating the specified\n\t   files (assumed to each hold the raw text of one mail message)\n\t   against the user's junk mail map.\n\n       \"lsm dump ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/LSMMap2\"\n\t   Dump the words accumulated in the junk mail map and their counts.\n\n       \"lsm create --category-delimiter=group c_vs_h *.c ';' *.h\"\n\t   Create an LSM map trained to distinguish C header files from C\n\t   source files.\n\n       \"lsm update --weight 2.0 --cat=group c_vs_h ';' ../xy/*.h\"\n\t   Add some additional header files with an increased weight to the\n\t   training.\n\n       \"lsm create --help\"\n\t   List the options available for the lsm create command.\n\n1.0\t\t\t\t  2024-05-10\t\t\t\tLSM(1)"
