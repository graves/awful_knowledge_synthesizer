If an image\n       or bitmap is being displayed in the label then the value is in screen\n       units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels); for text it\n       is in lines of text.  If this option is not specified, the label's\n       desired height is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text\n       being displayed in it.  [-state state] Specifies one of three states\n       for the label:  normal, active, or disabled.  In normal state the\n       button is displayed using the foreground and background options.  In\n       active state the label is displayed using the activeForeground and\n       activeBackground options.  In the disabled state the disabledForeground\n       and background options determine how the button is displayed.\n       [-width width] Specifies a desired width for the label.\tIf an image or\n       bitmap is being displayed in the label then the value is in screen\n       units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels); for text it\n       is in characters.  If this option is not specified, the label's desired\n       width is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text being\n       displayed in it.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Additional options, described above,\n       may be specified on the command line or in the option database to\n       configure aspects of the label such as its colors, font, text, and\n       initial relief.\tThe label command returns its pathName argument.  At\n       the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named\n       pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A label is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.\n       If text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it can\n       occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines or if\n       wrapping occurs because of the wrapLength option) and one of the\n       characters may optionally be underlined using the underline option.\n       The label can be manipulated in a few simple ways, such as changing its\n       relief or text, using the commands described below."

The\n       following commands are possible for label widgets:\n\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the label\n\t      command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the label\n\t      command."
