For variables, the\n       underlying mechanism uses trace and dump var.  For commands, it renames\n       the observed procedure and uses a special wrapper procedure.  WARNING:\n       using this procedure after checkpointing state will result in major\n       problems if you clean state because the renamed (true) commands will be\n       lost.\n\n       This procedure is experimental.\tComments are encouraged.\n\n       observe command cmdname ?maxlevel?\n\t      This will create a wrapper command which prints out (using dump)\n\t      the call stack to the console.  maxlevel represents the maximum\n\t      number of levels of the call stack which will be printed\n\t      (defaults to 4).\n\n       observe cdelete cmdname\n\t      Removes the wrapper around an observed command.\n\n       observe cinfo cmdname\n\t      Prints out useless info.\n\n       observe variable varname operation ?args?\n\t      Currently a wrapper around trace that uses dump to print out the\n\t      value of the named variable whenever the specified operation on\n\t      that variable occurs (must be read, write or unset).\n\n       observe vdelete varname operation\n\t      Deletes the trace wrapper around the named variable.\n\n       observe vinfo varname\n\t      Prints out trace info about the named variable.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dump(n), idebug(n), tkcon(1), tkcon(n), tkconrc(5)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       Tk, console, debug\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) Jeffrey Hobbs <jeff at hobbs.org>"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the observe command in TkCon?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the observe command to monitor the value of a variable named 'myVar' whenever it is written to?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the observe command to create a wrapper around a command named 'myProc' that prints the call stack up to 5 levels deep?
