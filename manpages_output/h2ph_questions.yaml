Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `h2ph`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nH2PH(1) \t       Perl Programmers Reference Guide \t       H2PH(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       h2ph - convert .h C header files to .ph Perl header files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       h2ph [-d destination directory] [-r | -a] [-l] [-h] [-e] [-D] [-Q]\n       [headerfiles]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       h2ph converts any C header files specified to the corresponding Perl\n       header file format.  It is most easily run while in /usr/include:\n\n\t       cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*\n\n       or\n\n\t       cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/* arpa/* netinet/*\n\n       or\n\n\t       cd /usr/include; h2ph -r -l .\n\n       The output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at Perl's\n       architecture dependent library directory.  You can specify a different\n       hierarchy with a -d switch.\n\n       If run with no arguments, filters standard input to standard output.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -d destination_dir\n\t   Put the resulting .ph files beneath destination_dir, instead of\n\t   beneath the default Perl library location\n\t   ($Config{'installsitearch'}).\n\n       -r  Run recursively; if any of headerfiles are directories, then run\n\t   h2ph on all files in those directories (and their subdirectories,\n\t   etc.).  -r and -a are mutually exclusive.\n\n       -a  Run automagically; convert headerfiles, as well as any .h files\n\t   which they include.\tThis option will search for .h files in all\n\t   directories which your C compiler ordinarily uses.  -a and -r are\n\t   mutually exclusive.\n\n       -l  Symbolic links will be replicated in the destination directory.  If\n\t   -l is not specified, then links are skipped over.\n\n       -h  Put 'hints' in the .ph files which will help in locating problems\n\t   with h2ph.  In those cases when you require a .ph file containing\n\t   syntax errors, instead of the cryptic\n\n\t\t   [ some error condition ] at (eval mmm) line nnn\n\n\t   you will see the slightly more helpful\n\n\t\t   [ some error condition ] at filename.ph line nnn\n\n\t   However, the .ph files almost double in size when built using -h.\n\n       -e  If an error is encountered during conversion, output file will be\n\t   removed and a warning emitted instead of terminating the conversion\n\t   immediately.\n\n       -D  Include the code from the .h file as a comment in the .ph file.\n\t   This is primarily used for debugging h2ph.\n\n       -Q  'Quiet' mode; don't print out the names of the files being\n\t   converted.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n       No environment variables are used.\n\nFILES\n\t/usr/include/*.h\n\t/usr/include/sys/*.h\n\n       etc.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Larry Wall\n\nSEE ALSO\n       perl(1)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       The usual warnings if it can't read or write the files involved.\n\nBUGS\n       Doesn't construct the %sizeof array for you.\n\n       It doesn't handle all C constructs, but it does attempt to isolate\n       definitions inside evals so that you can get at the definitions that it\n       can translate.\n\n       It's only intended as a rough tool.  You may need to dicker with the\n       files produced.\n\n       You have to run this program by hand; it's not run as part of the Perl\n       installation.\n\n       Doesn't handle complicated expressions built piecemeal, a la:\n\n\t   enum {\n\t       FIRST_VALUE,\n\t       SECOND_VALUE,\n\t   #ifdef ABC\n\t       THIRD_VALUE\n\t   #endif\n\t   };\n\n       Doesn't necessarily locate all of your C compiler's internally-defined\n       symbols.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2024-12-14\t\t\t       H2PH(1)"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the h2ph tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use h2ph to convert all .h files in the /usr/include/sys directory and its subdirectories into .ph files in a custom destination directory?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using h2ph to convert a specific .h file while ensuring that symbolic links are replicated in the destination directory and that no progress is printed to the terminal?
