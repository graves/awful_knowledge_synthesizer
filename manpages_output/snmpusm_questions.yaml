This tool can be used to create,\n       delete, clone, and change the passphrase of users configured on a\n       running SNMP agent."

In principle, this user should be\n       useable for 'noAuthNoPriv' requests, but in practise the Net-SNMP agent\n       will not allow such an entry to be made active.\tThe user can be\n       created via the createAndWait operation instead by using the -Ca flag.\n       This will prevent the user from being marked as active in any agent\n       until explicitly activated later via the activate command."
