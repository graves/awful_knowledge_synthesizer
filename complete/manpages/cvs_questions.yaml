The\n\t      resulting information is stored in the variables whose names\n\t      were specified via evar, cvar, and fvar.\n\n\t      Already existing information in the referenced variables is\n\t      preserved, allowing the caller to merge data from multiple logs\n\t      into one database.\n\n\t      varname evar (in)\n\t\t     Has to refer to a scalar variable. After the call this\n\t\t     variable will contain a list of all the entries found in\n\t\t     the log file. An entry is identified through the\n\t\t     combination of date and author, and can be split over\n\t\t     multiple physical entries, one per touched file.\n\n\t\t     It should be noted that the entries are listed in the\n\t\t     same order as they were found in the text. This is not\n\t\t     necessarily sorted by date or author.\n\n\t\t     Each item in the list is a list containing two elements,\n\t\t     the date of the entry, and its author, in this order. The\n\t\t     date is formatted as year/month/day.\n\n\t      varname cvar (in)\n\t\t     Has to refer to an array variable. Keys are strings\n\t\t     containing the date and author of log entries, in this\n\t\t     order, separated by a comma.\n\n\t\t     The values are lists of comments made for the entry.\n\n\t      varname fvar (in)\n\t\t     Has to refer to an array variable. Keys are strings\n\t\t     containing date, author of a log entry, and a comment for\n\t\t     that entry, in this order, separated by commas.\n\n\t\t     The values are lists of the files the entry is touching."
