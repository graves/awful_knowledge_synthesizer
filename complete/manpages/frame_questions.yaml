In this case, the widget will display no background or\n       border, and no colors will be consumed from its colormap for its\n       background and border.  [-class class] Specifies a class for the\n       window.\tThis class will be used when querying the option database for\n       the window's other options, and it will also be used later for other\n       purposes such as bindings.  The class option may not be changed with\n       the configure widget command.  [-colormap colormap] Specifies a\n       colormap to use for the window.\tThe value may be either new, in which\n       case a new colormap is created for the window and its children, or the\n       name of another window (which must be on the same screen and have the\n       same visual as pathName), in which case the new window will use the\n       colormap from the specified window.  If the colormap option is not\n       specified, the new window uses the same colormap as its parent.\tThis\n       option may not be changed with the configure widget command.\n       [-container container] The value must be a boolean.  If true, it means\n       that this window will be used as a container in which some other\n       application will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can be\n       embedded using the -use option).  The window will support the\n       appropriate window manager protocols for things like geometry requests.\n       The window should not have any children of its own in this application.\n       This option may not be changed with the configure widget command.\n       [-height height] Specifies the desired height for the window in any of\n       the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less than or\n       equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.\tNote\n       that this sets the total height of the frame, any -borderwidth or\n       similar is not added.  Normally -height should not be used if a\n       propagating geometry manager, such as grid or pack, is used within the\n       frame since the geometry manager will override the height of the frame.\n       [-visual visual] Specifies visual information for the new window in any\n       of the forms accepted by Tk_GetVisual.  If this option is not\n       specified, the new window will use the same visual as its parent.  The\n       visual option may not be modified with the configure widget command.\n       [-width width] Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the\n       forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less than or equal\n       to zero then the window will not request any size at all.  Note that\n       this sets the total width of the frame, any -borderwidth or similar is\n       not added.  Normally -width should not be used if a propagating\n       geometry manager, such as grid or pack, is used within the frame since\n       the geometry manager will override the width of the frame.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `frame`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The frame command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument)\n       and makes it into a frame widget.  Additional options, described above,\n       may be specified on the command line or in the option database to\n       configure aspects of the frame such as its background color and relief.\n       The frame command returns the path name of the new window.\n\n       A frame is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a spacer\n       or container for complex window layouts.  The only features of a frame\n       are its background color and an optional 3-D border to make the frame\n       appear raised or sunken.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The frame command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same as\n       the path name of the frame's window.  This command may be used to\n       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general\n       form:\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same as the frame\n       widget's path name.  Option and the args determine the exact behavior\n       of the command.\tThe following commands are possible for frame widgets:"
