In debug mode, smbd will not exit when\n\t      idle.\n\n     -help    Prints a usage message and exits.\n\n     -ports list\n\t      The service will listen on each of the TCP ports specified in\n\t      the comma-separated list. This option is typically only used for\n\t      debugging, since smbd is normally launched by launchd(8) on port\n\t      445.\n\n     -stdout  Causes smbd to print log messages to standard output instead of\n\t      the system log.\n\n     -no-symlinks\n\t      In normal operation, smbd will respond to client symlink\n\t      requests but will never follow symlinks itself. This flag causes\n\t      smbd to restrict client access to symlink operations and to\n\t      always follow symlinks. In this case, clients will not be aware\n\t      that symlinks are in use because they will always be directed to\n\t      the symlink target."
