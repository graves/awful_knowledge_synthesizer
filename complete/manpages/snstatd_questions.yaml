It is used to gather statistics about file system activity and\n       related activity such as I/O and storage manager activity.  This daemon\n       also services requests from the qustat command and archives statistics\n       to .csv files.  The archive files reside in /usr/cvfs/qustats.\n\n       snstatd is configured using the qustat.conf(5) configuration file,\n       which specifies the intervals for gathering and archiving statistics.\n       Debugging levels can also be specified in this file.\n\n       snstatd may be started, stopped or restarted in cvadmin(8) using the\n       startd, stopd, restartd commands respectively. This may be done to\n       propagate changes made to the existing qustat.conf(5) file.\n\n       snstatd logs to /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/snstatd.log for debugging\n       purposes."
