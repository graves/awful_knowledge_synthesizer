Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl5241delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERL5241DELTA(1)       Perl Programmers Reference Guide       PERL5241DELTA(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perl5241delta - what is new for perl v5.24.1\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This document describes differences between the 5.24.0 release and the\n       5.24.1 release.\n\n       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read\n       perl5240delta, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.24.0.\n\nSecurity\n   -Di switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output\n       Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file specified\n       by the \"PERLIO_DEBUG\" environment variable if perl wasn't running\n       setuid and the -T or -t switches hadn't been parsed yet.\n\n       If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its\n       switches this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file\n       named by \"PERLIO_DEBUG\" even when the -T switch had been supplied.\n\n       Perl now requires the -Di switch to produce PerlIO debugging output.\n       By default this is written to \"stderr\", but can optionally be\n       redirected to a file by setting the \"PERLIO_DEBUG\" environment\n       variable.\n\n       If perl is running setuid or the -T switch was supplied \"PERLIO_DEBUG\"\n       is ignored and the debugging output is sent to \"stderr\" as for any\n       other -D switch.\n\n   Core modules and tools no longer search \".\" for optional modules\n       The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search the\n       default current directory entry in @INC for optional modules.  For\n       example, Storable will remove the final \".\" from @INC before trying to\n       load Log::Agent.\n\n       This prevents an attacker injecting an optional module into a process\n       run by another user where the current directory is writable by the\n       attacker, e.g. the /tmp directory.\n\n       In most cases this removal should not cause problems, but difficulties\n       were encountered with base, which treats every module name supplied as\n       optional.  These difficulties have not yet been resolved, so for this\n       release there are no changes to base.  We hope to have a fix for base\n       in Perl 5.24.2.\n\n       To protect your own code from this attack, either remove the default\n       \".\" entry from @INC at the start of your script, so:\n\n\t #!/usr/bin/perl\n\t use strict;\n\t ...\n\n       becomes:\n\n\t #!/usr/bin/perl\n\t BEGIN { pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.' }\n\t use strict;\n\t ...\n\n       or for modules, remove \".\" from a localized @INC, so:\n\n\t my $can_foo = eval { require Foo; }\n\n       becomes:\n\n\t my $can_foo = eval {\n\t     local @INC = @INC;\n\t     pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.';\n\t     require Foo;\n\t };\n\nIncompatible Changes\n       Other than the security changes above there are no changes\n       intentionally incompatible with Perl 5.24.0.  If any exist, they are\n       bugs, and we request that you submit a report.

The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.1:\n\n       Aaron Crane, Alex Vandiver, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chad Granum, Chris\n       'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Father Chrysostomos, James E Keenan,\n       Jarkko Hietaniemi, Karen Etheridge, Leon Timmermans, Matthew Horsfall,\n       Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Sebastien Aperghis-Tramoni, Stevan Little,\n       Steve Hay, Tony Cook.\n\n       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically\n       generated from version control history.\tIn particular, it does not\n       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who\n       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.\n\n       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN\n       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles\n       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the Perl bug\n       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at\n       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see\n       \"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\" in perlsec for details of\n       how to report the issue.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5241DELTA(1)"
