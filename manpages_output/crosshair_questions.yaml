The cross-hairs track the pointing device.\n\t      The result of the command is the empty string.\n\n\t      All arguments after the widget w are treated as options as for a\n\t      canvas line item in w. Of particular interest are -fill and\n\t      -dash.\n\n       crosshair::off w\n\t      This command removes the cross-hairs from the canvas widget w.\n\t      Nothing is done if the widget had no cross-hairs. The result of\n\t      the command is the empty string.\n\n       crosshair::configure w ?arg...?\n\t      This command changes the appearance of the cross-hairs in the\n\t      canvas widget w. It is an error to call it for a canvas which\n\t      has no cross-hairs.\n\n\t      All arguments after the widget w are treated as options as for a\n\t      canvas line item in w. Of particular interest are -fill and\n\t      -dash.\n\n\t      The result of the command are the current configuration\n\t      settings.\n\n       crosshair::track on w cmdprefix\n\t      This command activates reporting of the location of the cross-\n\t      hairs in the canvas widget w. It is an error to use this command\n\t      for a canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the command\n\t      is the empty string.\n\n\t      After the invokation of this command the specified command\n\t      prefix cmdprefix will be called whenever the mouse moves within\n\t      the canvas, with 7 arguments. These are, in order:\n\n\t      [1]    The widget w\n\n\t      [2]    The x-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.\n\n\t      [3]    The y-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.\n\n\t      [4]    The x-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in\n\t\t     pixels.\n\n\t      [5]    The y-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in\n\t\t     pixels.\n\n\t      [6]    The x-location of the bottom-right corner of the\n\t\t     viewport, in pixels.\n\n\t      [7]    The y-location of the bottom-right corner of the\n\t\t     viewport, in pixels.\n       A previously existing callback for w will be disabled. I.e. per canvas\n       widget with cross-hairs only one callback reporting their location is\n       possible.\n\n       crosshair::track off w\n\t      This command disables the reporting of the location of the\n\t      cross-hairs in the canvas widget w. It is an error to use this\n\t      command for a canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the\n\t      command is the empty string.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
