Third parties can develop and distribute\n       their own plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front-end.  The\n       default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file\n       /private/etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins section for more\n       information."

    Manpage text:

    The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to
           run sudo.  The policy may require that users authenticate themselves
           with a password or another authentication mechanism.  If authentication
           is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered
           within a configurable time limit.  This limit is policy-specific; the
           default password prompt timeout for the sudoers security policy is 0
           minutes.

           Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to
           run sudo again for a period of time without requiring authentication.
           By default, the sudoers policy caches credentials on a per-terminal
           basis for 5 minutes.  See the timestamp_type and timestamp_timeout
           options in sudoers(5) for more information.  By running sudo with the
           -v option, a user can update the cached credentials without running a
           command.

           On systems where sudo is the primary method of gaining superuser
           privileges, it is imperative to avoid syntax errors in the security
           policy configuration files.  For the default security policy,
           sudoers(5), changes to the configuration files should be made using the
           visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are
           introduced.

    COMMAND EXECUTION
           When sudo executes a command, the security policy specifies the
           execution environment for the command.  Typically, the real and
           effective user and group and IDs are set to match those of the target
           user, as specified in the password database, and the group vector is
           initialized based on the group database (unless the -P option was
           specified).

           The following parameters may be specified by security policy:

           •  real and effective user-ID

           •  real and effective group-ID

           •  supplementary group-IDs

           •  the environment list

           •  current working directory

           •  file creation mode mask (umask)

           •  scheduling priority (aka nice value)

       Process model
           There are two distinct ways sudo can run a command.

           If an I/O logging plugin is configured to log terminal I/O, or if the
           security policy explicitly requests it, a new pseudo-terminal (“pty”)
           is allocated and fork(2) is used to create a second sudo process,
           referred to as the monitor.  The monitor creates a new terminal session
           with itself as the leader and the pty as its controlling terminal,
           calls fork(2) again, sets up the execution environment as described
           above, and then uses the execve(2) system call to run the command in
           the child process.  The monitor exists to relay job control signals
           between the user's terminal and the pty the command is being run in.
           This makes it possible to suspend and resume the command normally.
           Without the monitor, the command would be in what POSIX terms an
           “orphaned process group” and it would not receive any job control
           signals from the kernel.  When the command exits or is terminated by a
           signal, the monitor passes the command's exit status to the main sudo
           process and exits.  After receiving the command's exit status, the main
           sudo process passes the command's exit status to the security policy's
           close function, as well as the close function of any configured audit
           plugin, and exits.

    Manpage text:

    If no pty is used, sudo calls fork(2), sets up the execution
           environment as described above, and uses the execve(2) system call to
           run the command in the child process.  The main sudo process waits
           until the command has completed, then passes the command's exit status
           to the security policy's close function, as well as the close function
           of any configured audit plugins, and exits.  As a special case, if the
           policy plugin does not define a close function, sudo will execute the
           command directly instead of calling fork(2) first.  The sudoers policy
           plugin will only define a close function when I/O logging is enabled, a
           pty is required, an SELinux role is specified, the command has an
           associated timeout, or the pam_session or pam_setcred options are
           enabled.  Both pam_session and pam_setcred are enabled by default on
           systems using PAM.

           On systems that use PAM, the security policy's close function is
           responsible for closing the PAM session.  It may also log the command's
           exit status.

Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, cannot be caught and\n       thus will not be relayed to the command.  As a general rule, SIGTSTP\n       should be used instead of SIGSTOP when you wish to suspend a command\n       being run by sudo.\n\n       As a special case, sudo will not relay signals that were sent by the\n       command it is running.

    Plugins
           Plugins may be specified via Plugin directives in the sudo.conf(5)
           file.  They may be loaded as dynamic shared objects (on systems that
           support them), or compiled directly into the sudo binary.  If no
           sudo.conf(5) file is present, or if it doesn't contain any Plugin
           lines, sudo will use sudoers(5) for the policy, auditing, and I/O
           logging plugins.  See the sudo.conf(5) manual for details of the
           /private/etc/sudo.conf file and the sudo_plugin(5) manual for more
           information about the sudo plugin architecture.

    EXIT VALUE
           Upon successful execution of a command, the exit status from sudo will
           be the exit status of the program that was executed.  If the command
           terminated due to receipt of a signal, sudo will send itself the same
           signal that terminated the command.

           If the -l option was specified without a command, sudo will exit with a
           value of 0 if the user is allowed to run sudo and they authenticated
           successfully (as required by the security policy).  If a command is
           specified with the -l option, the exit value will only be 0 if the

    Users should never be granted sudo privileges to execute files that are
           writable by the user or that reside in a directory that is writable by
           the user.  If the user can modify or replace the command there is no
           way to limit what additional commands they can run.

           By default, sudo will only log the command it explicitly runs.  If a
           user runs a command such as ‘sudo su’ or ‘sudo sh’, subsequent commands
           run from that shell are not subject to sudo's security policy.  The
           same is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including most
           editors).  If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands will have
           their input and/or output logged, but there will not be traditional
           logs for those commands.  Because of this, care must be taken when
           giving users access to commands via sudo to verify that the command

Also, many\n       programs (such as editors) allow the user to run commands via shell\n       escapes, thus avoiding sudo's checks.  However, on most systems it is\n       possible to prevent shell escapes with the sudoers(5) plugin's noexec\n       functionality."
