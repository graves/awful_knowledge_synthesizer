- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `sync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSYNC(8) \t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t       SYNC(8)\n\nNAME\n     sync â€“ force completion of pending disk writes (flush cache)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     sync\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The sync utility can be called to ensure that all disk writes have been\n     completed before the processor is halted in a way not suitably done by\n     reboot(8) or halt(8).  Generally, it is preferable to use reboot(8) or\n     halt(8) to shut down the system, as they may perform additional actions\n     such as resynchronizing the hardware clock and flushing internal caches\n     before performing a final sync.\n\n     The sync utility utilizes the sync(2) function call.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     fsync(2), sync(2), halt(8), reboot(8)\n\nHISTORY\n     A sync utility appeared in Version 4 AT&T UNIX.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\t May 31, 1993\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
