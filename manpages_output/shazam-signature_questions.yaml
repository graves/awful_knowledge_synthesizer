The input can either be audio, video or a shazam\n     signature. If the input is an audio file, the audio is converted into a\n     shazam signature and saved to a specified output location. If the input\n     is a video file, the video file has its audio extracted and converted to\n     a shazam signature file. The combination of the start, duration and\n     stride options can be used to remove unwanted audio at the beginning and\n     slice the generated signature into smaller signatures. The stride defines\n     the separation, in seconds, between consecutive slices. If the stride is\n     smaller than the duration the slices will overlap. A starting offset can\n     be applied to skip unwanted audio at the begining of the signature. The\n     output must be a directory. If none is specified the current one will be\n     used.\n\n\nOPTIONS\n     -i,--input input\n\t     Path to an audio or video file to generate a shazam signature\n\t     from.\n\n\n     -o,--start start\n\t     Apply a starting offset, in seconds, to skip unwanted audio at\n\t     the beginning of the signature.\n\n\n     -o,--duration duration\n\t     Duration, in seconds, for each of the sliced signatures.\n\n\n     -o,--stride stride\n\t     Separation, in seconds, between consecutive slices.\n\n\n     -o,--output output\n\t     Path to save the new shazam signature file. If output is a\n\t     directory, the shazam signature is created in that directory with\n\t     the same name as the input file. If output is not specified, the\n\t     shazam signature is saved in the current working directory with\n\t     the same name as the input file.\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n     shazam-custom-catalog-create(1), shazam-custom-catalog-update(1),\n     shazam-custom-catalog-export(1), shazam-custom-catalog-display(1),\n     shazam-custom-catalog-remove(1)\n\n\nNOTES\n     1.
