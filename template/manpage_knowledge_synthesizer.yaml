      You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `4ccconv`.

      Please synthesize 3 questions that exercise the resource where the answer contains correct usage of the most common parameters and flags if the resource is a command, or a description of the resource's most common purpose if the resource is not a command. The first question should ask a general question about what purposes the resource serves. The next two questions should be realistic, specific questions about how the resource is used and should be answered by a code example or a command example.
