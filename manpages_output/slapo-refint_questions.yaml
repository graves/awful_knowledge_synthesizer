Entries matching that search would have their\n       manager attribute removed.  Or, renaming the same record into\n       \"uid=george,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com\" would trigger a search for all\n       other records which have a manager attribute containing that DN.\n       Entries matching that search would have their manager attribute deleted\n       and replaced by the new DN."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the slapo-refint resource?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you configure the slapo-refint overlay in slapd.conf to ensure that entries with the 'manager' attribute maintain referential integrity when renamed?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how the slapo-refint overlay ensures referential integrity during a delete operation?
