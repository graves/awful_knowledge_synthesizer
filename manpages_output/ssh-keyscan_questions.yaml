It was designed to aid in building and verifying\n     ssh_known_hosts files, the format of which is documented in sshd(8).\n     ssh-keyscan provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and\n     perl scripts.\n\n     ssh-keyscan uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as\n     possible in parallel, so it is very efficient.  The keys from a domain of\n     1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those\n     hosts are down or do not run sshd(8).  For scanning, one does not need\n     login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the\n     scanning process involve any encryption.\n\n     Hosts to be scanned may be specified by hostname, address or by CIDR\n     network range (e.g. 192.168.16/28).  If a network range is specified,\n     then all addresses in that range will be scanned."

The default is to print\n\t     keys in a format usable as a ssh(1) known_hosts file.\n\n     -f file\n\t     Read hosts or “addrlist namelist” pairs from file, one per line.\n\t     If ‘-’ is supplied instead of a filename, ssh-keyscan will read\n\t     from the standard input.  Names read from a file must start with\n\t     an address, hostname or CIDR network range to be scanned.\n\t     Addresses and hostnames may optionally be followed by comma-\n\t     separated name or address aliases that will be copied to the\n\t     output.  For example:\n\n\t     192.168.11.0/24\n\t     10.20.1.1\n\t     happy.example.org\n\t     10.0.0.1,sad.example.org\n\n     -H      Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output.  Hashed names may\n\t     be used normally by ssh(1) and sshd(8), but they do not reveal\n\t     identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed."
