The kdumpd server operates on UDP\n     port 1069, although this may be configurable in the future.  The server\n     should be started by launchctl(1).\n\n     The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege,\n     usually the user \"nobody\".\n\n     By default the server stores kernel cores in the directory\n     /var/tmp/PanicDumps.  The directory needs to already exist for kdumpd to\n     save core dumps.\n\n     The server returns an EEXIST error to the remote kernel if it receives a\n     request for an existing file - i.e.  only new files can be created. The\n     server also disallows path specifications in the incoming file name.\n\nHISTORY\n     The kdumpd command is based on Berkeley tftpd(8), by way of FreeBSD, with\n     several modifications."
