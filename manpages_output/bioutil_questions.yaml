It also allows listing\n     and deleting enrolled biometric templates.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -r, --read\n\t      Read biometrics configuration.\n\n     -w, --write\n\t      Write biometrics configuration.\n\n     -s, --system\n\t      Indicates that system-wide configuration is to be read/written\n\t      (user-specific configuration is the default) or that a system-\n\t      wide list/delete operation is to be performed.\n\n     -f, --function\n\t      Enables (1) or disables (0) overall biometrics functionality\n\t      (system-wide configuration only)."
