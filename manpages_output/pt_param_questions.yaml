Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       Welcome to the PackRat Machine (short: PARAM), a virtual machine geared\n       towards the support of recursive descent parsers, especially packrat\n       parsers. Towards this end it has features like the caching and reuse of\n       partial results, the caching of the encountered input, and the ability\n       to backtrack in both input and AST creation.\n\n       This document specifies the machine in terms of its architectural state\n       and instruction set."

For\n\t      example, the *-operator (matching a sub-expression zero or more\n\t      times) in a PEG is always successful, even if it encounters a\n\t      problem further in the input and has to backtrack.

It is a\n\t      performance aid for backtracking parsers, allowing them to avoid\n\t      a possibly expensive rereading of characters from IN, or even\n\t      enabling backtracking at, i.e. in the case of IN not randomly\n\t      seekable.\n\n\t      This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the\n\t      instructions defined in the section Input Handling.\n\nINSTRUCTION SET\n       With the machine's architectural state specified it is now possible to\n       specify the instruction set operating on that state and to be\n       implemented by any realization of the PARAM. The 37 instructions are\n       grouped roughly by the state they influence and/or query during their\n       execution.\n\n   INPUT HANDLING\n       The instructions in this section mainly access IN, pulling the\n       characters to process into the machine.\n\n       input_next msg\n\t      This method reads the next character, i.e. the character after\n\t      CL, from IN. If successful this character becomes CC, CL is\n\t      advanced by one, ES is cleared, and the operation is recorded as\n\t      a success in ST.\n\n\t      The operation may read the character from IN if the next\n\t      character is not yet known to TC. If successful the new\n\t      character is stored in TC, with its location (line, column), and\n\t      the operation otherwise behaves as specified above. Future reads\n\t      from the same location, possible due to backtracking, will then\n\t      be satisfied from TC instead of IN.\n\n\t      If, on the other hand, the end of IN was reached, the operation\n\t      is recorded as failed in ST, CL is left unchanged, and the pair\n\t      of CL and msg becomes the new ES.\n\n   CHARACTER PROCESSING\n       The instructions in this section mainly access CC, testing it against\n       character classes, ranges, and individual characters.\n\n       test_alnum\n\t      This instruction implements the special PE operator \"alnum\",\n\t      which checks if CC falls into the character class of the same\n\t      name, or not.\n\n\t      Success and failure of the test are both recorded directly in\n\t      ST.

It does nothing if either ES is\n\t      empty, or if the location in ES is not just past the last\n\t      location saved in LS. Otherwise it sets the pair of that\n\t      location and the nonterminal symbol as the new ES.\n\n\t      Note: In the above \"just past\" means \"that location plus one\",\n\t      or also \"the location of the next character after that\n\t      location\".\n\n   STATUS CONTROL\n       The instructions in this section directly manipulate ST.\n\n       status_ok\n\t      This instruction sets ST to true, recording a success.\n\n       status_fail\n\t      This instruction sets ST to false, recording a failure.\n\n       status_negate\n\t      This instruction negates ST, turning a failure into a success\n\t      and vice versa.\n\n   LOCATION HANDLING\n       The instructions in this section access CL and LS.\n\n       loc_push\n\t      This instruction makes a copy of CL and pushes it on LS.\n\n       loc_pop_discard\n\t      This instructions pops the last saved location from LS.\n\n       loc_pop_rewind\n\t      This instruction pops the last saved location from LS and\n\t      restores it as CL.\n\n   NONTERMINAL EXECUTION\n       The instructions in this section access and manipulate NC.\n\n       symbol_restore symbol\n\t      This instruction checks if NC contains data for the nonterminal\n\t      symbol at CL, or not. The result of the instruction is a boolean\n\t      flag, with True indicating that data was found in the cache. In\n\t      that case the instruction has further updated the architectural\n\t      state of the machine with the cached information, namely CL, ST,\n\t      ER, and SV.\n\n\t      The method with which the instruction's result is transformed\n\t      into control flow is left undefined and the responsibility of\n\t      the implementation.\n\n       symbol_save symbol\n\t      This instructions saves the current settings of CL, ST, ER, and\n\t      SV in NC, using the pair of nonterminal symbol and the last\n\t      location saved in LS as key.\n\n   VALUE CONSTRUCTION\n       The instructions in this section manipulate SV.\n\n       value_clear\n\t      This instruction clears SV.\n\n       value_leaf symbol\n\t      This instruction constructs an AST node for symbol covering the\n\t      range of IN from one character after the last location saved on\n\t      LS to CL and stores it in SV. ...\n\n       value_reduce symbol\n\t      This instruction generally behaves like value_nonterminal_leaf,\n\t      except that it takes all AST nodes on ARS, if any, and makes\n\t      them the children of the new node, with the last node saved on\n\t      ARS becoming the right-most / last child. Note that ARS is not\n\t      modfied by this operation.\n\n   AST CONSTRUCTION\n       The instructions in this section manipulate ARS and AS.\n\n       ast_value_push\n\t      This instruction makes a copy of SV and pushes it on ARS.\n\n       ast_push\n\t      This instruction pushes the current state of ARS on AS and then\n\t      clears ARS.\n\n       ast_pop_rewind\n\t      This instruction pops the last entry saved on AS and restores it\n\t      as the new state of ARS.\n\n       ast_pop_discard\n\t      This instruction pops the last entry saved on AS.\n\n   CONTROL FLOW\n       Normally this section would contain the specifications of the control\n       flow instructions of the PARAM, i.e. (un)conditional jumps and the\n       like. However, this part of the PARAM is intentionally left\n       unspecified. This allows the implementations to freely choose how to\n       implement control flow.\n\n       The implementation of this machine in Parser Tools, i.e the package\n       pt::rde, is not only coded in Tcl, but also relies on Tcl commands to\n       provide it with control flow (instructions).\n\nINTERACTION OF THE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE ARCHITECTURAL STATE\n\n       Instruction\t   Inputs\t\t    Outputs\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       ast_pop_discard\t\tAS\t       ->   AS\n       ast_pop_rewind\t   AS\t\t  ->   AS, ARS\n       ast_push       ARS, AS\t\t  ->   AS\n       ast_value_push\t   SV, ARS\t       ->   ARS\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       error_clear\t   -\t\t  ->   ER\n       error_nonterminal sym\tER, LS\t\t    ->\t ER\n       error_pop_merge\t   ES, ER\t       ->   ER\n       error_push\t   ES, ER\t       ->   ES\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       input_next msg\t   IN\t\t  ->   TC, CL, CC, ST, ER\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       loc_pop_discard\t\tLS\t       ->   LS\n       loc_pop_rewind\t   LS\t\t  ->   LS, CL\n       loc_push       CL, LS\t\t  ->   LS\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       status_fail\t   -\t\t  ->   ST\n       status_negate\t   ST\t\t  ->   ST\n       status_ok      - \t     ->   ST\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       symbol_restore sym  NC\t\t  ->   CL, ST, ER, SV\n       symbol_save    sym  CL, ST, ER, SV LS   ->   NC\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       test_alnum\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_alpha\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_ascii\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_char char\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_ddigit\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_digit\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_graph\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_lower\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_print\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_punct\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_range chars chare\tCC\t       ->   ST, ER\n       test_space\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_upper\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_wordchar\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       test_xdigit\t   CC\t\t  ->   ST, ER\n       ======================= =======================\t      ====================\n       value_clear\t   -\t\t  ->   SV\n       value_leaf symbol   LS, CL\t       ->   SV\n       value_reduce symbol ARS, LS, CL\t       ->   SV\n       ======================= =======================\t      ===================="
