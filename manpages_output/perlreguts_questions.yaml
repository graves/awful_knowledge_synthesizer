    NAME
           perlreguts - Description of the Perl regular expression engine.

    DESCRIPTION
           This document is an attempt to shine some light on the guts of the
           regex engine and how it works. The regex engine represents a
           significant chunk of the perl codebase, but is relatively poorly
           understood. This document is a meagre attempt at addressing this
           situation. It is derived from the author's experience, comments in the
           source code, other papers on the regex engine, feedback on the
           perl5-porters mail list, and no doubt other places as well.

           NOTICE! It should be clearly understood that the behavior and
           structures discussed in this represents the state of the engine as the
           author understood it at the time of writing. It is NOT an API
           definition, it is purely an internals guide for those who want to hack
           the regex engine, or understand how the regex engine works. Readers of
           this document are expected to understand perl's regex syntax and its
           usage in detail. If you want to learn about the basics of Perl's
           regular expressions, see perlre. And if you want to replace the regex
           engine with your own, see perlreapi.

    OVERVIEW
       A quick note on terms
           There is some debate as to whether to say "regexp" or "regex". In this
           document we will use the term "regex" unless there is a special reason
           not to, in which case we will explain why.

           When speaking about regexes we need to distinguish between their source
           code form and their internal form. In this document we will use the
           term "pattern" when we speak of their textual, source code form, and
           the term "program" when we speak of their internal representation.
           These correspond to the terms S-regex and B-regex that Mark Jason
           Dominus employs in his paper on "Rx" ([1] in "REFERENCES").

       What is a regular expression engine?
           A regular expression engine is a program that takes a set of
           constraints specified in a mini-language, and then applies those
           constraints to a target string, and determines whether or not the
           string satisfies the constraints. See perlre for a full definition of
           the language.

    In less grandiose terms, the first part of the job is to turn a pattern
           into something the computer can efficiently use to find the matching
           point in the string, and the second part is performing the search
           itself.

           To do this we need to produce a program by parsing the text. We then
           need to execute the program to find the point in the string that
           matches. And we need to do the whole thing efficiently.

       Structure of a Regexp Program
           High Level

           Although it is a bit confusing and some people object to the
           terminology, it is worth taking a look at a comment that has been in
           regexp.h for years:

           This is essentially a linear encoding of a nondeterministic finite-
           state machine (aka syntax charts or "railroad normal form" in parsing
           technology).

           The term "railroad normal form" is a bit esoteric, with "syntax
           diagram/charts", or "railroad diagram/charts" being more common terms.
           Nevertheless it provides a useful mental image of a regex program: each
           node can be thought of as a unit of track, with a single entry and in
           most cases a single exit point (there are pieces of track that fork,
           but statistically not many), and the whole forms a layout with a single
           entry and single exit point. The matching process can be thought of as
           a car that moves along the track, with the particular route through the
           system being determined by the character read at each possible
           connector point. A car can fall off the track at any point but it may
           only proceed as long as it matches the track.

Each node in the graph corresponds to part of the original\n       regex pattern, such as a literal string or a branch, and has a pointer\n       to the nodes representing the next component to be matched. Since\n       \"node\" and \"opcode\" already have other meanings in the perl source, we\n       will call the nodes in a regex program \"regops\".\n\n       The program is represented by an array of \"regnode\" structures, one or\n       more of which represent a single regop of the program. Struct \"regnode\"\n       is the smallest struct needed, and has a field structure which is\n       shared with all the other larger structures.  (Outside this document,\n       the term \"regnode\" is sometimes used to mean \"regop\", which could be\n       confusing.)"

    Manpage text:

    The "next" pointers of all regops except "BRANCH" implement
           concatenation; a "next" pointer with a "BRANCH" on both ends of it is
           connecting two alternatives.  [Here we have one of the subtle syntax
           dependencies: an individual "BRANCH" (as opposed to a collection of
           them) is never concatenated with anything because of operator
           precedence.]

           The operand of some types of regop is a literal string; for others, it
           is a regop leading into a sub-program.  In particular, the operand of a
           "BRANCH" node is the first regop of the branch.

           NOTE: As the railroad metaphor suggests, this is not a tree structure:
           the tail of the branch connects to the thing following the set of
           "BRANCH"es.  It is a like a single line of railway track that splits as
           it goes into a station or railway yard and rejoins as it comes out the
           other side.

           Regops

    regnodes.h defines an array called "regarglen[]" which gives the size
           of each opcode in units of "size regnode" (4-byte). A macro is used to
           calculate the size of an "EXACT" node based on its "str_len" field.

           The regops are defined in regnodes.h which is generated from
           regcomp.sym by regcomp.pl. Currently the maximum possible number of
           distinct regops is restricted to 256, with about a quarter already
           used.

           A set of macros makes accessing the fields easier and more consistent.
           These include "OP()", which is used to determine the type of a
           "regnode"-like structure; "NEXT_OFF()", which is the offset to the next
           node (more on this later); "ARG()", "ARG1()", "ARG2()", "ARG_SET()",
           and equivalents for reading and setting the arguments; and "STR_LEN()",
           "STRING()" and "OPERAND()" for manipulating strings and regop bearing
           types.

           What regop is next?

           There are three distinct concepts of "next" in the regex engine, and it
           is important to keep them clear.

    Manpage text:

    Initialisation in "pregcomp()" mostly involves the creation and data-
           filling of a special structure, "RExC_state_t" (defined in regcomp.c).
           Almost all internally-used routines in regcomp.h take a pointer to one
           of these structures as their first argument, with the name
           "pRExC_state".  This structure is used to store the compilation state
           and contains many fields. Likewise there are many macros which operate
           on this variable: anything that looks like "RExC_xxxx" is a macro that
           operates on this pointer/structure.

           "reg()" is the start of the parse process. It is responsible for
           parsing an arbitrary chunk of pattern up to either the end of the
           string, or the first closing parenthesis it encounters in the pattern.
           This means it can be used to parse the top-level regex, or any section
           inside of a grouping parenthesis. It also handles the "special parens"
           that perl's regexes have. For instance when parsing "/x(?:foo)y/",
           "reg()" will at one point be called to parse from the "?" symbol up to
           and including the ")".

    Additionally, "reg()" is responsible for parsing the one or more
           branches from the pattern, and for "finishing them off" by correctly
           setting their next pointers. In order to do the parsing, it repeatedly
           calls out to "regbranch()", which is responsible for handling up to the
           first "|" symbol it sees.

           "regbranch()" in turn calls "regpiece()" which handles "things"
           followed by a quantifier. In order to parse the "things", "regatom()"
           is called. This is the lowest level routine, which parses out constant
           strings, character classes, and the various special symbols like "$".
           If "regatom()" encounters a "(" character it in turn calls "reg()".

           There used to be two main passes involved in parsing, the first to
           calculate the size of the compiled program, and the second to actually
           compile it.  But now there is only one main pass, with an initial crude
           guess based on the length of the input pattern, which is increased if
           necessary as parsing proceeds, and afterwards, trimmed to the actual
           amount used.

    Another complication is that the representation used for the program
           differs if it needs to store Unicode, but it's not always possible to
           know for sure whether it does until midway through parsing. The Unicode
           representation for the program is larger, and cannot be matched as
           efficiently. (See "Unicode and Localisation Support" below for more
           details as to why.)  If the pattern contains literal Unicode, it's
           obvious that the program needs to store Unicode. Otherwise, the parser
           optimistically assumes that the more efficient representation can be
           used, and starts sizing on this basis.  However, if it then encounters
           something in the pattern which must be stored as Unicode, such as an
           "\x{...}" escape sequence representing a character literal, then this
           means that all previously calculated sizes need to be redone, using
           values appropriate for the Unicode representation.  This is another
           instance where the parsing needs to be restarted, and it can and is
           done immediately.  The function returns failure, and sets the flag
           "RESTART_UTF8" (encapsulated by using the macro "REQUIRE_UTF8").  This
           restart request is propagated up the call chain in a similar fashion,
           until it is "caught" in "Perl_re_op_compile()", which marks the pattern
           as containing Unicode, and restarts the sizing pass. It is also
           possible for constructions within run-time code blocks to turn out to
           need Unicode representation., which is signalled by
           "S_compile_runtime_code()" returning false to "Perl_re_op_compile()".

    There are various aspects of the pattern that can be used to facilitate
           optimisations along these lines:

           •    anchored fixed strings

           •    floating fixed strings

           •    minimum and maximum length requirements

           •    start class

           •    Beginning/End of line positions

           Another form of optimisation that can occur is the post-parse "peep-
           hole" optimisation, where inefficient constructs are replaced by more
           efficient constructs. The "TAIL" regops which are used during parsing
           to mark the end of branches and the end of groups are examples of this.
           These regops are used as place-holders during construction and "always
           match" so they can be "optimised away" by making the things that point
           to the "TAIL" point to the thing that "TAIL" points to, thus "skipping"
           the node.

           Another optimisation that can occur is that of ""EXACT" merging" which
           is where two consecutive "EXACT" nodes are merged into a single regop.
           An even more aggressive form of this is that a branch sequence of the
           form "EXACT BRANCH ... EXACT" can be converted into a "TRIE-EXACT"

    All of this occurs in the routine "study_chunk()" which uses a special
           structure "scan_data_t" to store the analysis that it has performed,
           and does the "peep-hole" optimisations as it goes.

           The code involved in "study_chunk()" is extremely cryptic. Be careful.
           :-)

       Execution
           Execution of a regex generally involves two phases, the first being
           finding the start point in the string where we should match from, and
           the second being running the regop interpreter.

           If we can tell that there is no valid start point then we don't bother
           running the interpreter at all. Likewise, if we know from the analysis
           phase that we cannot detect a short-cut to the start position, we go
           straight to the interpreter.

           The two entry points are "re_intuit_start()" and "pregexec()". These
           routines have a somewhat incestuous relationship with overlap between
           their functions, and "pregexec()" may even call "re_intuit_start()" on
           its own. Nevertheless other parts of the perl source code may call into

    Execution of the interpreter itself used to be recursive, but thanks to
           the efforts of Dave Mitchell in the 5.9.x development track, that has
           changed: now an internal stack is maintained on the heap and the
           routine is fully iterative. This can make it tricky as the code is
           quite conservative about what state it stores, with the result that two
           consecutive lines in the code can actually be running in totally
           different contexts due to the simulated recursion.

           Start position and no-match optimisations

           "re_intuit_start()" is responsible for handling start points and no-
           match optimisations as determined by the results of the analysis done
           by "study_chunk()" (and described in "Peep-hole Optimisation and
           Analysis").

           The basic structure of this routine is to try to find the start- and/or
           end-points of where the pattern could match, and to ensure that the
           string is long enough to match the pattern. It tries to use more
           efficient methods over less efficient methods and may involve
           considerable cross-checking of constraints to find the place in the
           string that matches.  For instance it may try to determine that a given

    "regmatch" is the main "recursive loop" of the interpreter. It is
           basically a giant switch statement that implements a state machine,
           where the possible states are the regops themselves, plus a number of

    MISCELLANEOUS
       Unicode and Localisation Support
           When dealing with strings containing characters that cannot be
           represented using an eight-bit character set, perl uses an internal
           representation that is a permissive version of Unicode's UTF-8
           encoding[2]. This uses single bytes to represent characters from the
           ASCII character set, and sequences of two or more bytes for all other
           characters. (See perlunitut for more information about the relationship
           between UTF-8 and perl's encoding, utf8. The difference isn't important
           for this discussion.)

           No matter how you look at it, Unicode support is going to be a pain in
           a regex engine. Tricks that might be fine when you have 256 possible
           characters often won't scale to handle the size of the UTF-8 character
           set.  Things you can take for granted with ASCII may not be true with
           Unicode. For instance, in ASCII, it is safe to assume that
           "sizeof(char1) == sizeof(char2)", but in UTF-8 it isn't. Unicode case
           folding is vastly more complex than the simple rules of ASCII, and even
           when not using Unicode but only localised single byte encodings, things
           can get tricky (for example, LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF, ss)
           should match 'SS' in localised case-insensitive matching).

    Manpage text:

    Making things worse is that UTF-8 support was a later addition to the
           regex engine (as it was to perl) and this necessarily  made things a
           lot more complicated. Obviously it is easier to design a regex engine
           with Unicode support in mind from the beginning than it is to retrofit
           it to one that wasn't.

           Nearly all regops that involve looking at the input string have two
           cases, one for UTF-8, and one not. In fact, it's often more complex
           than that, as the pattern may be UTF-8 as well.

           Care must be taken when making changes to make sure that you handle
           UTF-8 properly, both at compile time and at execution time, including
           when the string and pattern are mismatched.

       Base Structures
           The "regexp" structure described in perlreapi is common to all regex
           engines. Two of its fields are intended for the private use of the
           regex engine that compiled the pattern. These are the "intflags" and
           pprivate members. The "pprivate" is a void pointer to an arbitrary
           structure whose use and management is the responsibility of the
           compiling engine. perl will never modify either of these values. In the
           case of the stock engine the structure pointed to by "pprivate" is
           called "regexp_internal".

    Manpage text:

    Its "pprivate" and "intflags" fields contain data specific to each
           engine.

           There are two structures used to store a compiled regular expression.
           One, the "regexp" structure described in perlreapi is populated by the
           engine currently being. used and some of its fields read by perl to
           implement things such as the stringification of "qr//".

           The other structure is pointed to by the "regexp" struct's "pprivate"
           and is in addition to "intflags" in the same struct considered to be
           the property of the regex engine which compiled the regular expression;

           The regexp structure contains all the data that perl needs to be aware
           of to properly work with the regular expression. It includes data about
           optimisations that perl can use to determine if the regex engine should
           really be used, and various other control info that is needed to
           properly execute patterns in various contexts such as is the pattern
           anchored in some way, or what flags were used during the compile, or
           whether the program contains special constructs that perl needs to be
           aware of.
