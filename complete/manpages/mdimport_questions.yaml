Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mdimport`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nmdimport(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t   mdimport(1)\n\nNAME\n     mdimport â€“ import file hierarchies into the metadata datastore.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     mdimport [-itpAXLr] [-d level] [-o -outputfile] [ file | directory ... ]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     mdimport is used to test Spotlight plug-ins, list the installed plug-ins\n     and schema, and re-index files handled by a plug-in when a new plug-in is\n     installed.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -i \t Request Spotlight to import file or recursively import\n\t\t directory.  The files will be imported using the normal\n\t\t mechanisms and attributes will be stored in the Spotlight\n\t\t index. This is the implied switch if none are specified.\n\n     -t \t Request Spotlight to test import file, sending the result\n\t\t back to mdimport for possible further processing. The\n\t\t attributes will not be stored in the Spotlight index. This is\n\t\t useful to test Spotlight import plug-ins.\n\n     -d level\t Print debugging information.  This requires -t.\n\n\n     -d1\n\t\t print summary of test import\n\n     -d2\n\t\t print summary of import and all attributes, except kMDItemTextContent\n\n     -d3\n\t\t print summary of import and all attributes\n\n     -o outfile\n\t\t Store attribute into\n\t\t outfile.\n\t\t This requires\n\t\t -t.\n\n     -p\n\t\t Print out performance information gathered during the run.  This requires\n\t\t -t.\n\n     -A\n\t\t Print out the list of all of the attributes and their\n\t\t localizations in the current language and exit.\n\n     -X\n\t\t Print the schema file and exit.\n\n     -L\n\t\t Print the list of installed importers and exit.\n\n     -r\n\t\t Ask the server to reimport files for UTIs claimed by the listed plugin.\n\t\t For example, the following would cause all of the chat files on the system to be reimported:\n\n\t\t       mdimport -r /System/Library/Spotlight/Chat.mdimporter\n\nNOTES\n     -f is obsolete in Leopard and beyond.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     mdfind(1), mdutil(1), mdls(1)\n\nMac OS X\t\t       January 16, 2019 \t\t      Mac OS X"
