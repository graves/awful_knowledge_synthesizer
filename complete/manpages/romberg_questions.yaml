Can be at most m-1.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The romberg procedure performs Romberg integration using the modified\n       midpoint rule. Romberg integration is an iterative process.  At the\n       first step, the function is evaluated at the midpoint of the region of\n       integration, and the value is multiplied by the width of the interval\n       for the coarsest possible estimate.  At the second step, the interval\n       is divided into three parts, and the function is evaluated at the\n       midpoint of each part; the sum of the values is multiplied by three.\n       At the third step, nine parts are used, at the fourth twenty-seven, and\n       so on, tripling the number of subdivisions at each step.\n\n       Once the interval has been divided at least d times, a polynomial is\n       fitted to the integrals estimated in the last d+1 divisions.  The\n       integrals are considered to be a function of the square of the width of\n       the subintervals (any good numerical analysis text will discuss this\n       process under \"Romberg integration\").  The polynomial is extrapolated\n       to a step size of zero, computing a value for the integral and an\n       estimate of the error.\n\n       This process will be well-behaved only if the function is analytic over\n       the region of integration; there may be removable singularities at\n       either end of the region provided that the limit of the function (and\n       of all its derivatives) exists as the ends are approached.  Thus,\n       romberg may be used to integrate a function like f(x)=sin(x)/x over an\n       interval beginning or ending at zero.\n\n       Note that romberg will either fail to converge or else return incorrect\n       error estimates if the function, or any of its derivatives, has a\n       singularity anywhere in the region of integration (except for the case\n       mentioned above).  Care must be used, therefore, in integrating a\n       function like 1/(1-x**2) to avoid the places where the derivative is\n       singular.\n\nIMPROPER INTEGRALS\n       Romberg integration is also useful for integrating functions over half-\n       infinite intervals or functions that have singularities.  The trick is\n       to make a change of variable to eliminate the singularity, and to put\n       the singularity at one end or the other of the region of integration.\n       The math::calculus package supplies a number of romberg procedures to\n       deal with the commoner cases.\n\n       romberg_infinity\n\t      Integrates a function over a half-infinite interval; either a or\n\t      b may be infinite.  a and b must be of the same sign; if you\n\t      need to integrate across the axis, say, from a negative value to\n\t      positive infinity, use romberg to integrate from the negative\n\t      value to a small positive value, and then romberg_infinity to\n\t      integrate from the positive value to positive infinity.  The\n\t      romberg_infinity procedure works by making the change of\n\t      variable u=1/x, so that the integral from a to b of f(x) is\n\t      evaluated as the integral from 1/a to 1/b of f(1/u)/u**2.\n\n       romberg_powerLawLower and romberg_powerLawUpper\n\t      Integrate a function that has an integrable power law\n\t      singularity at either the lower or upper bound of the region of\n\t      integration (or has a derivative with a power law singularity\n\t      there).  These procedures take a first parameter, gamma, which\n\t      gives the power law.  The function or its first derivative are\n\t      presumed to diverge as (x-a)**(-gamma) or (b-x)**(-gamma).\n\t      gamma must be greater than zero and less than 1.\n\n\t      These procedures are useful not only in integrating functions\n\t      that go to infinity at one end of the region of integration, but\n\t      also functions whose derivatives do not exist at the end of the\n\t      region.  For instance, integrating f(x)=pow(x,0.25) with the\n\t      origin as one end of the region will result in the romberg\n\t      procedure greatly underestimating the error in the integral.\n\t      The problem can be fixed by observing that the first derivative\n\t      of f(x), f'(x)=x**(-3/4)/4, goes to infinity at the origin.\n\t      Integrating using romberg_powerLawLower with gamma set to 0.75\n\t      gives much more orderly convergence.\n\n\t      These procedures operate by making the change of variable u=(x-\n\t      a)**(1-gamma) (romberg_powerLawLower) or u=(b-x)**(1-gamma)\n\t      (romberg_powerLawUpper).\n\n\t      To summarize the meaning of gamma:\n\n\t      •      If f(x) ~ x**(-a) (0 < a < 1), use gamma = a\n\n\t      •      If f'(x) ~ x**(-b) (0 < b < 1), use gamma = b\n\n       romberg_sqrtSingLower and romberg_sqrtSingUpper\n\t      These procedures behave identically to romberg_powerLawLower and\n\t      romberg_powerLawUpper for the common case of gamma=0.5; that is,\n\t      they integrate a function with an inverse square root\n\t      singularity at one end of the interval.  They have a simpler\n\t      implementation involving square roots rather than arbitrary\n\t      powers.\n\n       romberg_expLower and romberg_expUpper\n\t      These procedures are for integrating a function that grows or\n\t      decreases exponentially over a half-infinite interval.\n\t      romberg_expLower handles exponentially growing functions, and\n\t      allows the lower limit of integration to be an arbitrarily large\n\t      negative number.\tromberg_expUpper handles exponentially\n\t      decaying functions and allows the upper limit of integration to\n\t      be an arbitrary large positive number.  The functions make the\n\t      change of variable u=exp(-x) and u=exp(x) respectively.\n\nOTHER CHANGES OF VARIABLE\n       If you need an improper integral other than the ones listed here, a\n       change of variable can be written in very few lines of Tcl.  Because\n       the Tcl coding that does it is somewhat arcane, we offer a worked\n       example here.\n\n       Let's say that the function that we want to integrate is\n       f(x)=exp(x)/sqrt(1-x*x) (not a very natural function, but a good\n       example), and we want to integrate it over the interval (-1,1).\tThe\n       denominator falls to zero at both ends of the interval. We wish to make\n       a change of variable from x to u so that dx/sqrt(1-x**2) maps to du.\n       Choosing x=sin(u), we can find that dx=cos(u)*du, and\n       sqrt(1-x**2)=cos(u).  The integral from a to b of f(x) is the integral\n       from asin(a) to asin(b) of f(sin(u))*cos(u).\n\n       We can make a function g that accepts an arbitrary function f and the\n       parameter u, and computes this new integrand.\n\n       proc g { f u } {\n\t   set x [expr { sin($u) }]\n\t   set cmd $f; lappend cmd $x; set y [eval $cmd]\n\t   return [expr { $y / cos($u) }]\n       }\n\n       Now integrating f from a to b is the same as integrating g from asin(a)\n       to asin(b).  It's a little tricky to get f consistently evaluated in\n       the caller's scope; the following procedure does it.\n\n       proc romberg_sine { f a b args } {\n\t   set f [lreplace $f 0 0 [uplevel 1 [list namespace which [lindex $f 0]]]]\n\t   set f [list g $f]\n\t   return [eval [linsert $args 0 romberg $f [expr { asin($a) }] [expr { asin($b) }]]]\n       }\n\n       This romberg_sine procedure will do any function with sqrt(1-x*x) in\n       the denominator. Our sample function is f(x)=exp(x)/sqrt(1-x*x):\n\n       proc f { x } {\n\t   expr { exp($x) / sqrt( 1. - $x*$x ) }\n       }\n\n       Integrating it is a matter of applying romberg_sine as we would any of\n       the other romberg procedures:\n\n       foreach { value error } [romberg_sine f -1.0 1.0] break\n       puts [format \"integral is %.6g +/- %.6g\" $value $error]\n\n       integral is 3.97746 +/- 2.3557e-010"
