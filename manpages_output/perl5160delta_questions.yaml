           "substr" lvalue revamp

           When "substr" is called in lvalue or potential lvalue context with two
           or three arguments, a special lvalue scalar is returned that modifies
           the original string (the first argument) when assigned to.

           Previously, the offsets (the second and third arguments) passed to
           "substr" would be converted immediately to match the string, negative
           offsets being translated to positive and offsets beyond the end of the
           string being truncated.

           Now, the offsets are recorded without modification in the special
           lvalue scalar that is returned, and the original string is not even
           looked at by "substr" itself, but only when the returned lvalue is read
           or modified.

           These changes result in an incompatible change:

           If the original string changes length after the call to "substr" but
           before assignment to its return value, negative offsets will remember
           their position from the end of the string, affecting code like this:

    DTrace probes for interpreter phase change

           The "phase-change" probes will fire when the interpreter's phase
           changes, which tracks the "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" variable.  "arg0" is the
           new phase name; "arg1" is the old one.  This is useful for limiting
           your instrumentation to one or more of: compile time, run time, or
           destruct time.

           "__FILE__()" Syntax

           The "__FILE__", "__LINE__" and "__PACKAGE__" tokens can now be written
           with an empty pair of parentheses after them.  This makes them parse
           the same way as "time", "fork" and other built-in functions.

           The "\$" prototype accepts any scalar lvalue

           The "\$" and "\[$]" subroutine prototypes now accept any scalar lvalue
           argument.  Previously they accepted only scalars beginning with "$" and
           hash and array elements.  This change makes them consistent with the
           way the built-in "read" and "recv" functions (among others) parse their
           arguments.  This means that one can override the built-in functions
           with custom subroutines that parse their arguments the same way.

    Security
       Use "is_utf8_char_buf()" and not "is_utf8_char()"
           The latter function is now deprecated because its API is insufficient
           to guarantee that it doesn't read (up to 12 bytes in the worst case)
           beyond the end of its input string.  See is_utf8_char_buf().

       Malformed UTF-8 input could cause attempts to read beyond the end of the
           buffer
           Two new XS-accessible functions, "utf8_to_uvchr_buf()" and
           "utf8_to_uvuni_buf()" are now available to prevent this, and the Perl
           core has been converted to use them.  See "Internal Changes".

           GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation / segfault.  A Perl

    Future Deprecations
           This section serves as a notice of features that are likely to be

           code depends on these features, you should contact the Perl 5 Porters
           via the mailing list <http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html> or

       Core Modules
           These modules may be marked as deprecated from the core.  This only
           means that they will no longer be installed by default with the core
           distribution, but will remain available on the CPAN.
