The\n       package is compatible with the Safesock security policy, so it can be\n       used by untrusted applets to do URL fetching from a restricted set of\n       hosts. This package can be extended to support additional HTTP\n       transport protocols, such as HTTPS, by providing a custom socket\n       command, via ::http::register."
