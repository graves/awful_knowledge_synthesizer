If either special\n     or mount_point are not provided, the appropriate information is obtained\n     via the getfsent(3) library routines.\n\n     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems.  If no\n     arguments are given to mount, this list is printed.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -a      All the filesystems listed via getfsent(3) are mounted.\n\t     Exceptions are those marked as ``noauto;'' excluded by the -t\n\t     flag (see below); entries that are neither ``ro,'' ``rw,'' or\n\t     ``rq;'' ``nfs'' entries that also have ``net'' as an option; and\n\t     already-mounted ``nfs'' entries.\n\n     -d      Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call.\n\t     This option is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to\n\t     determine what the mount command is trying to do.\n\n     -f      Forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a\n\t     filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.\n\n     -F      Forces the file system type be considered as an FSModule\n\t     delivered using FSKit.\n\n     -k      In the course of the mount system call, the kernel should not\n\t     follow any symlinks that may be present in the provided mount-on\n\t     directory."
