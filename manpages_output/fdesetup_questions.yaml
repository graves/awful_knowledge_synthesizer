Most commands require root access and need to be authenticated\n     with either a FileVault password, a personal recovery key (if enabled),\n     and in some cases the private key from the installed institutional\n     recovery key.  Some status related commands can be run from a non-root\n     session.\n\n     Certain commands on CoreStorage volumes allow you to authenticate and\n     unlock by providing the -key option followed by the path to a keychain\n     file containing the private key of the installed institutional recovery\n     key.  Do not include the certificate in this keychain.\n\n     By default, when enabling FileVault fdesetup will only return a personal\n     recovery key. Given the proper certificate information, fdesetup can\n     install an institutional recovery key.  You can also set it up without\n     creating a personal recovery key using the -norecoverykey option, though\n     this is not recommended unless you are also installing an institutional\n     recovery key.  On APFS volumes, if you already have a personal recovery\n     key created from a previous enablement, it will not remove or create a\n     new personal recovery key, allowing you to reuse the existing key.\n     Either type of keys can be added or changed at a later time."

    Manpage text:

    With the -keychain option, an institutional recovery key can be set up by
         placing an X.509 asymmetric public certificate in the
         /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file. security create-
         filevaultmaster-keychain can be used to create the keychain.
         Alternatively a certificate can be passed in by using the -certificate
         option and entering the path to the DER encoded certificate file. In this
         case the FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be created using the
         certificate. With your .cer file, the optional certificate data can be
         obtained using the base64 tool.  For example: 'base64 /path/to/mycert.cer
         > /mynewdata.txt', at which point you would copy the data string
         contained in the text file and place it into the Certificate
         <data></data> value area of the property list.  The certificate should be
         self signed, and the common name must be "FileVault Recovery Key"

         Because the user password may not be immediately available, read the
         DEFERRED ENABLEMENT section below for information on how to delay
         enabling FileVault until the user logs in or out.

    The status command will indicate if FileVault is On or Off.  If a
         FileVault master keychain is installed into the /Library/Keychains folder
         it will also report this back.  Note that this, by itself, does not
         indicate whether or not FileVault has been set up with an institutional
         recovery key.  The -extended option will display extended status
         information, including the time remaining for encrypting or decrypting.
         The calculation of this remaining time may take a few minutes and is only
         an approximate value.

         The list command will display the short names and UUIDs of enabled

         of existing user types along with some additional information.  This
         information will include if the recovery key was escrowed, though note
         that it will show "Yes" even if the information has not yet been

    If a user currently has the system unlocked using the recovery key, the
         usingrecoverykey command will return "true".

         The changerecovery command changes or adds either the personal or
         institutional recovery key.  You can only have one recovery key of each
         type, so any associated existing key will be removed.  The removerecovery
         command will remove any existing recovery key of the type specified.  It
         is not recommended that you remove all recovery keys since, if you lose
         your FileVault password, you may not be able to access your information.
         On APFS volumes using 10.14 or later, the existing recovery key can be
         used as authentication to change or remove the personal recovery key.

         On supported hardware, fdesetup allows restart of a FileVault-enabled
         system without requiring unlock during the subsequent boot using the
         authrestart command. WARNING: FileVault protections are reduced during
         authenticated restarts. In particular, fdesetup deliberately stores at
         least one additional copy of a permanent FDE (full disk encryption)
         unlock key in both system memory and (on supported systems) the System
         Management Controller (SMC).  fdesetup must be run as root and itself
         prompts for a password to unlock the FileVault root volume.  Use pmset
         destroyfvkeyonstandby to prevent saving the key across standby modes.
         Once authrestart is authenticated, it launches shutdown(8) and, upon
         successful unlock, the unlock key will be removed.  You can also use this
         as an option to the enable command if the system supports this feature.
         The supportsauthrestart command will check the system to see if it
         supports the authrestart command option, however you should note that
         even if this returns true, FileVault must still be enabled for
         authrestart to work.

    Manpage text:

    The -defer option sets up a single user to be added to FileVault. If
         there was no user specified (e.g. without the -user option), then the
         currently logged in user will be added to the configuration and becomes
         the designated user. If there is no user specified and no users are
         logged in at the time of configuration, then the next user that logs in
         will become the designated user.

         As recovery key information is not generated until the user password is
         obtained, the -defer option requires a path where this information will
         be written to. The property list file will be created as a root-only
         readable file and should be placed in a secure location.  You can use the
         showdeferralinfo command to view the current deferral configuration
         information.

         Options that can be used in conjunction with the -defer option include:
         -keychain, -certificate, -forcerestart, -forceatlogin, -dontaskatlogout,
         -user, and -norecoverykey.

         Note that if the designated user is being prompted at logout to enable
         FileVault, and doesn't complete the setup, FileVault will not be enabled,
         but the configuration will remain and be used again for the designated
         user's next logout (or login if the -forceatlogin option is enabled),
         thereby 'nagging' the user to enable FileVault.   When using the
         -forceatlogin option, the user is given a certain number of attempts to
         enable FileVault, in which they can cancel the operation and continue to
         use their system without FileVault.  When the number of cancel attempts
         is reached, the user will not be able to log into their account until
         FileVault is enabled.    The current value of the user's remaining
         attempts can be viewed using the showdeferralinfo command.   Special
         values for the -forceatlogin option include setting it to '0' to force
         the enablement immediately at next login, a '-1' disables the check
         entirely, and a special value of '9999' means that the user will never be
         required to enable FileVault, though it will continually prompt the user
         until FileVault is enabled.   If a personal recovery key is used, the
         user should probably be warned ahead of time that, upon successful
         enablement, they will need to write down and keep in a safe place the
         FileVault recovery key shown on the screen.
