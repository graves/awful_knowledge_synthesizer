It also provides accessor routines to pull out specific subtags,\n       not unlike DOM access.  This package was written for and is used by\n       Darren New's Amazon S3 access package.\n\n       This is pretty lame, but I needed something like this for S3, and at\n       the time, TclDOM would not work with the new 8.5 Tcl due to version\n       number problems.\n\n       In addition, this is a pure-value implementation. There is no garbage\n       to clean up in the event of a thrown error, for example.  This\n       simplifies the code for sufficiently small XML documents, which is what\n       Amazon's S3 guarantees.\n\n       Copyright 2006 Darren New.

See\n       LICENSE.txt for the terms.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       The package implements five rather simple procedures.  One parses, one\n       is for debugging, and the rest pull various parts of the parsed\n       document out for processing.\n\n       xsxp::parse xml\n\t      This parses an XML document (using the standard xml tcllib\n\t      module in a SAX sort of way) and builds a data structure which\n\t      it returns if the parsing succeeded. The return value is\n\t      referred to herein as a \"pxml\", or \"parsed xml\". The list\n\t      consists of two or more elements:\n\n\t      •      The first element is the name of the tag.\n\n\t      •      The second element is an array-get formatted list of\n\t\t     key/value pairs. The keys are attribute names and the\n\t\t     values are attribute values. This is an empty list if\n\t\t     there are no attributes on the tag.\n\n\t      •      The third through end elements are the children of the\n\t\t     node, if any. Each child is, recursively, a pxml.\n\n\t      •      Note that if the zero'th element, i.e. the tag name, is\n\t\t     \"%PCDATA\", then the attributes will be empty and the\n\t\t     third element will be the text of the element. In\n\t\t     addition, if an element's contents consists only of\n\t\t     PCDATA, it will have only one child, and all the PCDATA\n\t\t     will be concatenated. In other words, this parser works\n\t\t     poorly for XML with elements that contain both child tags\n\t\t     and PCDATA.  Since Amazon S3 does not do this (and for\n\t\t     that matter most uses of XML where XML is a poor choice\n\t\t     don't do this), this is probably not a serious\n\t\t     limitation."

Each element is the name of a child\n\t      to look up, optionally followed by a hash (\"#\") and a string of\n\t      digits. An empty list or an initial empty element selects pxml.\n\t      If no hash sign is present, the behavior is as if \"#0\" had been\n\t      appended to that element. (In addition to a list, slashes can\n\t      separate subparts where convenient.)\n\n\t      An element of path scans the children at the indicated level for\n\t      the n'th instance of a child whose tag matches the part of the\n\t      element before the hash sign. If an element is simply \"#\"\n\t      followed by digits, that indexed child is selected, regardless\n\t      of the tags in the children. Hence, an element of \"#3\" will\n\t      always select the fourth child of the node under consideration.\n\n\t      part defaults to \"%ALL\". It can be one of the following case-\n\t      sensitive terms:\n\n\t      %ALL   returns the entire selected element.\n\n\t      %TAGNAME\n\t\t     returns lindex 0 of the selected element.\n\n\t      %ATTRIBUTES\n\t\t     returns index 1 of the selected element.\n\n\t      %CHILDREN\n\t\t     returns lrange 2 through end of the selected element,\n\t\t     resulting in a list of elements being returned.\n\n\t      %PCDATA\n\t\t     returns a concatenation of all the bodies of direct\n\t\t     children of this node whose tag is %PCDATA.  It throws an\n\t\t     error if no such children are found. That is,\n\t\t     part=%PCDATA means return the textual content found in\n\t\t     that node but not its children nodes.\n\n\t      %PCDATA?\n\t\t     is like %PCDATA, but returns an empty string if no PCDATA\n\t\t     is found.\n\n       For example, to fetch the first bold text from the fifth paragraph of\n       the body of your HTML file,\n       xsxp::fetch $pxml {html body p#4 b} %PCDATA"
