If -o is given, the\n\t     office location and office phone number is printed (the default).\n\t     If -h is given, the remote host is printed instead.\n\n\t     Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, hours and\n\t     minutes if a ``:'' is present, or days if a ``d'' is present.  If\n\t     it is an “*”, the login time indicates the time of last login.\n\t     Login time is displayed as the day name if less than 6 days, else\n\t     month, day; hours and minutes, unless more than six months ago,\n\t     in which case the year is displayed rather than the hours and\n\t     minutes."
