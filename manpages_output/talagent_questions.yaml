You may also pass a path directly to the app's persistent\n\t state directory, usually in ~/Library/Saved Application State.\n\n     -launch bundle_id\n\t This launches an app (in this case, TextEdit) in a manner\n\t approximating how apps get launched at login. You can pass either a\n\t bundle ID fragment or a path to an app.  The app is maintained\n\t stopped until you hit return in the launching window (or until it\n\t receives SIGCONT). This is the easiest way to test the login scenario\n\t without needing to log in."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the talagent command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use talagent to output the persistent state of an application with bundle ID fragment 'textedit'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using talagent to launch the TextEdit application in a way that simulates the login process?
