Acceptors are objects which can\n       be given a string of symbols and tell if the DFA they are constructed\n       from would accept that string.  For the actual creation of the DFAs the\n       acceptors are based on we have the packages grammar::fa and\n       grammar::fa::op.\n\nAPI\n       The package exports the API described here.\n\n       ::grammar::fa::dacceptor daName fa ?-any any?\n\t      Creates a new deterministic acceptor with an associated global\n\t      Tcl command whose name is daName. This command may be used to\n\t      invoke various operations on the acceptor. It has the following\n\t      general form:\n\n\t      daName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command. See section ACCEPTOR METHODS for more\n\t\t     explanations.\n\n\t\t     The acceptor will be based on the deterministic finite\n\t\t     automaton stored in the object fa. It will keep a copy of\n\t\t     the relevant data of the FA in its own storage, in a form\n\t\t     easy to use for its purposes. This also means that\n\t\t     changes made to the fa after the construction of the\n\t\t     acceptor will not influence the acceptor.\n\n\t\t     If any has been specified, then the acceptor will convert\n\t\t     all symbols in the input which are unknown to the base FA\n\t\t     to that symbol before proceeding with the processing.\n\nACCEPTOR METHODS\n       All acceptors provide the following methods for their manipulation:\n\n       daName destroy\n\t      Destroys the automaton, including its storage space and\n\t      associated command.\n\n       daName accept? symbols\n\t      Takes the list of symbols and checks if the FA the acceptor is\n\t      based on would accept it. The result is a boolean value. True is\n\t      returned if the symbols are accepted, and False otherwise. Note\n\t      that bogus symbols in the input are either translated to the any\n\t      symbol (if specified), or cause the acceptance test to simply\n\t      fail. No errors will be thrown. The method will process only\n\t      just that prefix of the input which is enough to fully determine\n\t      (non-)acceptance.\n\nEXAMPLES\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
