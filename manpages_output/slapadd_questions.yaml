It opens the given database\n       determined by the database number or suffix and adds entries\n       corresponding to the provided LDIF to the database.  Databases\n       configured as subordinate of this one are also updated, unless -g is\n       specified.  The LDIF input is read from standard input or the specified\n       file.\n\n       All files eventually created by slapadd will belong to the identity\n       slapadd is run as, so make sure you either run slapadd with the same\n       identity slapd(8) will be run as (see option -u in slapd(8)), or change\n       file ownership before running slapd(8)."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the slapadd command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use slapadd to add entries from an LDIF file named 'data.ldif' to a slapd database with the suffix 'dc=example,dc=com'?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to add entries from standard input to a slapd database configured with the default database number, while enabling debug output?
