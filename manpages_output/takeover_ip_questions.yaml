Only use when recommended by Apple Support.\n\nFLAGS\n       -h     Display help\n\n       -d device_name\n\t      The device name of the network interface the VIP is on\n\n       -m mac_address\n\t      Mac address of network device the VIP is on\n\n       -i ipv4_ip\n\t      IPv4 address for VIP\n\nLIMITATIONS\n       Only the Linux platform is supported with takeover_ip since it requires\n       an HA pair.\n\nFILES\n       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_vip.txt"
