    When encountering these changes, the key to cleaning up from them is to
           accept that hashes are unordered collections and to act accordingly.

           Hash randomization

           The seed used by Perl's hash function is now random.  This means that
           the order which keys/values will be returned from functions like
           "keys()", "values()", and "each()" will differ from run to run.

           This change was introduced to make Perl's hashes more robust to
           algorithmic complexity attacks, and also because we discovered that it
           exposes hash ordering dependency bugs and makes them easier to track
           down.

           Toolchain maintainers might want to invest in additional infrastructure
           to test for things like this.  Running tests several times in a row and
           then comparing results will make it easier to spot hash order
           dependencies in code.  Authors are strongly encouraged not to expose
           the key order of Perl's hashes to insecure audiences.

           Further, every hash has its own iteration order, which should make it
           much more difficult to determine what the current hash seed is.

    Manpage text:

    When "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS" is 0, perl will not randomize the key order at
           all. The chance that "keys" changes due to an insert will be the same
           as in previous perls, basically only when the bucket size is changed.

           When "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS" is 1, perl will randomize keys in a non-
           repeatable way. The chance that "keys" changes due to an insert will be
           very high.  This is the most secure and default mode.

           When "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS" is 2, perl will randomize keys in a repeatable
           way.  Repeated runs of the same program should produce the same output
           every time.

           "PERL_HASH_SEED" implies a non-default "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS" setting.
           Setting "PERL_HASH_SEED=0" (exactly one 0) implies
           "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=0" (hash key randomization disabled); setting
           "PERL_HASH_SEED" to any other value implies "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=2"
           (deterministic and repeatable hash key randomization).  Specifying

    "state sub" creates a subroutine visible within the lexical scope in
           which it is declared.  The subroutine is shared between calls to the
           outer sub.

           "my sub" declares a lexical subroutine that is created each time the
           enclosing block is entered.  "state sub" is generally slightly faster
           than "my sub".

           "our sub" declares a lexical alias to the package subroutine of the
           same name.

           For more information, see "Lexical Subroutines" in perlsub.

       "kill" with negative signal names
           "kill" has always allowed a negative signal number, which kills the
           process group instead of a single process.  It has also allowed signal
           names.  But it did not behave consistently, because negative signal
           names were treated as 0.  Now negative signals names like "-INT" are
           supported and treated the same way as -2 [perl #112990].

    "Locale::Maketext" allowed code injection via a malicious template
           If users could provide a translation string to Locale::Maketext, this
           could be used to invoke arbitrary Perl subroutines available in the
           current process.

           This has been fixed, but it is still possible to invoke any method
           provided by "Locale::Maketext" itself or a subclass that you are using.
           One of these methods in turn will invoke the Perl core's "sprintf"
           subroutine.

           In summary, allowing users to provide translation strings without
           auditing them is a bad idea.

           This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2012-6329.

       Avoid calling memset with a negative count
           Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count

This behavior is also inconsistent with using a property\n       instead of a range:  \"\\p{Block=Latin1}\" also includes LATIN SMALL\n       LETTER SHARP S, but \"/[\\p{Block=Latin1}]/i\" does not match \"ss\".  The\n       new rule is that for there to be a multi-character case-insensitive\n       match within a bracketed character class, the character must be\n       explicitly listed, and not as an end point of a range.  This more\n       closely obeys the Principle of Least Astonishment.  See \"Bracketed\n       Character Classes\" in perlrecharclass.

    Explicit rules for variable names and identifiers
           Due to an oversight, single character variable names in v5.16 were
           completely unrestricted.  This opened the door to several kinds of
           insanity.  As of v5.18, these now follow the rules of other
           identifiers, in addition to accepting characters that match the
           "\p{POSIX_Punct}" property.

           There is no longer any difference in the parsing of identifiers
           specified by using braces versus without braces.  For instance, perl
           used to allow "${foo:bar}" (with a single colon) but not $foo:bar.  Now
           that both are handled by a single code path, they are both treated the
           same way: both are forbidden.  Note that this change is about the range
           of permissible literal identifiers, not other expressions.

       Vertical tabs are now whitespace
           No one could recall why "\s" didn't match "\cK", the vertical tab.  Now

    It is our hope that lexical $_ can be rehabilitated, but this may cause
           changes in its behavior.  Please use it with caution until it becomes
           stable.

       readline() with "$/ = \N" now reads N characters, not N bytes
           Previously, when reading from a stream with I/O layers such as
           "encoding", the readline() function, otherwise known as the "<>"
           operator, would read N bytes from the top-most layer. [perl #79960]

           Now, N characters are read instead.

           There is no change in behaviour when reading from streams with no extra
           layers, since bytes map exactly to characters.

       Overridden "glob" is now passed one argument
           "glob" overrides used to be passed a magical undocumented second
           argument that identified the caller.  Nothing on CPAN was using this,
           and it got in the way of a bug fix, so it was removed.  If you really
           need to identify the caller, see Devel::Callsite on CPAN.

       Here doc parsing
           The body of a here document inside a quote-like operator now always
           begins on the line after the "<<foo" marker.  Previously, it was
           documented to begin on the line following the containing quote-like
           operator, but that was only sometimes the case [perl #114040].

    Defined values stored in environment are forced to byte strings
           A value stored in an environment variable has always been stringified
           when inherited by child processes.

           In this release, when assigning to %ENV, values are immediately
           stringified, and converted to be only a byte string.

           First, it is forced to be only a string.  Then if the string is utf8
           and the equivalent of "utf8::downgrade()" works, that result is used;
           otherwise, the equivalent of "utf8::encode()" is used, and a warning is
           issued about wide characters ("Diagnostics").

       "require" dies for unreadable files
           When "require" encounters an unreadable file, it now dies.  It used to
           ignore the file and continue searching the directories in @INC [perl

           The various "gv_fetchmeth_*" XS functions used to treat a package whose

    Deprecations
       Module removals
           The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
           future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
           Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list
           them as prerequisites.

           The core versions of these modules will now issue "deprecated"-category
           warnings to alert you to this fact. To silence these deprecation
           warnings, install the modules in question from CPAN.

           Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are
           encouraged to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily
           hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-

    clang++

           There is now a workaround for a compiler bug that prevented compiling
           with clang++ since Perl v5.15.7 [perl #112786].

           C++

           When compiling the Perl core as C++ (which is only semi-supported), the
           mathom functions are now compiled as "extern "C"", to ensure proper
           binary compatibility.  (However, binary compatibility isn't generally
           guaranteed anyway in the situations where this would matter.)

           Darwin

           Stop hardcoding an alignment on 8 byte boundaries to fix builds using
           -Dusemorebits.

           Haiku

           Perl should now work out of the box on Haiku R1 Alpha 4.

           MidnightBSD

           "libc_r" was removed from recent versions of MidnightBSD and older
           versions work better with "pthread". Threading is now enabled using
           "pthread" which corrects build errors with threading enabled on
           0.4-CURRENT.

           Solaris

           In Configure, avoid running sed commands with flags not supported on
           Solaris.

           Perl v5.18.0 represents approximately 12 months of development since
           Perl v5.16.0 and contains approximately 400,000 lines of changes across
           2,100 files from 113 authors.

           Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
           community of users and developers. The following people are known to
           have contributed the improvements that became Perl v5.18.0:

    Manpage text:

    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
           generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
           include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
           reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

           Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
           modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
           community for helping Perl to flourish.

           For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
           please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
           recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
           database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
           information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.
