No more than 20 positions may be specified.\n\n     If no tab stops are specified, the “standard” UNIX tab width of 8 is\n     used.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -n      Set a tab stop every n columns.  If n is 0, the tab stops are\n\t     cleared but no new ones are set."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the tabs utility?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the tabs command to set tab stops every 4 columns and also adjust the margin?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using tabs to set tab stops at positions 8, 16, and 24, with the second position being relative to the first?
