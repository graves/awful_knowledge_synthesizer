The\n       monitor backend produces mostly operational attributes, and LDAP only\n       returns operational attributes that are explicitly requested.\n       Requesting attribute \"+\" is an extension which requests all operational\n       attributes.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       These slapd.conf options apply to the monitor backend database.\tThat\n       is, they must follow a \"database monitor\" line and come before any\n       subsequent \"backend\" or \"database\" lines."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `slapd-monitor`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAs opposed to most databases, the monitor database can be instantiated\n       only once, i.e. only one occurrence of \"database monitor\" can occur in\n       the slapd.conf(5) file.\tMoreover, the suffix of the database cannot be\n       explicitly set by means of the suffix directive.  The suffix is\n       automatically set to \"cn=Monitor\".\n\n       The monitor database honors the rootdn and the rootpw directives, and\n       the usual ACL directives, e.g. the access directive.\n\n       Other database options are described in the slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\nUSAGE\n       The usage is:\n\n       1) enable the monitor backend at configure:\n\n\t      configure --enable-monitor\n\n       2) activate the monitor database in the slapd.conf(5) file:\n\n\t      database monitor\n\n       3) add ACLs as detailed in slapd.access(5) to control access to the\n       database, e.g.:\n\n\t      access to dn.subtree=\"cn=Monitor\"\n\t\t   by dn.exact=\"uid=Admin,dc=my,dc=org\" write\n\t\t   by users read\n\t\t   by * none\n\n       4) ensure that the core.schema file is loaded.\n\t      The monitor backend relies on some standard track attributeTypes\n\t      that must be already defined when the backend is started."
