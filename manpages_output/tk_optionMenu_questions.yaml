The current value will be\n       stored in the global variable whose name is given by varName and it\n       will also be displayed as the label in the option menubutton.  The user\n       can click on the menubutton to display a menu containing all of the\n       values and thereby select a new value.  Once a new value is selected,\n       it will be stored in the variable and appear in the option menubutton.\n       The current value can also be changed by setting the variable."
