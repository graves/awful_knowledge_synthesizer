There are a number of output formats, depending on the\n       options for the information presented.  The first form of the command\n       displays a list of active sockets.  The second form presents the values\n       of other network-related information according to the option selected.\n       Using the third form, with an interval specified, snmpnetstat will\n       continuously display the information regarding packet traffic on the\n       configured network interfaces.  The fourth form displays statistics\n       about the named protocol."

    Manpage text:

    -Co Show an abbreviated interface status, giving octets in place of
           packets.  This is useful when enquiring virtual interfaces (such as
           Frame-Relay circuits) on a router.

           -CI interface Show information only about this interface; used with an
           interval as described below.

           -Cn Show network addresses as numbers (normally snmpnetstat interprets
           addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option may
           be used with any of the display formats.

           -Cp protocol Show statistics about protocol, which is either a well-
           known name for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and
           aliases are listed in the file /etc/protocols.  A null response
           typically means that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The
           program will complain if protocol is unknown or if there is no
           statistics routine for it.

           -Cs Show per-protocol statistics.  When used with the -Cr option, show
           routing statistics instead.
