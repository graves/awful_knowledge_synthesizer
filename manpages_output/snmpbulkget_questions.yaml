One or more\n       object identifiers (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command\n       line.  Each variable name is given in the format specified in\n       variables(5).\n\n       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an\n       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to\n       pinpoint why the request was malformed.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -Cn<NUM>\n\t       Set the non-repeaters field in the GETBULK PDU.\tThis specifies\n\t       the number of supplied variables that should not be iterated\n\t       over.  The default is 0.\n\n       -Cr<NUM>\n\t       Set the max-repetitions field in the GETBULK PDU.  This\n\t       specifies the maximum number of iterations over the repeating\n\t       variables.  The default is 10."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the snmpbulkget command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use snmpbulkget to retrieve a large number of repeated OIDs from an SNMP agent?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using snmpbulkget to set the non-repeater count and maximum repetitions for a GETBULK request?

Note that snmpbulkget\n       REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query and at least one\n       OID argument, as described there.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       The command:\n\n       snmpbulkget -v2c -Cn1 -Cr5 -Os -c public zeus system ifTable\n\n       will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0 (which is the\n       lexicographically next object to system) and the first 5 objects in the\n       ifTable:\n\n       sysDescr.0 = STRING: \"SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m\"\n       ifIndex.1 = INTEGER: 1\n       ifIndex.2 = INTEGER: 2\n       ifDescr.1 = STRING: \"lo0\"\n       et cetera.\n\nNOTE\n       As the name implies, snmpbulkget utilizes the SNMP GETBULK message,\n       which is not available in SNMPv1.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       snmpcmd(1), variables(5), RFC 1905.\n\nV5.6.2.1\t\t\t  01 May 2002\t\t\tSNMPBULKGET(1)"
