This man page provides a\n       quick reference to the supported keywords and should be used in\n       conjunction with the online help for CUPS.\n\n       The source file format is plain ASCII text that can be edited using\n       your favorite text editor. Comments are supported using the C (/* ...\n       */) and C++ (// ...) comment mechanisms.\n\n       Printer driver information can be grouped and shared using curly braces\n       ({ ... }); PPD files are written when a close brace or end-of-file is\n       seen and a PCFileName directive has been defined.\n\n       Directives may be placed anywhere on a line and are followed by one or\n       more values. The following is a list of the available directives and\n       the values they accept:"
