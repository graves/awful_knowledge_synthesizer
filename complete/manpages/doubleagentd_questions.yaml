- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `doubleagentd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDOUBLEAGENTD(8) \t    System Manager's Manual\t       DOUBLEAGENTD(8)\n\nNAME\n     doubleagentd â€“ A daemon for parsing AppleDouble files in userspace\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     doubleagentd takes no arguments, and users should not launch it manually.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     doubleagentd receives requests from the kernel to parse AppleDouble files\n     (and modify them, if needed).  AppleDouble files are used by file systems\n     which do not natively support extended attributes, such as the MS-DOS and\n     ExFAT file systems.\n\n     doubleagentd is launched automatically by launchd(8) when the kernel\n     needs to access an AppleDouble file that contains extended attributes for\n     a base file.\n\nFILES\n     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.doubleagentd.plist\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t      September 24, 2024\t\t    macOS 15.3"
