It implements a printing system based\n       upon the Internet Printing Protocol, version 2.1, and supports most of\n       the requirements for IPP Everywhere. If no options are specified on the\n       command-line then the default configuration file /etc/cups/cupsd.conf\n       will be used.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -c_cupsd.conf\n\t    Uses the named cupsd.conf configuration file.\n\n       -f   Run cupsd in the foreground; the default is to run in the\n\t    background as a \"daemon\".\n\n       -F   Run cupsd in the foreground but detach the process from the\n\t    controlling terminal and current directory. This is useful for\n\t    running cupsd from init(8).\n\n       -h   Shows the program usage.\n\n       -l   This option is passed to cupsd when it is run from launchd(8) or\n\t    systemd(8).\n\n       -s_cups-files.conf\n\t    Uses the named cups-files.conf configuration file.\n\n       -t   Test the configuration file for syntax errors.\n\nFILES\n       /etc/cups/classes.conf\n       /etc/cups/cups-files.conf\n       /etc/cups/cupsd.conf\n       /usr/share/cups/mime/mime.convs\n       /usr/share/cups/mime/mime.types\n       /etc/cups/printers.conf\n       /etc/cups/subscriptions.conf\n\nCONFORMING TO\n       cupsd implements all of the required IPP/2.1 attributes and operations.\n       It also implements several CUPS-specific administrative operations.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Run cupsd in the background with the default configuration file:\n\n\t   cupsd\n\n       Test a configuration file called test.conf:\n\n\t   cupsd -t -c test.conf\n\n       Run cupsd in the foreground with a test configuration file called\n       test.conf:\n\n\t   cupsd -f -c test.conf"
