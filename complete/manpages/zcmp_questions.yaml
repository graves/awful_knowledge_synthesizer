When both file1 or file2 are\n     specified, either file may be compressed.\n\n     Extensions handled by gzip(1):\n     •\t z, Z,\n     •\t gz,\n     •\t taz,\n     •\t tgz.\n\n     Extensions handled by bzip2(1):\n     •\t bz,\n     •\t bz2,\n     •\t tbz,\n     •\t tbz2.\n\n     Extensions handled by xz(1):\n     •\t lzma,\n     •\t xz,\n     •\t tlz,\n     •\t txz.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     TMPDIR  Directory in which to place temporary files.  If unset, /tmp is\n\t     used.\n\nFILES\n     /tmp/zcmp.XXXXXXXXXX   Temporary file for zcmp.\n     /tmp/zdiff.XXXXXXXXXX  Temporary file for zdiff."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the zcmp and zdiff tools?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use zcmp to compare a compressed file named 'data.z' with its uncompressed version?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using zdiff to compare two compressed files, 'report.tgz' and 'backup.tgz', while passing the -u option to diff(1)?
