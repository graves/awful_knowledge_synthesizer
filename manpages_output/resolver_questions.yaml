    The res_send() routine sends a pre-formatted query and returns an answer.
         It will call res_init() if RES_INIT is not set, send the query to the
         local name server, and handle timeouts and retries.  The length of the
         reply message is returned, or -1 if there were errors.

         The dn_comp() function compresses the domain name exp_dn and stores it in
         comp_dn.  The size of the compressed name is returned or -1 if there were
         errors.  The size of the array pointed to by comp_dn is given by length.
         The compression uses an array of pointers dnptrs to previously-compressed
         names in the current message.  The first pointer points to the beginning
         of the message and the list ends with NULL.  The limit to the array is
         specified by lastdnptr.  A side effect of dn_comp() is to update the list
         of pointers for labels inserted into the message as the name is
         compressed.  If dnptr is NULL, names are not compressed.  If lastdnptr is
         NULL, the list of labels is not updated.
