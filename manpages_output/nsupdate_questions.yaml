This allows resource records to be added or\n       removed from a zone without manually editing the zone file. A single\n       update request can contain requests to add or remove more than one\n       resource record.\n\n       Zones that are under dynamic control via nsupdate or a DHCP server\n       should not be edited by hand. Manual edits could conflict with dynamic\n       updates and cause data to be lost.\n\n       The resource records that are dynamically added or removed with\n       nsupdate have to be in the same zone. Requests are sent to the zone's\n       master server. This is identified by the MNAME field of the zone's SOA\n       record."

    Manpage text:

    Transaction signatures can be used to authenticate the Dynamic DNS
           updates. These use the TSIG resource record type described in RFC 2845
           or the SIG(0) record described in RFC 2535 and RFC 2931 or GSS-TSIG as
           described in RFC 3645.

           TSIG relies on a shared secret that should only be known to nsupdate
           and the name server. For instance, suitable key and server statements
           would be added to /etc/named.conf so that the name server can associate
           the appropriate secret key and algorithm with the IP address of the
           client application that will be using TSIG authentication. You can use
           ddns-confgen to generate suitable configuration fragments.  nsupdate
           uses the -y or -k options to provide the TSIG shared secret. These
           options are mutually exclusive.

           SIG(0) uses public key cryptography. To use a SIG(0) key, the public
           key must be stored in a KEY record in a zone served by the name server.

           GSS-TSIG uses Kerberos credentials. Standard GSS-TSIG mode is switched
           on with the -g flag. A non-standards-compliant variant of GSS-TSIG used
           by Windows 2000 can be switched on with the -o flag.

Each command is\n       supplied on exactly one line of input. Some commands are for\n       administrative purposes. The others are either update instructions or\n       prerequisite checks on the contents of the zone. These checks set\n       conditions that some name or set of resource records (RRset) either\n       exists or is absent from the zone. These conditions must be met if the\n       entire update request is to succeed. Updates will be rejected if the\n       tests for the prerequisite conditions fail.\n\n       Every update request consists of zero or more prerequisites and zero or\n       more updates. This allows a suitably authenticated update request to\n       proceed if some specified resource records are present or missing from\n       the zone. A blank input line (or the send command) causes the\n       accumulated commands to be sent as one Dynamic DNS update request to\n       the name server."
