Unless the string property UserSelectorPath is set with\n     full executable path value in the configuration file (\n     /etc/SmartcardLogin.plist ), the system UserSelector is used.\n\n     How CryptoTokenKit framework invokes UserSelector:\n\n\t   UserSelector -o operation -u username -i pubkeyhash1[,pubkeyhash2,...]\n\nPath and format\n     UserSelector runs in a sandbox which limits its path and file format. A\n     custom UserSelector must be stored in the /Library/CryptoTokenKit\n     directory. The file format of the UserSelector must be binary. Shell\n     scripts are not supported.\n\nSupported Operations\n   Map Operation\n     This operation returns a list of users bound with pubkeyhashes from the\n     SmartCard certificates. The username parameter is optional. If set,\n     bindings are returned only for the specified user. The list of one or\n     more comma separated pubkeyhashes is mandatory."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use UserSelector to map a username to a list of associated public key hashes?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of invoking UserSelector with a custom binary file to perform a 'Map' operation?
