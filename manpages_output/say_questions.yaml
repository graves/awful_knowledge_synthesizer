This can consist of\n\t   multiple arguments, which are considered to be separated by spaces.\n\n       -f file, --input-file=file\n\t   Specify a file to be spoken. If file is - or neither this parameter\n\t   nor a message is specified, read from standard input.\n\n       -v voice, --voice=voice\n\t   Specify the voice to be used. Default is the voice selected in\n\t   System Preferences. To obtain a list of voices installed in the\n\t   system, specify '?' as the voice name.\n\n       -r rate, --rate=rate\n\t   Speech rate to be used, in words per minute.\n\n       -o out.aiff, --output-file=file\n\t   Specify the path for an audio file to be written. AIFF is the\n\t   default and should be supported for most voices, but some voices\n\t   support many more file formats.\n\n       -n name, --network-send=name\n       -n name:port, --network-send=name:port\n       -n :port, --network-send=:port\n       -n :, --network-send=:\n\t   Specify a service name (default \"AUNetSend\") and/or IP port to be\n\t   used for redirecting the speech output through AUNetSend.\n\n       -a ID, --audio-device=ID\n       -a name, --audio-device=name\n\t   Specify, by ID or name prefix, an audio device to be used to play\n\t   the audio. To obtain a list of audio output devices, specify '?' as\n\t   the device name.\n\n       --progress\n\t   Display a progress meter during synthesis.\n\n       -i, --interactive, --interactive=markup\n\t   Print the text line by line during synthesis, highlighting words as\n\t   they are spoken. Markup can be one of\n\n\t   •   A terminfo capability as described in terminfo(5), e.g. bold,\n\t       smul, setaf 1.\n\n\t   •   A color name, one of black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,\n\t       cyan, or white.\n\n\t   •   A foreground and background color from the above list,\n\t       separated by a slash, e.g. green/black. If the foreground color\n\t       is omitted, only the background color is set.\n\n\t   If markup is not specified, it defaults to smso, i.e. reverse\n\t   video.\n\n       If the input is a TTY, text is spoken line by line, and the output\n       file, if specified, will only contain audio for the last line of the\n       input.  Otherwise, text is spoken all at once.\n\nAUDIO FORMATS\n       Starting in MacOS X 10.6, file formats other than AIFF may be\n       specified, although not all third party synthesizers may initially\n       support them. In simple cases, the file format can be inferred from the\n       extension, although generally some of the options below are required\n       for finer grained control:\n\n       --file-format=format\n\t   The format of the file to write (AIFF, caff, m4af, WAVE).\n\t   Generally, it's easier to specify a suitable file extension for the\n\t   output file. To obtain a list of writable file formats, specify '?'\n\t   as the format name.\n\n       --data-format=format\n\t   The format of the audio data to be stored. Formats other than\n\t   linear PCM are specified by giving their format identifiers (aac,\n\t   alac). Linear PCM formats are specified as a sequence of:\n\n\t   Endianness (optional)\n\t       One of BE (big endian) or LE (little endian). Default is native\n\t       endianness.\n\n\t   Data type\n\t       One of F (float), I (integer), or, rarely, UI (unsigned\n\t       integer).\n\n\t   Sample size\n\t       One of 8, 16, 24, 32, 64.\n\n\t   Most available file formats only support a subset of these sample\n\t   formats.\n\n\t   To obtain a list of audio data formats for a file format specified\n\t   explicitly or by file name, specify '?' as the format name.\n\n\t   The format identifier optionally can be followed by @samplerate and\n\t   /hexflags for the format.\n\n       --channels=channels\n\t   The number of channels. This will generally be of limited use, as\n\t   most speech synthesizers produce mono audio only.\n\n       --bit-rate=rate\n\t   The bit rate for formats like AAC. To obtain a list of valid bit\n\t   rates, specify '?' as the rate. In practice, not all of these bit\n\t   rates will be available for a given format.\n\n       --quality=quality\n\t   The audio converter quality level between 0 (lowest) and 127\n\t   (highest).\n\nERRORS\n       say returns 0 if the text was spoken successfully, otherwise non-zero.\n       Diagnostic messages will be printed to standard error.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\t  say Hello, World\n\t  say -v Alex -o hi -f hello_world.txt\n\t  say --interactive=/green spending each day the color of the leaves\n\t  say -o hi.aac 'Hello, [[slnc 200]] World'\n\t  say -o hi.m4a --data-format=alac Hello, World.\n\t  say -o hi.caf --data-format=LEF32@8000 Hello, World\n\n\t  say -v '?'\n\t  say --file-format=?\n\t  say --file-format=caff --data-format=?\n\t  say -o hi.m4a --bit-rate=?\n\nSEE ALSO\n       \"Speech Synthesis Programming Guide\"\n\n1.0\t\t\t\t  2020-08-13\t\t\t\tSAY(1)"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the say command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the say command to convert a text file into an audio file using the default voice and save it as 'output.aiff'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the say command to convert the text 'Welcome to macOS' into speech and output it as a 32-bit floating-point stereo audio file at 44.1kHz with the default settings?
