Several modules\n     receive input messages through various channels, including UNIX domain\n     sockets associated with the syslog(3), asl(3), and kernel printf APIs,\n     and optionally on a UDP socket from network clients.\n\n     The Apple System Log facility comprises the asl(3) API, a new syslogd\n     server, the syslog(1) command-line utility, and a data store file\n     manager, aslmanager(8).  The system supports structured and extensible\n     messages, permitting advanced message browsing and management through\n     search APIs and other components of the Apple system log facility.\n\n     Log messages are retained in a data store, subject to automatic archival,\n     and input filtering as described below, to simplify the task of locating\n     log messages and to facilitate browsing and searching.  The data store is\n     intended to become a replacement for the numerous log files that are\n     currently found in various locations on the system.  Those files will be\n     phased out in future versions of Mac OS."

The message files are given read access controls\n     corresponding to the read UID and GID specified in the messages\n     themselves.  Read access UID and GID settings may be attached to messages\n     using the asl(3) library by setting a value for the \"ReadUID\" and/or\n     \"ReadGID\" message keys.
