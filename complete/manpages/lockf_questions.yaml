BSD-style locking is used, as\n     described in flock(2); the mere existence of the file is not considered\n     to constitute a lock.\n\n     lockf may also be used to operate on a file descriptor instead of a file.\n     If no command is supplied, then fd must be a file descriptor.  The\n     version with a command may also be used with a file descriptor by\n     supplying it as a path /dev/fd/N, where N is the desired file descriptor.\n     The -k option is implied when a file descriptor is in use, and the -n and\n     -w options are silently ignored.  This can be used to lock inside a shell\n     script."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lockf`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf the lockf utility is being used to facilitate concurrency between a\n     number of processes, it is recommended that the -k option be used.  This\n     will guarantee lock ordering, as well as implement a performance enhanced\n     algorithm which minimizes CPU load associated with concurrent unlink,\n     drop and re-acquire activity.  It should be noted that if the -k option\n     is not used, then no guarantees around lock ordering can be made.\n\n     The following options are supported:\n\n     -k \t       Causes the lock file to be kept (not removed) after the\n\t\t       command completes.\n\n     -s \t       Causes lockf to operate silently.  Failure to acquire\n\t\t       the lock is indicated only in the exit status.\n\n     -n \t       Causes lockf to fail if the specified lock file does\n\t\t       not exist.  If -n is not specified, lockf will create\n\t\t       file if necessary.\n\n     -t seconds        Specifies a timeout for waiting for the lock.  By\n\t\t       default, lockf waits indefinitely to acquire the lock.\n\t\t       If a timeout is specified with this option, lockf will\n\t\t       wait at most the given number of seconds before giving\n\t\t       up.  A timeout of 0 may be given, in which case lockf\n\t\t       will fail unless it can acquire the lock immediately.\n\t\t       When a lock times out, command is not executed."
