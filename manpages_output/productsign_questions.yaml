Although you can add a digital signature\n     at the time you run productbuild(1), you may wish to add a signature\n     later, once the product archive has been tested and is ready to deploy.\n     If you run productsign on a product archive that was previously signed,\n     the existing signature will be replaced.\n\n     To sign a product archive, you will need to have a certificate and\n     corresponding private key -- together called an “identity” -- in one of\n     your accessible keychains. To add a signature, specify the name of the\n     identity using the --sign option. The identity's name is the same as the\n     “Common Name” of the certificate."

    Manpage text:

    If you want to search for the identity in a specific keychain, specify
         the path to the keychain file using the --keychain option. Otherwise, the
         default keychain search path is used.

         productsign will embed the signing certificate in the product archive, as
         well as any intermediate certificates that are found in the keychain. If
         you need to embed additional certificates to form a chain of trust
         between the signing certificate and a trusted root certificate on the
         system, use the --cert option to give the Common Name of the intermediate
         certificate. Multiple --cert options may be used to embed multiple
         intermediate certificates.

         The signature can optionally include a trusted timestamp. This is enabled
         by default when signing with a Developer ID identity, but it can be
         enabled explicitly using the --timestamp option. A timestamp server must
         be contacted to embed a trusted timestamp. If you aren't connected to the
         Internet, you can use --timestamp=none to disable timestamps, even for a
         Developer ID identity.
