It is a thin layer over the package\n       fileutil::multi::op which provides objects for the same. This package\n       simply creates a single such object and directs all file commands to\n       it.\n\n       At the core is a domain specific language allowing the easy\n       specification of multi-file copy and/or move and/or deletion\n       operations. Alternate names would be scatter/gather processor, or maybe\n       even assembler.\tFor the detailed specification of this language, and\n       examples, please see the documention for the package\n       fileutil::multi::op."
