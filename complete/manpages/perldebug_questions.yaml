    NAME
           perldebug - Perl debugging

    DESCRIPTION
           First of all, have you tried using "use strict;" and "use warnings;"?

           If you're new to the Perl debugger, you may prefer to read perldebtut,
           which is a tutorial introduction to the debugger.

           If you're looking for the nitty gritty details of how the debugger is
           implemented, you may prefer to read perldebguts.

           For in-depth technical usage details, see perl5db.pl, the documentation
           of the debugger itself.

    The Perl Debugger
           If you invoke Perl with the -d switch, your script runs under the Perl
           source debugger.  This works like an interactive Perl environment,
           prompting for debugger commands that let you examine source code, set
           breakpoints, get stack backtraces, change the values of variables, etc.
           This is so convenient that you often fire up the debugger all by itself
           just to test out Perl constructs interactively to see what they do.
           For example:

  manpageQuestion2: How would you start the Perl debugger to debug a script named 'script.pl'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how to set a breakpoint in a Perl script using the debugger?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perldebug`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n$ perl -d -e 42\n\n       In Perl, the debugger is not a separate program the way it usually is\n       in the typical compiled environment.  Instead, the -d flag tells the\n       compiler to insert source information into the parse trees it's about\n       to hand off to the interpreter.\tThat means your code must first\n       compile correctly for the debugger to work on it.  Then when the\n       interpreter starts up, it preloads a special Perl library file\n       containing the debugger.\n\n       The program will halt right before the first run-time executable\n       statement (but see below regarding compile-time statements) and ask you\n       to enter a debugger command.  Contrary to popular expectations,\n       whenever the debugger halts and shows you a line of code, it always\n       displays the line it's about to execute, rather than the one it has\n       just executed.\n\n       Any command not recognized by the debugger is directly executed\n       (\"eval\"'d) as Perl code in the current package.\t(The debugger uses the\n       DB package for keeping its own state information.)"

As a result\n       any newly introduced lexical variable or any modified capture buffer\n       content is lost after the eval. The debugger is a nice environment to\n       learn Perl, but if you interactively experiment using material which\n       should be in the same scope, stuff it in one line.\n\n       For any text entered at the debugger prompt, leading and trailing\n       whitespace is first stripped before further processing.\tIf a debugger\n       command coincides with some function in your own program, merely\n       precede the function with something that doesn't look like a debugger\n       command, such as a leading \";\" or perhaps a \"+\", or by wrapping it with\n       parentheses or braces.\n\n   Calling the Debugger\n       There are several ways to call the debugger:\n\n       perl -d program_name\n\t   On the given program identified by \"program_name\".\n\n       perl -d -e 0\n\t   Interactively supply an arbitrary \"expression\" using \"-e\"."

Note that .perldb is\n       processed before processing \"PERLDB_OPTS\".  If .perldb defines the\n       subroutine \"afterinit\", that function is called after debugger\n       initialization ends.  .perldb may be contained in the current\n       directory, or in the home directory.  Because this file is sourced in\n       by Perl and may contain arbitrary commands, for security reasons, it\n       must be owned by the superuser or the current user, and writable by no\n       one but its owner.\n\n       You can mock TTY input to debugger by adding arbitrary commands to\n       @DB::typeahead. For example, your .perldb file might contain:\n\n\t   sub afterinit { push @DB::typeahead, \"b 4\", \"b 6\"; }\n\n       Which would attempt to set breakpoints on lines 4 and 6 immediately\n       after debugger initialization. Note that @DB::typeahead is not a\n       supported interface and is subject to change in future releases."

    Manpage text:

    A rudimentary command-line completion is also available, including
           lexical variables in the current scope if the "PadWalker" module is
           installed.

           Without Readline support you may see the symbols "^[[A", "^[[C",
           "^[[B", "^[[D"", "^H", ... when using the arrow keys and/or the
           backspace key.

       Editor Support for Debugging
           If you have the GNU's version of emacs installed on your system, it can
           interact with the Perl debugger to provide an integrated software
           development environment reminiscent of its interactions with C
           debuggers.

           Recent versions of Emacs come with a start file for making emacs act
           like a syntax-directed editor that understands (some of) Perl's syntax.
           See perlfaq3.

           Users of vi should also look into vim and gvim, the mousey and windy
           version, for coloring of Perl keywords.

           Note that only perl can truly parse Perl, so all such CASE tools fall
           somewhat short of the mark, especially if you don't program your Perl
           as a C programmer might.
