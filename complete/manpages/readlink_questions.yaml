If no argument is given, stat displays information about the\n     file descriptor for standard input.\n\n     When invoked as readlink, only the target of the symbolic link is\n     printed.  If the given argument is not a symbolic link and the -f option\n     is not specified, readlink will print nothing and exit with an error.  If\n     the -f option is specified, the output is canonicalized by following\n     every symlink in every component of the given path recursively.  readlink\n     will resolve both absolute and relative paths, and return the absolute\n     pathname corresponding to file.  In this case, the argument does not need\n     to be a symbolic link."
