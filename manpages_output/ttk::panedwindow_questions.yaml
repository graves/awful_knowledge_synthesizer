The user may adjust the relative\n       sizes of the subwindows by dragging the sash between panes.\n\nSTANDARD OPTIONS\n       -class\t\t     -cursor\t\t  -takefocus\n       -style\n\n       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS\n       [-orient orient] Specifies the orientation of the window.  If vertical,\n       subpanes are stacked top-to-bottom; if horizontal, subpanes are stacked\n       left-to-right.  [-width width] If present and greater than zero,\n       specifies the desired width of the widget in pixels.  Otherwise, the\n       requested width is determined by the width of the managed windows.\n       [-height height] If present and greater than zero, specifies the\n       desired height of the widget in pixels.\tOtherwise, the requested\n       height is determined by the height of the managed windows."
