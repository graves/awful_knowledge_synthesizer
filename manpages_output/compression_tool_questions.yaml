Default is lzfse.\n\n     --b block_size\n\t     Set block size for block compression.  The integer value can be\n\t     followed by m or k or b.\n\n     --t thread_count\n\t     Set the number of worker threads to use for block\n\t     compression/decompression.  Default is the number of logical\n\t     threads on the machine.\n\n     --i input_file\n\t     Input file.  If omitted, read from standard input.\n\n     --o output_file\n\t     Output file.  If omitted, write to standard output.\n\n     --v     Increase verbosity.  Default is silent operation.\n\n     --h     Print usage and exit.\n\nBLOCK COMPRESSION FILE FORMAT\n     The file starts with a 4-byte header 'p','b','z',<algo>, where <algo>\n     indicates the algorithm used to compress data.  The header is followed by\n     the 64-bit block size in bytes.  Then for each block, we have 64-bit\n     uncompressed size (will batch the block size, except possibly for the\n     last block), 64-bit compressed size, and the compressed payload.  If both\n     uncompressed and compressed sizes for a block are equal, the payload is\n     stored uncompressed.  All 64-bit values are stored big-endian.  Valid\n     values for <algo> are: 'z' for zlib, 'x' for lzma, '4' for lz4, and 'e'\n     for lzfse."
