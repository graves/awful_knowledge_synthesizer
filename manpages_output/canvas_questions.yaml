If the value of this option is greater than zero, the\n       horizontal view in the window will be constrained so that the canvas x\n       coordinate at the left edge of the window is always an even multiple of\n       xScrollIncrement;  furthermore, the units for scrolling (e.g., the\n       change in view when the left and right arrows of a scrollbar are\n       selected) will also be xScrollIncrement.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `canvas`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n       The canvas command creates a new window (given by the pathName\n       argument) and makes it into a canvas widget.  Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the canvas such as its colors and 3-D\n       relief.\tThe canvas command returns its pathName argument.  At the time\n       this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName,\n       but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       Canvas widgets implement structured graphics.  A canvas displays any\n       number of items, which may be things like rectangles, circles, lines,\n       and text.  Items may be manipulated (e.g. moved or re-colored) and\n       commands may be associated with items in much the same way that the\n       bind command allows commands to be bound to widgets.  For example, a\n       particular command may be associated with the <Button-1> event so that\n       the command is invoked whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse\n       cursor over an item.  This means that items in a canvas can have\n       behaviors defined by the Tcl scripts bound to them."

Items later in the display list\n       obscure those that are earlier in the display list and are sometimes\n       referred to as being “on top” of earlier items.\tWhen a new item is\n       created it is placed at the end of the display list, on top of\n       everything else.  Widget commands may be used to re-arrange the order\n       of the display list.\n\n       Window items are an exception to the above rules.  The underlying\n       window systems require them always to be drawn on top of other items.\n       In addition, the stacking order of window items is not affected by any\n       of the canvas widget commands; you must use the raise and lower Tk\n       commands instead.\n\nITEM IDS AND TAGS\n       Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or\n       by tag.\tEach item has a unique identifying number, which is assigned\n       to that item when it is created.

    Manpage text:

    Each item may also have any number of tags associated with it.  A tag
           is just a string of characters, and it may take any form except that of
           an integer.  For example, “x123” is OK but “123” is not.  The same tag
           may be associated with many different items.  This is commonly done to
           group items in various interesting ways;  for example, all selected
           items might be given the tag “selected”.

           The tag all is implicitly associated with every item in the canvas;  it
           may be used to invoke operations on all the items in the canvas.

           The tag current is managed automatically by Tk; it applies to the
           current item, which is the topmost item whose drawn area covers the
           position of the mouse cursor (different item types interpret this in
           varying ways; see the individual item type documentation for details).
           If the mouse is not in the canvas widget or is not over an item, then
           no item has the current tag.

           When specifying items in canvas widget commands, if the specifier is an
           integer then it is assumed to refer to the single item with that id.
           If the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to refer to all
           of the items in the canvas that have a tag matching the specifier.  The
           symbol tagOrId is used below to indicate that an argument specifies
           either an id that selects a single item or a tag that selects zero or
           more items.

Exceptions\n       are noted in the widget command descriptions below.\n\nCOORDINATES\n       All coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point\n       numbers.  Coordinates and distances are specified in screen units,\n       which are floating-point numbers optionally followed by one of several\n       letters.  If no letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels.  If\n       the letter is m then the distance is in millimeters on the screen;  if\n       it is c then the distance is in centimeters; i means inches, and p\n       means printers points (1/72 inch).  Larger y-coordinates refer to\n       points lower on the screen;  larger x-coordinates refer to points\n       farther to the right.

    INDICES
           Text items support the notion of an index for identifying particular
           positions within the item.  In a similar fashion, line and polygon
           items support index for identifying, inserting and deleting subsets of
           their coordinates.  Indices are used for commands such as inserting or
           deleting a range of characters or coordinates, and setting the
           insertion cursor position. An index may be specified in any of a number
           of ways, and different types of items may support different forms for
           specifying indices.  Text items support the following forms for an
           index;  if you define new types of text-like items, it would be
           advisable to support as many of these forms as practical.  Note that it
           is possible to refer to the character just after the last one in the
           text item;  this is necessary for such tasks as inserting new text at
           the end of the item.  Lines and Polygons do not support the insertion
           cursor and the selection. Their indices are supposed to be even always,
           because coordinates always appear in pairs.

Text items support indexing and selection, along with the\n       following text-related canvas widget commands:  dchars, focus, icursor,\n       index, insert, select.  Text items are created with widget commands of\n       the following form:\n\t      pathName create text x y ?option value option value ...?\n\t      pathName create text coordList ?option value option value ...?\n       The arguments x and y or coordList (which must have two elements)\n       specify the coordinates of a point used to position the text on the\n       display (see the options below for more information on how text is\n       displayed).  After the coordinates there may be any number of\n       option-value pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options\n       for the item.  These same option-value pairs may be used in\n       itemconfigure widget commands to change the item's configuration. A\n       text item becomes the current item when the mouse pointer is over any\n       part of its bounding box."
