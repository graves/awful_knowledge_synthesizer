When first is larger than last, the default incr is -1.\n\n     All numbers are interpreted as floating point.\n\n     Normally integer values are printed as decimal integers.\n\n     The seq utility accepts the following options:\n\n     -f format, --format format\n\t\t   Use a printf(3) style format to print each number.  Only\n\t\t   the A, a, E, e, F, f, G, g, and % conversion characters are\n\t\t   valid, along with any optional flags and an optional\n\t\t   numeric minimum field width or precision.  The format can\n\t\t   contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as\n\t\t   defined in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  The default is\n\t\t   %g.\n\n     -s string, --separator string\n\t\t   Use string to separate numbers.  The string can contain\n\t\t   character escape sequences in backslash notation as defined\n\t\t   in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  The default is \\n."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the seq command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the seq command to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 with each number on a new line?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the seq command with the -f option to format numbers as hexadecimal?

The string\n\t\t   can contain character escape sequences in backslash\n\t\t   notation as defined in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  This\n\t\t   option is useful when the default separator does not\n\t\t   contain a \\n.\n\n     -w, --fixed-width\n\t\t   Equalize the widths of all numbers by padding with zeros as\n\t\t   necessary.  This option has no effect with the -f option.\n\t\t   If any sequence numbers will be printed in exponential\n\t\t   notation, the default conversion is changed to %e.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The seq utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Generate a sequence from 1 to 3 (included) with a default increment of 1:\n\n\t   # seq 1 3\n\t   1\n\t   2\n\t   3\n\n     Generate a sequence from 3 to 1 (included) with a default increment of\n     -1:\n\n\t   # seq 3 1\n\t   3\n\t   2\n\t   1\n\n     Generate a sequence from 0 to 0.1 (included) with an increment of 0.05\n     and padding with leading zeroes.\n\n\t   # seq -w 0 .05 .1\n\t   0.00\n\t   0.05\n\t   0.10"

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the seq command to generate a sequence of numbers from 5 to 10 with a step of 2, and ensure that all numbers are printed with the same width using leading zeros?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the function of the -t option in the seq command, and how would you use it to generate a sequence that is terminated by a specific string such as 'END'?
