It is used to create,\n     display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files.  When invoked as\n     red, the editor runs in \"restricted\" mode, in which the only difference\n     is that the editor restricts the use of filenames which start with ‘!’\n     (interpreted as shell commands by ed) or contain a ‘/’.  Note that\n     editing outside of the current directory is only prohibited if the user\n     does not have write access to the current directory.  If a user has write\n     access to the current directory, then symbolic links can be created in\n     the current directory, in which case red will not stop the user from\n     editing the file that the symbolic link points to.\n\n     If invoked with a file argument, then a copy of file is read into the\n     editor's buffer.  Changes are made to this copy and not directly to file\n     itself.  Upon quitting ed, any changes not explicitly saved with a w\n     command are lost."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `red`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nEditing is done in two distinct modes: command and input.\tWhen first\n     invoked, ed is in command mode.  In this mode commands are read from the\n     standard input and executed to manipulate the contents of the editor\n     buffer.  A typical command might look like:\n\n     ,s/old/new/g\n\n     which replaces all occurrences of the string old with new.\n\n     When an input command, such as a (append), i (insert) or c (change), is\n     given, ed enters input mode.  This is the primary means of adding text to\n     a file.  In this mode, no commands are available; instead, the standard\n     input is written directly to the editor buffer.  Lines consist of text up\n     to and including a newline character.  Input mode is terminated by\n     entering a single period (.) on a line.\n\n     All ed commands operate on whole lines or ranges of lines; e.g., the d\n     command deletes lines; the m command moves lines, and so on.  It is\n     possible to modify only a portion of a line by means of replacement, as\n     in the example above.  However even here, the s command is applied to\n     whole lines at a time."

When a file is first read,\n     the current address is set to the last line of the file.  In general, the\n     current address is set to the last line affected by a command.\n\n     A line address is constructed from one of the bases in the list below,\n     optionally followed by a numeric offset.  The offset may include any\n     combination of digits, operators (i.e., +, - and ^) and whitespace.\n     Addresses are read from left to right, and their values are computed\n     relative to the current address.\n\n     One exception to the rule that addresses represent line numbers is the\n     address 0 (zero).\tThis means \"before the first line,\" and is legal\n     wherever it makes sense.\n\n     An address range is two addresses separated either by a comma or semi-\n     colon.  The value of the first address in a range cannot exceed the value\n     of the second.  If only one address is given in a range, then the second\n     address is set to the given address.  If an n-tuple of addresses is given\n     where n_>_2, then the corresponding range is determined by the last two\n     addresses in the n-tuple.\tIf only one address is expected, then the last\n     address is used."
