A line is a\n     record separated from the subsequent record by a newline (default) or NUL\n     ´\\0´ character (-z option).  A record can contain any printable or\n     unprintable characters.  Comparisons are based on one or more sort keys\n     extracted from each line of input, and are performed lexicographically,\n     according to the current locale's collating rules and the specified\n     command-line options that can tune the actual sorting behavior.  By\n     default, if keys are not given, sort uses entire lines for comparison.\n\n     The command line options are as follows:\n\n     -c, --check, -C, --check=silent|quiet\n\t     Check that the single input file is sorted.  If the file is not\n\t     sorted, sort produces the appropriate error messages and exits\n\t     with code 1, otherwise returns 0.\tIf -C or --check=silent is\n\t     specified, sort produces no output.  This is a \"silent\" version\n\t     of -c."
