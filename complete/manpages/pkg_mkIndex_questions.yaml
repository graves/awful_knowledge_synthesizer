It is used to create index files that allow packages to be\n       loaded automatically when package require commands are executed.  To\n       use pkg_mkIndex, follow these steps:\n\n       [1]    Create the package(s).  Each package may consist of one or more\n\t      Tcl script files or binary files.  Binary files must be suitable\n\t      for loading with the load command with a single argument;  for\n\t      example, if the file is test.so it must be possible to load this\n\t      file with the command load test.so.  Each script file must\n\t      contain a package provide command to declare the package and\n\t      version number, and each binary file must contain a call to\n\t      Tcl_PkgProvide."

If $tcl_pkgPath contains\n\t      more than one directory, machine-dependent packages (e.g., those\n\t      that contain binary shared libraries) should normally be\n\t      installed under the first directory and machine-independent\n\t      packages (e.g., those that contain only Tcl scripts) should be\n\t      installed under the second directory.  The subdirectory should\n\t      include the package's script and/or binary files as well as the\n\t      pkgIndex.tcl file.

    HOW IT WORKS
           Pkg_mkIndex depends on the package unknown command, the package
           ifneeded command, and the auto-loader.  The first time a package
           require command is invoked, the package unknown script is invoked.
           This is set by Tcl initialization to a script that evaluates all of the
           pkgIndex.tcl files in the auto_path.  The pkgIndex.tcl files contain
           package ifneeded commands for each version of each available package;
           these commands invoke package provide commands to announce the
           availability of the package, and they setup auto-loader information to
           load the files of the package.  If the -lazy flag was provided when the
           pkgIndex.tcl was generated, a given file of a given version of a given
           package is not actually loaded until the first time one of its commands
           is invoked.  Thus, after invoking package require you may not see the
           package's commands in the interpreter, but you will be able to invoke
           the commands and they will be auto-loaded.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pkg_mkIndex`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDIRECT LOADING\n       Some packages, for instance packages which use namespaces and export\n       commands or those which require special initialization, might select\n       that their package files be loaded immediately upon package require\n       instead of delaying the actual loading to the first use of one of the\n       package's command. This is the default mode when generating the package\n       index.  It can be overridden by specifying the -lazy argument.\n\nCOMPLEX CASES\n       Most complex cases of dependencies among scripts and binary files, and\n       packages being split among scripts and binary files are handled OK.\n       However, you may have to adjust the order in which files are processed\n       by pkg_mkIndex.\tThese issues are described in detail below.\n\n       If each script or file contains one package, and packages are only\n       contained in one file, then things are easy.  You simply specify all\n       files to be indexed in any order with some glob patterns.\n\n       In general, it is OK for scripts to have dependencies on other\n       packages.  If scripts contain package require commands, these are\n       stubbed out in the interpreter used to process the scripts, so these do\n       not cause problems.  If scripts call into other packages in global\n       code, these calls are handled by a stub unknown command.  However, if\n       scripts make variable references to other package's variables in global\n       code, these will cause errors.  That is also bad coding style."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pkg_mkIndex`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf binary files have dependencies on other packages, things can become\n       tricky because it is not possible to stub out C-level APIs such as\n       Tcl_PkgRequire API when loading a binary file.  For example, suppose\n       the BLT package requires Tk, and expresses this with a call to\n       Tcl_PkgRequire in its Blt_Init routine.\tTo support this, you must run\n       pkg_mkIndex in an interpreter that has Tk loaded.  You can achieve this\n       with the -load pkgPat option.  If you specify this option, pkg_mkIndex\n       will load any packages listed by info loaded and that match pkgPat into\n       the interpreter used to process files.  In most cases this will satisfy\n       the Tcl_PkgRequire calls made by binary files.\n\n       If you are indexing two binary files and one depends on the other, you\n       should specify the one that has dependencies last.  This way the one\n       without dependencies will get loaded and indexed, and then the package\n       it provides will be available when the second file is processed.  You\n       may also need to load the first package into the temporary interpreter\n       used to create the index by using the -load flag; it will not hurt to\n       specify package patterns that are not yet loaded."
