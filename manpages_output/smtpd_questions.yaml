Each received message is\n       piped through the cleanup(8) daemon, and is placed into the incoming\n       queue as one single queue file.\tFor this mode of operation, the\n       program expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.\n\n       Alternatively, the SMTP server be can run in stand-alone mode; this is\n       traditionally obtained with \"sendmail -bs\".  When the SMTP server runs\n       stand-alone with non $mail_owner privileges, it receives mail even\n       while the mail system is not running, deposits messages directly into\n       the maildrop queue, and disables the SMTP server's access policies. As\n       of Postfix version 2.3, the SMTP server refuses to receive mail from\n       the network when it runs with non $mail_owner privileges."

    Manpage text:

    The SMTP server implements a variety of policies for connection
           requests, and for parameters given to HELO, ETRN, MAIL FROM, VRFY and
           RCPT TO commands. They are detailed below and in the main.cf
           configuration file.

    SECURITY
           The SMTP server is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to SMTP
           clients and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP server can be run
           chrooted at fixed low privilege.
