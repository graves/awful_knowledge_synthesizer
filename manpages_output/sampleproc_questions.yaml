Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       sampleproc [hertz]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This program samples which process is on each CPU, at a particular\n       configurable rate. This can be used as an estimate for which process is\n       consuming the most CPU time.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Sample at 100 hertz,\n\t      # sampleproc\n\n       Sample at 400 hertz,\n\t      # sampleproc 400\n\nFIELDS\n       PID    process ID\n\n       COMMAND\n\t      command name\n\n       COUNT  number of samples\n\n       PERCENT\n\t      percent of CPU usage\n\nBASED ON\n       /usr/demo/dtrace/prof.d\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       DTrace Guide \"profile Provider\" chapter (docs.sun.com)\n\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       sampleproc will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dtrace(1M)"
