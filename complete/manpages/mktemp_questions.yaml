The template may be any\n     file name with some number of ‘Xs’ appended to it, for example\n     /tmp/temp.XXXX.  The trailing ‘Xs’ are replaced with the current process\n     number and/or a unique letter combination.  The number of unique file\n     names mktemp can return depends on the number of ‘Xs’ provided; six ‘Xs’\n     will result in mktemp selecting 1 of 56800235584 (62 ** 6) possible file\n     names.  On case-insensitive file systems, the effective number of unique\n     names is significantly less; given six ‘Xs’, mktemp will instead select 1\n     of 2176782336 (36 ** 6) possible unique file names."

    Manpage text:

    If mktemp can successfully generate a unique file name, the file is
         created with mode 0600 (unless the -u flag is given) and the filename is
         printed to standard output.

         If the -t prefix option is given, mktemp will generate a template string
         based on the prefix and the _CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR configuration
         variable if available.  Fallback locations if _CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR is
         not available are TMPDIR, the -p option's tmpdir
          if set, and /tmp.  Care should be taken to ensure that it is appropriate
         to use an environment variable potentially supplied by the user.

         If no arguments are passed or if only the -d flag is passed mktemp
         behaves as if -t tmp was supplied.

         Any number of temporary files may be created in a single invocation,
         including one based on the internal template resulting from the -t flag.

         The mktemp utility is provided to allow shell scripts to safely use
         temporary files.  Traditionally, many shell scripts take the name of the
         program with the pid as a suffix and use that as a temporary file name.
         This kind of naming scheme is predictable and the race condition it
         creates is easy for an attacker to win.  A safer, though still inferior,
         approach is to make a temporary directory using the same naming scheme.
         While this does allow one to guarantee that a temporary file will not be
         subverted, it still allows a simple denial of service attack.  For these
         reasons it is suggested that mktemp be used instead.
