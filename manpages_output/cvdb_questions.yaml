It can be used by system administrators to change the\n       level of system logging that the client filesystem performs.  There is\n       also a switch to retrieve various statistics.\n\nUSAGE\n       cvdb is a multi-purpose debugging tool, performing a variety of\n       functions. A rich set of options provide the user with control over\n       various debug and logging functions. The main features of cvdb are as\n       follows:\n\t    Control debug logging.\n\t    Control level and verbosity of syslog logging.\n\t    Retrieve statistics.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -g     Retrieve the debug log from a running system. The log pointers\n\t      are reset after this command, so that the next invocation of\n\t      cvdb -g will retrieve new information from the buffer.\n\n       -C     Continuously snap the trace.  (Only useful with the -g option.)\n\n       -S stopfile\n\t      Stop snapping the trace when the file stopfile appears.  (Only\n\t      useful when also using the -g and -C options.)\n\n       -D msec\n\t      Delay msec milliseconds between trace snaps.  The default is\n\t      1000 msec or one second.\t(Only useful when also using the -C\n\t      and -g options.)\n\n       -F     Save the trace output to files named cvdbout.000000,\n\t      cvdbout.000001, etc.  instead of writing to standard output.\n\t      These files will appear in the current working directory.  (Only\n\t      useful when also using the -C and -g options.)\n\n       -n cnt After writing cnt files, overwrite the cvdbout out files\n\t      starting with cvdbout.000000.  This will essentially \"wrap\" the\n\t      trace output.\n\n       -N name\n\t      Use name instead of cvdbout for the cvdb output files.  (Only\n\t      useful when also using the -C, -g, and -F options.)\n\n       -d     Disable debug logging. This is the initial (start-up) default.\n\n       -e     Enable debug logging. Disabled by default.  Note: care should be\n\t      taken when enabling logging in a production environment as this\n\t      can significantly reduce file system performance.\n\n       -m modules=bitvector logmask=bitvector\n\t      Specify the trace points for a given module or modules.\n\n       -l     List the current trace points and their mask values.\n\n       -L     List the available trace/debug points.\n\n       -s syslog={none|notice|info|debug}\n\t      Set the syslog logging value. The default at mount time is\n\t      notice. See mount_acfs(8) for more information.\n\n       -R size=[nbytes[k|m|g]]\n\t      Resize the the debug log.  By default, the size of the log is\n\t      4MB.  The minimum allowed size is 32768 bytes.\n\n       -v     Be verbose about the operations.\n\n       -i     Print various statistics about the directory cache.  If enabled\n\t      and configured, the directory cache contains a number of buffers\n\t      of directory contents.  This cache is shared by all mounted Xsan\n\t      file systems.  Without -v, the following are printed:\n\n\t\t     The number of directory buffers currently cached and the\n\t\t     maximum number allowed.\n\n\t\t     The number of times a buffer has been \"hit\" in the cache.\n\n\t\t     The number of times a cache search missed and required an\n\t\t     RPC to the MDC.\n\n\t\t     The number of times a read of the directory re-used the\n\t\t     LAST buffer that was used on the previous read of the\n\t\t     same directory (similar to a cache hit but doesn't probe\n\t\t     the cache).\n\n\t\t     The number of times a read of a directory specified the\n\t\t     EOF offset.\n\n\t\t     The number of times the directory cache for a specific\n\t\t     directory was invalidated.  For example, if the directory\n\t\t     contents changed after it was read and a subsequent read\n\t\t     directory was done thereby causing the invalidation.\n\n\t      If -v is also specified, -i displays more statistics.  Note that\n\t      there are 2 hashes in the directory cache: one for all buffers\n\t      and one by directory and file system.\n\n\t\t     The number of entries in the hash used to find dir cache\n\t\t     buffers.\n\n\t\t     The # of searches using the directory cache buffer hash.\n\n\t\t     The total # of probes searching the directory cache for\n\t\t     buffers.  This can be larger than searches in the hash\n\t\t     since multiple buffers may hit the same hash bucket.\n\n\t\t     The maximum probes after hitting a particular hash bucket\n\t\t     (for buffers).\n\n\t\t     The maximum probes in the hash by directory and file\n\t\t     system.\n\n\t      -b     Print various statistics about each buffer cache.\tThe\n\t\t     only other option that can be used with this is -v.\n\t\t     There are buffer caches per cachebufsize, see\n\t\t     mount_acfs(8).  For each buffer cache, the following is\n\t\t     printed:\n\n\t\t\t    # of mounted file systems using this buffer cache\n\n\t\t\t    # of buffers and total memory used\n\n\t\t\t    # of cache hits (and percentage)\n\n\t\t\t    # of cache misses (and percentage)\n\n\t\t\t    # of checks for write throttling to prevent over\n\t\t\t    use by one file system.

Statistics are\n\t\t     maintained separately for reads and writes, for each\n\t\t     cache segment, and each mount point.  Statistics labeled\n\t\t     Cumulative are those representing the totals since the\n\t\t     command was invoked or since the last reset.  Those\n\t\t     labeled Current represent the change in the last one\n\t\t     second, roughly corresponding to the display refresh\n\t\t     interval.\n\n\t\t     Two keystrokes are interactively recognized on systems\n\t\t     supporting curses.  A q, quit, will cause the display to\n\t\t     terminate.  An r, reset, will reset the cumulative\n\t\t     counters to zeros.\n\n\t\t     The -B option is intended to be used to to analyze\n\t\t     performance of the buffer cache with various\n\t\t     applications, I/O subsystems, and various configuration\n\t\t     parameters.\n\n\t\t     The refreshing display is supported on clients that have\n\t\t     a curses capability.  Other clients will produce a line\n\t\t     oriented output with similar content.\n\n\t\t     A deadman timer will terminate the display after 30\n\t\t     seconds with no file systems mounted.  This is to avoid\n\t\t     hanging during file system shutdown.\n\n\t      -x     Print distributed LAN proxy client and server statistics.\n\t\t     The only other options that can be used with this are -X\n\t\t     and -f.  The proxy statistics are collected at both the\n\t\t     client and server ends of each proxy connection. The\n\t\t     client will have a connection entry for each path to a\n\t\t     proxy server for each proxy client file system.  A proxy\n\t\t     server will have a connection entry for each path to each\n\t\t     client which has the file system mounted.\n\n\t\t     Note: The distributed LAN proxy options are only\n\t\t     available on platforms which support the distributed LAN\n\t\t     client or server.\n\n\t\t     The following information is displayed for each proxy\n\t\t     connection:\n\n\t\t\t    Client/Server System ID This IP address identifies\n\t\t\t\t   the remote host.\n\n\t\t\t    Client IP Addr The IP address of the Client side\n\t\t\t\t   of the connection.\n\n\t\t\t    Server IP Addr The IP address of the Server side\n\t\t\t\t   of the connection.\n\n\t\t\t    Read Bytes/Sec Measured recent read performance of\n\t\t\t\t   the connection.\n\n\t\t\t    Write Bytes/Sec Measured recent write performance\n\t\t\t\t   of the connection.\n\n\t\t\t    FS Read Bytes/Sec Measured recent read performance\n\t\t\t\t   for all connections for this file system.\n\n\t\t\t    FS Write Bytes/Sec Measured recent write\n\t\t\t\t   performance for all connections for this\n\t\t\t\t   file system.\n\n\t\t\t    Queued I/O Outstanding I/O (backlog) for this\n\t\t\t\t   connection.\tThe backlog is meaningful for\n\t\t\t\t   client side connections only.\n\n\t      -X option\n\t\t     Dump statistics for each path in comma separated value\n\t\t     (CSV) format.
