The members\n       of a record can be variables or other records. However, a record can\n       not contain circular record, i.e. records that contain the same record\n       as a member.\n\n       This package was structured so that it is very similar to how Tk\n       objects work. Each record definition creates a record object that\n       encompasses that definition. Subsequently, that record object can\n       create instances of that record. These instances can then be\n       manipulated with the cget and configure methods.\n\n       The package only contains one top level command, but several sub\n       commands (see below). It also obeys the namespace in which the record\n       was define, hence the objects returned are fully qualified.\n\n       record define recordName recordMembers ?instanceName1 instanceName2\n       ...?   Defines a record. recordName is the name of the record, and is\n\t      also used as an object command. This object command is used to\n\t      create instances of the record definition. recordMembers are the\n\t      members of the record that make up the record definition. These\n\t      are variables and other record. If optional instanceName args\n\t      are given, then an instance is generated after the definition is\n\t      created for each instanceName.\n\n       record show record\n\t      Returns a list of records that have been defined.\n\n       record show instances recordName\n\t      Returns the instances that have been instantiated by recordName.\n\n       record show members recordName\n\t      Returns the members that are defined for record recordName. It\n\t      returns the same format as how the records were defined.\n\n       record show values instanceName\n\t      Returns a list of values that are set for the instance\n\t      instanceName. The output is a list of key/value pairs. If there\n\t      are nested records, then the values of the nested records will\n\t      itself be a list.\n\n       record exists record recordName\n\t      Tests for the existence of a record with the name recordName.\n\n       record exists instance instanceName\n\t      Tests for the existence of a instance with the name\n\t      instanceName.\n\n       record delete record recordName\n\t      Deletes recordName, and all instances of recordName. It will\n\t      return an error if the record does not exist.\n\n       record delete instance instanceName\n\t      Deletes instance with the name of instanceName. It will return\n\t      an error if the instance does not exist.\n\nRECORD MEMBERS\n       Record members can either be variables, or other records, However, the\n       same record can not be nested witin itself (circular). To define a\n       nested record, you need to specify the record keyword, along the with\n       name of the record, and the name of the instance of that nested record.\n       For example, it would look like this:\n\n\n       # this is the nested record\n       record define mynestedrecord {\n\t   nest1\n\t   nest2\n       }\n\n       # This is the main record\n       record define myrecord {\n\t   mem1\n\t   mem2\n\t   {record mynestedrecord mem3}\n       }\n\n\n       You can also assign default or initial values to the members of a\n       record, by enclosing the member entry in braces:"

If no default is given, then the value will be\n       the empty string.\n\n       Getting Values\n\n       To get a value of a member, there are several ways to do this.\n\n       [1]    To get a member value, then use the instance built-in cget\n\t      method:\n\n\t      instanceName cget -mem1\n\n       [2]    To get multiple member values, you can specify them all in one\n\t      command:\n\n\t      instanceName cget -mem1 -mem2\n\n       [3]    To get a list of the key/value of all of the members, there are\n\t      3 ways:\n\n\t      - instanceName cget\n\n\t      - instanceName configure\n\n\t      - instanceName\n\n       [4]    To get a value of a nested member, then use the dot notation:\n\n\t      instanceName cget -mem3.nest1\n\n       Setting Values\n\n       To set a value of a member, there are several ways to do this.\n\n       [1]    To set a member value, then use the instance built-in configure\n\t      method:\n\n\t      instanceName configure -mem1 val1\n\n       [2]    To set multiple member values, you can specify them all in one\n\t      command:\n\n\t      instanceName configure -mem1 va1 -mem2 val2\n\n       [3]    To set a value of a nested member, then use the dot notation:\n\n\t      instanceName configure -mem3.nest1 value\n\n       Alias access\n\n       In the original implementation, access was done by using dot notation\n       similar to how 'C' structures are accessed. However, there was a\n       concensus to make the interface more Tcl like, which made sense.\n       However, the original alias access still exists. It might prove to be\n       helpful to some.\n\n       Basically, for every member of every instance, an alias is created.\n       This alias is used to get and set values for that member. An example\n       will illustrate the point, using the above defined records:\n\n\n       # Create an instance first\n       % myrecord inst1\n       ::inst1\n       % # To get a member of an instance, just use the\n       % # alias (it behaves like a Tcl command):\n       % inst1.mem1\n       %\n       % # To set a member via the alias, just include\n       % # a value (optionally the equal sign - syntactic sugar)\n       % inst1.mem1 = 5\n       5\n       % inst1.mem1\n       5\n       % # For nested records, just continue with the\n       % # dot notation (note no equal sign)\n       % inst1.mem3.nest1 10\n       10\n       % inst1.mem3.nest1\n       10\n       % # just the instance by itself gives all\n       % # member/values pairs for that instance\n       % inst1\n       -mem1 5 -mem2 {} -mem3 {-nest1 10 -nest2 {}}\n       % # and to get all members within the nested record\n       % inst1.mem3\n       -nest1 10 -nest2 {}\n       %"

Once a instance is created, then it inherits the\n\t      members of the record definition, very similar to how objects\n\t      work. During instance generation, an object command for the\n\t      instance is created as well, using instanceName. This object\n\t      command is used to access the data members of the instance.\n\t      During the instantiation, values for that instance can be given,\n\t      but all values must be given, and be given in key/value pairs.\n\t      Nested records, need to be in list format.\n\n\t      Optionally, #auto can be used in place of instanceName. When\n\t      #auto is used, then a instance name will automatically be\n\t      generated, of the form recordName<integer>, where <integer> is a\n\t      unique integer (starting at 0) that is generated.\n\nINSTANCE COMMAND\n       The following subcommands and corresponding arguments are available to\n       any record instance command:\n\n       instanceName cget ?-member1 -member2 ...?\n\t      Each instance has the sub command cget associated with it. This\n\t      is very similar to how Tk widget's cget command works. It\n\t      queries the values of the member for that particular instance.\n\t      If no arguments are given, then a key/value list is returned.\n\n       instanceName configure ?-member1 value1 -member2 value2 ...?\n\t      Each instance has the sub command configure associated with it.\n\t      This is very similar to how Tk widget's configure command works.\n\t      It sets the values of the particular member for that particular\n\t      instance. If no arguments are given, then a key/value list is\n\t      returned.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Two examples are provided to give an good illustration on how to use\n       this package.\n\n       Example 1\n\n       Probably the most obvious example would be to hold contact information,\n       such as addresses, phone numbers, comments, etc. Since a person can\n       have multiple phone numbers, multiple email addresses, etc, we will use\n       nested records to define these. So, the first thing we do is define the\n       nested records:"
