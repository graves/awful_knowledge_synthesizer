This\n\t     flag is ignored and the process id is always logged.\n\n     -s      Log the message to standard error, as well as the system log.\n\n     -f file\n\t     Read the contents of the specified file into syslog.  This option\n\t     is ignored when a message is also specified.\n\n     -p pri  Enter the message with the specified priority.  The priority may\n\t     be specified numerically or as a facility.level pair.  For\n\t     example, “-p local3.info” logs the message(s) as informational\n\t     level in the local3 facility.  The default is “user.notice”.\n\n     -t tag  Mark every line in the log with the specified tag rather than the\n\t     default of current login name."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the logger command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the logger command to log a message with the priority ‘local3.info’ and a custom tag ‘myapp’, while also sending the message to standard error?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the logger command to log a message with the default priority and tag, but also include the process ID in the log entry?
