These calls will either\n\t     return results from the cache or go fetch live data and place\n\t     them in the cache.  By default if no specific query is requested\n\t     via -a then all results within that category will be returned."

An optional category can be supplied to\n\t     only see types of interest.  Dumping 'host' entries can only be\n\t     done by administrative users.\n\n     -configuration\n\t     Prints current configuration information, such as the search\n\t     policy from Directory Service and cache parameters.\n\n     -flushcache\n\t     Flushes the entire cache.\tThis should only be used in extreme\n\t     cases.  Validation information is used within the cache along\n\t     with other techniques to ensure the OS has valid information\n\t     available to it.\n\n     -statistics\n\t     Prints statistics from the cache including an overview and\n\t     detailed call statistics.\tSome calls are not cached but are\n\t     derived from other calls internally.  Cache hits and cache misses\n\t     may not always be equal to external calls.  For example\n\t     getaddrinfo is actually a combination of gethostbyname with other\n\t     calls internally to the cache to maximize cache hit rate."
