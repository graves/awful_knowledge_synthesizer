Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package provides a command implementing a parser generator taking\n       parsing expression grammars as input.\n\n       It is the implementation of method generate of pt, the Parser Tools\n       Application.\n\n       As such the intended audience of this document are people wishing to\n       modify and/or extend this part of pt's functionality. Users of pt on\n       the other hand are hereby refered to the applications' manpage, i.e.\n       Parser Tools Application.\n\n       It resides in the User Package Layer of Parser Tools.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_user_pkg\n\nAPI\n       ::pt::pgen inputformat text resultformat ?options...?\n\t      This command takes the parsing expression grammar in text (in\n\t      the format specified by inputformat), and returns the same\n\t      grammar in the format resultformat as the result of the command.\n\n\t      The two known input formats are peg and json.  Introductions to\n\t      them, including their formal specifications, can be found in the\n\t      PEG Language Tutorial and The JSON Grammar Exchange Format. The\n\t      packages used to parse these formats are\n\n\t      peg    pt::peg::from::peg\n\n\t      json   pt::peg::from::json\n\n       On the output side the known formats, and the packages used to generate\n       them are\n\n\t      c      pt::peg::to::cparam\n\n\t      container\n\t\t     pt::peg::to::container\n\n\t      critcl pt::peg::to::cparam + pt::cparam::configuration::critcl\n\n\t      json   pt::peg::to::json\n\n\t      oo     pt::peg::to::tclparam +\n\t\t     pt::tclparam::configuration::tcloo\n\n\t      peg    pt::peg::to::peg\n\n\t      snit   pt::peg::to::tclparam + pt::tclparam::configuration::snit\n       The options supported by each of these formats are documented with\n       their respective packages.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       In this section we are working a complete example, starting with a PEG\n       grammar and ending with running the parser generated from it over some\n       input, following the outline shown in the figure below:\n\n       IMAGE: flow\n\n       Our grammar, assumed to the stored in the file \"calculator.peg\" is\n\n       PEG calculator (Expression)\n\t   Digit      <- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;\n\t   Sign       <- '-' / '+'\t\t\t ;\n\t   Number     <- Sign? Digit+\t\t\t      ;\n\t   Expression <- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)\t;\n\t   MulOp      <- '*' / '/'\t\t\t ;\n\t   Factor     <- Term (AddOp Term)*\t\t      ;\n\t   AddOp      <- '+'/'-'\t\t\t ;\n\t   Term       <- Number \t\t    ;\n       END;\n\n       From this we create a snit-based parser using the script \"gen\"\n\n       package require Tcl 8.5\n       package require fileutil\n       package require pt::pgen\n\n       lassign $argv name\n       set grammar [fileutil::cat $name.peg]\n       set plass [pt::pgen\n\t\t     peg $gr  snit  -class $name      -file  $name.peg\t-name  $name]\n       fileutil::writeFile $name.tcl $pclass\n       exit 0\n\n       calling it like\n\ttclsh8.5 gen calculator\n       which leaves us with the parser package and class written to the file\n       \"calculator.tcl\".  Assuming that this package is then properly\n       installed in a place where Tcl can find it we can now use this class\n       via a script like\n\n\t   package require calculator\n\n\t   lassign $argv input\n\t   set channel [open $input r]\n\n\t   set parser [calculator]\n\t   set ast [$parser parse $channel]\n\t   $parser destroy\n\t   close $channel\n\n\t   ... now process the returned abstract syntax tree ...\n\n       where the abstract syntax tree stored in the variable will look like"

There are no callbacks during the parsing\n       process, i.e. no parsing actions, as most other parsers will have.\n\n       Going back to the last snippet of code, the execution of the parser for\n       some input, note how the parser instance follows the specified Parser\n       API.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
