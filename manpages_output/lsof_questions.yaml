    Manpage text:

    Instead of a formatted display, lsof will produce output that can be
           parsed by other programs.  See the -F, option description, and the
           OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for more information.

           In addition to producing a single output list, lsof will run in repeat
           mode.  In repeat mode it will produce output, delay, then repeat the
           output operation until stopped with an interrupt or quit signal.  See
           the +|-r [t[m<fmt>]] option description for more information.

    OPTIONS
           In the absence of any options, lsof lists all open files belonging to
           all active processes.

           If any list request option is specified, other list requests must be
           specifically requested - e.g., if -U is specified for the listing of
           UNIX socket files, NFS files won't be listed unless -N is also
           specified; or if a user list is specified with the -u option, UNIX
           domain socket files, belonging to users not in the list, won't be
           listed unless the -U option is also specified.

The exceptions are:\n\n       1) the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the -u\n\t  option;\n\n       2) the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the -p option;\n\n       3) the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the -g\n\t  option;\n\n       4) the `^' (negated) command, specified with the -c option;\n\n       5) the (`^') negated TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with\n\t  the -s [p:s] option.\n\n       Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or\n       ANDing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.\n\n       The -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example,\n       specifying -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX socket\n       files that belong to processes owned by user ``foo''."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lsof`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nCaution: the -a option causes all list selection options to be ANDed;\n       it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options\n       by placing it between them, even though its placement there is\n       acceptable.  Wherever -a is placed, it causes the ANDing of all\n       selection options.\n\n       Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors,\n       network addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names,\n       security contexts - are joined in a single ORed set and applied before\n       the result participates in ANDing.  Thus, for example, specifying\n       -i@aaa.bbb, -i@ccc.ddd, -a, and -ufff,ggg will select the listing of\n       files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg'' AND have network\n       connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.\n\n       Options may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g., the\n       option set ``-a -b -C'' may be stated as -abC.  However, since values\n       are optional following +|-f, -F, -g, -i, +|-L, -o, +|-r, -s, -S, -T, -x\n       and -z.\twhen you have no values for them be careful that the following\n       character isn't ambiguous.  For example, -Fn might represent the -F and\n       -n options, or it might represent the n field identifier character\n       following the -F option.  When ambiguity is possible, start a new\n       option with a `-' character - e.g., ``-F -n''.  If the next option is a\n       file name, follow the possibly ambiguous option with ``--'' - e.g.,\n       ``-F -- name''."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lsof`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nEither the `+' or the `-' prefix may be applied to a group of options.\n       Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., -i\n       - may be grouped under either prefix.  Thus, for example, ``+M -i'' may\n       be stated as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate\n       options.  Be careful of prefix grouping when one or more options in the\n       group does take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g.,\n       +|-M; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''.  When in doubt, use\n       separate options with appropriate prefixes.\n\n       -? -h\n\t    These two equivalent options select a usage (help) output list.\n\t    Lsof displays a shortened form of this output when it detects an\n\t    error in the options supplied to it, after it has displayed\n\t    messages explaining each error.  (Escape the `?' character as your\n\t    shell requires.)\n\n       -a   causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.\n\n       -A A is available on systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel code\n\t    is implemented via dynamic modules.  It allows the lsof user to\n\t    specify A as an alternate name list file where the kernel\n\t    addresses of the dynamic modules might be found.  See the lsof FAQ\n\t    (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more information about\n\t    dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they affect lsof.\n\n       -b   causes lsof to avoid kernel functions that might block - lstat(2),\n\t    readlink(2), and stat(2).\n\n\t    See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS sections\n\t    for information on using this option.\n\n       -c c selects the listing of files for processes executing the command\n\t    that begins with the characters of c.  Multiple commands may be\n\t    specified, using multiple -c options.  They are joined in a single\n\t    ORed set before participating in AND option selection.\n\n\t    If c begins with a `^', then the following characters specify a\n\t    command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)\n\n\t    If c begins and ends with a slash ('/'), the characters between\n\t    the slashes are interpreted as a regular expression.  Shell\n\t    meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted to\n\t    prevent their interpretation by the shell.\tThe closing slash may\n\t    be followed by these modifiers:\n\n\t\t b    the regular expression is a basic one.\n\t\t i    ignore the case of letters.\n\t\t x    the regular expression is an extended one\n\t\t      (default).\n\n\t    See the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more\n\t    information on basic and extended regular expressions.\n\n\t    The simple command specification is tested first.  If that test\n\t    fails, the command regular expression is applied.  If the simple\n\t    command test succeeds, the command regular expression test isn't\n\t    made.  This may result in ``no command found for regex:'' messages\n\t    when lsof's -V option is specified.\n\n       +c w defines the maximum number of initial characters of the name,\n\t    supplied by the UNIX dialect, of the UNIX command associated with\n\t    a process to be printed in the COMMAND column.  (The lsof default\n\t    is nine.)\n\n\t    Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply all command name\n\t    characters to lsof in the files and structures from which lsof\n\t    obtains command name.  Often dialects limit the number of\n\t    characters supplied in those sources.  For example, Linux 2.4.27\n\t    and Solaris 9 both limit command name length to 16 characters.\n\n\t    If w is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to lsof by the\n\t    UNIX dialect will be printed.\n\n\t    If w is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND'', it\n\t    will be raised to that length.\n\n       -C   disables the reporting of any path name components from the\n\t    kernel's name cache.  See the KERNEL NAME CACHE section for more\n\t    information.\n\n       +d s causes lsof to search for all open instances of directory s and\n\t    the files and directories it contains at its top level.  +d does\n\t    NOT descend the directory tree, rooted at s.  The +D D option may\n\t    be used to request a full-descent directory tree search, rooted at\n\t    directory D.\n\n\t    Processing of the +d option does not follow symbolic links within\n\t    s unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.\tNor does it\n\t    search for open files on file system mount points on\n\t    subdirectories of s unless the -x or -x  f option is also\n\t    specified.\n\n\t    Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to\n\t    searching for files that the user has permission to examine with\n\t    the system stat(2) function.\n\n       -d s specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or\n\t    include in the output listing.  The file descriptors are specified\n\t    in the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``cwd,1,3'', ``^6,^2''.\n\t    (There should be no spaces in the set.)\n\n\t    The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set begin with\n\t    `^'.  It is an inclusion list if no entry begins with `^'.\tMixed\n\t    lists are not permitted.\n\n\t    A file descriptor number range may be in the set as long as\n\t    neither member is empty, both members are numbers, and the ending\n\t    member is larger than the starting one - e.g., ``0-7'' or\n\t    ``3-10''.  Ranges may be specified for exclusion if they have the\n\t    `^' prefix - e.g., ``^0-7'' excludes all file descriptors 0\n\t    through 7.\n\n\t    Multiple file descriptor numbers are joined in a single ORed set\n\t    before participating in AND option selection.\n\n\t    When there are exclusion and inclusion members in the set, lsof\n\t    reports them as errors and exits with a non-zero return code.\n\n\t    See the description of File Descriptor (FD) output values in the\n\t    OUTPUT section for more information on file descriptor names.\n\n       +D D causes lsof to search for all open instances of directory D and\n\t    all the files and directories it contains to its complete depth.\n\n\t    Processing of the +D option does not follow symbolic links within\n\t    D unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.\tNor does it\n\t    search for open files on file system mount points on\n\t    subdirectories of D unless the -x or -x  f option is also\n\t    specified.\n\n\t    Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to\n\t    searching for files that the user has permission to examine with\n\t    the system stat(2) function.\n\n\t    Further note: lsof may process this option slowly and require a\n\t    large amount of dynamic memory to do it.  This is because it must\n\t    descend the entire directory tree, rooted at D, calling stat(2)\n\t    for each file and directory, building a list of all the files it\n\t    finds, and searching that list for a match with every open file.\n\t    When directory D is large, these steps can take a long time, so\n\t    use this option prudently.\n\n       -D D directs lsof's use of the device cache file.  The use of this\n\t    option is sometimes restricted.  See the DEVICE CACHE FILE section\n\t    and the sections that follow it for more information on this\n\t    option.\n\n\t    -D must be followed by a function letter; the function letter may\n\t    optionally be followed by a path name.  Lsof recognizes these\n\t    function letters:\n\n\t\t ? - report device cache file paths\n\t\t b - build the device cache file\n\t\t i - ignore the device cache file\n\t\t r - read the device cache file\n\t\t u - read and update the device cache file\n\n\t    The b, r, and u functions, accompanied by a path name, are\n\t    sometimes restricted.  When these functions are restricted, they\n\t    will not appear in the description of the -D option that\n\t    accompanies -h or -?  option output.  See the DEVICE CACHE FILE\n\t    section and the sections that follow it for more information on\n\t    these functions and when they're restricted.\n\n\t    The ?  function reports the read-only and write paths that lsof\n\t    can use for the device cache file, the names of any environment\n\t    variables whose values lsof will examine when forming the device\n\t    cache file path, and the format for the personal device cache file\n\t    path.  (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)\n\n\t    When available, the b, r, and u functions may be followed by the\n\t    device cache file's path.  The standard default is .lsof_hostname\n\t    in the home directory of the real user ID that executes lsof, but\n\t    this could have been changed when lsof was configured and\n\t    compiled.  (The output of the -h and -?  options show the current\n\t    default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.)\tThe suffix, hostname, is the\n\t    first component of the host's name returned by gethostname(2).\n\n\t    When available, the b function directs lsof to build a new device\n\t    cache file at the default or specified path.\n\n\t    The i function directs lsof to ignore the default device cache\n\t    file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls to\n\t    the kernel.\n\n\t    The r function directs lsof to read the device cache at the\n\t    default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new\n\t    device cache file when none exists or the existing one is\n\t    improperly structured.  The r function, when specified without a\n\t    path name, prevents lsof from updating an incorrect or outdated\n\t    device cache file, or creating a new one in its place.  The r\n\t    function is always available when it is specified without a path\n\t    name argument; it may be restricted by the permissions of the lsof\n\t    process.\n\n\t    When available, the u function directs lsof to read the device\n\t    cache file at the default or specified path, if possible, and to\n\t    rebuild it, if necessary.  This is the default device cache file\n\t    function when no -D option has been specified.\n\n       +|-e s\n\t    exempts the file system whose path name is s from being subjected\n\t    to kernel function calls that might block.\tThe +e option exempts\n\t    stat(2), lstat(2) and most readlink(2) kernel function calls.  The\n\t    -e option exempts only stat(2) and lstat(2) kernel function calls.\n\t    Multiple file systems may be specified with separate +|-e\n\t    specifications and each may have readlink(2) calls exempted or\n\t    not.\n\n\t    This option is currently implemented only for Linux.\n\n\t    CAUTION: this option can easily be mis-applied to other than the\n\t    file system of interest, because it uses path name rather than the\n\t    more reliable device and inode numbers.  (Device and inode numbers\n\t    are acquired via the potentially blocking stat(2) kernel call and\n\t    are thus not available, but see the +|-m m option as a possible\n\t    alternative way to supply device numbers.)\tUse this option with\n\t    great care and fully specify the path name of the file system to\n\t    be exempted.\n\n\t    When open files on exempted file systems are reported, it may not\n\t    be possible to obtain all their information.  Therefore, some\n\t    information columns will be blank, the characters ``UNKN'' preface\n\t    the values in the TYPE column, and the applicable exemption option\n\t    is added in parentheses to the end of the NAME column.  (Some\n\t    device number information might be made available via the +|-m m\n\t    option.)\n\n       +|-E +E specifies that Linux pipe, Linux UNIX socket and Linux\n\t    pseudoterminal files should be displayed with endpoint information\n\t    and the files of the endpoints should also be displayed.  Note:\n\t    UNIX socket file endpoint information is only available when the\n\t    compile flags line of -v output contains HASUXSOCKEPT, and\n\t    psudoterminal endpoint information is only available when the\n\t    compile flags line contains HASPTYEPT.\n\n\t    Pipe endpoint information is displayed in the NAME column in the\n\t    form ``PID,cmd,FDmode'', where PID is the endpoint process ID; cmd\n\t    is the endpoint process command; FD is the endpoint file's\n\t    descriptor; and mode is the endpoint file's access mode.\n\n\t    Pseudoterminal endpoint information is displayed in the NAME\n\t    column as ``->/dev/ptsmin PID,cmd,FDmode'' or ``PID,cmd,FDmode''.\n\t    The first form is for a primary device; the second, for a replica\n\t    device.  min is a replica device's minor device number; and PID,\n\t    cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe endpoint information.\n\t    Note: psudoterminal endpoint information is only available when\n\t    the compile flags line of -V output contains HASPTYEPT.\n\n\t    UNIX socket file endpoint information is displayed in the NAME\n\t    column in the form\n\t    ``type=TYPE ->INO=INODE PID,cmd,FDmode'', where TYPE is the socket\n\t    type; INODE is the i-node number of the connected socket; and PID,\n\t    cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe endpoint information.\n\t    Note: UNIX socket file endpoint information is available only when\n\t    the compile flags line of -v output contains HASUXSOCKEPT.\n\n\t    Multiple occurrences of this information can appear in a file's\n\t    NAME column.\n\n\t    -E specfies that Linux pipe and Linux UNIX socket files should be\n\t    displayed with endpoint information, but not the files of the\n\t    endpoints.\n\n       +|-f [cfgGn]\n\t    f by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be\n\t    interpreted.  When followed by c, f, g, G, or n in any combination\n\t    it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure information\n\t    is to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').\n\n\t    Normally a path name argument is taken to be a file system name if\n\t    it matches a mounted-on directory name reported by mount(8), or if\n\t    it represents a block device, named in the mount output and\n\t    associated with a mounted directory name.  When +f is specified,\n\t    all path name arguments will be taken to be file system names, and\n\t    lsof will complain if any are not.\tThis can be useful, for\n\t    example, when the file system name (mounted-on device) isn't a\n\t    block device.  This happens for some CD-ROM file systems.\n\n\t    When -f is specified by itself, all path name arguments will be\n\t    taken to be simple files.  Thus, for example, the ``-f -- /''\n\t    arguments direct lsof to search for open files with a `/' path\n\t    name, not all open files in the `/' (root) file system.\n\n\t    Be careful to make sure +f and -f are properly terminated and\n\t    aren't followed by a character (e.g., of the file or file system\n\t    name) that might be taken as a parameter.  For example, use ``--''\n\t    after +f and -f as in these examples.\n\n\t\t $ lsof +f -- /file/system/name\n\t\t $ lsof -f -- /file/name\n\n\t    The listing of information from kernel file structures, requested\n\t    with the +f [cfgGn] option form, is normally inhibited, and is not\n\t    available in whole or part for some dialects - e.g., /proc-based\n\t    Linux kernels below 2.6.22.

           Creation and use of a user-readable and user-writable device cache file
           is controlled by the compile-time HASDCACHE option.  See the DEVICE
           CACHE FILE section and the sections that follow it for details on how
           its path is formed.  For security considerations it is important to
           note that in the default lsof distribution, if the real user ID under
           which lsof is executed is root, the device cache file will be written
           in root's home directory - e.g., / or /root.  When HASDCACHE is not

           defined in the dialect's machine.h header file, and when a suitable
           language locale has been defined in the appropriate environment
           variable for the lsof process.  Wide characters are printable under

           HASWIDECHAR and a suitable language locale aren't defined, or if

    Lsof may add two parenthetical notes to the NAME column for open
           Solaris 10 files: ``(?)'' if lsof considers the path name of
           questionable accuracy; and ``(deleted)'' if the -X option has been
           specified and lsof detects the open file's path name has been deleted.
           Consult the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more
           information on these NAME column additions.

    LOCKS
           Lsof can't adequately report the wide variety of UNIX dialect file
           locks in a single character.  What it reports in a single character is
           a compromise between the information it finds in the kernel and the
           limitations of the reporting format.

           Moreover, when a process holds several byte level locks on a file, lsof
           only reports the status of the first lock it encounters.  If it is a
           byte level lock, then the lock character will be reported in lower case
           - i.e., `r', `w', or `x' - rather than the upper case equivalent
           reported for a full file lock.

    Manpage text:

    Generally lsof can only report on locks held by local processes on
           local files.  When a local process sets a lock on a remotely mounted
           (e.g., NFS) file, the remote server host usually records the lock
           state.  One exception is Solaris - at some patch levels of 2.3, and in
           all versions above 2.4, the Solaris kernel records information on
           remote locks in local structures.

           Lsof has trouble reporting locks for some UNIX dialects.  Consult the
           BUGS section of this manual page or the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives
           its location.)  for more information.

    OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS
           When the -F option is specified, lsof produces output that is suitable
           for processing by another program - e.g, an awk or Perl script, or a C
           program.

           Each unit of information is output in a field that is identified with a
           leading character and terminated by a NL (012) (or a NUL (000) if the 0
           (zero) field identifier character is specified.)  The data of the field
           follows immediately after the field identification character and
           extends to the field terminator.

    Manpage text:

    It is possible to think of field output as process and file sets.  A
           process set begins with a field whose identifier is `p' (for process
           IDentifier (PID)).  It extends to the beginning of the next PID field
           or the beginning of the first file set of the process, whichever comes
           first.  Included in the process set are fields that identify the
           command, the process group IDentification (PGID) number, the task
           (thread) ID (TID), and the user ID (UID) number or login name.

           A file set begins with a field whose identifier is `f' (for file
           descriptor).  It is followed by lines that describe the file's access
           mode, lock state, type, device, size, offset, inode, protocol, name and
           stream module names.  It extends to the beginning of the next file or
           process set, whichever comes first.

           When the NUL (000) field terminator has been selected with the 0 (zero)
           field identifier character, lsof ends each process and file set with a
           NL (012) character.

    Manpage text:

    Lsof always produces one field, the PID (`p') field.  All other fields
           may be declared optionally in the field identifier character list that
           follows the -F option.  When a field selection character identifies an
           item lsof does not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with -R -
           specification of the field character - e.g., ``-FR'' - also selects the
           listing of the item.

           It is entirely possible to select a set of fields that cannot easily be
           parsed - e.g., if the field descriptor field is not selected, it may be
           difficult to identify file sets.  To help you avoid this difficulty,
           lsof supports the -F option; it selects the output of all fields with
           NL terminators (the -F0 option pair selects the output of all fields
           with NUL terminators).  For compatibility reasons neither -F nor -F0
           select the raw device field.

    You can get on-line help information on these characters and their

           character as your shell requires.)  Additional information on field
           content can be found in the OUTPUT section.

           As an example, ``-F pcfn'' will select the process ID (`p'), command
           name (`c'), file descriptor (`f') and file name (`n') fields with an NL
           field terminator character; ``-F pcfn0'' selects the same output with a
           NUL (000) field terminator character.

           Lsof doesn't produce all fields for every process or file set, only
           those that are available.  Some fields are mutually exclusive: file
           device characters and file major/minor device numbers; file inode
           number and protocol name; file name and stream identification; file
           size and offset.  One or the other member of these mutually exclusive
           sets will appear in field output, but not both.

           Normally lsof ends each field with a NL (012) character.  The 0 (zero)
           field identifier character may be specified to change the field
           terminator character to a NUL (000).  A NUL terminator may be easier to

           mechanisms may not easily cope with the range of characters in the

    Three aids to producing programs that can process lsof field output are
           included in the lsof distribution.  The first is a C header file,
           lsof_fields.h, that contains symbols for the field identification
           characters, indexes for storing them in a table, and explanation
           strings that may be compiled into programs.  Lsof uses this header
           file.

           The second aid is a set of sample scripts that process field output,
           written in awk, Perl 4, and Perl 5.  They're located in the scripts
           subdirectory of the lsof distribution.

           The third aid is the C library used for the lsof test suite.  The test
           suite is written in C and uses field output to validate the correct
           operation of lsof.  The library can be found in the tests/LTlib.c file
           of the lsof distribution.  The library uses the first aid, the
           lsof_fields.h header file.

    BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS
           Lsof can be blocked by some kernel functions that it uses - lstat(2),
           readlink(2), and stat(2).  These functions are stalled in the kernel,
           for example, when the hosts where mounted NFS file systems reside
           become inaccessible.

Some cautions apply.\n\n       First, using this option usually requires that your system supply\n       alternate device numbers in place of the device numbers that lsof would\n       normally obtain with the lstat(2) and stat(2) kernel functions.\tSee\n       the ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS section for more information on alternate\n       device numbers.\n\n       Second, you can't specify names for lsof to locate unless they're file\n       system names.  This is because lsof needs to know the device and inode\n       numbers of files listed with names in the lsof options, and the -b\n       option prevents lsof from obtaining them.  Moreover, since lsof only\n       has device numbers for the file systems that have alternates, its\n       ability to locate files on file systems depends completely on the\n       availability and accuracy of the alternates.

    Third, if the names of your file system directories that lsof obtains
           from your system's mount table are symbolic links, lsof won't be able
           to resolve the links.  This is because the -b option causes lsof to
           avoid the kernel readlink(2) function it uses to resolve symbolic
           links.

           Finally, using the -b option causes lsof to issue warning messages when
           it needs to use the kernel functions that the -b option directs it to
           avoid.  You can suppress these messages by specifying the -w option,
           but if you do, you won't see the alternate device numbers reported in
           the warning messages.

    ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS
           On some dialects, when lsof has to break a block because it can't get
           information about a mounted file system via the lstat(2) and stat(2)
           kernel functions, or because you specified the -b option, lsof can

           computation and verification of a sixteen bit Cyclic Redundancy Check
           (CRC) sum on the file's contents.  When lsof senses something wrong

           cache file and create a new copy, but only to a path that the process
           can legitimately write.

    Manpage text:

    When a new device is added to the system, the device cache file may
           need to be recreated.  Since lsof compares the mtime of the device
           cache file with the mtime and ctime of the /dev (or /devices)
           directory, it usually detects that a new device has been added; in that
           case lsof issues a warning message and attempts to rebuild the device
           cache file.

           Whenever lsof writes a device cache file, it sets its ownership to the
           real UID of the executing process, and its permission modes to 0600,
           this restricting its reading and writing to the file's owner.

    LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE ACCESS
           Two permissions of the lsof executable affect its ability to access
           device cache files.  The permissions are set by the local system
           administrator when lsof is installed.

           The first and rarer permission is setuid-root.  It comes into effect
           when lsof is executed; its effective UID is then root, while its real

    DEVICE CACHE PATH FROM AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
           Lsof's second choice for the device cache file is the contents of the
           LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable.  It avoids this choice if the lsof
           process is setuid-root, or the real UID of the process is root.

           A further restriction applies to a device cache file path taken from
           the LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable: lsof will not write a device
           cache file to the path if the lsof process doesn't surrender its setgid
           permission.  (See the LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE
           ACCESS section for information on implementations that don't surrender
           their setgid permission.)

           The local system administrator can disable the use of the LSOFDEVCACHE
           environment variable or change its name when building lsof.  Consult
           the output of -D?  for the environment variable's name.

    SYSTEM-WIDE DEVICE CACHE PATH
           The local system administrator may choose to have a system-wide device
           cache file when building lsof.  That file will generally be constructed
           by a special system administration procedure when the system is booted
           or when the contents of /dev or /devices) changes.  If defined, it is
           lsof's third device cache file path choice.

    Manpage text:

    You can tell that a system-wide device cache file is in effect for your
           local installation by examining the lsof help option output - i.e., the
           output from the -h or -?  option.

           Lsof will never write to the system-wide device cache file path by
           default.  It must be explicitly named with a -D function in a
           root-owned procedure.  Once the file has been written, the procedure
           must change its permission modes to 0644 (owner-read and owner-write,
           group-read, and other-read).

    PERSONAL DEVICE CACHE PATH (DEFAULT)
           The default device cache file path of the lsof distribution is one
           recorded in the home directory of the real UID that executes lsof.
           Added to the home directory is a second path component of the form
           .lsof_hostname.

           This is lsof's fourth device cache file path choice, and is usually the
           default.  If a system-wide device cache file path was defined when lsof
           was built, this fourth choice will be applied when lsof can't find the
           system-wide device cache file.  This is the only time lsof uses two
           paths when reading the device cache file.

    The hostname part of the second component is the base name of the
           executing host, as returned by gethostname(2).  The base name is
           defined to be the characters preceding the first `.' in the
           gethostname(2) output, or all the gethostname(2) output if it contains
           no `.'.

           The device cache file belongs to the user ID and is readable and
           writable by the user ID alone - i.e., its modes are 0600.  Each
           distinct real user ID on a given host that executes lsof has a distinct
           device cache file.  The hostname part of the path distinguishes device
           cache files in an NFS-mounted home directory into which device cache
           files are written from several different hosts.

           The personal device cache file path formed by this method represents a
           device cache file that lsof will attempt to read, and will attempt to
           write should it not exist or should its contents be incorrect or
           outdated.

    The display of the destination address of a raw socket (e.g., for ping)
           depends on the UNIX operating system.  Some dialects store the
           destination address in the raw socket's protocol control block, some do
           not.

           Lsof can't always represent Solaris device numbers in the same way that
           ls(1) does.  For example, the major and minor device numbers that the
           lstat(2) and stat(2) functions report for the directory on which CD-ROM
           files are mounted (typically /cdrom) are not the same as the ones that
           it reports for the device on which CD-ROM files are mounted (typically
           /dev/sr0).  (Lsof reports the directory numbers.)

           The support for /proc file systems is available only for BSD and Tru64
           UNIX dialects, Linux, and dialects derived from SYSV R4 - e.g.,
           FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, UnixWare.

    Manpage text:

    Some pre-compiled Lsof executables are available on
           lsof.itap.purdue.edu, but their use is discouraged - it's better that
           you build your own from the sources.  If you feel you must use a
           pre-compiled executable, please read the cautions that appear in the
           README files of the pub/tools/unix/lsof/binaries subdirectories and in
           the 00* files of the distribution.

           More information on the lsof distribution can be found in its
           README.lsof_<version> file.  If you intend to get the lsof distribution
           and build it, please read README.lsof_<version> and the other 00* files
           of the distribution before sending questions to the author.
