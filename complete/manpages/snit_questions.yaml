It's unique among Tcl\n       object systems in that it's based not on inheritance but on delegation.\n       Object systems based on inheritance only allow you to inherit from\n       classes defined using the same system, which is limiting.  In Tcl, an\n       object is anything that acts like an object; it shouldn't matter how\n       the object was implemented.  Snit is intended to help you build\n       applications out of the materials at hand; thus, Snit is designed to be\n       able to incorporate and build on any object, whether it's a hand-coded\n       object, a Tk widget, an Incr Tcl object, a BWidget or almost anything\n       else.\n\n       This man page is intended to be a reference only; see the accompanying\n       snitfaq for a gentler, more tutorial introduction to Snit concepts.\n\nSNIT VERSIONS\n       This man page covers both Snit 2.2 and Snit 1.3.  The primary\n       difference between the two versions is simply that Snit 2.2 contains\n       speed optimizations based on new features of Tcl 8.5; Snit 1.3 supports\n       all of Tcl 8.3, 8.4 and Tcl 8.5.  There are a few minor\n       inconsistencies; they are flagged in the body of the man page with the\n       label \"Snit 1.x Incompatibility\"; they are also discussed in the\n       snitfaq.\n\nREFERENCE\n   TYPE AND WIDGET DEFINITIONS\n       Snit provides the following commands for defining new types:\n\n       snit::type name definition\n\t      Defines a new abstract data type called name.  If name is not a\n\t      fully qualified command name, it is assumed to be a name in the\n\t      namespace in which the snit::type command was called (usually\n\t      the global namespace).  It returns the fully qualified name of\n\t      the new type.\n\n\t      The type name is then a command that is used to create objects\n\t      of the new type, along with other activities.\n\n\t      The snit::type definition block is a script that may contain the\n\t      following definitions:\n\n\t      typevariable name ?-array? ?value?\n\t\t     Defines a type variable with the specified name, and\n\t\t     optionally the specified value.  Type variables are\n\t\t     shared by all instances of the type.  If the -array\n\t\t     option is included, then value should be a dictionary; it\n\t\t     will be assigned to the variable using array set.\n\n\t      typemethod name arglist body\n\t\t     Defines a type method, a subcommand of the new type\n\t\t     command, with the specified name, argument list, and\n\t\t     body.  The arglist is a normal Tcl argument list and may\n\t\t     contain default arguments and the args argument; however,\n\t\t     it may not contain the argument names type, self, selfns,\n\t\t     or win.\n\n\t\t     The variable type is automatically defined in the body to\n\t\t     the type's fully-qualified name.  In addition, type\n\t\t     variables are automatically visible in the body of every\n\t\t     type method.\n\n\t\t     If the name consists of two or more tokens, Snit handles\n\t\t     it specially:\n\t\t\t typemethod {a b} {arg} { puts \"Got $arg\" }\n\n\t\t     This statement implicitly defines a type method called a\n\t\t     which has a subcommand b.\tb is called like this:\n\t\t\t $type a b \"Hello, world!\"\n\n\t\t     a may have any number of subcommands.  This makes it\n\t\t     possible to define a hierarchical command structure; see\n\t\t     method, below, for more examples.\n\n\t\t     Type methods can call commands from the namespace in\n\t\t     which the type is defined without importing them, e.g.,\n\t\t     if the type name is ::parentns::typename, then the type's\n\t\t     type methods can call ::parentns::someproc just as\n\t\t     someproc.\tSnit 1.x Incompatibility: This does not work\n\t\t     in Snit 1.x, as it depends on namespace path, a new\n\t\t     command in Tcl 8.5.\n\n\t\t     Snit 1.x Incompatibility: In Snit 1.x, the following\n\t\t     following two calls to this type method are equivalent:\n\t\t\t $type a b \"Hello, world!\"\n\t\t\t $type {a b} \"Hello, world!\"\n\n\t\t     In Snit 2.2, the second form is invalid.\n\n\t      typeconstructor body\n\t\t     The type constructor's body is executed once when the\n\t\t     type is first defined; it is typically used to initialize\n\t\t     array-valued type variables and to add entries to The Tk\n\t\t     Option Database.\n\n\t\t     The variable type is automatically defined in the body,\n\t\t     and contains the type's fully-qualified name.  In\n\t\t     addition, type variables are automatically visible in the\n\t\t     body of the type constructor.\n\n\t\t     A type may define at most one type constructor.\n\n\t\t     The type constructor can call commands from the namespace\n\t\t     in which the type is defined without importing them,\n\t\t     e.g., if the type name is ::parentns::typename, then the\n\t\t     type constructor can call ::parentns::someproc just as\n\t\t     someproc.\tSnit 1.x Incompatibility: This does not work\n\t\t     in Snit 1.x, as it depends on namespace path, a new\n\t\t     command in Tcl 8.5.\n\n\t      variable name ?-array? ?value?\n\t\t     Defines an instance variable, a private variable\n\t\t     associated with each instance of this type, and\n\t\t     optionally its initial value.  If the -array option is\n\t\t     included, then value should be a dictionary; it will be\n\t\t     assigned to the variable using array set.\n\n\t      method name arglist body\n\t\t     Defines an instance method, a subcommand of each instance\n\t\t     of this type, with the specified name, argument list and\n\t\t     body.  The arglist is a normal Tcl argument list and may\n\t\t     contain default arguments and the args argument.\n\n\t\t     The method is implicitly passed the following arguments\n\t\t     as well: type, which contains the fully-qualified type\n\t\t     name; self, which contains the current instance command\n\t\t     name; selfns, which contains the name of the instance's\n\t\t     private namespace; and win, which contains the original\n\t\t     instance name.  Consequently, the arglist may not contain\n\t\t     the argument names type, self, selfns, or win.\n\n\t\t     An instance method defined in this way is said to be\n\t\t     locally defined.\n\n\t\t     Type and instance variables are automatically visible in\n\t\t     all instance methods.  If the type has locally defined\n\t\t     options, the options array is also visible.\n\n\t\t     If the name consists of two or more tokens, Snit handles\n\t\t     it specially:\n\t\t\t method {a b} {} { ... }\n\n\t\t     This statement implicitly defines a method called a which\n\t\t     has a subcommand b.  b is called like this:\n\t\t\t $self a b \"Hello, world!\"\n\n\t\t     a may have any number of subcommands.  This makes it\n\t\t     possible to define a hierarchical command structure:\n\t\t     % snit::type dog {\n\t\t\t method {tail wag}   {} {return \"Wag, wag\"}\n\t\t\t method {tail droop} {} {return \"Droop, droop\"}\n\t\t     }\n\t\t     ::dog\n\t\t     % dog spot\n\t\t     ::spot\n\t\t     % spot tail wag\n\t\t     Wag, wag\n\t\t     % spot tail droop\n\t\t     Droop, droop\n\t\t     %\n\n\t\t     What we've done is implicitly defined a \"tail\" method\n\t\t     with subcommands \"wag\" and \"droop\".  Consequently, it's\n\t\t     an error to define \"tail\" explicitly.\n\n\t\t     Methods can call commands from the namespace in which the\n\t\t     type is defined without importing them, e.g., if the type\n\t\t     name is ::parentns::typename, then the type's methods can\n\t\t     call ::parentns::someproc just as someproc.  Snit 1.x\n\t\t     Incompatibility: This does not work in Snit 1.x, as it\n\t\t     depends on namespace path, a new command in Tcl 8.5.\n\n\t\t     Snit 1.x Incompatibility: In Snit 1.x, the following\n\t\t     following two calls to this method are equivalent:\n\t\t\t $self a b \"Hello, world!\"\n\t\t\t $self {a b} \"Hello, world!\"\n\n\t\t     In Snit 2.2, the second form is invalid.\n\n\t      option namespec ?defaultValue?\n\n\t      option namespec ?options...?\n\t\t     Defines an option for instances of this type, and\n\t\t     optionally gives it an initial value.  The initial value\n\t\t     defaults to the empty string if no defaultValue is\n\t\t     specified.\n\n\t\t     An option defined in this way is said to be locally\n\t\t     defined.\n\n\t\t     The namespec is a list defining the option's name,\n\t\t     resource name, and class name, e.g.:\n\t\t\t option {-font font Font} {Courier 12}\n\n\t\t     The option name must begin with a hyphen, and must not\n\t\t     contain any upper case letters. The resource name and\n\t\t     class name are optional; if not specified, the resource\n\t\t     name defaults to the option name, minus the hyphen, and\n\t\t     the class name defaults to the resource name with the\n\t\t     first letter capitalized.\tThus, the following statement\n\t\t     is equivalent to the previous example:\n\t\t\t option -font {Courier 12}\n\n\t\t     See The Tk Option Database for more information about\n\t\t     resource and class names.\n\n\t\t     Options are normally set and retrieved using the standard\n\t\t     instance methods configure and cget; within instance code\n\t\t     (method bodies, etc.), option values are available\n\t\t     through the options array:\n\t\t\t set myfont $options(-font)\n\n\t\t     If the type defines any option handlers (e.g.,\n\t\t     -configuremethod), then it should probably use configure\n\t\t     and cget to access its options to avoid subtle errors.\n\n\t\t     The option statement may include the following options:\n\n\t\t     -default defvalue\n\t\t\t    Defines the option's default value; the option's\n\t\t\t    default value will be \"\" otherwise.\n\n\t\t     -readonly flag\n\t\t\t    The flag can be any Boolean value recognized by\n\t\t\t    Tcl.  If flag is true, then the option is read-\n\t\t\t    only--it can only be set using configure or\n\t\t\t    configurelist at creation time, i.e., in the\n\t\t\t    type's constructor.\n\n\t\t     -type type\n\t\t\t    Every locally-defined option may define its\n\t\t\t    validation type, which may be either the name of a\n\t\t\t    validation type or a specification for a\n\t\t\t    validation subtype\n\n\t\t\t    For example, an option may declare that its value\n\t\t\t    must be an integer by specifying snit::integer as\n\t\t\t    its validation type:\n\t\t\t\toption -number -type snit::integer\n\n\t\t\t    It may also declare that its value is an integer\n\t\t\t    between 1 and 10 by specifying a validation\n\t\t\t    subtype:\n\t\t\t\toption -number -type {snit::integer -min 1 -max 10}\n\n\t\t\t    If a validation type or subtype is defined for an\n\t\t\t    option, then it will be used to validate the\n\t\t\t    option's value whenever it is changed by the\n\t\t\t    object's configure or configurelist methods.  In\n\t\t\t    addition, all such options will have their values\n\t\t\t    validated automatically immediately after the\n\t\t\t    constructor executes.\n\n\t\t\t    Snit defines a family of validation types and\n\t\t\t    subtypes, and it's quite simple to define new\n\t\t\t    ones.  See Validation Types for the complete list,\n\t\t\t    and Defining Validation Types for an explanation\n\t\t\t    of how to define your own.\n\n\t\t     -cgetmethod methodName\n\t\t\t    Every locally-defined option may define a\n\t\t\t    -cgetmethod; it is called when the option's value\n\t\t\t    is retrieved using the cget method.  Whatever the\n\t\t\t    method's body returns will be the return value of\n\t\t\t    the call to cget.\n\n\t\t\t    The named method must take one argument, the\n\t\t\t    option name.  For example, this code is equivalent\n\t\t\t    to (though slower than) Snit's default handling of\n\t\t\t    cget:\n\t\t\t\toption -font -cgetmethod GetOption\n\t\t\t\tmethod GetOption {option} {\n\t\t\t\t    return $options($option)\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t    Note that it's possible for any number of options\n\t\t\t    to share a -cgetmethod.\n\n\t\t     -configuremethod methodName\n\t\t\t    Every locally-defined option may define a\n\t\t\t    -configuremethod; it is called when the option's\n\t\t\t    value is set using the configure or configurelist\n\t\t\t    methods.  It is the named method's responsibility\n\t\t\t    to save the option's value; in other words, the\n\t\t\t    value will not be saved to the options() array\n\t\t\t    unless the method saves it there.\n\n\t\t\t    The named method must take two arguments, the\n\t\t\t    option name and its new value.  For example, this\n\t\t\t    code is equivalent to (though slower than) Snit's\n\t\t\t    default handling of configure:\n\t\t\t\toption -font -configuremethod SetOption\n\t\t\t\tmethod SetOption {option value} {\n\t\t\t\t    set options($option) $value\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t    Note that it's possible for any number of options\n\t\t\t    to share a single -configuremethod.\n\n\t\t     -validatemethod methodName\n\t\t\t    Every locally-defined option may define a\n\t\t\t    -validatemethod; it is called when the option's\n\t\t\t    value is set using the configure or configurelist\n\t\t\t    methods, just before the -configuremethod (if\n\t\t\t    any).  It is the named method's responsibility to\n\t\t\t    validate the option's new value, and to throw an\n\t\t\t    error if the value is invalid.\n\n\t\t\t    The named method must take two arguments, the\n\t\t\t    option name and its new value.  For example, this\n\t\t\t    code verifies that -flag's value is a valid\n\t\t\t    Boolean value:\n\t\t\t\toption -font -validatemethod CheckBoolean\n\t\t\t\tmethod CheckBoolean {option value} {\n\t\t\t\t    if {![string is boolean -strict $value]} {\n\t\t\t\t\terror \"option $option must have a boolean value.\"\n\t\t\t\t    }\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t    Note that it's possible for any number of options\n\t\t\t    to share a single -validatemethod.\n\n\t      constructor arglist body\n\t\t     The constructor definition specifies a body of code to be\n\t\t     executed when a new instance is created.  The arglist is\n\t\t     a normal Tcl argument list and may contain default\n\t\t     arguments and the args argument.\n\n\t\t     As with methods, the arguments type, self, selfns, and\n\t\t     win are defined implicitly, and all type and instance\n\t\t     variables are automatically visible in its body.\n\n\t\t     If the definition doesn't explicitly define the\n\t\t     constructor, Snit defines one implicitly.\tIf the type\n\t\t     declares at least one option (whether locally or by\n\t\t     delegation), the default constructor will be defined as\n\t\t     follows:\n\t\t\t constructor {args} {\n\t\t\t     $self configurelist $args\n\t\t\t }\n\n\t\t     For standard Tk widget behavior, the argument list should\n\t\t     be the single name args, as shown.\n\n\t\t     If the definition defines neither a constructor nor any\n\t\t     options, the default constructor is defined as follows:\n\t\t\t constructor {} {}\n\n\t\t     As with methods, the constructor can call commands from\n\t\t     the namespace in which the type is defined without\n\t\t     importing them, e.g., if the type name is\n\t\t     ::parentns::typename, then the constructor can call\n\t\t     ::parentns::someproc just as someproc.

The original command is\n\t      again accessible in the instance variable hull.\n\n\t      Note that in general it is not possible to change the widget\n\t      class of a snit::widgetadaptor's hull widget.\n\n\t      See The Tk Option Database for information on how\n\t      snit::widgetadaptors interact with the option database.\n\n       snit::typemethod type name arglist body\n\t      Defines a new type method (or redefines an existing type method)\n\t      for a previously existing type.\n\n       snit::method type name arglist body\n\t      Defines a new instance method (or redefines an existing instance\n\t      method) for a previously existing type.  Note that delegated\n\t      instance methods can't be redefined.\n\n       snit::macro name arglist body\n\t      Defines a Snit macro with the specified name, arglist, and body.\n\t      Macros are used to define new type and widget definition\n\t      statements in terms of the statements defined in this man page.\n\n\t      A macro is simply a Tcl proc that is defined in the slave\n\t      interpreter used to compile type and widget definitions.\tThus,\n\t      macros have access to all of the type and widget definition\n\t      statements.  See Macros and Meta-programming for more details.\n\n\t      The macro name cannot be the same as any standard Tcl command,\n\t      or any Snit type or widget definition statement, e.g., you can't\n\t      redefine the method or delegate statements, or the standard set,\n\t      list, or string commands.\n\n       snit::compile which type body\n\t      Snit defines a type, widget, or widgetadaptor by \"compiling\" the\n\t      definition into a Tcl script; this script is then evaluated in\n\t      the Tcl interpreter, which actually defines the new type.\n\n\t      This command exposes the \"compiler\".  Given a definition body\n\t      for the named type, where which is type, widget, or\n\t      widgetadaptor, snit::compile returns a list of two elements.\n\t      The first element is the fully qualified type name; the second\n\t      element is the definition script.\n\n\t      snit::compile is useful when additional processing must be done\n\t      on the Snit-generated code--if it must be instrumented, for\n\t      example, or run through the TclDevKit compiler.  In addition,\n\t      the returned script could be saved in a \".tcl\" file and used to\n\t      define the type as part of an application or library, thus\n\t      saving the compilation overhead at application start-up.\tNote\n\t      that the same version of Snit must be used at run-time as at\n\t      compile-time.\n\n   THE TYPE COMMAND\n       A type or widget definition creates a type command, which is used to\n       create instances of the type.  The type command has this form:\n\n       $type typemethod args...\n\t      The typemethod can be any of the Standard Type Methods (e.g.,\n\t      create), or any type method defined in the type definition.  The\n\t      subsequent args depend on the specific typemethod chosen.\n\n\t      The type command is most often used to create new instances of\n\t      the type; hence, the create method is assumed if the first\n\t      argument to the type command doesn't name a valid type method,\n\t      unless the type definition includes delegate typemethod * or the\n\t      -hasinstances pragma is set to false.\n\n\t      Furthermore, if the -hastypemethods pragma is false, then Snit\n\t      type commands can be called with no arguments at all; in this\n\t      case, the type command creates an instance with an automatically\n\t      generated name.  In other words, provided that the\n\t      -hastypemethods pragma is false and the type has instances, the\n\t      following commands are equivalent:\n\t      snit::type dog { ... }\n\n\t      set mydog [dog create %AUTO%]\n\t      set mydog [dog %AUTO%]\n\t      set mydog [dog]\n\n\t      This doesn't work for Snit widgets, for obvious reasons.\n\n\t      Snit 1.x Incompatibility: In Snit 1.x, the above behavior is\n\t      available whether -hastypemethods is true (the default) or\n\t      false.\n\n   STANDARD TYPE METHODS\n       In addition to any type methods in the type's definition, all type and\n       widget commands will usually have at least the following subcommands:\n\n       $type create name ?option value ...?\n\t      Creates a new instance of the type, giving it the specified name\n\t      and calling the type's constructor.\n\n\t      For snit::types, if name is not a fully-qualified command name,\n\t      it is assumed to be a name in the namespace in which the call to\n\t      snit::type appears.  The method returns the fully-qualified\n\t      instance name.\n\n\t      For snit::widgets and snit::widgetadaptors, name must be a valid\n\t      widget name; the method returns the widget name.\n\n\t      So long as name does not conflict with any defined type method\n\t      name the create keyword may be omitted, unless the type\n\t      definition includes delegate typemethod * or the -hasinstances\n\t      pragma is set to false.\n\n\t      If the name includes the string %AUTO%, it will be replaced with\n\t      the string $type$counter where $type is the type name and\n\t      $counter is a counter that increments each time %AUTO% is used\n\t      for this type.\n\n\t      By default, any arguments following the name will be a list of\n\t      option names and their values; however, a type's constructor can\n\t      specify a different argument list.\n\n\t      As of Snit V0.95, create will throw an error if the name is the\n\t      same as any existing command--note that this was always true for\n\t      snit::widgets and snit::widgetadaptors.  You can restore the\n\t      previous behavior using the -canreplace pragma.\n\n       $type info typevars ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the type's type variables (excluding Snit\n\t      internal variables); all variable names are fully-qualified.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n       $type info typemethods ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the names of the  type's type methods.\tIf the\n\t      type has hierarchical type methods, whether locally-defined or\n\t      delegated, only the first word of each will be included in the\n\t      list.\n\n\t      If the type definition includes delegate typemethod *, the list\n\t      will include only the names of those implicitly delegated type\n\t      methods that have been called at least once and are still in the\n\t      type method cache.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n       $type info args method\n\t      Returns a list containing the names of the arguments to the\n\t      type's method, in order. This method cannot be applied to\n\t      delegated type methods.\n\n       $type info body method\n\t      Returns the body of typemethod method. This method cannot be\n\t      applied to delegated type methods.\n\n       $type info default method aname varname\n\t      Returns a boolean value indicating whether the argument aname of\n\t      the type's method has a default value (true) or not (false). If\n\t      the argument has a default its value is placed into the variable\n\t      varname.\n\n       $type info instances ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the type's instances.  For snit::types, it\n\t      will be a list of fully-qualified instance names; for\n\t      snit::widgets, it will be a list of Tk widget names.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n\t      Snit 1.x Incompatibility:  In Snit 1.x, the full multi-word\n\t      names of hierarchical type methods are included in the return\n\t      value.\n\n       $type destroy\n\t      Destroys the type's instances, the type's namespace, and the\n\t      type command itself.\n\n   THE INSTANCE COMMAND\n       A Snit type or widget's create type method creates objects of the type;\n       each object has a unique name that is also a Tcl command.  This command\n       is used to access the object's methods and data, and has this form:\n\n       $object method args...\n\t      The method can be any of the Standard Instance Methods, or any\n\t      instance method defined in the type definition.  The subsequent\n\t      args depend on the specific method chosen.\n\n   STANDARD INSTANCE METHODS\n       In addition to any delegated or locally-defined instance methods in the\n       type's definition, all Snit objects will have at least the following\n       subcommands:\n\n       $object configure ?option? ?value? ...\n\t      Assigns new values to one or more options.  If called with one\n\t      argument, an option name, returns a list describing the option,\n\t      as Tk widgets do; if called with no arguments, returns a list of\n\t      lists describing all options, as Tk widgets do.\n\n\t      Warning: This information will be available for delegated\n\t      options only if the component to which they are delegated has a\n\t      configure method that returns this same kind of information.\n\n\t      Note: Snit defines this method only if the type has at least one\n\t      option.\n\n       $object configurelist optionlist\n\t      Like configure, but takes one argument, a list of options and\n\t      their values.  It's mostly useful in the type constructor, but\n\t      can be used anywhere.\n\n\t      Note: Snit defines this method only if the type has at least one\n\t      option.\n\n       $object cget option\n\t      Returns the option's value.\n\n\t      Note: Snit defines this method only if the type has at least one\n\t      option.\n\n       $object destroy\n\t      Destroys the object, calling the destructor and freeing all\n\t      related memory.\n\n\t      Note: The destroy method isn't defined for snit::widget or\n\t      snit::widgetadaptor objects; instances of these are destroyed by\n\t      calling Tk's destroy command, just as normal widgets are.\n\n       $object info type\n\t      Returns the instance's type.\n\n       $object info vars ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the object's instance variables (excluding\n\t      Snit internal variables).  The names are fully qualified.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n       $object info typevars ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the object's type's type variables (excluding\n\t      Snit internal variables).  The names are fully qualified.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n       $object info typemethods ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the names of the  type's type methods.\tIf the\n\t      type has hierarchical type methods, whether locally-defined or\n\t      delegated, only the first word of each will be included in the\n\t      list.\n\n\t      If the type definition includes delegate typemethod *, the list\n\t      will include only the names of those implicitly delegated type\n\t      methods that have been called at least once and are still in the\n\t      type method cache.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n\t      Snit 1.x Incompatibility:  In Snit 1.x, the full multi-word\n\t      names of hierarchical type methods are included in the return\n\t      value.\n\n       $object info options ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the object's option names.  This always\n\t      includes local options and explicitly delegated options.\tIf\n\t      unknown options are delegated as well, and if the component to\n\t      which they are delegated responds to $object configure like Tk\n\t      widgets do, then the result will include all possible unknown\n\t      options that can be delegated to the component.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n\t      Note that the return value might be different for different\n\t      instances of the same type, if component object types can vary\n\t      from one instance to another.\n\n       $object info methods ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of the names of the instance's methods.  If the\n\t      type has hierarchical methods, whether locally-defined or\n\t      delegated, only the first word of each will be included in the\n\t      list.\n\n\t      If the type definition includes delegate method *, the list will\n\t      include only the names of those implicitly delegated methods\n\t      that have been called at least once and are still in the method\n\t      cache.\n\n\t      If pattern is given, it's used as a string match pattern; only\n\t      names that match the pattern are returned.\n\n\t      Snit 1.x Incompatibility:  In Snit 1.x, the full multi-word\n\t      names of hierarchical type methods are included in the return\n\t      value.\n\n       $object info args method\n\t      Returns a list containing the names of the arguments to the\n\t      instance's method, in order. This method cannot be applied to\n\t      delegated methods.\n\n       $object info body method\n\t      Returns the body of the instance's method method. This method\n\t      cannot be applied to delegated methods.\n\n       $object info default method aname varname\n\t      Returns a boolean value indicating whether the argument aname of\n\t      the instance's method has a default value (true) or not (false).\n\t      If the argument has a default its value is placed into the\n\t      variable varname.\n\n   COMMANDS FOR USE IN OBJECT CODE\n       Snit defines the following commands for use in your object code: that\n       is, for use in type methods, instance methods, constructors,\n       destructors, onconfigure handlers, oncget handlers, and procs.  They do\n       not reside in the ::snit:: namespace; instead, they are created with\n       the type, and can be used without qualification.\n\n       mymethod name ?args...?\n\t      The mymethod command is used for formatting callback commands to\n\t      be passed to other objects.  It returns a command that when\n\t      called will invoke method name with the specified arguments,\n\t      plus of course any arguments added by the caller.  In other\n\t      words, both of the following commands will cause the object's\n\t      dosomething method to be called when the $button is pressed:\n\t\t  $button configure -command [list $self dosomething myargument]\n\n\t\t  $button configure -command [mymethod dosomething myargument]\n\n\t      The chief distinction between the two is that the latter form\n\t      will not break if the object's command is renamed.\n\n       mytypemethod name ?args...?\n\t      The mytypemethod command is used for formatting callback\n\t      commands to be passed to other objects.  It returns a command\n\t      that when called will invoke type method name with the specified\n\t      arguments, plus of course any arguments added by the caller.  In\n\t      other words, both of the following commands will cause the\n\t      object's dosomething type method to be called when $button is\n\t      pressed:\n\t\t  $button configure -command [list $type dosomething myargument]\n\n\t\t  $button configure -command [mytypemethod dosomething myargument]\n\n\t      Type commands cannot be renamed, so in practice there's little\n\t      difference between the two forms.  mytypemethod is provided for\n\t      parallelism with mymethod.\n\n       myproc name ?args...?\n\t      The myproc command is used for formatting callback commands to\n\t      be passed to other objects.  It returns a command that when\n\t      called will invoke the type proc name with the specified\n\t      arguments, plus of course any arguments added by the caller.  In\n\t      other words, both of the following commands will cause the\n\t      object's dosomething proc to be called when $button is pressed:\n\t\t  $button configure -command [list ${type}::dosomething myargument]\n\n\t\t  $button configure -command [myproc dosomething myargument]"

If it is found, it\n\t      and its value are removed from the list, and the value is\n\t      returned.  If option doesn't appear in the list, then the\n\t      defvalue is returned.  If the option is locally-defined option,\n\t      and defvalue is not specified, then the option's default value\n\t      as specified in the type definition will be returned instead.\n\n       install compName using objType objName args...\n\t      Creates a new object of type objType called objName and installs\n\t      it as component compName, as described in Components and\n\t      Delegation.  Any additional args... are passed along with the\n\t      name to the objType command.  If this is a snit::type, then the\n\t      following two commands are equivalent:\n\t\t  install myComp using myObjType $self.myComp args...\n\n\t\t  set myComp [myObjType $self.myComp args...]\n\n\t      Note that whichever method is used, compName must still be\n\t      declared in the type definition using component, or must be\n\t      referenced in at least one delegate statement.\n\n\t      If this is a snit::widget or snit::widgetadaptor, and if options\n\t      have been delegated to component compName, then those options\n\t      will receive default values from the Tk option database.\tNote\n\t      that it doesn't matter whether the component to be installed is\n\t      a widget or not.\tSee The Tk Option Database for more\n\t      information.\n\n\t      install cannot be used to install type components; just assign\n\t      the type component's command name to the type component's\n\t      variable instead.\n\n       installhull using widgetType args...\n\n       installhull name\n\t      The constructor of a snit::widgetadaptor must create a widget to\n\t      be the object's hull component; the widget is installed as the\n\t      hull component using this command.  Note that the installed\n\t      widget's name must be $win.  This command has two forms.\n\n\t      The first form specifies the widgetType and the args... (that\n\t      is, the hardcoded option list) to use in creating the hull.\n\t      Given this form, installhull creates the hull widget, and\n\t      initializes any options delegated to the hull from the Tk option\n\t      database.\n\n\t      In the second form, the hull widget has already been created;\n\t      note that its name must be \"$win\".  In this case, the Tk option\n\t      database is not queried for any options delegated to the hull.\n\t      The longer form is preferred; however, the shorter form allows\n\t      the programmer to adapt a widget created elsewhere, which is\n\t      sometimes useful.  For example, it can be used to adapt a \"page\"\n\t      widget created by a BWidgets tabbed notebook or pages manager\n\t      widget.\n\n\t      See The Tk Option Database for more information about\n\t      snit::widgetadaptors and the option database.\n\n       variable name\n\t      Normally, instance variables are defined in the type definition\n\t      along with the options, methods, and so forth; such instance\n\t      variables are automatically visible in all instance code (e.g.,\n\t      method bodies).  However, instance code can use the variable\n\t      command to declare instance variables that don't appear in the\n\t      type definition, and also to bring variables from other\n\t      namespaces into scope in the usual way.\n\n\t      It's generally clearest to define all instance variables in the\n\t      type definition, and omit declaring them in methods and so\n\t      forth.\n\n\t      Note that this is an instance-specific version of the standard\n\t      Tcl ::variable command.\n\n       typevariable name\n\t      Normally, type variables are defined in the type definition,\n\t      along with the instance variables; such type variables are\n\t      automatically visible in all of the type's code.\tHowever, type\n\t      methods, instance methods and so forth can use typevariable to\n\t      declare type variables that don't appear in the type definition.\n\n\t      It's generally clearest to declare all type variables in the\n\t      type definition, and omit declaring them in methods, type\n\t      methods, etc.\n\n       varname name\n\t      Deprecated.  Use myvar instead.\n\n\t      Given an instance variable name, returns the fully qualified\n\t      name.  Use this if you're passing the variable to some other\n\t      object, e.g., as a -textvariable to a Tk label widget.\n\n       typevarname name\n\t      Deprecated.  Use mytypevar instead.\n\n\t      Given a type variable name, returns the fully qualified name.\n\t      Use this if you're passing the type variable to some other\n\t      object, e.g., as a -textvariable to a Tk label widget.\n\n       codename name\n\t      Deprecated.  Use myproc instead.\tGiven the name of a proc (but\n\t      not a type or instance method), returns the fully-qualified\n\t      command name, suitable for passing as a callback.\n\n   COMPONENTS AND DELEGATION\n       When an object includes other objects, as when a toolbar contains\n       buttons or a GUI object contains an object that references a database,\n       the included object is called a component.  The standard way to handle\n       component objects owned by a Snit object is to declare them using\n       component, which creates a component instance variable.\tIn the\n       following example, a dog object has a tail object:\n\n\t   snit::type dog {\n\t       component mytail\n\n\t       constructor {args} {\n\t\t   set mytail [tail %AUTO% -partof $self]\n\t\t   $self configurelist $args\n\t       }\n\n\t       method wag {} {\n\t\t   $mytail wag\n\t       }\n\t   }\n\n\t   snit::type tail {\n\t       option -length 5\n\t       option -partof\n\t       method wag {} { return \"Wag, wag, wag.\"}\n\t   }"

In OO jargon, this is called delegation.\n       Snit provides an easier way to do this:\n\n\t   snit::type dog {\n\t       delegate method wag to mytail\n\n\t       constructor {args} {\n\t\t   install mytail using tail %AUTO% -partof $self\n\t\t   $self configurelist $args\n\t       }\n\t   }"

The book Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk by Welch et\n       al has a good introduction to the option database, as does Effective\n       Tcl/Tk Programming.\n\n       Snit is implemented so that most of the time it will simply do the\n       right thing with respect to the option database, provided that the\n       widget developer does the right thing by Snit.  The body of this\n       section goes into great deal about what Snit requires.  The following\n       is a brief statement of the requirements, for reference.\n\n       •      If the snit::widget's default widget class is not what is\n\t      desired, set it explicitly using widgetclass in the widget\n\t      definition.\n\n       •      When defining or delegating options, specify the resource and\n\t      class names explicitly when if the defaults aren't what you\n\t      want.\n\n       •      Use installhull using to install the hull for\n\t      snit::widgetadaptors.\n\n       •      Use install to install all other components.\n\n       The interaction of Tk widgets with the option database is a complex\n       thing; the interaction of Snit with the option database is even more\n       so, and repays attention to detail.\n\n       Setting the widget class: Every Tk widget has a widget class.  For Tk\n       widgets, the widget class name is the just the widget type name with an\n       initial capital letter, e.g., the widget class for button widgets is\n       \"Button\".\n\n       Similarly, the widget class of a snit::widget defaults to the\n       unqualified type name with the first letter capitalized.  For example,\n       the widget class of\n\n\t   snit::widget ::mylibrary::scrolledText { ... }\n\n       is \"ScrolledText\".  The widget class can also be set explicitly using\n       the widgetclass statement within the snit::widget definition.\n\n       Any widget can be used as the hulltype provided that it supports the\n       -class option for changing its widget class name.  See the discussion\n       of the hulltype command, above.\tThe user may pass -class to the widget\n       at instantion.\n\n       The widget class of a snit::widgetadaptor is just the widget class of\n       its hull widget; this cannot be changed unless the hull widget supports\n       -class, in which case it will usually make more sense to use\n       snit::widget rather than snit::widgetadaptor.\n\n       Setting option resource names and classes: In Tk, every option has\n       three names: the option name, the resource name, and the class name.\n       The option name begins with a hyphen and is all lowercase; it's used\n       when creating widgets, and with the configure and cget commands.\n\n       The resource and class names are used to initialize option default\n       values by querying the Tk option database.  The resource name is\n       usually just the option name minus the hyphen, but may contain\n       uppercase letters at word boundaries; the class name is usually just\n       the resource name with an initial capital, but not always.  For\n       example, here are the option, resource, and class names for several\n       text widget options:\n\n\t   -background\t       background\t  Background\n\t   -borderwidth        borderWidth\t  BorderWidth\n\t   -insertborderwidth  insertBorderWidth  BorderWidth\n\t   -padx\t       padX\t\t  Pad"

By default,\n       these names follow the rule given above: the resource name is the\n       option name without the hyphen, and the class name is the resource name\n       with an initial capital.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snit`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nQuerying the option database: If you set your widgetclass and option\n       names as described above, Snit will query the option database when each\n       instance is created, and will generally do the right thing when it\n       comes to querying the option database.  The remainder of this section\n       goes into the gory details.\n\n       Initializing locally defined options: When an instance of a\n       snit::widget is created, its locally defined options are initialized as\n       follows: each option's resource and class names are used to query the\n       Tk option database.  If the result is non-empty, it is used as the\n       option's default; otherwise, the default hardcoded in the type\n       definition is used.  In either case, the default can be overridden by\n       the caller.  For example,\n\n\t   option add *Mywidget.texture pebbled\n\n\t   snit::widget mywidget {\n\t    option -texture smooth\n\t    # ...\n\t   }\n\n\t   mywidget .mywidget -texture greasy\n\n\n       Here, -texture would normally default to \"smooth\", but because of the\n       entry added to the option database it defaults to \"pebbled\".  However,\n       the caller has explicitly overridden the default, and so the new widget\n       will be \"greasy\".\n\n       Initializing options delegated to the hull: A snit::widget's hull is a\n       widget, and given that its class has been set it is expected to query\n       the option database for itself.\tThe only exception concerns options\n       that are delegated to it with a different name.\tConsider the following\n       code:\n\n\t   option add *Mywidget.borderWidth 5\n\t   option add *Mywidget.relief sunken\n\t   option add *Mywidget.hullbackground red\n\t   option add *Mywidget.background green\n\n\t   snit::widget mywidget {\n\t    delegate option -borderwidth to hull\n\t    delegate option -hullbackground to hull as -background\n\t    delegate option * to hull\n\t    # ...\n\t   }\n\n\t   mywidget .mywidget\n\n\t   set A [.mywidget cget -relief]\n\t   set B [.mywidget cget -hullbackground]\n\t   set C [.mywidget cget -background]\n\t   set D [.mywidget cget -borderwidth]"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snit`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe question is, what are the values of variables A, B, C and D?\n\n       The value of A is \"sunken\".  The hull is a Tk frame that has been given\n       the widget class \"Mywidget\"; it will automatically query the option\n       database and pick up this value.  Since the -relief option is\n       implicitly delegated to the hull, Snit takes no action.\n\n       The value of B is \"red\".  The hull will automatically pick up the value\n       \"green\" for its -background option, just as it picked up the -relief\n       value.  However, Snit knows that -hullbackground is mapped to the\n       hull's -background option; hence, it queries the option database for\n       -hullbackground and gets \"red\" and updates the hull accordingly.\n\n       The value of C is also \"red\", because -background is implicitly\n       delegated to the hull; thus, retrieving it is the same as retrieving\n       -hullbackground.  Note that this case is unusual; in practice,\n       -background would probably be explicitly delegated to some other\n       component.\n\n       The value of D is \"5\", but not for the reason you think.  Note that as\n       it is defined above, the resource name for -borderwidth defaults to\n       \"borderwidth\", whereas the option database entry is \"borderWidth\".  As\n       with -relief, the hull picks up its own -borderwidth option before Snit\n       does anything.  Because the option is delegated under its own name,\n       Snit assumes that the correct thing has happened, and doesn't worry\n       about it any further.\n\n       For snit::widgetadaptors, the case is somewhat altered.\tWidget\n       adaptors retain the widget class of their hull, and the hull is not\n       created automatically by Snit.  Instead, the snit::widgetadaptor must\n       call installhull in its constructor.  The normal way to do this is as\n       follows:\n\n\t   snit::widgetadaptor mywidget {\n\t    # ...\n\t    constructor {args} {\n\t\t# ...\n\t\tinstallhull using text -foreground white\n\t\t#\n\t    }\n\t    #...\n\t   }"

Just as with\n       snit::widget hulls, Snit assumes that it will pick up all of its normal\n       option values automatically; options delegated from a different name\n       are initialized from the option database in the same way.\n\n       Initializing options delegated to other components: Non-hull components\n       are matched against the option database in two ways.  First, a\n       component widget remains a widget still, and therefore is initialized\n       from the option database in the usual way.  Second, the option database\n       is queried for all options delegated to the component, and the\n       component is initialized accordingly--provided that the install command\n       is used to create it.\n\n       Before option database support was added to Snit, the usual way to\n       create a component was to simply create it in the constructor and\n       assign its command name to the component variable:\n\n\t   snit::widget mywidget {\n\t    delegate option -background to myComp\n\n\t    constructor {args} {\n\t\tset myComp [text $win.text -foreground black]\n\t    }\n\t   }"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snit`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe drawback of this method is that Snit has no opportunity to\n       initialize the component properly.  Hence, the following approach is\n       now used:\n\n\t   snit::widget mywidget {\n\t    delegate option -background to myComp\n\n\t    constructor {args} {\n\t\tinstall myComp using text $win.text -foreground black\n\t    }\n\t   }\n\n\n       The install command does the following:\n\n       •      Builds a list of the options explicitly included in the install\n\t      command -- in this case, -foreground.\n\n       •      Queries the option database for all options delegated explicitly\n\t      to the named component.\n\n       •      Creates the component using the specified command, after\n\t      inserting into it a list of options and values read from the\n\t      option database.\tThus, the explicitly included options\n\t      (-foreground) will override anything read from the option\n\t      database.\n\n       •      If the widget definition implicitly delegated options to the\n\t      component using delegate option *, then Snit calls the newly\n\t      created component's configure method to receive a list of all of\n\t      the component's options.\tFrom this Snit builds a list of\n\t      options implicitly delegated to the component that were not\n\t      explicitly included in the install command.  For all such\n\t      options, Snit queries the option database and configures the\n\t      component accordingly.\n\n       Non-widget components: The option database is never queried for\n       snit::types, since it can only be queried given a Tk widget name.\n       However, snit::widgets can have non-widget components.  And if options\n       are delegated to those components, and if the install command is used\n       to install those components, then they will be initialized from the\n       option database just as widget components are.\n\n   MACROS AND META-PROGRAMMING\n       The snit::macro command enables a certain amount of meta-programming\n       with Snit classes.  For example, suppose you like to define properties:\n       instance variables that have set/get methods.  Your code might look\n       like this:\n\t   snit::type dog {\n\t       variable mood happy\n\n\t       method getmood {} {\n\t\t   return $mood\n\t       }\n\n\t       method setmood {newmood} {\n\t\t   set mood $newmood\n\t       }\n\t   }\n\n       That's nine lines of text per property.\tOr, you could define the\n       following snit::macro:\n\t   snit::macro property {name initValue} {\n\t       variable $name $initValue\n\n\t       method get$name {} \"return $name\"\n\n\t       method set$name {value} \"set $name \\$value\"\n\t   }\n\n       Note that a snit::macro is just a normal Tcl proc defined in the slave\n       interpreter used to compile type and widget definitions; as a result,\n       it has access to all the commands used to define types and widgets.\n\n       Given this new macro, you can define a property in one line of code:\n\t   snit::type dog {\n\t       property mood happy\n\t   }\n\n       Within a macro, the commands variable and proc refer to the Snit type-\n       definition commands, not the standard Tcl commands.  To get the\n       standard Tcl commands, use _variable and _proc.\n\n       Because a single slave interpreter is used for compiling all Snit types\n       and widgets in the application, there's the possibility of macro name\n       collisions.  If you're writing a reuseable package using Snit, and you\n       use some snit::macros, define them in your package namespace:\n\t   snit::macro mypkg::property {name initValue} { ... }\n\n\t   snit::type dog {\n\t       mypkg::property mood happy\n\t   }\n\n       This leaves the global namespace open for application authors.\n\n   VALIDATION TYPES\n       A validation type is an object that can be used to validate Tcl values\n       of a particular kind.  For example, snit::integer is used to validate\n       that a Tcl value is an integer.\n\n       Every validation type has a validate method which is used to do the\n       validation. This method must take a single argument, the value to be\n       validated; further, it must do nothing if the value is valid, but throw\n       an error if the value is invalid:\n\t   snit::integer validate 5\t;# Does nothing\n\t   snit::integer validate 5.0\t;# Throws an error (not an integer!)"

For example, a probability is a\n       number between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive:\n\t   snit::double probability -min 0.0 -max 1.0\n\n       The example above creates an instance of snit::double--a validation\n       subtype--called probability, which can be used to validate probability\n       values:\n\t   probability validate 0.5   ;# Does nothing\n\t   probability validate 7.9   ;# Throws an error\n\n       Validation subtypes can be defined explicitly, as in the above example;\n       when a locally-defined option's -type is specified, they may also be\n       created on the fly:\n\t   snit::enum ::dog::breed -values {mutt retriever sheepdog}\n\n\t   snit::type dog {\n\t       # Define subtypes on the fly...\n\t       option -breed -type {\n\t\t   snit::enum -values {mutt retriever sheepdog}\n\t       }\n\n\t       # Or use predefined subtypes...\n\t       option -breed -type ::dog::breed\n\t   }"

Validates Tk window names.

A validation type is simply an object that\n       has a validate method; the validate method must take one argument, a\n       value, return the value if it is valid, and throw an error with\n       -errorcode INVALID if the value is invalid.  This can be done with a\n       simple proc.  For example, the snit::boolean validate type could have\n       been implemented like this:\n\t   proc ::snit::boolean {\"validate\" value} {\n\t       if {![string is boolean -strict $value]} {\n\t\t   return -code error -errorcode INVALID \\\n\t\t       \"invalid boolean \\\"$value\\\", should be one of: 1, 0, ...\"\n\t       }\n\n\t       return $value\n\t   }\n\n       A validation type defined in this way cannot be subtyped, of course;\n       but for many applications this will be sufficient.\n\n       Finally, one can define a full-fledged, subtype-able validation type as\n       a snit::type.  Here's a skeleton to get you started:\n\t   snit::type myinteger {\n\t       # First, define any options you'd like to use to define\n\t       # subtypes.  Give them defaults such that they won't take\n\t       # effect if they aren't used, and marked them \"read-only\".\n\t       # After all, you shouldn't be changing their values after\n\t       # a subtype is defined.\n\t       #\n\t       # For example:\n\n\t       option -min -default \"\" -readonly 1\n\t       option -max -default \"\" -readonly 1\n\n\t       # Next, define a \"validate\" type method which should do the\n\t       # validation in the basic case.\tThis will allow the\n\t       # type command to be used as a validation type.\n\n\t       typemethod validate {value} {\n\t\t   if {![string is integer -strict $value]} {\n\t\t       return -code error -errorcode INVALID \\\n\t\t\t   \"invalid value \\\"$value\\\", expected integer\"\n\t\t   }\n\n\t\t   return $value\n\t       }\n\n\t       # Next, the constructor should validate the subtype options,\n\t       # if any.  Since they are all readonly, we don't need to worry\n\t       # about validating the options on change.\n\n\t       constructor {args} {\n\t\t   # FIRST, get the options\n\t\t   $self configurelist $args\n\n\t\t   # NEXT, validate them.\n\n\t\t   # I'll leave this to your imagination.\n\t       }\n\n\t       # Next, define a \"validate\" instance method; its job is to\n\t       # validate values for subtypes.\n\n\t       method validate {value} {\n\t\t   # First, call the type method to do the basic validation.\n\t\t   $type validate $value\n\n\t\t   # Now we know it's a valid integer.\n\n\t\t   if {(\"\" != $options(-min) && $value < $options(-min))  ||\n\t\t       (\"\" != $options(-max) && $value > $options(-max))} {\n\t\t       # It's out of range; format a detailed message about\n\t\t       # the error, and throw it.\n\n\t\t       set msg \"....\"\n\n\t\t       return -code error -errorcode INVALID $msg\n\t\t   }\n\n\t\t   # Otherwise, if it's valid just return it.\n\t\t   return $valid\n\t       }\n\t   }\n\n       And now you have a type that can be subtyped.\n\n       The file \"validate.tcl\" in the Snit distribution defines all of Snit's\n       validation types; you can find the complete implementation for\n       snit::integer and the other types there, to use as examples for your\n       own types.\n\nCAVEATS\n       If you have problems, find bugs, or new ideas you are hereby cordially\n       invited to submit a report of your problem, bug, or idea at the\n       SourceForge trackers for tcllib, which can be found at\n       http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib/.  The relevant category is\n       snit.\n\n       Additionally, you might wish to join the Snit mailing list; see\n       http://www.wjduquette.com/snit for details.\n\n       One particular area to watch is using snit::widgetadaptor to adapt\n       megawidgets created by other megawidget packages; correct widget\n       destruction depends on the order of the <Destroy> bindings.  The wisest\n       course is simply not to do this.\n\nKNOWN BUGS\n       •      Error stack traces returned by Snit 1.x are extremely ugly and\n\t      typically contain far too much information about Snit internals.\n\t      The error messages are much improved in Snit 2.2.\n\n       •      Also see the SourceForge Trackers at\n\t      http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib/, category snit.\n\nHISTORY\n       During the course of developing Notebook (See\n       http://www.wjduquette.com/notebook), my Tcl-based personal notebook\n       application, I found I was writing it as a collection of objects.  I\n       wasn't using any particular object-oriented framework; I was just\n       writing objects in pure Tcl following the guidelines in my Guide to\n       Object Commands (see http://www.wjduquette.com/tcl/objects.html), along\n       with a few other tricks I'd picked up since.  And though it was working\n       well, it quickly became tiresome because of the amount of boilerplate\n       code associated with each new object type.\n\n       So that was one thing--tedium is a powerful motivator.  But the other\n       thing I noticed is that I wasn't using inheritance at all, and I wasn't\n       missing it.  Instead, I was using delegation: objects that created\n       other objects and delegated methods to them.\n\n       And I said to myself, \"This is getting tedious...there has got to be a\n       better way.\"  And one afternoon, on a whim, I started working on Snit,\n       an object system that works the way Tcl works.  Snit doesn't support\n       inheritance, but it's great at delegation, and it makes creating\n       megawidgets easy.\n\n       If you have any comments or suggestions (or bug reports!) don't\n       hesitate to send me e-mail at will@wjduquette.com.  In addition,\n       there's a Snit mailing list; you can find out more about it at the Snit\n       home page (see http://www.wjduquette.com/snit).\n\nCREDITS\n       Snit has been designed and implemented from the very beginning by\n       William H.
