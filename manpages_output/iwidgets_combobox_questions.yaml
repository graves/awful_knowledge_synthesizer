When an item\n       is selected in the list area of a Combobox, its value is then displayed\n       in the entry field text area. Functionally similar to an Optionmenu,\n       the Combobox adds (optional) list scrolling and (optional) item editing\n       and inserting capabilities.\n\n       There are two basic styles of Comboboxes (determined by the -dropdown\n       option): dropdown and simple. The dropdown style adds an arrow button\n       to the right of the entry field which when activated will pop up (and\n       down) the scrolled listbox beneath the entry field. The simple (non-\n       dropdown) Combobox permanently displays the listbox beneath the entry\n       field and has no arrow button. Either style allows an optional entry\n       field label.\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::combobox command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget. It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command. The\n       following commands are possible for Combobox widgets:\n\nASSOCIATED METHODS\n       icursor\t       scan\n\n       See the \"entry\" manual entries for details on the above associated\n       methods.\n\n       curselection    index\t      see\t      size\n       xview\t       yview\n\n       See the \"listbox\" manual entries for details on the above associated\n       methods.\n\n       getcurselection justify\t      sort\n\n       See the \"scrolledlistbox\" manual entries for details on the above\n       associated methods.\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::combobox command.\n\n       pathName clear ?component?\n\t      Clears the contents from one or both components. Valid component\n\t      values are list, or entry.  With no component specified, both\n\t      are cleared.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::combobox command.\n\n       pathName delete component first ?last?\n\t      Delete one or more elements from a given component, list or\n\t      entry.  If a list item to be removed is currently selected\n\t      (displayed in the entry field area), the entry field will be\n\t      cleared.\n\n       pathName get ?index?\n\t      With no arguments, returns the contents currently in the entry\n\t      field area. With a single argument, returns the contents of the\n\t      listbox item at the indicated index.\n\n       pathName insert component index element ?element element ...?\n\t      Insert one or more new elements into the given component, list\n\t      or entry, just before the element given by index.\n\n       pathName selection option first ?last?\n\t      Adjust the selection within the listbox component and updates\n\t      the contents of the entry field component to the value of the\n\t      selected item. See the \"listbox\" manual entry for more details\n\t      on parameter options.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n       Name:\t       entry\n       Class:\t       Entry\n\n\t      Text entry area where the current selection is displayed. If the\n\t      Combobox is editable and its state is normal, the user can edit\n\t      the contents of this item.\n\n       Name:\t       list\n       Class:\t       Scrolledlistbox\n\n\t      Scrollable list which stores all the items which the user can\n\t      select from. For dropdown Comboboxes, this component is hidden\n\t      until the user pops it up by pressing on the arrow button to the\n\t      right of the entry component. For simple Comboboxes this\n\t      component is always visible just beneath the entry component.\n\nDEFAULT BINDINGS\n       The Combobox generally has the same bindings as its primary component\n       items - the Scrolledlistbox and Entryfield. However it also adds these:\n\n       [1] Button-1 mouse press on the arrow key of a dropdown Combobox causes\n       the list to be popped up. If the combobox is non-editable, a Button-1\n       press on the entry field area will also pop up the list.\n\n       [2] Button-1 mouse press anywhere on the display removes a dropdown\n       listbox which has been popped up, unless the keypress is upon one of\n       the Combobox scrollbars which scrolls the list. If it is pressed upon\n       an item in the list area, that item will be selected before the list is\n       removed.\n\n       [3] Button-3 mouse press on the arrow key of a dropdown Combobox causes\n       the next item to be selected. Shift-Button-3 causes the previous item\n       to be selected.\n\n       [4] Escape keypress removes a dropdown list which has been popped up.\n\n       [5] The <space> and <Return> keystrokes select the current item. They\n       also remove the popped up list for dropdown comboboxes.\n\n       [6] Up and Down arrow keypresses from the entry field and arrow button\n       component cause the previous and next items in the listbox to be\n       selected respectively. Ctl-P and Ctl-N are similarly mapped for emacs\n       emulation.\n\n       [7] Entry field and arrow button component Shift-Up and Shift-Down\n       arrow keys pop up and down the listbox of a dropdown Combobox. The\n       arrow button component also maps <Return> and <space> similarly.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\t       package require Iwidgets 4.0\n\t       proc selectCmd {} {\n\t\t  puts stdout \"[.cb2 getcurselection]\"\n\t       }\n\n\t       #\n\t       # Non-editable Dropdown Combobox\n\t       #\n\t       iwidgets::combobox .cb1 -labeltext Month: \\\n\t\t   -selectioncommand {puts \"selected: [.cb1 getcurselection]\"} \\\n\t\t   -editable false -listheight 185 -popupcursor hand1\n\t       .cb1 insert list end Jan Feb Mar Apr May June Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec\n\n\t       #\n\t       # Editable Dropdown Combobox\n\t       #\n\t       iwidgets::combobox .cb2 -labeltext \"Operating System:\" -selectioncommand selectCmd\n\t       .cb2 insert list end Linux HP-UX SunOS Solaris Irix\n\t       .cb2 insert entry end L\n\n\t       pack .cb1 -padx 10 -pady 10 -fill x\n\t       pack .cb2 -padx 10 -pady 10 -fill x"
