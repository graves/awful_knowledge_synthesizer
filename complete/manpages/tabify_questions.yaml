A different algorithm is\n\t      used however. Instead of replacing any substring of num spaces\n\t      this command works more like an editor. num defaults to 8."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the textutil::tabify package?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the tabify command to replace sequences of 8 spaces with a single tab in a string?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the untabify command to convert a string with tabs back into spaces, assuming a tab stop of 8?

Only sequences of space characters\n\t      containing more than one space character and found immediately\n\t      before a tabstop are replaced with tabs.\n\n       ::textutil::tabify::untabify string ?num?\n\t      Untabify the string by replacing any tabulation char by a\n\t      substring of num space chars and return the result as a new\n\t      string. num defaults to 8.\n\n       ::textutil::tabify::untabify2 string ?num?\n\t      Untabify the string by replacing any tabulation char by a\n\t      substring of at most num space chars and return the result as a\n\t      new string. Unlike textutil::tabify::untabify each tab is not\n\t      replaced by a fixed number of space characters.  The command\n\t      overlays each line in the string with tabstops every num columns\n\t      instead and replaces tabs with just enough space characters to\n\t      reach the next tabstop. This is the complement of the actions\n\t      taken by ::textutil::tabify::tabify2. num defaults to 8."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the tabify and untabify commands in macOS?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the untabify command to convert a string with tabs into spaces, assuming the default tabstop value of 8 columns?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the untabify2 command to convert a string with tabs into spaces, where each tab is replaced by the minimum number of spaces needed to reach the next tabstop, using the default tabstop value of 8 columns?
