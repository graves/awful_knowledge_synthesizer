Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `domainsid`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDOMAINSID(4)\t\t     Device Drivers Manual\t\t  DOMAINSID(4)\n\nNAME\n       domainsid - Xsan File System Domain SID File\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/domainsid\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The Xsan File System domainsid file is an optional MDC configuration\n       file used to set the domain SID to be used with ACLs when the Security\n       Model is set to \"acl\" in a file system configuration file and Unix\n       Identity Mapping is set to \"algorithmic\"\n\n       Note that this file should only be deployed in very specific use cases.\n       For example, if an environment uses Open Directory, the domainsid file\n       should contain the assigned Domain SID.\tThis can be determined by\n       running the following command on a Mac:\n\n       $ dsmemberutil getsid -U username\n\n       where username is the name of any regular user account in Open\n       Directory.  This will return a string such as the following:\n\n\n       S-1-5-21-2553502104-2799725507-638401443-3106\n\n       The Domain SID is the string without the trailing RID so in this\n       example, it has the value S-1-5-21-2553502104-2799725507-638401443  The\n       following command may be run on the MDC to set this domain SID.\n\n       mdc# echo S-1-5-21-2553502104-2799725507-638401443 > /Library/Preferences/Xsan/domainsid\n\n       After configuring the domainsid, file systems must be restarted on the\n       FSM to have it take effect.\n\n       Note: Improper configuration of this file may lead to files having\n       invalid ACLs and permissions not being enforced properly.\n\nFILES\n       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/domainsid\n\nSEE ALSO\n       cvfs(8), snfs_config(5),\n\nXsan File System\t\t January 2018\t\t\t  DOMAINSID(4)"
