The Objective-C\n     bridges supported in Mac OS X, such as PyObjC (Python), read this\n     information at runtime.\n\n     As of Mac OS 10.7, gen_bridge_metadata uses an improved parser, based on\n     clang.  This means the generated files should be more correct and\n     complete, and the true parsing allows the automatic extraction of\n     metadata from existing __attribute__() information supported by the\n     compiler.\tFile generation time should also be faster.\n\n     Metadata files describe the parts of an Objective-C framework that the\n     bridges cannot automatically handle. These are primarily the ANSI C\n     elements of the framework -- functions, constants, enumerations, and so\n     on -- but also include special cases such as functions or methods that\n     accept pointer-like arguments. These special cases must be manually\n     specified in separate files called exceptions. The gen_bridge_metadata\n     tool can then read in the exceptions file when it generates the framework\n     metadata."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `gen_bridge_metadata`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe file extension used for x86_64 metadata files should be\n     .bridgesupport. The extension for arm64e metadata files should be\n     .arm64e.bridgesupport.\n\n     Certain elements, such as inline functions, cannot be described in the\n     metadata files.
