Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       dapptrace [-acdeFlhoU] [-u lib] { -p PID | command }\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       dapptrace prints details on user and library function calls. By default\n       it traces user functions only, options can be used to trace library\n       activity.\n\n       Of particular interest is the elapsed times and on cpu times, which can\n       identify both function calls that are slow to complete, and those which\n       are consuming CPU cycles.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a     print all details\n\n       -b bufsize\n\t      dynamic variable buffer size. Increase this if you notice\n\t      dynamic variable drop errors. The default is \"4m\" for 4\n\t      megabytes per CPU.\n\n       -c     print function call counts\n\n       -d     print relative timestamps, us\n\n       -e     print elapsed times, us\n\n       -F     print flow indentation\n\n       -l     force printing of pid/lwpid per line\n\n       -o     print on-cpu times, us\n\n       -p PID examine this PID\n\n       -u lib trace this library instead\n\n       -U     trace all library and user functions\n\nEXAMPLES\n       run and examine the \"df -h\" command,\n\t      # dapptrace df -h\n\n       examine PID 1871,\n\t      # dapptrace -p 1871\n\n       print using flow indents,\n\t      # dapptrace -Fp 1871\n\n       print elapsed and CPU times,\n\t      # dapptrace -eop 1871\n\nFIELDS\n       PID/LWPID\n\t      Process ID / Lightweight Process ID\n\n       RELATIVE\n\t      relative timestamps to the start of the thread, us\n\t      (microseconds)\n\n       ELAPSD elapsed time for this system call, us\n\n       CPU    on-cpu time for this system call, us\n\n       CALL(args)\n\t      function call name, with some arguments in hexadecimal\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       dapptrace will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit, or if a command was\n       executed dapptrace will finish when the command ends.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dappprof(1M), dtrace(1M), apptrace(1)"
