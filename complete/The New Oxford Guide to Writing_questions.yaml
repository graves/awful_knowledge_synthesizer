- prompt: "The New Oxford Guide to Writing  \nIntroduction  \n\nTwo broad assumptions underlie this book: (1) that writing is a rational activity, and (2) that it is a valuable activity.  \n\nTo say that writing is rational means nothing more than that it is an exercise of mind requiring the mastery of techniques anyone can learn. Obviously, there are limits: one cannot learn to write like Shakespeare or Charles Dickens. You can't become a genius by reading a book.  \n\nBut you don't have to be a genius to write clear, effective English. You just have to understand what writing involves and to know how to handle words and sentences and paragraphs. That you can learn. If you do, you can communicate what you want to communicate in words other people can understand. This book will help by showing you what good writers do.  \n\nThe second assumption is that writing is worth learning. It is of immediate practical benefit in any job or career. Certainly there are many jobs in which you can get along without being able to write clearly. If you know how to write, however, you will get along faster and farther.  \n\nThere is another, more profound value to writing. We create ourselves by words.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rational and Practical Value in Writing**\n\nUsing the two broad assumptions presented in the text (that writing is a rational activity and that it is a valuable activity), explain how these concepts apply to the real-world scenario of a college student preparing for a research paper.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''rational activity'' in the context of writing as discussed in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why mastering writing techniques is essential for academic success, referencing the idea that one doesn''t need to be a genius to write effectively.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how the practical value of clear writing translates into long-term career benefits, using examples from the text about jobs where writing skills are advantageous.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both assumptions and demonstrate an understanding of their interplay in the context of academic and professional life.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Writing as Self-Expression**\n\nThe text states that ''we create ourselves by words.'' Using this idea, construct a logical argument explaining why writing is essential for personal development.\n- **Part A**: Define the concept of self-creation through writing using the text''s assertion about words shaping identity.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from everyday life where writing (e.g., journaling, letter-writing) has influenced personal growth or change.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s emphasis on clear communication ties into the broader idea of self-expression through writing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly connect the text''s ideas to real-life applications and demonstrate logical reasoning about the role of writing in identity formation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Writing Assumptions**\n\nEvaluate the two assumptions in the text (that writing is rational and that it is valuable) by comparing them to a modern context where digital communication has become prevalent.\n- **Part A**: Argue whether the ''rational activity'' assumption still holds true when considering texting, social media, and email as forms of writing. Use examples from the text about learning techniques to support your position.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the ''valuable activity'' assumption applies to digital communication in today''s world. Consider the text''s point that clear writing helps you ''get along faster and farther'' in any career.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on whether the text''s focus on traditional writing (e.g., essays, reports) is outdated or still relevant in a digital age. Justify your conclusion based on the text''s arguments about the importance of clarity and effectiveness in communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must critically analyze both assumptions in the context of modern communication tools while maintaining alignment with the text''s core ideas.'

    CHAPTER

    Subject, Reader,
    and Kinds of Writing

    Choosing a Subject

    Often, of course, you are not free to choose at all. You must
    compose a report for a business meeting or write on an as-
    signed topic for an English class. The problem then becomes
    not what to write about but how to attack it, a question we'll
    discuss in Chapters 5 and 6.

    When you can select a subject for yourself, it ought to in-
    terest you, and interest others as well, at least potentially. It
    should be within the range of your experience and skill,
    though it is best if it stretches you. It ought to be neither so
    vast that no one person can encompass it nor so narrow and
    trivial that no one cares.

    Don't be afraid to express your own opinions and feelings.
    You are a vital part of the subject. No matter what the topic,
    you are really writing about how you understand it, how you
    feel about it. Good writing has personality. Readers enjoy
    sensing a mind at work, hearing a clear voice, responding to
    an unusual sensibility. If you have chosen a topic that is of
    general concern, and if genuine feeling and intelligence come
    through, you will be interesting. Interest lies not so much in
    a topic as in what a writer has made of it.

    6 INTRODUCTION

    About Readers

    You don't want to repel readers. This doesn't mean you have
    to flatter them or avoid saying something they may disagree
    with. It does mean you must respect them. Don't take their
    interest for granted or suppose that it is the readers' job to
    follow you. It's your job to guide them, to make their task as
    easy as the subject allows.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Subject Selection and Reader Engagement**\n\nCompose a short essay (200-300 words) that addresses the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain how selecting a subject that is ''neither so vast that no one person can encompass it nor so narrow and trivial that no one cares'' aligns with the principles of effective writing discussed in the text.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the importance of respecting readers'' perspectives, as emphasized in the section on "About Readers," and how this respect influences your approach to guiding them through a text.\n- **Part C**: Illustrate how personal feelings and opinions can enhance the reader''s experience, using an example from your own life or a hypothetical scenario that reflects the text''s message.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must integrate key concepts from the text, demonstrate critical thinking about writing strategies, and show a clear understanding of the relationship between subject selection and reader engagement.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Writing Principles to Real-World Scenarios**\n\nImagine you are tasked with writing a report for a business meeting that requires you to address a topic not of personal interest. Using the text''s guidance on choosing subjects and engaging readers, outline a step-by-step strategy for:\n- **Step 1**: Identify a subject that is within your expertise but still allows for personal insight.\n- **Step 2**: Structure the report to maintain reader engagement throughout, incorporating elements of clarity, voice, and sensibility.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how your approach reflects the text''s emphasis on making the subject ''interesting'' through a writer''s interpretation rather than just the topic itself.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate practical application of writing principles, show logical reasoning about reader expectations, and explicitly reference at least two concepts from the text (e.g., respecting readers, personal feelings in writing).'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Writing Ethics and Personal Expression**\n\nThe text argues that good writing has personality and that readers enjoy sensing a mind at work. However, it also acknowledges that writing does not necessarily make one morally better. Using these ideas, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the balance between personal expression and ethical responsibility is maintained in effective writing, based on the text''s discussion of ''growth as human beings through language.''\n- **Part B**: Reflect on a situation where your own writing might have expressed a personal opinion that could be seen as controversial. How would you approach this situation according to the text''s advice?\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that supports the claim: ''Writing is a form of growth for individuals, but it does not guarantee moral improvement.'' Use examples from the text and your own reasoning to back up this statement.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s themes of growth through writing, demonstrate critical thinking about ethical writing, and show a clear understanding of how personal expression interacts with reader engagement.'

- prompt: |-
    Ask yourself questions about your readers: What can I expect them to know and not know? What do they believe and value? How do I want to affect them by what I say? What attitudes and claims will meet with their approval? What will offend them? What objections may they have to my ideas, and how can I anticipate and counter those objections?

    Readers may be annoyed if you overestimate their knowledge. Tossing off unusual words may seem a put-down, a way of saying, "I know more than you." On the other hand, laboring the obvious also implies a low opinion of readers: don't tell them what a wheel is; they know. It isn't easy to gauge your readers' knowledge or to sense their beliefs and values. Sensitivity to readers comes only with experience, and then imperfectly. Tact and respect, however, go a long way. Readers have egos too.

    Kinds of Writing

    The various effects a writer may wish to have on his or her readers—to persuade, to inform, to entertain—result in different kinds of prose. The most common is prose that informs, which, depending on what it is about, is called exposition, description, or narration.

    Exposition explains. How a combustion engine works. How the economy functions. Facts of everyday life, like why people get divorced. History—why Custer attacked at the Little Big Horn. Controversial issues laden with feelings and responsibility, whatever its subject, exposition reveals what a particular mind thinks or knows or believes. Exposition is constructed logically. It organizes around cause/effect, true/false, less/more, positive/negative, general/particular, assertion/denial. Its movement is signaled by connectives like therefore, however, and so, besides, but, not only, more important, in fact, for example.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Expository Writing Principles**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text about exposition, describe a scenario where an expository essay would be most effective in communicating information to readers.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of the essay (e.g., to explain, to inform, or to clarify).\n- **Step 2**: Justify why the chosen topic is best suited for exposition based on the text''s discussion of cause/effect, true/false, and general/particular structures.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how connectives like ''therefore'' or ''however'' would be used to guide the reader through the essay''s logical flow.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of expository writing as defined in the text, with clear examples from the text''s explanation of exposition''s structure and purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Prose Purpose and Effects**\n\nThe text distinguishes between exposition, description, and narration. Choose one of these three types of prose and argue why it is more effective than the others in conveying a specific message or idea.\n- **Part A**: Define each type based on the text''s explanation (e.g., exposition explains, description paints a picture, narration tells a story).\n- **Part B**: Select one type and provide an example from real life where this form of prose is most appropriate. Explain why it is more suitable than the others for that context.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on logical organization in exposition might influence your choice of writing style for a particular audience or purpose.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the definitions from the text and demonstrate an ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different prose types based on their structure and purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning About Writing Styles**\n\nThe text mentions that writers may aim to persuade, inform, or entertain. Consider a situation where a writer must choose between exposition and persuasion.\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference between these two purposes as defined in the text (e.g., exposition reveals facts, persuasion seeks to convince).\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument for why persuasion might be more effective than exposition in a specific real-world scenario (e.g., political campaigning, advertising). Justify your claim using the text''s discussion of logical structure and connectives.\n- **Part C**: Identify potential objections to using persuasion over exposition and propose counterarguments based on the text''s advice about respecting readers'' egos and avoiding put-downs.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both writing purposes as defined in the text, along with the ability to evaluate their effectiveness in different contexts.'

    Description deals with perception. Its central problem is to arrange what we see into a picture-like the logic of exposition, the pattern is spatial: above/below, before/behind, right/left, and so on.

    The subject of narration is a series of related events—a story. Its problem is twofold: to arrange the events in a sequence of time and to reveal their significance.

    Persuasion seeks to alter how readers think or believe. It is usually about controversial topics and often appeals to reason in the form of argument, offering evidence or logical proof. Another form of persuasion is satire, which ridicules folly or evil, sometimes subtly, sometimes crudely and coarsely. Finally, persuasion may be in the form of eloquence, appealing to ideals and noble sentiments.

    Writing that is primarily entertaining includes fiction, personal essays, sketches. Such prose will receive less attention here. It is certainly important, but it is more remote from everyday needs than exposition or persuasion.

    For Practice

    > List ten or twelve topics you might develop into a short essay. Think of topics that deal not so much with things, places, or how-to-do projects as with your opinions and beliefs. Pick subjects that interest you and are within your experience, yet challenging. Be specific: don't simply write "my job" but something like "what I like most (or hate most) about my job."

    [> Selecting one of the topics on your list, compose a paragraph about the readers for whom you might develop it. Consider how
    you wish to affect those readers, what you want them to understand and feel. Think about their general knowledge, values, attitudes,
    biases; whether they are your age or older or younger, come from a similar or a different background; and how you would like them
    to regard you.

    8 INTRODUCTION


    CHAPTER

    Strategy and Style

    Purpose, the end you're aiming at, determines strategy and
    style. Strategy involves picking a topic to develop, deciding how to organize them, choosing this word rather than that, constructing various types of sentences, building paragraphs. Style is the result of strategy, the language that makes the strategy work.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Purpose and Strategy in Writing**\n\nUsing the definition of purpose provided in the text, explain how the purpose determines both strategy and style in writing. Provide a specific example from your own experience or create one that aligns with the principles described.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of your chosen writing task (e.g., to inform, persuade, entertain).\n- **Step 2**: Describe the corresponding strategy you would use to achieve this purpose (e.g., organizing information logically for exposition).\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the style (word choice, sentence structure) reflects the strategy and purpose.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your example must clearly demonstrate the relationship between purpose, strategy, and style as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Narrative Structure**\n\nThe text describes narration as a series of related events arranged in time to reveal significance. Using this definition, analyze a short story or narrative you have read (or create one).\n- **Part A**: Identify the chronological sequence of events and explain how they build toward a climax or resolution.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the significance of at least two events in the narrative and their relevance to the overall theme.\n- **Part C**: Compare your analysis to the text''s description of narration, highlighting how your example adheres to or diverges from the given definition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definition of narration with a detailed analysis of a specific narrative structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Persuasive Techniques**\n\nThe text identifies persuasion as involving argument, evidence, and satire. Using this framework, create a persuasive essay outline for a topic you are interested in.\n- **Part A**: Choose a controversial topic that aligns with the definition of persuasion provided in the text (e.g., "Should schools require uniforms?").\n- **Part B**: Outline your argument using at least two types of evidence (data, personal experience, expert opinion) and explain how each supports your position.\n- **Part C**: Incorporate a satirical element to highlight folly or evil in the topic, demonstrating an understanding of both argumentation and satire as forms of persuasion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your outline must reflect the text''s classification of persuasive techniques and demonstrate a clear connection between evidence, logic, and satire.'

    Think of purpose, strategy, and style in terms of increasing abstractness. Style is immediate and obvious. It exists in the writing itself; it is the sum of the actual words, sentences, paragraphs. Strategy is more abstract, felt beneath the words as the immediate ends they serve. Purpose is even deeper, supporting strategy and involving not only what you write about but how you affect readers.

    A brief example will clarify these overlapping concepts. It was written by a college student in a fifteen-minute exercise. The several topics from which the students could choose were stated beforehand—""treating,"' "ers," and so on—each writer had to think about restricting and organizing his or her composition. This student chose "marriage":

    Why get married? Or if you are modern, why live together? Answer:
    Insecurity. "Man needs woman; woman needs man." However, this
    cliché fails to explain need. How do you need someone of the
    opposite sex? Sexually is an insufficient explanation. Other animals
    do not stay with a mate for more than one season; some not even
    that long. Companionship, although a better answer, is also an in-
    complete explanation. We all have several friends. Why make one
    friend so significant that he at least partially excludes the others?
    Because we want to "join our lives." But this desire for joining is
    far from [semantic] We want someone to share our

    lives in order that we do not have to endure hardships alone.

    The writer's purpose is not so much to tell us of what she
    thinks about marriage as to convince us that what she thinks
    is true. Her purpose, then, is persuasive, and it leads to par-
    ticular strategies both of organization and of sentence style.
    Her organization is a formal question/answer strategy: a basic question ("Why get married?"); an
    initial, inadequate answer ("Insecurity"); a more precise ques-
    tion ("How do we need someone?"); a partial answer ("sex");
    then a second partial answer ("Companionship"); a final, more
    precise question ("Why make one friend so significant?");
    and a concluding answer ("so that we do not have to endure
    hardships alone").

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Purpose, Strategy, and Style in Persuasive Writing**\n\nUsing the provided example, analyze how the student''s purpose of persuasion influences both the organization and style of the writing.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary purpose of the text (persuasive) and explain how it shapes the structure (question/answer format).\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the stylistic choices (e.g., use of rhetorical questions, repetition of ''Why'' and ''How'') support the persuasive strategy.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this approach is effective for persuading readers about the necessity of marriage.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect purpose to both organizational strategies and stylistic elements, demonstrating an understanding of how these components work together in persuasion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Logical Reasoning in Argument Construction**\n\nEvaluate the student''s argument about why people get married.\n- **Part A**: Identify the logical progression of ideas from the initial ''cliché'' (insecurity) to the final conclusion (''so that we do not have to endure hardships alone''). Explain how each step builds upon the previous one.\n- **Part B**: Assess the validity of the argument by considering whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Provide reasoning based on the text''s structure and content.\n- **Part C**: Propose a counterargument that challenges the student''s conclusion, using logical reasoning to question the necessity of marriage as described.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of logical progression in arguments and the ability to construct a valid counterargument based on the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Writing Strategies to Real-World Topics**\n\nIf you were to write an essay about a topic similar to ''marriage'' (e.g., ''Why choose a college major?''), how would you apply the strategies discussed in the text?\n- **Step 1**: Outline a question/answer structure for your essay, identifying at least three questions and corresponding answers.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the stylistic choices (e.g., rhetorical questions, repetition) used in the example could be adapted to enhance persuasion in your essay.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this approach would be effective for persuading readers about the chosen topic.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the writing strategies from the text into a practical application, demonstrating an ability to transfer these concepts to a new topic.'

- prompt: |-
    The persuasive purpose is also reflected in the writer's strategy of short emphatic sentences. They are convincing, and they establish an appropriate informal relationship with readers.

    Finally, the student's purpose determines her strategy in approaching the subject and in presenting herself. About the topic, the writer avoids becoming pompous. As for herself, she adopts an impersonal point of view, avoiding such expressions as "I think" or "it seems to me." On another occasion they might suggest a pleasing modesty; here they would weaken the force of her argument.

    These strategies are effectively realized in the style: in the clear rhetorical questions, each immediately followed by a straightforward answer; and in the short uncomplicated sentences, echoing speech. (There are even two sentences that are grammatically insupportable—afic iBwer: "cause we want to Jornlives."") At the same time the sentences are sufficiently concise to achieve a strategy fundamental to all good presentation—the reader's attention.

    Remember several things about strategy. First, it is many-sided. Any piece of prose displays not one but numerous strategic elements, of sentence structure, of word choice, of point of view, of tone. In effective writing these reinforce one another.

    Second, no absolute one-to-one correspondence exists between strategy and purpose. A specific strategy may be adapted to various purposes. The question/answer mode of organizing, for example, is not confined to persuasion: it is often used in informative writing. Furthermore, a particular purpose may be served by different strategies. In our example the student's organization was not the only one possible. Another writer might have organized using a "list" strategy:

    People get married for a variety of reasons. First... Second... Third... Finally...

    Still another might have used a personal point of view, or taken a less serious approach, or assumed a more formal relationship with the reader.

    In its broadest sense "style" is the total of all the choices a
    writer makes concerning words and their arrangements. In
    this sense style may be good or Hathe-gloaides are
    appropriate to the writer's purpose, bad if they are not. More
    narrowly, "style" has a positive, approving sense, as when we
    say that someone has "style" or praise a writer for his or her
    "style." More narrowly yet, the word may also designate a
    particular way of writing, unique to a person or characteristic
    of a group or profession: "Hemingway's style," "an academic
    style."

    12 INTRODUCTION

    Here we use style to mean something between those ex-
    tremes. It will be a positive term, and while we speak of errors
    in style, we don't speak of "bad styles." On the other hand,
    we understand "style" to include many ways of writing, each
    appropriate for some purposes, less so for others. There is no
    one style, some ideal manner of writing at which all of us
    should aim. Style is flexible, capable of almost endless varia-
    tion. But one thing style is not: it is not a superficial fanciness
    brushed over the basic ideas. Rather than the gilding, style is
    the deep essence of writing.

    For Practice

    > Selecting one of the topics you listed at the end of Chapter 1,
    work up a paragraph of ft5Qvord20(efore you begin to

    write, think about possible strategies of organization and tone. Or-
    ganization involves (1) how you analyze your topic, the parts into
    which you divide it, and (2) the order in which you present these
    parts and how you tie them together. Tone means fidw you feel
    about your suyeet—abpjemive, and so on; (2) how

    you regard your eddenatior an informal relationship;

    and (3) how you present yourself.

    When you have the paragraph in its final shape, on a separate
    sheet of paper compose several sentences explaining what strate-
    gies you followed in organizing your paragraph and in aiming for
    a particular tone, and why you thought these would be appropriate.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Style Concepts**\n\nDefine ''style'' based on the text''s three different interpretations provided. Then, using the definition that ''style is the deep essence of writing,'' explain why a writer should focus on substance rather than superficial embellishments. Support your argument with examples from the text and logical reasoning about the relationship between content and presentation in effective communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all three interpretations of style and demonstrate an understanding of how the text differentiates between surface-level features and meaningful writing essence.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Writing Strategies**\n\nUsing the ''For Practice'' section instructions, create a paragraph on the topic of ''the importance of technology in education.'' Follow the guidelines for organization (analyzing your topic into parts, deciding presentation order) and tone (your feelings about the topic, your relationship to the audience, and self-presentation). After writing the paragraph, compose a 3-sentence explanation detailing your organizational strategies and tone choices.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain how your paragraph reflects the chosen organization strategy.\n- **Part B**: Justify why the selected tone is appropriate for the topic and audience.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on ''deep essence'' relates to your writing choices.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate mastery of both organizational strategies and tonal decisions as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Grammar and Mechanics**\n\nThe text discusses grammar, usage, and mechanics as essential components of effective writing. Consider the sentence: ''She did not know that he was going to call her.''\n- **Part A**: Identify and correct any grammatical errors in the sentence using the text''s guidelines on subject-verb agreement and pronoun usage.\n- **Part B**: Explain how proper grammar and mechanics contribute to the ''deep essence'' of writing, as described in the text. Use logical reasoning to connect these elements to the broader concept of style.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim that ''grammar is only about following rules.'' Your example must reference at least two aspects from the text (e.g., usage, mechanics) and explain how they relate to meaningful communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate grammar, usage, and mechanics with the text''s overall definition of style.'

- prompt: |-
    Purpose, strategy, and style are decided by you. But the decision must be made within limits set by rules over which you have little control. The rules fall into three groups: grammar, usage, and mechanics.

    Grammar

    Grammar means the rules which structure our language. The sentence "She dresses beautifully" is grammatical. These variations are not:

    Her dresses beautifully.
    Dresses beautifully she.

    The first rule that a pronoun must be in the subjective case when it is the subject of a verb. The second violates the conventional order of the English sentence: subject-verb-object. (That order is not invariable and may be altered, subject to other rules, but none of these permits the pattern: "Dresses beautifully she.")

    Grammatical rules are not the pronouncements of teachers, editors, or other authorities. They are simply the way people speak and write, and if enough people begin to speak and write, the rules change.

    Usage

    Usage designates rules of a less basic and binding sort, concerning how we should use the language in certain situations. These sentences, for instance, violate formal usage:

    She dresses beautiful.
    She ain't got no dress.

    Sentences like these are often heard in speech, but both break rules governing how educated people write. Formal usage dictates that when beautiful functions as an adverb it takes an -ed ending, that ain and a double negative like got n't or haven't got no should be avoided.

    Grammar and usage are often confused. Many people would argue that the sentences above are "ungrammatical." Our distinction, however, is more useful. Grammatical rules are implicit in the speech of all who use the language. Usage rules, on the other hand, stem from and change with social pressure. Ain't, for example, was once acceptable. The adverbial use of an adjective like beautiful was common in seventeenth-century prose. Chaucer and Shakespeare use double negatives for emphasis.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Grammatical Structure**\n\nConsider the sentence: "She dresses beautifully."\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain the grammatical function of each word in the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Compare this sentence with the ungrammatical example: "Her dresses beautifully." Explain why the pronoun ''her'' is incorrect in this context, referencing the rule that a pronoun must be in the subjective case when it is the subject of a verb.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how grammatical rules are not absolute but can change over time, using examples from the text such as the shift in usage of ''ain''t'' and the historical use of adverbs like ''beautifully.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of subject-verb agreement, pronoun cases, and the evolution of language rules.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Formal Usage**\n\nExamine the sentence: "She dresses beautiful."\n- **Part A**: Identify the error in this sentence according to formal usage rules. Explain why ''beautiful'' should be modified with an -ed ending when used as an adverb.\n- **Part B**: Compare this error with the informal sentence: "She ain''t got no dress." Discuss how formal usage differs from informal speech, citing examples from the text about the historical acceptance of ''ain''t'' and double negatives.\n- **Part C**: Propose a correction for the informal sentence that aligns with formal usage standards. Justify your choice based on the rules governing educated writing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must address both grammatical correctness and formal usage, showing an awareness of the distinction between spoken and written language.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Language Change**\n\nThe text suggests that grammar is a reflection of how people speak, while usage is influenced by social pressures.\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference between grammatical rules and usage rules using examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the historical shift in the use of ''beautifully'' as an adverb. How does this shift reflect changes in language over time?\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why certain words, like ''ain''t,'' might be considered nonstandard but still acceptable in informal contexts. Support your argument with examples from the text about the evolution of language and social pressures.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both grammatical and usage principles, demonstrating an understanding of how language evolves and is regulated by societal norms.'

    The fact that usage rules are less basic than grammatical ones, however, and even that they may seem arbitrary, does not lessen their force. Most of them contribute to clarity and economy of expression. Moreover, usage applies to all levels of purpose and strategy, to informal, colloquial styles as well as to formal ones. For example, grammatically incomplete sentences (or fragments), frowned upon in formal usage, are occasionally permissible and even valuable in informal composition. (Witness the two fragments in the student paragraph on marriage on page 8.) So is regarded in formal English as a subordinating conjunction which ought not to introduce a

    GRAMMAR, USAGE, AND MECHANICS 15

    sentence. But in a colloquial style, it may work better than a more literary connective like consequently or therefore.

    Mechanics

    In composition, mechanics refers to the appearance of words, to how they are spelled or arranged on paper. The fact that the first word of a paragraph is usually indented, for example, is a matter of mechanics. These sentences violate other rules of mechanics:

    she dresses beautifully
    She dresses beautifuly.

    Conventions of writing require that a sentence begin with a capital letter and end with full-stop punctuation (period, question mark, or exclamation point). Conventions of spelling require that beautifully have two Is.

    The rules gathered under the heading of mechanics attempt to make writing consistent and clear. They may seem arbitrary, but they have evolved from centuries of experience. Generally they represent, if not the only way of solving a problem, an economic and efficient way.

    Along with mechanics we include punctuation, a very complicated subject and by no means purely mechanical. While some punctuation is cut-and-dried, much of it falls into the province of usage or style. Later, in the chapter on punctuation, we'll discuss the distinctions between mechanical and stylistic uses of commas, dashes, and so on.

    Grammar, Usage, and Style

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Grammar and Mechanics in Composition**\n\nAnalyze the following student paragraph excerpt regarding marriage (from page 8):\n\n"Marriage is a partnership where two people share their lives. It''s not just about sex, but about love and commitment. However, some people might think that marriage is only for pleasure."\n\n- **Task A**: Identify at least three grammatical errors in the paragraph. Explain each error using the text''s definition of grammar.\n- **Task B**: Determine if the sentence "It''s not just about sex, but about love and commitment" is grammatically complete. Justify your answer based on the text''s discussion of incomplete sentences (fragments).\n- **Task C**: Propose a revision that improves both the mechanics (capitalization, punctuation) and clarity of the paragraph. Ensure your revised version adheres to formal usage rules while maintaining the original intent.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both grammatical and mechanical conventions as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Usage vs. Mechanics in Punctuation**\n\nConsider the sentence: "She dresses beautifuly."\n- **Task A**: Identify the mechanical error in this sentence and explain why it violates writing conventions (e.g., spelling, capitalization).\n- **Task B**: Explain the difference between mechanical and stylistic uses of punctuation based on the text''s discussion. Provide an example from the text that illustrates this distinction.\n- **Task C**: Create a sentence that intentionally breaks a mechanical rule but adheres to usage guidelines. Justify why such a sentence might be acceptable in informal writing according to the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly differentiate between mechanical and usage-based rules, as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Usage Rules**\n\nThe text states that "usage applies to all levels of purpose and strategy, to informal, colloquial styles as well as to formal ones."\n- **Part A**: Explain why a subordinating conjunction like "although" might be considered acceptable in an informal context despite being traditionally used in formal writing. Provide an example from the text that supports this idea.\n- **Part B**: Construct a sentence that uses a grammatically incomplete sentence (fragment) effectively in an informal context. Justify why this fragment enhances clarity or expression in the given context.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the role of usage rules in formal versus informal writing, referencing specific examples from the text. Discuss how these rules contribute to the effectiveness of different writing styles.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion on usage and mechanics, demonstrating an understanding of their roles in various types of writing.'

    Grammar, usage, and mechanics establish the ground rules of
    writing, circumscribing what you are free to do. Within their
    limits, you select various strategies and work out those strat-
    egies in terms of words, sentences, paragraphs. The ground
    rules, however, are relatively inflexible, broken at your peril.

    16 INTRODUCTION

    It is not always easy to draw the line between grammar and
    usage or between usage and style. Broadly, grammar is what
    you must do as a user of English; usage, what you should do
    as a writer of more or less formal (or informal) English; and
    style, what you elect to do to work out your strategies and
    realize your purposes.

    "Her dresses beautifully," we said, represents an error in
    grammar, and "She dresses beautiful," a mistake in usage.
    "She dresses in a beautiful manner," however, is a lapse in
    style. The sentence breaks no rule of grammar or of usage,
    but it is not effective (assuming that the writer wants to stress
    the idea of "beauty"). The structure slurs the emphasis, which
    should be on the key word and which should close the state-

    ments "Sheutifully."
    Most of our difficulties with words and sentences involve
    style. For native speakers, grammar—in sense—is
    likely to be a serious problem. Usage (which includes much
    of what is popularly called "grammar") and mechanics are
    more troublesome. But generally these require simply that
    you learn clearly defined conventions. And having learned
    them, you will find that rather than being restrictive they free
    you to choose more effectively among the options available
    to you as a writer.

    Style is less reducible to rule, and more open to argument.
    No one can prove "She dresses in a beautiful manner" is
    poorer than "She dresses beautifully." (One can even imagine
    a context in which the longer sentence would be preferable.)
    Even so, it violates a principle observed by good writers; use
    no more words than you must.

    You may think of that principle as a "rule" of style. We
    shall discuss and illustrate that and other stylistic "rules," but
    remember: they are generalizations about what good writers
    do, not laws dictating what all writers must do.

    words on flaperstdpss thinking about it, doing it,

    and doing it again (and again and again, as often as time will
    allow and patience will endure).

    The ftegt, "thinking," involves choosing a subject, ex-
    ploring ways of developing it, and devising strategies of or-
    ganization and style. The second step, "doing," is usually
    called "drafting"; and the third, "doing again," is "revising."
    The next several chapters take a brief look at these steps of
    the writing process.

    First a warning. They're not really "steps," not in the usual
    sense anyway. You don't write by (1) doing all your thinking,
    (2) finishing a draft, and then (3) completing a revision. Ac-
    tually you do all these things at once.

    If that sounds mysterious, it's because writing is a complex
    activity. As you think about a topic you are already beginning
    to select words and construct stheenwexdsinto
    draft. As you draft and as you revise, the thinking goes on:
    you discover new ideas, realize you've gone down a dead end,
    discover an implication you hadn't seen before.

    It's helpful to conceive of writing as a process having, in a
    broad and loose sense, three steps. But remember that you
    don't move from step to step in smooth and steady progress.

    You go back and forth. As you work on a composition you
    will be, at any given point, concentrating on one phase of

    writing. But always you are engaged with the process in its

    entirety.

    Looking for Subjects

    People write for lots of reasons. Sometimes it's part of the
    job. A sales manager is asked to report on a new market, or
    an executive to discuss the feasibility of moving a plant to
    another state. A psychology student has to turn in a twenty-
    page term paper, or a member of an art club must prepare a
    two-page introduction to an exhibit.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Writing Motivations**\n\nThe text mentions various reasons people write, including job-related tasks and academic requirements. Consider the following two scenarios:\n- **Scenario A**: A marketing executive needs to prepare a report on market trends for a client.\n- **Scenario B**: A college student is writing an essay for a history class.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three different purposes or contexts in which writing is used, drawing from the text''s examples.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the purpose of writing influences the structure and content of the final composition. Use specific details from the text to support your argument.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the text emphasizes that ''writing is a complex activity'' in relation to these different purposes.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate multiple examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how purpose shapes the writing process.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Writing Phases**\n\nThe text describes the writing process as involving three phases: thinking, doing (drafting), and revising. However, it also clarifies that these phases are not sequential but occur simultaneously. Consider the following statements:\n- **Statement 1**: ''You don''t write by (1) doing all your thinking, (2) finishing a draft, and then (3) completing a revision.''\n- **Statement 2**: ''As you think about a topic, you are already beginning to select words and construct sentences into a draft.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the text considers these phases as overlapping rather than separate. Use examples from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part B**: Create a hypothetical writing scenario where all three phases are actively engaged at once. Describe how each phase contributes to the overall process.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s description of ''going back and forth'' challenges the traditional view of writing as a linear process. Use logical reasoning based on the text''s explanation of continuous engagement with the process.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate deep understanding of the text''s perspective on the writing process and its implications for creative problem solving.'

    In such cases the subject is given, and the first step is chiefly
    a matter of research, of finding information. Even the prob-
    lem of organizing the information is often bymplified
    lowing a conventional plan, as with scientific papers or busi-
    ness letters. Which is not to dismiss such writing as easy.
    Being clear and concise is never easy. (To say nothing of being
    interesting!) But at least the writing process is structured and
    to that degree simplified.

    At other times we write because we want to express some-
    thing about ourselves, about what we've experienced or how
    we feel. Our minds turn inward, and writing is complicated
    by the double role we play. / am the subject, which somehow
    the /who writes must express in words. And there is a further
    complication. In personal writing, words are not simply an
    expression of the self; they help to create the self. In struggling
    to say what we are, we become what we say.

    Such writing is perhaps the most rewarding kind. But it is
    20 THE WRITING PROCESS

    also the most challenging and the most frustrating. We are
    thrown relentlessly upon our own ddsoundepect is

    elusive, and the effect can be a kind of paralysis. And so peo-
    ple say, "I can't think of anything to write about."

    That's strange, because life is fascinating. The solution is to
    open yourself to experience. To look around. To describe
    what you see and hear. To read. Reading takes you into other
    minds and enriches your own. A systematic way of enriching
    your ideas and experiences is to keep a commonplace book
    and a journal.

    The Commonplace Book

    A commonplace book is a record of things we have read or
    heard and want to remember: a proverb, a remark by a writer
    of unusual sensibility, a witty or a wise saying, or even some-
    thing silly or foolish or crass:

    Sincerity always hits me something sikep. | mean, if you try to
    get it too hard, you won't. w. H. Auden

    A journal is not for others to read. So you don't have to worry about niceties of punctuation; you can use abbreviations and symbols like "&." But if a journal is really to help you develop as a writer, you've got to do more than compose trite commonplaces or mechanically list what happens each day. You have to look honestly and freshly at the world around you and at the self within. And that means you have to wrestle with words to tell what you see and what you feel:

    But journals do not have to be so extraordinary in their sensibility or introspection. Few people are that perceptive. The essential thing is that a journal captures your experience and feelings. Here is another, different example, also fresh and revealing. The writer, Rockwell Stensrud, kept a pournal accompanied an old-time cattle drive staged in 1975 as part of the Bicentennial celebration:

    Exploring for Topics

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Journal Writing Principles**\n\nUsing the insights from the provided journal entries and the text''s discussion on journal writing, compose a short journal entry (2-3 paragraphs) reflecting on a recent personal challenge. Your entry must include:\n- A vivid description of the situation using sensory details (e.g., sights, sounds, emotions).\n- An analysis of your internal conflict or emotional struggle, referencing the idea that journals should ''wrestle with words to tell what you see and feel.''\n- A conclusion that reflects on how this experience has changed your understanding of self-reflection.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: The journal entry must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s emphasis on honesty, introspection, and the role of language in capturing personal experiences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Comparative Analysis of Journaling Styles**\n\nCompare and contrast the two journal excerpts provided (Sylvia Plath''s and Rockwell Stensrud''s) based on the text''s discussion of journal writing. Your response should address:\n- The purpose and tone of each entry, including how they reflect different approaches to introspection.\n- The use of language and structure in each journal: does one prioritize poetic expression while the other focuses on practical observation?\n- The implications of these differences for the writer''s intent and the value of each style in personal development.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s arguments about the importance of capturing ''experience and feelings'' and the role of journals in ''developing as a writer.'''
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Journal Writing Techniques**\n\nDesign a journal entry that combines elements from both journal styles (Plath''s poetic introspection and Stensrud''s practical observation) to reflect on a recent event. Your entry must:\n- Begin with a specific, vivid scene or moment (e.g., a place, an action, a feeling).\n- Incorporate both introspective reflection and external observation, using the text''s advice about ''wrestling with words.''\n- Conclude with a personal insight or realization that demonstrates growth in self-awareness.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: The entry must show an understanding of the text''s emphasis on honesty, creativity, and the transformative potential of journaling.'

    Before beginning a draft, you need to explore a subject, looking for topics. (Subject refers to the main focus of a composition; topic to specific aspects of the subject. The subject of this book is writing. Within that subject grammar, sentence style, and so on, are topics. Any topic, of course, can itself be analyzed into subtopics.)

    Some people like to work through a subject systematically, uncovering topics by asking questions. Others prefer a less structured, less analytical approach, a kind of brainstorming. They just begin to rapidly and loosely, letting ideas tumble out in free association. Then they edit what they've done, discarding some topics, selecting others for further development.

    Neither way is better. Which you use depends on your habits of mind, how much you already know about a subject, and of course the subject itself. If you are writing about something that is easily analyzed—why one candidate should be elected, for instance, rather than some other—already thought a good deal about the matter, the analytical, questioning approach is better. But if your subject is more complex, something you haven't thought long and hard, you may get stuck if you try systematic analysis. It might be better to scribble, to get ideas on paper, any ideas, however far-fetched, in whatever order.

    Finding Topics by Asking Questions

    What happened?

    How?

    When?

    Why? What caused it? What were the reasons?
    How can the subject be defined?

    What does it imply or entail?

    What limits should be set to it?

    Are there exceptions and qualifications?

    What examples are there?

    Can the subject be analyzed into parts or aspects?
    Can these parts be grouped in any way?

    What is the subject similar to?

    What is it different from?

    Has it advantages or virtues?

    Has it disadvantages or defects?

    What have other people said about it?

    These are general questions, of course; and they are not the only ones you might ask. Particular subjects will suggest others. Nor will all of these questions be equally applicable in every case. But usually five or six will lead to topics.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Questioning Strategies for Topic Development**\n\nCompare and contrast the two approaches described in the text for uncovering topics: systematic questioning and brainstorming.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary purpose of each method (e.g., systematic questioning is best for...).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the effectiveness of each approach depends on factors like prior knowledge and subject complexity.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of a topic that would be better suited to one method over the other, using the text''s suggested questions as a guide.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the two strategies and demonstrate understanding of when each is most appropriate.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Creative Application of Questioning Techniques**\n\nDesign a set of five original questions that would help uncover topics for a writing assignment on the subject: "The impact of social media on mental health in adolescents."\n- **Step 1**: Use the text''s suggested question categories (e.g., ''What happened?'', ''What does it imply?'') as a framework.\n- **Step 2**: Ensure your questions are open-ended and thought-provoking, encouraging exploration of multiple aspects of the topic.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why each question is relevant to the subject, referencing specific categories from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your five questions must be distinct and demonstrate an understanding of both the text''s questioning strategies and the nature of the subject being explored.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analytical Reasoning with Topic Development**\n\nThe text suggests that not all questions are equally applicable to every subject. Choose a topic from your own experience (e.g., ''The role of technology in education'') and explain why certain questions from the text would be more relevant than others.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two questions from the text that you believe are most applicable to your chosen topic.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why these questions are particularly useful, referencing specific categories (e.g., ''What examples are there?'').\n- **Step 3**: Explain how answering these questions would contribute to the development of a coherent argument or analysis.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate critical thinking about how different question types can shape the exploration of a topic.'

    Suppose, for example, you are interested in how young adults (20 to 30) in the 1960s differ from similar people in the 1990s. Try asking questions. Consider definition. What do you mean by "differ"? Differ how? In dress style? Eating habits? Political loyalties? Lifestyle? Attitudes toward love, sex, marriage? Toward success, work, money?

    Already you have topics, perhaps too many. Another question suggests itself: Which of these topics do I want to focus on? Or, put another way: How shall I limit the subject? The choice would not be purely arbitrary; it would depend partly on your interests and partly on your ambitions. In a book you might cover all these topics. In a ten-page paper only one or two or three. We'll imagine a short paper and focus on love, sex, and marriage.

    Now you have three major topics. How to organize them? Sex, love, and marriage seems a reasonable order. Next, each topic needs to be explored, which you do by again asking questions. How do the attitudes of the sixties and the nineties differ? Why? For example, look at popular culture (songs, advertisements, magazine articles, films), sociological studies? Can you find useful quotations or stories or movies that support your points? Are there virtues in the attitudes of the nineties? Disadvantages? How do you evaluate those of the sixties? Was a comparable generational shift in values evident in other places and other times?

    You're not going to get answers off the top of your head. But at least you know what you're looking for. You can begin to collect information, interviewing friends, studying magazines and movies and television shows, reading novels and stories, looking into scholarly studies of changing social attitudes.

    You've got a lot to write about.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Argumentative Structure**\n\nUsing the framework provided in the text, design an argumentative essay comparing the attitudes toward love, sex, and marriage among young adults aged 20-30 in the 1960s and 1990s.\n- **Step 1**: Outline a clear thesis statement that addresses how these attitudes differ across the two eras.\n- **Step 2**: Develop three supporting paragraphs, each focusing on one of the topics (love, sex, marriage), using the text''s suggestions for organizing ideas.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude by evaluating the societal implications of these generational shifts in values.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s guidance on topic selection, organization, and argumentative structure. It should include at least two specific examples from the text (e.g., popular culture, sociological studies) to support your analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Research Methods**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of gathering information, design a research plan to investigate differences in attitudes toward love, sex, and marriage among young adults in two different decades.\n- **Part A**: Identify three primary sources you would use (e.g., scholarly studies, advertisements, films) and explain how each contributes to understanding generational attitudes.\n- **Part B**: Describe a secondary source you might consult (e.g., sociological surveys, historical documents) and justify its relevance to your research question.\n- **Part C**: Propose a method for evaluating the validity of your findings, considering the text''s emphasis on critical thinking in information gathering.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s suggestions for collecting and analyzing information. It should demonstrate an understanding of how different sources can provide evidence for or against generational shifts in attitudes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Writing**\n\nUsing the text''s framework, create a short narrative that illustrates the differences in attitudes toward love, sex, and marriage between young adults in the 1960s and 1990s.\n- **Step 1**: Write a scene set in the 1960s that reflects the era''s values regarding these topics.\n- **Step 2**: Write a contrasting scene set in the 1990s that highlights changes in attitudes.\n- **Step 3**: Use dialogue or descriptions to show how societal norms and personal choices differ between the two time periods.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your narrative must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s guidance on organizing ideas and using examples from popular culture. It should include at least one specific reference to a cultural artifact (e.g., song, film) mentioned in the text as a means of illustrating generational attitudes.'

    Thus both methods of exploration have led to topics, the
    rudiments of an essay. But notice that while they cover the
    same general subject, they have led in rather different direc-
    tions. The analytical questions have stressed wabat—the
    ture of the changes in attitude; the free writing has stressed
    wégserthdor the changes.

    These different emphases were not planned. They just hap-
    pened. And that suggests an important fact: it is profitable to
    use both methods to explore for topics. Questions have the
    advantage of focusing your attention. But a focused attention
    sees only what is under the lens, and that is a severe limitation.
    Brainstorming can be wasteful, leading in too many direc-
    tions. But it is more likely to extend a subject in unforeseen
    ways and to make unexpected connections.

    The two methods, then, are complementary, not antithet-
    ical. Temperamentally, you may prefer one or the other. But
    it's wise to try both.

    EXPLORING FOR TOPICS 27

    For Practice

    > Below is a series of provocative quotations. Select one that
    appeals to you and explore it for topics. You don't have to agree
    with the idea. The goal is just to get your thoughts on paper.

    First, fill one or two pages with free writing. Put down everything
    that comes to mind. Then try the more analytical approach of ask-
    ing questions. (A variation of this exercise is to work with several
    friends; group brainstorming can be more productive than working
    alone.)

    CHAPTER

    Making a Plan

    You've chosen a subject (or had one chosen for you), explored
    it, thought about the topics you discovered, gathered infor-
    mation about them. Now what? Are you ready to begin
    writing?

    Well, yes. But first you need a plan. Perhaps nothing more
    than a loose sense of purpose, held in your mind and never
    written piawmraswans call a head arrangement.

    Head arrangements can work very yoallhaife the right
    kind of head and if you're thoroughly familiar with the
    subject.

    But sometimes all of us (and most times most of us) require
    a more tangible plan. One kind is a statement of purpose;
    another is a preliminary, scratch outline.

    The Statement of Purpose

    It's nothing pemplapitedriavo broadly de-

    scribing what you want to say, how you're going to organize
    it, what you want readers to understand, feel, believe. The
    paragraphs are written for yourself, to clarify your ideas and
    to give you a guide; you don't have to worry about any-
    one else's reading them. Even so, you may find on occasion
    that composing a statement of purpose is difficult, perhaps

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Literary Quotes and Themes**\n\nAnalyze the quote "If we wanted to be happy it would be easy; but we want to be happier than other people, which is almost always difficult..." by Montesquieu. How does this sentiment relate to the broader theme of "The Writing Process" as discussed in Chapter 12 of the text?\n- **Step 1**: Identify the core idea of Montesquieu''s quote regarding human desire for happiness and comparison with others.\n- **Step 2**: Connect this idea to the writing process, particularly the ''Making a Plan'' section.\n- **Step 3**: Use logical reasoning to explain how the pursuit of perfection in writing (as suggested by the quote) influences the planning phase.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both the literary quote and the text''s discussion on writing plans without referencing external materials.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Writing Strategies with Literary Examples**\n\nUsing the "Statement of Purpose" concept from the text, create a hypothetical statement for a college application essay. The statement should incorporate at least two of the following quotes: \n- "A lawyer has no business with the justice or injustice of the cause..." by Samuel Johnson\n- "[College is] four years under the ethercone breathe deep gently now..." by John Dos Passos\n- "The thing is worth itd@imgrth doing badly. Chesterton G. K."\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Write a 3-4 sentence statement of purpose that reflects your academic goals and personal philosophy, incorporating one of the quotes.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the chosen quote influences your approach to writing the essay, based on the text''s explanation of the ''Statement of Purpose'' as a self-guiding tool.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the other two quotes are not suitable for this particular statement.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s definition of a Statement of Purpose and the appropriate use of literary references.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking with Writing Processes**\n\nThe text discusses ''head arrangements'' as a way to organize writing, but also mentions that "sometimes all of us...require a more tangible plan." Using this duality, create a comparison between two different approaches to planning for a writing project.\n- **Part A**: Define ''head arrangement'' based on the text and explain its role in the writing process.\n- **Part B**: Describe an alternative planning method (not mentioned in the text) that you would use for a different type of writing, such as a research paper or creative nonfiction.\n- **Part C**: Use logical reasoning to argue why both approaches are necessary depending on the writer''s familiarity with the subject matter.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s concepts with your own reasoning about writing strategies.'

    It seems to me that today people in their twenties feel differently about sex, love, and marriage than young people did in the 1960s. I'm not claiming the differences are universal, that every young adult today feels one way, while every young adult twenty years ago felt another. Just that the predominant tone has changed. I want to identify and describe these differences, focusing on the nineties, and to discuss why the changes came about. See a problem of organization. Am going to organize primarily around the differences themselves, first attitudes toward sex, then attitudes towards love and marriage? In this case, a discussion of causes would be subordinate. On the other hand, could make the causes my main points of organization, beginning with a relatively detailed discussion of how attitudes today are different, but spending most of the paper in discussing how feminism, the hardening economy, and a tougher, more self-centered approach to life have combined to bring about the changes. Think this second way. What I want readers to see is less of the facts about the new attitudes to-

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Thematic Organization**\n\nThe text discusses two potential organizational approaches for analyzing changes in young adults'' views on sex, love, and marriage: one focusing primarily on differences themselves, the other emphasizing causes as the main focus.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain which organizational approach (differences or causes) is more effective for conveying the author''s primary purpose. Justify your answer with reasoning from the text.\n- **Part B**: Propose a hybrid organizational structure that combines elements of both approaches. Describe how this structure would allow the paper to balance description of changes with analysis of their causes.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference specific statements from the text and demonstrate an understanding of the author''s intent.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Historical Contextual Changes**\n\nThe author notes that young adults today have different attitudes toward sex, love, and marriage compared to those in the 1960s.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify two specific historical factors mentioned in the text that contributed to these changes. Explain how each factor influenced the shift in attitudes.\n- **Part B**: Using evidence from the text, argue whether the author believes these changes are primarily due to social trends or individual choices. Support your argument with direct quotes or paraphrased statements from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate textual details and demonstrate critical analysis of the author''s perspective.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluation of Argument Structure**\n\nThe text presents a dilemma in organizing the paper: focus on differences or causes. The author ultimately decides to prioritize causes as the main discussion point.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Evaluate the effectiveness of this organizational choice based on the author''s stated purpose. Provide specific reasons why focusing on causes aligns with or diverges from the author''s goal.\n- **Part B**: Suggest one alternative structure that could better serve the author''s intent. Explain how this alternative would address potential limitations of the chosen approach.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect a clear understanding of the text''s argumentative strategies and their implications for essay organization.'

    The Scratch Outline

    An outline is a way of dividing a subject into its major parts,
    of dividing these in turn into subparts, and so on, into finer
    and finer detail. There are formal outlines, which are usually
    turned in with a composition and even serve as compositions
    in their own right. And there are informal outlines, often
    called "working" or "scratch" outlines. The formal variety
    follesthat prescribe the alternating use of numbers and

    letters and the way in which the analysis must proceed. But
    formal outlines and their rules will not concern us here.

    Our interest is in the scratch outline, which serves only the
    writer's use and may be cast in any form that works. Begin
    by asking: What are the major sections of my composition?
    For example:

    1.Beginning
    Il. How attitudes toward sex, love, and marriage in the di#f@0s
    from those in the 1960s
    lll. Why the differences occurred
    IV. Closing

    Now apply a similar question to each major section:

    I.Beginning
    A. Identify subject and establish foeuseasons for the
    change rather than on the change itself
    B. Quality and limit: attitudes in question are the predominat-
    ing ones, those which set the tone of a generation
    Il. How attitudes toward sex, love, and marriage differ in the 1990s
    from those in the 1960s

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Outline Development**\n\nUsing the provided scratch outline structure, create a detailed outline for an essay on ''The Impact of Technology on Social Isolation.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the major sections (Introduction, Body I, Body II, Conclusion).\n- **Step 2**: For each major section, develop subpoints based on the example given in the text (e.g., for Body I, consider ''Changes in Communication Patterns'').\n- **Step 3**: Justify the structure of your outline by explaining how it reflects the principles of scratch outlining as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your outline must be comprehensive and demonstrate an understanding of the purpose and flexibility of scratch outlines.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Outline Logic**\n\nModify the provided scratch outline for ''The Role of Attitudes Toward Sex, Love, and Marriage in Social Change'' by adding a new section on ''The Influence of Media and Cultural Trends.''\n- **Step 1**: Insert this new section as a subpoint under one of the existing major sections.\n- **Step 2**: For the new section, create at least two subpoints that address specific ways media and cultural trends have influenced these attitudes.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this addition aligns with the text''s description of scratch outlines as flexible tools for writers.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show an understanding of how to expand an outline while maintaining its logical flow.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Outline Structure**\n\nCompare and contrast the structure of a formal outline (as described in the text) with a scratch outline, using the provided example as a reference.\n- **Part A**: Explain the key differences between formal and scratch outlines based on the text''s description.\n- **Part B**: Using the example from the text, demonstrate how a scratch outline can be more adaptable for exploring complex topics.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example of a formal outline for the same topic as in the text (e.g., ''The Role of Attitudes Toward Sex, Love, and Marriage in Social Change'') and explain why it would be more rigid than a scratch outline.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of structure flexibility and purpose from the text to demonstrate a clear understanding of both types of outlines.'

- prompt: "C. Dialogue material; avoid early marriage, first get career on track  \nIII. Why the differences occurred  \nA. Better opportunities for women and greater independence; also stronger sense of their own worth—all this weakens the allure of love and marriage  \nB.

The attitudes of the nineties more realistic, less prone to disillusion  \nB. But perhaps idealism has been sacrificed, or weakened, and the prevailing materialism is too ready to sell the world short  \n\nThus the analysis could go on: the A's and B's broken down, examples introduced, comparisons offered, and so on. Generally, it is better to proceed with the analysis one step at a time, as in the example above. This keeps the whole subject better in mind and is more likely to preserve a reasonable balance. If you exhaustively analyze category I before moving on to II, then carry II down to the end before tackling III, you may lose sight of the overall structure of the composition.  \n\nHow far you take a scratch outline depends on the length of your composition and obviously on your willingness to spend time in planning. But the more planning you do, the easier the actual writing will be. A good scratch outline suggests where possible paragraph breaks might come, and the ideas you have jotted down in the headings are the germs of topic statements and supporting sentences.  \n\nBut however you proceed and however far you carry the scratch outline, remember that as a plan it is only tentative, subject to change. And the odds are that you will change it. No matter how much you think about a subject or how thoroughly you plan, the actuality of writing opens up unforeseen possibilities and reveals the weakness of points that seemed  \nimportant. A scratch outline is a guide, but a guide you should never hesitate to change.  \n\nFor Practice\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Writing Strategies**\n\nBased on the passage about planning and writing, evaluate the effectiveness of a scratch outline as a writing tool. Compare and contrast the author''s argument that a scratch outline is "a guide you should never hesitate to change" with the potential benefits of thorough planning. Provide specific examples from the text to support your evaluation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference at least two distinct points from the text regarding the flexibility of scratch outlines and the balance between planning and actual writing.'

Your essay should address the topic: "The Role of Materialism in Modern Relationships." Ensure each paragraph corresponds to one of the main sections (I, II, III) and that your argument progresses logically from one point to the next.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must explicitly follow the structure described in the text and include at least two specific examples or references from the passage to demonstrate understanding of the writing process outlined.'

    **Statement of Purpose**

    Writing is an iterative process that requires both creativity and revision. As I explore the quotation from the preceding chapter, "A draft is an early version of a piece of writing. Most of us cannot compose anything well at the first try. We must write and rewrite," I am reminded that the journey to a polished final product begins with the initial act of drafting. This essay aims to examine the importance of drafts in the writing process, emphasizing how they serve as a foundation for refinement and improvement. Through the exploration of this quotation, I will highlight the role of drafting in shaping a writer's ideas and how it enables the development of a more coherent and effective final product.

    The purpose of this essay is to argue that drafting is not only a necessary step in writing but also an essential part of the creative process. I will discuss how drafts allow writers to experiment with ideas, structure, and language without the pressure of perfection. Furthermore, I will explore how the process of drafting and revising helps writers to identify weaknesses in their work and to make meaningful improvements. By examining the significance of drafts, this essay will demonstrate that the initial version of a text is not only acceptable but often necessary for achieving a high-quality final product.

    However, there is a limit to the similarity between drafting and free writing. Free writing involves exploration and discovery; your pencil should move wherever your mind pushes it. A draft is more restrained. You know, more or less, what you want to do, and the draft is an early version of an organized composition. Therefore you are not as free as in the exploratory phase. If you get into blind alleys in a draft, you must back out and set off in a new direction. The mistake will not be unproductive if it tells you where you don't want to be.

    Some people prefer to draft with a pen or pencil; others can work successfully on a typewriter or word processor. If you draft in longhand, skip every other line and leave adequate margins: you will need the space for revisions. If you type, double space. Use only one side of the paper, reserving the other side for extensive changes or additions. When you number the pages of your draft, it's a good idea to include a brief identifying title: "First draft, p. 1," "Second draft, p. 3."

    In a composition of any length, consider stopping every so often at a convenient point. Read over what you've written, making corrections or improvements; then type what you've done. Seeing your ideas in print will usually be reassuring. If you don't have a typewriter or word processor, copy the section neatly in longhand; the effect will be much the same. Turn back to the draft; work out the next section; stop again and type. The alternation between drafting and typing will relieve the strain of constant writing and give you a chance to pause and contemplate what you have accomplished and what you ought to do next.

    But this is advice, not dogma. People vary enormously in their writing habits; what works for one fails for another. The best rule is to find a time and a place for writing that enable you to work productively and to follow a procedure you find congenial. You may like to draft in green or purple ink, to listen to music as you write, to compose the entire draft of a ten-page essay and then retype the whole thing instead of doing it section by section. Do what works for you.

    36 THE WRITING PROCESS

    As a brief sample, here is a draft of the beginning of the composition we've been discussing for the last several chapters—inches—people in the feel about sk29Osve, and marriage.

    I have some friends in their late twenties. They live in Chicago, where he is starting out as a lawyer and she as an accountant. Both are presently junior members of large firms, but they are ambitious and hope eventually either to track upward in their companies or to get out on their own. They live together; they say they are in love, and they seem to be. But they are surprisingly cool about it and about the prospect of marriage. "Well," Dee says, "I have my career and Jack has his. It's good we're together, but who knows where we'll be in two years or how we'll feel?" Their coolness surprises me. Find it admirable and yet a bit repelling. Admire their good sense. Still, think to myself, should young love be so cool, so rational, so pragmatic? Is such good sense at so youthful an age perhaps purchased at too great a price? My friends are not, { believe, unusual, not certainly among young, college-educated professionals. The lack of emotional intensity and commitment—about love, at lbastlers@eamt tone of their generation.

    How is it different from the attitudes grew up with, the attitudes of the sixties? And why is it different? These are the questions | want to consider.

    A good deal of improvement can be made in that draft. First, though, it would help to say something about revision in general.

    Both drafting and revising are creative, but they differ in emphasis. Drafting is more spontaneous and active; revision, more thoughtful and critical. As a writer of a draft you must keep going and not get hung up on small problems. As a reviser you change hats, becoming a demanding reader who expects perfection. When you write you see your words from inside; you know what you want to say and easily overlook

    lapses of clarity puzzling to readers. When you revise you put yourself in the reader's place. Of course you cannot get completely outside your own mind, but you can think about what readers know and do not know, what they believe and consider important. You can ask yourself if what is clear to you will be equally clear to them.

    To revise effectively, force yourself to read slowly. Some people hold a straightedge so they read only one line at a time, one word at a time if possible. Others read their work aloud. This is more effective (though you cannot do it on all occasions). Reading aloud not only slows you down, it distances you from the words, contributing to that objectivity which successful revision requires. Moreover, it brings another sense to bear: you hear your prose as well as see it. Ears are often more trustworthy than eyes. They detect an awkwardness in sentence structure or a jarring repetition the eyes pass over. Even if you're not exactly sure what's wrong, you hear that something is, and you can tinker with the sentences until they sound better. It also helps to get someone else to listen to or to read your work and respond.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Revision Strategies**\n\nConsider the scenario where you are revising a written piece for publication.\n- **Part A**: Describe two specific strategies from the text that you would use to improve clarity and effectiveness, explaining how each strategy aligns with the principles discussed (e.g., reading aloud).\n- **Part B**: Explain why "forcing yourself to read slowly" is more effective than rapid reading during revision. Use examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the importance of getting someone else to listen to or read your work, as suggested in the text.

Use logical reasoning to argue for or against this claim, incorporating the text''s emphasis on the role of revision.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the importance of hearing your prose as you read it aloud, as mentioned in the text.

    Keep a pencil in hand as you revise (some like a different color). Mark your paper freely. Strike out imprecise words, inserting more exact terms above them (here is the advantage of skipping lines). If you think of another idea or of a way of expanding a point already used, write a marginal note, phrasing it precisely enough so that when you come back to it in an hour or a day it will make sense. If a passage isn't clear, write "clarity?" in the margin. If there seems a gap between paragraphs or between sentences within a paragraph, draw an arrow from one to the other with a question mark. Above all, be ruthless in striking out what is not necessary. A large part of revision is chipping away unnecessary words.

    As we study diction, sentences, and paragraph structure, you will become aware of what to look for when you revise, but we shall mention a few basics here. Most fundamental is clarity. If you suspect a sentence may puzzle a reader, figure out why and revise it. Almost as important is emphasis.

    Strengthen important points by expressing them in short or unusual sentences. Learn to position semicolons they interrupt a sentence and throw greater weight on important ideas. Look for unsupported generalizations. Even when it is clear, a generalization gains value from illustrative detail.

    Sharpen your diction. Avoid awkward repetitions of the same word. Replace vague abstract terms with precise ones having richer, more provocative connotations. Watch for failures of tone: don't offend readers and don't strike poses.

    Be alert for errors in grammar and usage and in spelling and typing. Make sure your punctuation is adequate and conventional, but no more frequent than clarity or emphasis requires. Guard against mannerisms of style. All of us have them: beginning too many sentences with "and" or "but"; interrupting the subject and verb; writing long, complicated sentences. None of these is wrong, but any word or sentence pattern becomes a mannerism when it is overworked. One "however" in a paragraph may work well; two attract a reader's notice; three will make him or her squirm.

    As an example of revision let's look again at the opening of our imaginary essay.

    40 THE WRITING PROCESS

    Here now is the revision:

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Character Motivation and Themes**\n\nAnalyze the relationship between Dee and Jack''s career focus and their attitude toward marriage, as presented in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify how their professional ambitions (lawyer and accountant) influence their pragmatic view of marriage.\n- **Step 2**: Connect this perspective to the broader theme of "young love" being "cool, rational, and pragmatic."\n- **Step 3**: Justify why their attitude is considered "unsettling" despite their "good sense," using quotes or paraphrased statements from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate character analysis with thematic interpretation and explicitly reference at least two key phrases from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Literary Techniques**\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the author''s use of rhetorical questions in the original draft versus the revised version.\n- **Step 1**: Identify three rhetorical questions in the original draft and explain their purpose (e.g., "Is such good sense at so youthful an age purchased at too great a price?").\n- **Step 2**: Compare these with the rhetorical questions in the revised version and discuss how the author''s tone is affected.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the revised text adopts a more "informal tone" while maintaining the core themes of the original.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must highlight changes in literary technique and explicitly reference at least two specific sentences from both versions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Literary Analysis**\n\nConstruct an argument that explains why the "lack of emotionalism" among Dee and Jack''s friends is not a sign of moral failure, but rather a reflection of societal changes.\n- **Step 1**: Use quotes or paraphrased statements from the text to support your claim about the "attitudes of the sixties."\n- **Step 2**: Connect this to the broader question: "Why is it different?" and explain how the author''s perspective on generational attitudes has evolved.\n- **Step 3**: Provide a counterargument that might challenge this interpretation and refute it using textual evidence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate critical thinking by integrating historical context with literary analysis and explicitly reference at least two key phrases from the text.'

    Dee and Jack are an attractive couple in their late twenties—
    bright, well-educated, ambitious. He is starting out as a lawyer, she
    as an pcdountamhbers of large firms, they are commit-
    ted to their careers and eager to move ahead.

    They live together. They say they are in love, and they seem to
    be. But they are cool about it, and about the possibility of marriage.
    "Well," Dee says, "I have my career and Jack has his. It's good
    that we're together, but who knows where we'll be in two years?
    Or how we'll feel?"

    find their coolness admirable, and yet a bit unsettling. Should
    young love, think to myself, be quite so cool, so rational, so prag-
    matic? Is good sense at so youthful an age purchased at too high a
    price?

    Dee and Jack aren't unusual, not among college-educated young
    professionals. Low-keyed emotionalism seems the dominant tone
    of the contemporary song of love. It's all very different from the
    attitudes Shared in the sixties. It occurred to me to wonder why.

    I don't think there is any single, simple reason... .

    Probably you wouldn't write such extensive marginal notes
    to yourself, but those in dxample suggest how you should
    be thinking. The revisions are toward precision, emphasis,
    and economy.

    How many drafts and revisions you go through depends
    on your energy, ambition, and time. Most people who publish
    feel they stopped one draft too soon. Many teachers and ed-
    itors are willing to accept corrections so long as they are not
    so numerous or messy that they interfere with reading. Some,
    on the other hand, do want clean aoppeseshatith
    no corrections, additions, or deletions.

    Final Copy

    Whether or not you are allowed to revise it, your final copy
    should always be neat and legible. Keep margins of an inch
    or more. If you type, use standard typing paper and type on

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Revision Strategies**\n\nUsing the information provided in the text about revisions and final copies, devise a step-by-step strategy for writing a college-level essay that balances precision, emphasis, and economy as suggested by the marginal notes.\n- **Step 1**: Outline the initial draft with clear structure and main ideas.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the principles of precision, emphasis, and economy to revise the first draft.\n- **Step 3**: Determine how many revisions are reasonable based on the text''s advice about energy, ambition, and time.\n- **Step 4**: Justify your final copy standards by referencing the text''s recommendations for margins, legibility, and formatting.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your strategy must be practical, incorporate all key elements from the text, and demonstrate an understanding of the balance between revision and finality.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Writing Attitudes**\n\nThe text discusses the contrast between contemporary views on love (as seen in Dee and Jack''s relationship) and attitudes from the sixties. Using the information provided, analyze how the writing style and tone of the text reflect this contrast.\n- **Part A**: Identify specific elements in the text that demonstrate a more pragmatic and rational approach to love compared to the sixties.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the author''s description of Dee and Jack''s relationship serves as a metaphor for the broader cultural shift in attitudes toward love.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the text suggests that this new approach to love is inherently more logical or if it reflects changing societal values.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s themes with its writing style and provide evidence from both the narrative and the author''s commentary.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Final Copy Standards**\n\nBased on the instructions for final copies in the text, create a checklist for a college student preparing to submit an academic paper. The checklist must include at least six items that directly reference the text''s recommendations for revisions, formatting, and presentation.\n- **Item 1**: Ensure clarity and conciseness in language (economy).\n- **Item 2**: Maintain consistent margins (at least one inch) and legible font size.\n- **Item 3**: Include clear headings and subheadings for organization.\n- **Item 4**: Proofread for grammatical errors and punctuation.\n- **Item 5**: Use standard typing paper and avoid formatting inconsistencies.\n- **Item 6**: Provide a title page as required by the course guidelines.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your checklist must be comprehensive, follow the text''s specifications exactly, and include items that reflect both revision and final presentation standards.'

    The Essay

    CHAPTER

    Beginning

    An essay is a relatively short composition. It does not claim scholarly thoroughness (that belongs to the dissertation), it does exhibit great variety. Essays can be about almost anything; they can be speculative or factual or emotional; they can be personal or objective, serious or humorous. The very looseness of the term is a convenience; it would be a mistake to define it too narrowly. Here, essay really will simply mean a short prose piece. There are differences among articles and reports and essays. But they have much in common, and what we say about the beginning, closing, structure, and so on applies generally.

    Readers approach any piece of prose with a set of questions. What is this about? Will it interest me? What does the writer intend to do (or not do)? What kind of person is the writer?

    To begin effectively you must answer these questions, one way or another. From the writer's point of view, beginning means announcing and limiting the subject, indicating a plan, catching the reader's attention, and establishing an appropriate tone and point of view.

    Not all of these matters are equally important. Announcing and limiting the subject are essential. Laying out the plan of the paper and angling for the reader's interest, on the other hand, depend on your purpose and audience. Tone and point
    of view are inevitable: whenever you write you imply them. In the beginning, then, you must establish a tone and point of view conducive to your purpose.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Essay Structure and Purpose**\n\nWrite an essay that introduces the topic of climate change, following the guidelines provided in the text about effective beginnings. Your essay should: \n- **Start with a clear subject statement** that announces the topic and limits it to climate change. \n- **Include a plan** that outlines the structure of your essay (e.g., introduction, three body paragraphs on causes, effects, and solutions, conclusion). \n- **Catch the reader''s attention** using a rhetorical question or a surprising fact. \n- **Establish an appropriate tone** (e.g., concerned but hopeful) and point of view (first-person or third-person). \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must be concise, demonstrate understanding of the text''s guidance on beginning effectively, and show how each element addresses the reader''s questions about the topic.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Essay Opening Strategies**\n\nConsider the following two opening sentences from different essays: \n1. "The world is changing faster than we can adapt to it." \n2. "In 1893, a group of scientists in Europe began an experiment that would eventually lead to the development of the modern computer." \n\nUsing the text''s explanation of effective beginnings, analyze these two openings and answer: \n- **Part A**: Which opening is more effective for an essay about climate change? Why? \n- **Part B**: How do these examples illustrate the text''s point that ''beginning means announcing and limiting the subject, indicating a plan, catching the reader''s attention, and establishing an appropriate tone and point of view''? \n- **Part C**: Create your own opening sentence for an essay about space exploration, incorporating at least two elements from the text (e.g., a rhetorical question, a surprising fact, or a specific purpose). \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must directly reference the text''s guidance on effective beginnings and demonstrate reasoning based on the purpose and audience of each opening.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Essay Components**\n\nThe text states that essays can be personal, objective, serious, or humorous. Choose one of these categories and write a short essay (200-250 words) that exemplifies the chosen category. Your essay must: \n- **Demonstrate a clear purpose** (e.g., to persuade, inform, entertain). \n- **Use an appropriate tone** that matches the category (e.g., formal for objective, lighthearted for humorous). \n- **Include at least one personal anecdote or observation** if the category is personal. \n- **Conclude with a reflection** on how the chosen category influences the writer''s approach to the topic. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must show understanding of the text''s discussion on the variety of essays and how different categories affect writing style and purpose.'

- prompt: |-
    The length of the beginning depends on the length and complexity of what it introduces. In a book the opening might take an entire chapter with dozens of paragraphs. In a short article a single sentence might be adequate. For most essays a single paragraph is enough. Whatever their length, all effective openings fulfill the same functions.

    Announcing the Subject

    In announcing a subject you have two choices: (1) whether to be explicit or implicit, and (2) whether to be immediate or to delay.

    Explicit and Implicit Announcement

    In explicit announcement you literally state in some fashion or other, "This is my subject." The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead begins Religion in the Making like this:

    It is my purpose to consider the type of justification which is avail-
    able for belief in the doctrines of religion.

    The words "It is my purpose" make this an explicit announcement. It would have been implicit had Whitehead begun:

    Belief in the doctrines of religion may be justified in various ways.

    This sentence does not literally tell readers what the subject is, but the subject is clearly implied.

    Because of its clarity, scholars and scientists writing for their colleagues often use explicit announcement. On less formal occasions it may seem heavy-handed. A school theme, for instance, ought not to begin "The purpose of this paper is to contrast college and high school." It is smoother to establish the subject by implication: "College and high school differ in several ways." Readers don't have to be hit over the head. Implicit announcements may appear as rhetorical questions, as in this essay about historians:

    What is the historian?
    The historian is he who tells a true story in writing.
    Consider the members of that definition. Hilaire Belloc

    Similarly the theme on college and high school might have opened:

    In what ways do college and high school differ?

    Opening questions, however, can sound mechanical. While better than no announcement at all, or the clumsiness of "The purpose of this paper is," rhetorical questions are not very original. Use them for announcement only when you can do so with originality or when all other alternatives are less attractive.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Announcement Styles**\n\nThe text discusses explicit and implicit announcement styles in writing. Using examples from the text, explain how each style functions in different contexts:\n- **Explicit Announcement**: Describe a scenario where an explicit announcement would be most appropriate, such as a scholarly paper or academic setting. Cite the example from Whitehead''s essay and explain why it is effective.\n- **Implicit Announcement**: Provide an example of implicit announcement from the text (e.g., the historian definition) and analyze how it subtly conveys the subject without direct statement.\n- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare and contrast the two styles, highlighting when one might be preferable over the other based on the purpose of the writing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of the contextual appropriateness of each announcement style.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Announcement Techniques in Real-World Scenarios**\n\nDesign a paragraph for a school theme paper that announces its subject using both explicit and implicit styles. The paragraph must contain at least two distinct examples from the text, one explicit and one implicit, to illustrate how each style can be used effectively in different parts of the paper:\n- **Explicit Example**: Use the Whitehead quote to introduce the topic of religious justification.\n- **Implicit Example**: Use the historian definition to subtly establish the subject of historical truth-telling.\n- **Integration**: Ensure that the paragraph flows logically, with each example serving its purpose in announcing the paper''s focus.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must include direct quotes from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of how both styles contribute to effective communication.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Announcement Effectiveness**\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of rhetorical questions as an implicit announcement method based on the text. Consider the following aspects:\n- **Originality**: Discuss whether rhetorical questions can be used effectively with originality, citing the example from the text about historians.\n- **Clarity vs. Creativity**: Analyze the trade-off between clarity and creativity in using rhetorical questions for announcement.\n- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Determine when rhetorical questions would be more suitable than explicit announcements, referencing examples from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must reference specific examples from the text and demonstrate a nuanced understanding of when and why different announcement techniques are appropriate.'

- prompt: |-
    The same advice holds for opening with a dictionary definition, another way of announcing subjects implicitly. Nothing is inherently wrong in starting off with a quote from a reputable dictionary, but it is trite. Of course a clever or an unusual definition may make a good opening. John Dos Passos's definition of college as "four years under the ethercone" is certainly novel and provocative and might make a fine beginning.

    When the purpose of an essay is to define a word or idea, it is legitimate to start from the dictionary. But these exceptions admitted, the dictionary quotation, like the rhetorical question, has been overworked as a way of implying the subject.

    48 THE ESSAY

    Immediate and Delayed Announcement

    Your second choice involves whether to announce the subject immediately or to delay. This opening line of an essay called "Selected Snobberies" by the English novelist Aldous Huxley falls into the Garstgory:

    All men are snobs about something.

    Letting readers in on the subject at once is a no-nonsense, businesslike procedure. But an immediate announcement may not hold much allure. If the subject is of great interest, or if the statement is startling or provocative (like Huxley's), it will catch a reader's eye. Generally, however, immediate announcement is longer on clarity than on interest.

    So you may prefer to delay identifying the subject. Delay is usually achieved by beginning broadly and narrowing until you get down to the subject. The critic Susan Sontag, for instance, uses this beginning for an essay defining "Camp" (a deliberately pretentious style in popular art and entertainment):

    Many things in the world have not been named; and many things, even if they have been named, have never been described. One of these is the sead#yitity—vananistakadpiis-

    tication but hardly identical with geethay the name of "Camp."

    Less commonly the subject may be delayed by focusing outward, opening with a specific detail or example and broadening to arrive at the subject. Aldous Huxley opens an essay on "Tragedy and the Whole Truth" in this manner:

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Essay Opening Strategies**\n\nCompare and contrast the two opening strategies used in the text: immediate announcement and delayed announcement.\n- **Immediate Announcement**: Use Huxley''s quote ''All men are snobs about something.'' Explain how this approach directly identifies the subject and what effect it has on the reader.\n- **Delayed Announcement**: Analyze Sontag''s opening, which begins broadly with ''Many things in the world have not been named...'' Discuss how this method builds toward the definition of ''Camp'' and what literary devices are employed.\n- **Synthesis**: Evaluate which approach is more effective for a general audience based on the text''s advice about clarity versus interest. Justify your conclusion using examples from both strategies.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Essay Structure Principles**\n\nDesign an opening paragraph for an essay defining ''Innovation'' that uses delayed announcement.\n- **Step 1**: Begin with a broad statement about the role of creativity in society (e.g., ''Creativity is the lifeblood of progress...'').\n- **Step 2**: Narrow to specific examples, such as technological advancements or cultural changes.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a direct definition that ties back to your opening.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must incorporate at least two literary devices (e.g., metaphor, analogy) and demonstrate an understanding of the delayed announcement strategy as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Essay Techniques**\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of Huxley''s opening for a modern essay on ''Social Media and Identity.''\n- **Part A**: Analyze how Huxley''s immediate announcement (''All men are snobs about something'') relates to today''s digital culture.\n- **Part B**: Compare this approach to Sontag''s delayed announcement. Why might one be more suitable for a contemporary topic?\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative opening that uses delayed announcement, incorporating at least one specific example from modern technology (e.g., social media platforms).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of immediacy versus delay and provide a well-reasoned argument about the appropriateness of each strategy for discussing modern issues.'

    There were six of them, the best and the bravest of the hero's companions. Turning back from his post in the bows, Odysseus was in time to see them lifted hetaiggtingear their screams,

    BEGINNING 49

    the desperate repetition of his own name. The survivors could only look on, helplessly, while Scylla "at the mouth of her cave devoured them, still screaming, still stretching out their hands to me in the frightful struggle." And Odysseus adds that it was the most dreadful and lamentable sight he ever saw in all his "explorings of the passes of the sea." We can believe it; Homer's brief description (the too-poetical simile is a later interpolation) convinces us.

    Later, the danger passed, Odysseus and his men went ashore for the night, and, on the Sicilian beach, prepared their supper—prepared it, says Homer, "expertly." The Twelfth Book of the Odyssey concludes with these words: "When they had satisfied their thirst and hunger, they thought of their dear companions and wept, and in the midst of their tears sleep came gently upon them."

    The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth—how the older literatures ever told it! Bits of the truth, yes; every good book gives us bits of the truth, would not be a good book if it did not. But the whole truth, no. Of the great writers of the past incredibly few have given us that. Homer—eftine Odyssey—os those few.

    It is not until the third paragraph that Huxley closes in on his subject, of which the episode from the Odyssey is an example.

    Delayed announcement has several advantages. It piques readers' curiosity. They know from the title that the opening sentences do not reveal the subject, and they are drawn in to see where they are headed. Curiosity has a limit, however; you can tease readers too long.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Narrative Structure and Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the excerpt from *The Odyssey* as a narrative device used in Huxley''s essay. How does the inclusion of this passage serve to introduce the central theme of delayed announcement? Use textual evidence from both the Odyssey excerpt and Huxley''s analysis to support your argument.\n- **Step 1**: Identify how the Odyssey passage functions within Huxley''s essay structure.\n- **Step 2**: Connect the narrative technique (delayed revelation) to the broader theme of literary craftsmanship.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this approach is effective in engaging readers and conveying the author''s message about storytelling.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both texts and demonstrate a clear understanding of Huxley''s argument regarding delayed announcement.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Literary Devices in Textual Analysis**\n\nHuxley discusses the balance between curiosity and the need to reveal information gradually in his essay. Apply this concept to the Odyssey excerpt provided.\n- **Part A**: Identify two instances where the narrative technique of delayed announcement is used in the passage. Explain how each instance contributes to the overall effect.\n- **Part B**: Compare the use of delayed announcement in the Odyssey with Huxley''s discussion of this technique. How does the Odyssey exemplify Huxley''s point about effective storytelling?\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the balance between curiosity and information is maintained in the excerpt, using specific examples from both texts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of both the Odyssey passage and Huxley''s essay, with clear connections between their themes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Literary Tradition and Interpretation**\n\nHuxley argues that few writers have given us the whole truth in literature. Analyze how the Odyssey excerpt supports or challenges this claim.\n- **Part A**: Evaluate whether the passage from the Odyssey reflects Huxley''s assertion about the limitations of literary truth. Use specific details from the text to support your argument.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the role of interpretation in understanding the Odyssey, as suggested by Huxley''s comments on literary tradition. How does the excerpt illustrate this?\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument to Huxley''s claim that only a few writers have given us the whole truth. Use examples from the Odyssey and Huxley''s essay to support your position.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must engage with both texts critically, demonstrating an ability to analyze literary works through the lens of Huxley''s philosophical perspective.'

- prompt: |-
    A broad beginning can also clarify a subject, perhaps supplying background or offering examples. Finally, delayed announcement can be entertaining in its own right. There is a pleasure like that of watching a high-wire performer in observing an accomplished writer close in on a subject.

    More immediate announcement, on the other hand, is called for in situations where getting to the point is more important than angling for readers or entertaining them. How you announce your subjects with so much in writing, depends on purposes and reasons for addressing your readers.

    Limiting the Subject

    In most cases a limiting sentence or clause must follow the announcement of the subject. Few essays (or books, for that matter) discuss all there is to say; they treat some aspects of a subject but not others. As with announcement, limitation may be explicit or implicit. The first—in which the writer says, in effect, "I shall say such and such"—is commonly used in formal, scholarly writing. The grammarian Karl By-Keegans an article entitled "Where Our Grammar Came From":

    The title of this paper is too brief to be quite accurate. Perhaps with the following subtitle it does not promise too much: A partial account of the origin and development of the attitudes which commonly pass for grammatical in Western culture and particularly in English-speaking societies.

    On informal occasions one should limit the subject less literally, implying the boundaries of the paper rather than literally stating them:

    Publishers, as told, are worried about their business, and so am I. But I am not sure that the actual state of their affairs disturbs me quite so much as some of the analyses of it and some of the proposals for remedying what is admittedly an unsatisfactory situation. Joseph Wood Krutch

    Besides being explicit or implicit, limitation may also be
    positive or negative (or both). The paragraphs by Dykema
    and Krutch tell us what the writers will do; they limit the
    subject in a positive sense. In the following case the English
    writer and statesman John Buchan tells what he will not do

    BEGINNING 51

    (the paragraph opens the chapter "My America" of his book
    Pilgrim's Way):

    The title of this chapter exactly defines its contents. It presents the
    American scene as it appears to one pbserver-view

    which does not claim to be that mysterious thing, objective truth.
    There will be no attempt to portray the "typical" American, for |
    have never known one. have met a multitude of individuals, but
    Ishould not dare to take any one of them as representing his coun-
    tryeings that other mysterious thing, the average man. You

    can point to certain qualities which are more widely distributed in
    America than elsewhere, but you will scarcely find human beings
    who possess all these qualities. One good American will have most
    of them; another, equally good and not less representative, may
    have few or none. So &hall eschew generalities. If you cannot
    indict a nation, no more can you label it like a museum piece.

    Some binimattionpespliettor negative—
    is necessary at the beginning of most essays. Term papers,
    long formal essays whose purpose is to inform, technical and
    scholarly articles, all may have to engage in extensive bound-
    ary fixing to avoid misleading or disappointing the reader.
    Shorter themes, however, do not require much limitation.
    Readers learn all they really need to know by an opening
    sentence like this:

    College is different from high school in several ways—especially
    in teaching, homework, and tests.

    The final phrase conveys the limitations, following the an-
    nouncement in the first clause of the sentence. The subject is
    a contrast between college and high school, the focus is on
    college, and the contents are limited to three specific points
    of difference. That is limitation enough for a brief, informal
    essay, and the writer can get on with the discussion without
    a heavy statement like this:

    Ishall limit the contrast to teaching methods, homework, and tests.

    There is no rule to test whether you have limited a subject sufficiently. Just put yourself in the reader's place and ask if it is clear (whether by direct statement or by implication) what the essay will do and what it will not do.

    Indicating the Plan of the Essay

    Another function of the beginning, though not an invariable one, is to clarify how the essay will be organized. The writer has the plan in mind when composing the beginning paragraph (or revising it). The question is: Should the plan be revealed to the reader?

    Writers often do consider it necessary. Harold Mattingly, in *Roman Imperial Civilization*, uses this paragraph:

    The object of this first chapter is to give a sketch of the Empire which may supply a background to all that follows: to explain what the position of Emperor from time to time was, how it was defined in kasw it was interpreted by the subjects; then, around the Emperor, to show the different parts of the State in relation to one another and to him. Later chapters will develop particular themes. We shall have to consider at the close how far the constitution of the Empire was satisfactory for its main purposes, how much truth there is in the contention that imperfections in the constitution were a main cause of Decline and Fall.

    The paragraph indicates not only the plan of the first chapter and that of the whole book, but also how the opening chapter fits into the larger organization.

    Even with subjects less complex and grand than the Roman Empire, writers may wish to tell us how they intend to develop their essays:

    I want to tell you about a woodsman, what he was like, what his work was, and what it meant. His name was Alfred D. Teare and he came originally from Nova Scotia, but all the time knew him

    his home was in Berlin, New Hampshire. Probably the best surveyor of old lines in New England, he was—in a way——a genius. Kenneth Andler

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Essay Structure and Purpose**\n\nWrite an essay introducing the topic of climate change, following the structure outlined in the text. Your introduction must include: \n- A clear statement of purpose (similar to the example in the text) \n- An indication of the plan (how the essay will be organized) \n- At least one specific topic sentence that previews the main points to follow \n\n**Answer Requirement**: The essay must demonstrate an understanding of how to effectively communicate the essay''s purpose and structure to the reader, as outlined in the text. Your response should reflect the principles discussed about the function of the beginning paragraph in clarifying the essay''s plan.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Plan Disclosure in Writing**\n\nCompare and contrast the two examples provided in the text regarding the disclosure of an essay''s plan. \n- **Example 1**: The excerpt from *Roman Imperial Civilization* \n- **Example 2**: The example from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing* \n\n**Task**: \n- **Part A**: Identify at least three key differences in how each author discloses their plan. \n- **Part B**: Explain why the disclosure of a plan might be more or less necessary depending on the subject matter. \n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the disclosure of a plan is always necessary, or if it can be omitted in certain cases. Justify your answer with examples from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to analyze and synthesize information from the text about essay structure and planning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Essay Introduction Techniques**\n\nCreate an introduction for a fictional essay titled *The Legacy of Innovation*. The introduction must: \n- Introduce the topic in a way that indicates the essay''s purpose (similar to the examples in the text) \n- Outline the plan of the essay (how it will be organized) \n- Include at least one specific example or anecdote to engage the reader \n\n**Answer Requirement**: The introduction must showcase your understanding of how to effectively communicate the essay''s purpose and structure, as discussed in the text. Your response should reflect the principles outlined about the function of the beginning paragraph in clarifying the essay''s plan.'

- prompt: |-
    This straightforward paragraph not only announces and limits the subject but also reveals something about the organization of the essay. Readers are prepared for a three-part structure: Teare as a person, the nature of his work, and the significance of that work. Assuming that the writer knows his subject as he does, he mentions these aspects of his subject reflects the order in which he will treat them. The plan has been outlined and effectively.

    Establishing your plan in the beginning has several virtues. It eases the reader's task. Knowing where they are headed, readers can follow the flow of ideas. An initial indication of the organization also simplifies later problems of transition. When a writer can assume that readers understand the general scheme of the essay, it is easier to move them from point to point.

    As with limiting the subject, one cannot set down clear-cut rules about when to reveal the plan. Generally it is wise to indicate something about the organization of compositions that are relatively long and that fall into several well-defined parts. Shorter, simpler essays less often require that their plan be established in the opening paragraph.

    When you must indicate your plan, do so as subtly as you can. The imaginary theme about high school and college that begins:

    College is different from high school in several ways—especially in teaching methods, homework, and tests.

    clearly implies the three parts of the essay and their order. In longer work you may occasionally feel it desirable to indicate organization explicitly. But be sure that your subject is substantial enough and your purpose serious enough to support such a beginning.

    Interesting the Reader

    Sometimes you can take readers' interest for granted. Scholars and scientists writing for learned journals, for instance, do not have to make much effort to catch their readers' attention. More commonly a writer's audience includes at least some people whose interest must be deliberately sought. Several strategies for doing this are available.

    Stressing the Importance of the Subject

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Essay Structure and Planning**\n\nBased on the passage, explain how establishing a clear plan at the beginning of an essay serves multiple purposes in writing. Use specific examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part A**: Discuss the benefits of outlining the organization early, such as easing the reader''s task or facilitating transitions between ideas.\n- **Part B**: Compare the necessity of indicating a plan in long vs. short essays, using the example provided in the passage about high school and college differences.\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative method for signaling the essay''s structure without explicitly stating the plan, referencing the text''s suggestion to use an ''imaginary theme.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of organization, reader engagement, and the purpose of planning as outlined in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Interest-Grabbing Strategies**\n\nThe passage discusses several methods for engaging readers. Choose one strategy and explain how it can be effectively applied in a different context (e.g., a research paper, a persuasive essay, or a creative writing piece).\n- **Part A**: Describe the chosen strategy in detail, including its purpose and how it aligns with the text''s explanation of ''stressing the importance of the subject.''\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of how this strategy would be implemented in a different genre.\n- **Part C**: Analyze why this approach is particularly effective for your chosen context, referencing the text''s discussion on audience engagement and purpose.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s strategies and their application in varied writing scenarios.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning About Essay Planning**\n\nThe passage suggests that the decision to reveal an essay''s plan should depend on the length, complexity, and purpose of the work. Evaluate this claim by considering the following:\n- **Part A**: Argue whether a short, simple essay always requires an explicit plan in the introduction. Use examples from the text to support your position.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the potential drawbacks of revealing a plan too early in a longer essay. How might this affect the reader''s engagement or understanding?\n- **Part C**: Propose a scenario where revealing the plan would be both appropriate and beneficial, referencing the text''s suggestion that ''the subject must be substantial enough to support such a beginning.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must critically analyze the passage''s advice on planning and its implications for different types of writing.'

    Treat the reader as a reasonable, intelligent person with a desire to be well informed and say, in effect: "Here is something you should know or think about." The American poet and critic John Béahep begins an essay on Picasso with this sentence:

    There is no painter who has so spontaneously and so profoundly reflected his age as Pablo Picasso.

    Arousing Curiosity

    This is usually a more effective strategy than stressing the importance of the subject. You may play upon curiosity by opening with a short factual statement that raises more questions than it answers. Astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington begins a chapter in his book The Philosophy of Science with this statement:

    I believe there are 15,747,724,136,275,002,577,605,653,691,181,555,468,044,717,914,527,116,709,366,231,425,076,185,631,031,296 protons in the universe and the same number of electrons.

    It would be a curiously incurious reader who would not boggle at this and read on to learn how the writer arrived at so precise a figure.

    A short step from such interest-arousing factual openings

    is the cryptic beginning, that is, a mysterious or not quite clear statement. Charles Lamb opens an essay with

    I have no ear.

    We soon learn that he means "no ear for music," but for a moment we are startled.

    To be effective a cryptic opening must not simply be murky. It must combine clarity of statement with mystery of intent. We know what it says, but we are puzzled about why. The mystery has to be cleared up rather quickly if the reader's interest is to be retained. For most of us curiosity does not linger; without satisfaction it goes elsewhere.

    Carrying mystification a little further, you may open with a rhetorical pretension—that appears to contradict reality as we know it. Hilaire Belloc begins his essay "The Barbarians" this way:

    It is a pity true history is not taught in the schools.

    Readers who suppose true history is taught may be annoyed, but they are likely to go on.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Purpose of Curiosity-Inducing Openings**\n\nCompare and contrast the opening sentences from John Béahep, Arthur Eddington, Charles Lamb, and Hilaire Belloc as presented in the text.\n- **Task A**: Identify the strategy each author uses to engage the reader (e.g., factual assertion, cryptic statement, rhetorical contradiction).\n- **Task B**: Evaluate how effectively each opening creates curiosity or intrigue based on the text''s explanation of these strategies.\n- **Task C**: Explain why a ''cryptic'' opening requires both clarity and mystery according to the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference all four authors and explicitly connect their techniques to the principles discussed in the text about engaging readers through curiosity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating Rhetorical Effectiveness of Openings**\n\nConsider the opening statement by Hilaire Belloc: ''It is a pity true history is not taught in the schools.''\n- **Task A**: Analyze how this rhetorical statement creates intrigue without being misleading.\n- **Task B**: Compare this to the factual statement by Eddington about the number of protons and electrons in the universe. How do these two openings differ in their approach to engaging the reader?\n- **Task C**: Reflect on the text''s assertion that ''curiosity does not linger; without satisfaction it goes elsewhere.'' Explain how Belloc''s opening satisfies this condition, even though it appears to contradict reality.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical strategies and their effectiveness in maintaining reader interest as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing Literary Devices in Openings**\n\nExplain how Charles Lamb''s opening ''I have no ear'' employs a combination of clarity and mystery to engage readers.\n- **Task A**: Define what is meant by a ''cryptic'' opening based on the text.\n- **Task B**: Justify why this particular statement is effective in creating intrigue despite its apparent simplicity.\n- **Task C**: Compare Lamb''s approach with that of Belloc''s, highlighting how both authors use different literary devices to achieve reader engagement.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts from the text about cryptic and rhetorical openings and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct purposes in literary composition.'

    Sometimes mystification takes the form of a non sequitur, that is, an apparently nonlogical sequence of ideas. An enterprising student began a theme:

    I hate botany, which is why I went to New York.

    The essay revealed a legitimate connection, but the seeming logic fulfilled its purpose of drawing in the reader.

    Amusing the Reader

    Aside from arousing their curiosity, you may attract readers by amusing them. One strategy is to open with a witty remark, often involving an allusion to a historical or literary
    figure. Francis Bacon opens his essay "Of Truth" with this famous sentence:

    What is truth? said jesting Pilate and would not stay for an answer.

    A contemporary writer alludes both to Pontius Pilate and to Bacon by adapting that beginning for the essay "What, Then, Is Culture?":

    "What is truth?" said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an
    answer.
    "What is culture? said a certain man to me not long since,
    and though he stayed for an answer, he did not get one.
    Katherine Fullerton-Gerould

    Another variety of the entertaining opening is the anecdote. Anecdotes have a double value, attracting us once by their intrinsic wittiness and then by the skill with which writers
    apply them to the subject. In the following opening Nancy Mitford describes the history of the French salon, a social gathering of well-known people who discuss politics, art, and
    so on:

    "What became of that man Used to see sitting at the end of your
    table?" someone asked the famous eighteenth-century Paris hostess,
    Néeffrin.

    "He was my husband. He is dead." It is the epitaph of all such
    husbands. The hostess of a salon (the useful word salonniere, un-
    fortunately, is an Anglo-Saxon invention) must not be encumbered
    by family life, and her husband, if he exists, must know his place.

    The salon was invented by the Marquise de Rambouillet at the
    beginning of the seventeenth century.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Reasoning in Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the logical structure of the opening paragraph from Francis Bacon''s essay "Of Truth" and its adaptation in Katherine Fullerton-Gerould''s "What, Then, Is Culture?":\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rhetorical question posed by Pilate and explain how it sets up the essay''s central theme.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the logical progression of ideas between Bacon''s original quote and Gerould''s adaptation. How does Gerould''s version maintain the same logical function but in a different context?\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this kind of rhetorical question is an effective opening device, referencing the text''s discussion on amusing readers through wit and allusion.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the logical relationships between the quotes and their application in literary analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Anecdotal Logic in Literary Contexts**\n\nExamine the anecdote used by Nancy Mitford to introduce the history of the French salon.\n- **Step 1**: Explain how the anecdote serves as a logical introduction to the topic of salons.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the reasoning behind the hostess''s response: "He was my husband. He is dead." How does this statement logically connect to the broader theme of the salon?\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate whether the anecdote''s logic is a non sequitur or a well-integrated introduction, citing specific details from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an ability to assess logical coherence in literary openings and apply it to the given anecdote.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Literary Logic**\n\nConstruct a logical opening for an essay on ''The Role of Humor in Education'' using the strategies discussed in the text (witty remarks, allusions, or anecdotes).\n- **Step 1**: Choose one of the three strategies and provide a brief example.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why this strategy is appropriate for the topic of humor in education, referencing the text''s discussion on amusing readers.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that your opening follows the logical structure outlined in the text (e.g., rhetorical questions, anecdotes with thematic connections).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must create a coherent and logically structured opening that integrates the strategies discussed in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    Mitford's story is amusing, in a cynical fashion. More important, it leads naturally into her subject. Naturally—that
    important, for an opening anecdote fails if forced upon the subject from the outside.

    BEGINNING 57

    Still another entertaining opening strategy is the clever and
    apt comparison. It may be an analogy, as in the following
    passage by Virginia Woolf of the opening paragraph of her essay "Reviewing":

    In London there are certain shop windows that always attract a
    crowd. The attraction is not in the finished article but in the worn-
    out garments that are having patches inserted in them. The crowd
    is watching the women at work. There they sit in the shop window
    putting invisible stitches into moth-eaten trousers. And this familiar
    sight may serve as an illustration to the following paper. So our
    poets, playwrights, and novelists sit in the shop window, doing their
    work under the eyes of reviewers.

    Notice, incidentally, the skill with which Woolf focuses
    upon the subject.

    A comparison calculated to arouse interest may be a simile
    or metaphor. G. K. Chesterton wittily begins an essay "On
    Monsters" with this metaphorical comparison:

    I saw in an illustrated paper—window—wickcien tific news——
    that a green-blooded fish had been found in the sea; indeed a crea-
    ture that was completely green, down to this uncanny ichor in its
    veins, and very big and venomous at that. Somehow Could not
    get it out of my head, because the caption suggested a perfect re-
    frain for a Ballade: A green-blooded fish has been found in the sea.
    It has so wide a critical and philosophical application. I have
    known so many green-blooded fish on the land, walking about the
    streets and sitting in the clubs, and especially the committees. So
    many green-blooded fish have written books and criticism of books,
    have taught in academies of learning and founded schools of phi-
    losophy that they have almost made themselves the typical biolog-
    ical product of the present age of evolution.

    58 THE ESSAY

    A Word About Titles

    The type of an essay precedes the beginning and should clarify the subject and arouse interest. The title, however, does not take the place of a beginning paragraph. In fact it is good practice to make an essay self-sufficient, purpose, plan (if needed) are all perfectly clear without reference to a title.

    As to titles themselves, they should ideally be both informative and eye-catching. It is difficult in practice to balance these qualities, and most titles come down on one side or the other; they are informative but not eye-catching, or unusual and attractive but not especially informative. In either case a title ought to be concise.

    If you start your essay with a title in mind, be sure it fits the theme as it actually evolves. In the process of composition, essays have a way of taking unexpected twists and turns. For this reason it may be well not to decide on a final title until you see what you have actually written.

    Conclusion

    When composing beginnings, inexperienced writers are likely to err at either of two extremes: doing too little or doing too much. In doing too little they slight the opening, jumping too suddenly into the subject and piling ideas and information in front of the reader before he or she has time to settle back and see what all this is about.

    In doing too much they make the beginning a precis of the essay and anticipate everything they will cover. The function of an opening is to introduce an essay, not to be a miniature version of it. To make it so is to act as inappropriately as the master of ceremonies at a banquet who introduces the main speaker by anticipating everything he or she is going to say.

    The effective beginning stays between those extremes. It lets readers know what to expect, but it leaves them something to expect.

    Closing

    Like the opening of an essay, the closing should be proportional to the length and complexity of the whole piece. Several paragraphs, or only one, or even a single sentence may be sufficient. But whatever its length, a closing must do certain things.

    Termination

    The most obvious function of a closing is to say, "The end." There are several ways of doing this.

    Terminal Words

    The simplest is to employ a word or phrase like "in conclusion," "concluding," "finally," "lastly," "in the last analysis," "to close," "in closing," and so on. Adverbs showing a loose consequential relationship also work: "then," "and so," "thus." Generally it is best to keep such terminal words unobtrusive. In writing, the best technique hides itself.

    Circular Closing

    This strategy works on the analogy of a circle, which ends where it began. The final paragraph repeats an important phrase from the opening, thereby creating a sense of completion and cohesion. This approach not only signals the end but also reinforces the main idea or theme of the essay, providing a satisfying conclusion for the reader. The circular closing is effective because it ties together the beginning and end of the piece, offering a sense of closure and completeness. It is particularly useful in essays that aim to convey a clear, central message or argument. By repeating key phrases or ideas from the introduction in the conclusion, the writer ensures that the reader is reminded of the main points and the purpose of the essay. This technique also helps to reinforce the writer's point of view and tone, making it more memorable for the reader. In this way, the circular closing serves both as a functional ending and as a stylistic device that enhances the overall impact of the essay.

    A word or phrase prominent in the beginning, something the reader will remember. If the strategy is to work, the reader has to recognize the key term (but of course you cannot hang a sign on this" Réfpennhest stress it more subtly, perhaps by position or by using an unusual, memorable word. In an essay of any length it may be wise to repeat the phrase now and again, and sometimes writers emphasize the fact of completion by saying something like, "We return, then, to...."

    In a sketch of a famous aristocrat, Lady Hester Stanhope, the biographer Lytton Strachey opens with this paragraph:

    The Pitt nose [Lady Stanhope belonged to the famous Pitt family] has a curious history. One can watch its transmigrations through three lives. The tremendous hook of Old Lord Chatham, under whose curves Empires came to birth, was succeeded by the bleak upward-pointing nose of William Pitt the yigithggm—the bol of an indomitable hauteur. With Lady Hester Stanhope came the final stage. The nose, still with an upward tilt in it, had lost its masculinity; the hard bones of the uncle and grandfather had disappeared. Lady Hester's was a nose of wild ambitions, of pride grown fantastical, a nose that scorned the earth, shooting off, one fancies, towards some eternally eccentric heaven. It was a imose, fact, altogether in the air.

    And here are the final three sentences of Strachey's sketch:

    The end came in June, H88Gervants immediately possessed themselves of every moveable object in the house. But Lady Hester cared no longer: she was lying back in her bed—inexplicable, grand, preposterous, with her nose in the air.

    Not only does Strachey's phrase latch the end of his essay to its beginning, it also conveys his attitude toward Lady Hes-ter Stanhope. The expression that completes the circle necessarily looms large in the reader's mind, and it must be genuinely important.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Narrative Structure in Literary Analysis**\n\nIn Lytton Strachey''s sketch of Lady Hester Stanhope, the author uses the recurring motif of ''the nose'' to trace her character development across three generations. Analyze how this imagery serves as a narrative device that both opens and closes the essay, emphasizing the theme of transformation and legacy.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the initial and concluding references to ''the nose'' in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the motif reinforces the idea of continuity and change throughout the essay.\n- **Step 3**: Connect the final image of ''her nose in the air'' to the broader theme of Lady Stanhope''s character.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate specific textual evidence and demonstrate an understanding of how literary devices contribute to narrative structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Textual Structure**\n\nExamine how Strachey uses the repetition of ''the nose'' as a structural element in his essay. Consider the following aspects:\n- **Part A**: How does the opening reference to ''the nose'' establish a thematic focus?\n- **Part B**: What effect does the recurring motif have on the reader''s perception of Lady Hester Stanhope''s character?\n- **Part C**: Analyze the significance of the final sentence, which describes her ''nose in the air,'' in relation to the essay''s opening.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an ability to interpret literary devices and their impact on narrative coherence.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Interpretation of Literary Motifs**\n\nIn Strachey''s essay, the imagery of ''the nose'' is central to the portrayal of Lady Hester Stanhope. Investigate how this motif functions as a symbol for her personality and the broader themes of the text.\n- **Step 1**: Trace the evolution of the ''nose'' from the first generation (Old Lord Chatham) to the final one (Lady Hester).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the transformation of the nose reflects changes in the characters'' personalities and societal roles.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the symbolic meaning of the final image (''her nose in the air'') in relation to the essay''s conclusion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate textual analysis with a clear interpretation of the motif''s significance in the narrative.'

    Prose rhythm is complex. Here it is enough to understand that, however it works, rhythm is inevitable and important. Because it is, you can use it to signal the closing by varying the movement of the final sentence or sentences.

    Usually the variation is to slow the sentence and make its rhythm more regular. A famous example is the end of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland:

    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the aftertime, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood; and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with her dream of Wonderland of long ago; and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child life, and the happy summer days.

    The passage is slowed by interrupting constructions (for example, "in the aftertime") and regularized by repeating similar constructions ("and how," for instance) to create an almost poetic rhythm (the X marks unstressed syllables and the / denotes stressed):

    xX xX / xX / xX /
    and the happy summer days.

    Occasionally writers take the other tack and close with a short, quick sentence rather than a long, slow, regular one. Such an ending is most effective played against a longer statement, as in this passage, which concludes Joan Didion's essay "On Morality":

    Because when we start deceiving ourselves into thinking not that we want something or need something, not that it is a pragmatic necessity for us to have it, but that it is a moral imperative that we have it, then is when we join the fashionable madmen, and then is when the thin whine of hysteria is heard in the land, and then is when we are in bad trouble. And think we are already there.

    Failing to use a brief sentence as a way of ending sometimes wastes a potentially good closing:

For example, in a biographical sketch of someone who is dead the obvious place to end  \nis with the death scene, as in the passage quoted earlier by Lytton Strachey about Lady Hester Stanhope. Another instance is this paragraph, the end of Llewelyn Powys's essay \"Michel de Montaigne\":\n\nOn September, Michel de Montaigne, having distributed  \ncertain legacies to his servants, summoned his parish priest to his  \nbedside, and there in his curious room with the swallows already  \ngathering on the leaden gutters outside, he heard Mass said for the  \nlast time in the company of certain of his neighbors.

Writing about your daily routine, for instance, you might well  \nend with some variation of the phrase the diarist Samuel Pepys made famous: \"And so to Beds?\" when a subject  \ndoes not have a built-in closing, a comparison or figure of  \nspeech can provide one.\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Natural Closing Techniques**\n\nUsing the examples provided in the text, explain how a natural closing in an essay can be determined based on the subject matter.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two different subjects from the text (e.g., a biographical sketch about a deceased person and a daily routine description).\n- **Step 2**: For each subject, describe the natural closing point used in the examples and explain why it is appropriate for that topic.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the concept of a natural closing is essential to essay structure by referencing the example about Michel de Montaigne''s death scene.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between subjects with built-in closings and those requiring external closures, and it must explicitly connect the examples to the text''s explanation of natural points of closure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Figurative Language in Closing**\n\nThe text mentions that when a subject does not have a built-in closing, a comparison or figure of speech can provide one. Use the example of Samuel Pepys'' phrase "And so to Beds?" to create your own original closing sentence for an essay about a daily routine.\n- **Part A**: Explain how your chosen figure of speech (e.g., a metaphor, simile, or rhetorical question) mirrors the structure and purpose of Pepys'' phrase.\n- **Part B**: Justify why this type of closure is effective in concluding an essay about daily routines, referencing the text''s discussion on natural closures.\n- **Part C**: Compare your closing sentence to Pepys'' original in terms of style, tone, and how they both serve the purpose of ending a narrative or descriptive essay.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of figurative language as a tool for closure and clearly connect it to the text''s explanation of natural vs. artificial closures.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Closing Techniques**\n\nAnalyze the effectiveness of the closing in the passage about Michel de Montaigne, using the text''s description of how the last sentence "dead" functions as a natural closure.\n- **Part A**: Identify two elements from the text that demonstrate how the final word "dead" completes the main idea of the paragraph.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the structure of the last sentence (ending with a single word) is significant in reinforcing the theme of death and mortality.\n- **Part C**: Compare this closing technique to the example of Pepys'' phrase "And so to Beds?" in terms of how they both use language to signal the end of a narrative or descriptive essay.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of natural closures with an analysis of literary devices used in the examples provided.'

    These, then, are some of the ways of making clear that you are through. The various techniques do not exclude one another; they are often combined. Nor are these the only devices of closing. Inventive writers tailor their endings to subject and purpose. The poet Dylan Thomas wittily concludes his essay "How To Begin a Story" by doing what inexperienced writers should not stop midway:

    I see there is little, or no, time to continue my instructional essay on "How To Begin a Story." "How To End a Story" is, of course, a different matter... . One way of ending a story is. ...

    And Virginia Woolf's essay called "Reading" with this sentence:

    Some offering we must make; some act we must dedicate, if only to move across the room and turn the rose in the jar, which, by the way, has dropped its petals.

    It is difficult to say why this works. The rhythm is important. But so is the image. The flower that has dropped its petals is perhaps a metaphor of ending. And the seeming irrelevancy of the final clause also signals finality, like the gracious closing of a conversation. In any case, the passage ends the essay neatly and unmistakably. That is the important thing.

    CLOSING 65

    Summation and Conclusion

    Termination is always a function of the closing paragraph or sentence. Sometimes, depending on subject and purpose, you may need to make a summary or to draw a conclusion, in the sense of a final inference or judgment.

    Summaries are more likely in long, complicated papers. Usually they are signaled by a phrase like in summary, to sum up, summing up, in short, in fine, to recapitulate. The label may be more subtle: "We have seen, however..." is usually a virtue in such matters.

    Logical conclusions or judgments may be necessary even in short essays. Certain subjects make them obligatory. Here the journalist Samuel Hopkins Adams concludes an article on the controversial Warren Harding (the twenty-ninth president, who served from 1921 to 1923):

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Closing Techniques in Literary Analysis**\n\nCompare and contrast the closing techniques used in Dylan Thomas''s essay ''How To Begin a Story'' and Virginia Woolf''s essay ''Reading''. In your response, address the following:\n- **Dylan Thomas**: Analyze how his abrupt conclusion reflects the purpose of the essay. Use specific language from the text (e.g., "...is, of course, a different matter...").\n- **Virginia Woolf**: Interpret the symbolic meaning of the final image (the rose with dropped petals) and explain its relevance to the theme of ending.\n- **Synthesis**: Discuss how both authors use their closing techniques to achieve a specific rhetorical effect.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate direct quotes from the text and demonstrate an understanding of the purpose behind each author''s choice of closure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Summarization Techniques in Academic Writing**\n\nWrite a summary of the passage on ''Closing'' from The New Oxford Guide to Writing. Your summary must include:\n- A clear thesis statement that encapsulates the main idea of the chapter.\n- Three key points from the text, each supported by an example or quote.\n- An analysis of how these techniques are applied in different types of writing (e.g., academic, journalistic).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your summary must be concise yet comprehensive, reflecting a deep understanding of the strategies for effective closing in various writing contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Literary Conclusions**\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the closing sentences in both essays. Consider the following criteria:\n- **Dylan Thomas**: Does his abrupt ending serve to highlight the contrast between beginning and end? Use evidence from the text (e.g., "...is, of course, a different matter...").\n- **Virginia Woolf**: Does the image of the rose with dropped petals effectively convey finality? Explain how the metaphor relates to the theme of endings.\n- **Comparison**: How do these two approaches reflect broader principles of effective writing closure as discussed in the text?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must be based on textual evidence and demonstrate an ability to analyze rhetorical strategies for concluding a piece.'

    The anomaly of Warren Gamaliel Harding's career is that without wanting, knowing, or trying to do anything at all, he became the figurehead for the most flagrantly corrupt regime in our history. It was less his fault than that of the country at large. Maneuvered by the politicians, the American people selected to represent them one whom they considered an average man. But the job they assigned him is not an average job. When he proved incapable of meeting its requirements, they blamed him and not themselves.
    That is the tragedy of Harding.

    On occasion it may not be the best strategy, or even be possible, to round off an essay with a neat final judgment.
    The novelist Joseph Conrad once remarked that the business of the storyteller is to ask questions, not to answer them. That truth applies sometimes to the essayist, who may wish to suggest a judgment rather than to formulate one. The strategy is called an implicative closing. The writer stops short, allowing the reader to infer the conclusion. In effect the final sentences
    open a door instead of closing one. Here, for instance, is the ending of an essay about a teenage hangout:

    The old lady who lives across the street from the place says that
    the most striking thing is the momentary silences which, now and
    again, break up the loud, loud laughter.

    CHAPTER 3 ()
    Organizing the Middle

    Just as an essay must begin and end well, so it must be clearly
    organized in between. An important part of a writer's job is
    assisting readers in following the organization. It can be done
    in two ways, which are often used together. One is by sign-
    posts (occasionally even a short
    paragraph) which tells readers what you have done, are doing,
    will do next, or even will not do at all. The other way is by
    interparagraph transitions, that is, words and phrases that tie
    the beginning of a new paragraph to what precedes it.

    The most common signpost is an initial sentence that indicates both the topic and the general plan of treating it. For instance, the scientist J. B. S. Haldane organizes a five-paragraph section of a long essay like this:

    Secondly .

    Thirdly ...

    Fourthly ..

    68 THE ESSAY

    Sequence may be signaled by actual numbers or letters— usually enclosed in parentheses. first, second, in the first place, and so on. The poet W.Yeats explains why he believes in magic:

    I believe in the practice and philosophy of what we have agreed to call magic, in what must call the evocation of spirits, though I do not know what they are, in the power of creating magical illusions, in the visions of truth in the depths of the mind when the eyes are closed; and believe in three doctrines, which have, as I think, been handed down from early times, and been the foundation of nearly all magical practices. These doctrines are—

    1. That the borders of our mind are ever shifting, and that many minds can flow into one another, and create or reveal a single mind, a single energy.

    2. That the borders of our memories are as shifting, and that our memories are a part of one great memory, the memory of Nature herself.

    3. That this great mind and great memory can be evoked by symbols.

    Numbers, however, and number words like first, second, third, must be handled cautiously. Overused, they confuse readers, losing them in a labyrinth of (1)s and (2)s and (a)s and (b)s.

    Rather than using numbers, it is better, if possible, to set up an analysis by employing key terms. These identify the major points and can be repeated at the beginning of the appropriate paragraph or section. For example, the television critic Edith Efron, discussing soap operas, writes:

    Almost all dramatic tension and moral conflict emerge from three basic sources: mating, marriage and babies.

    She begins the next paragraph by picking up the key word "mating":

    And the following paragraph she opens by using the loose
    synonym "domesticity" to link "marriage and babies":

    If domesticity is a marital "good," aversion to it is a serious evil.

    Signposts demand consistency. Once you begin using them
    you must carry through. Some writers make the mistake of
    starting off with something like this:

    There were three reasons why the pact was not satisfactory. First.

    But then they fail to introduce the next two reasons with the
    obligatory second or third (or secondly, finally). The lack of
    signals may confuse readers who fail to recognize when the
    writer passes from one reason to another.

    Aside from setting up a group of paragraphs, signposts may
    also anticipate future sections of an essay or make clear what
    will not be treated. Few subjects divide neatly into watertight
    compartments. As you develop one point, you touch upon
    another that you do not plan to discuss fully until later or
    perhaps not to discuss at all. When this happens you may wish
    to give a warning.

    Signposts may also point backward, reminding readers of
    something treated earlier which bears upon the current topic.
    Thus a writer may say "(See page 8)," or "As we saw in
    Chapter 7...."

    The signposts we have looked at are intrinsic—that
    are actually a part of the writer's text. There are also extrinsic
    signposts, ones that stand outside the actual discussion yet
    clue readers to its organization. An outline or a table of con-
    tents is such an extrinsic signal. So are chapter titles, subtitles
    of sections, running heads at the top of each page.

    Typography and design convey other extrinsic indications
    of organization: the indentation of paragraph beginnings and
    of quotations, the extra spacing between lines to signal a new
    major section, and occasionally the numerals (usually Roman)
    centered above the division of an essay. Philosophical and
    scientific writers sometimes use a more elaborate system, be-
    ginning each paragraph with a two-part number, the first digit
    to designate the chapter, the second the paragraph.

    Interparagraph Transitions

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Signpost Usage in Essays**\n\nIn the context of essay writing, explain how signposts function as both intrinsic and extrinsic organizational tools. Provide two specific examples from the text that illustrate each type of signpost.\n- **Intrinsic Examples**: Identify two instances where signposts are embedded within the body of the text (e.g., phrases like ''Firstly,'' ''However,'' or ''As we saw'').\n- **Extrinsic Examples**: Give two examples of extrinsic signposts that appear outside the main discussion, such as outlines, chapter titles, or running heads.\n- **Analysis Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how these signposts guide readers through the structure of an essay and ensure clarity in argumentation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Signpost Logic to Paragraph Transitions**\n\nUsing the principles of interparagraph transitions discussed in the text, analyze a paragraph from your own writing. Identify at least three transition words or phrases that effectively link the ideas within the paragraph and explain their function.\n- **Task**: Choose a paragraph you have written about a topic (e.g., technology''s impact on communication).\n- **Step 1**: Highlight the three transition terms in your text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how each term contributes to the flow of ideas, referencing specific strategies from the text (e.g., ''signposts may point backward'' or ''signals may confuse readers'').\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must integrate the concepts of consistency and clarity in paragraph organization as emphasized in the reading.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Reasoning with Essay Structure**\n\nImagine you are writing an essay on a complex topic, such as climate change. Design a signpost-based structure for your essay that addresses both immediate and long-term consequences of this issue.\n- **Part A**: Create a table of contents (extrinsic signposts) with at least three sections, each including a subheading (e.g., ''Immediate Effects'' or ''Global Policy Responses'').\n- **Part B**: Write two intrinsic signposts that would appear within the body of your essay to guide the reader through the argument.\n- **Part C**: Explain how your structure ensures logical flow and prevents readers from being confused by abrupt shifts in topic, using examples from the text (e.g., ''signposts demand consistency'' or ''signposts may point backward'').\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of both intrinsic and extrinsic signposting techniques as outlined in the reading.'

    Transitions link a paragraph to what has immediately pre-
    ceded it. They occur at or near the beginning of the new para-
    graph because it represents a turn of thought, needing to be
    linked to what has gone before. Transitions act like railroad
    switches, smoothing and easing the turn from one track to
    another.

    The Repetitive Transition

    The simplest type of transition repeats a key word. Writing
    about the Louisiana politician Huey Long, Hodding Carter
    ends one paragraph and begins the next with the following
    link (the italics are added in this and in all following examples,
    unless noted otherwise):

    Behind Huey were the people, and the people wanted these things.
    And with the people behind him, Huey expanded ominously.

    A repeated word makes a strong and simple connection. It
    works well when the key term leading into the new paragraph
    occurs naturally at the end of the preceding one. But it is
    awkward and artificial when the term is forced into the final
    sentence merely to set up the transition.

    The Quaasitioand-Answer

    A second way of linking paragraphs is to ask and answer a
    rhetorical question. Usually the question is placed at the end
    of the preceding paragraph and the answer at the beginning
    of the following one. Nancy Mitford, commenting upon the
    apparently compulsive need of tourists to travel, concludes
    one paragraph and opens the next like this:

    Why do they do it?
    The answer is that the modern dwelling is comfortable, conven-
    ient, and clean, but it is not a home.

    Less often the question appears at the opening of the new
    paragraph, as in this discussion of the ultimate defeat of the
    Crusades:

    With want of enthusiasm, want of new recruits, want, indeed, of
    stout purpose, the remaining Christian principalities gradually
    crumbled. Antioch fell in 1268, the Hospitaler fortress of Sesk
    Chevaliers in h2Al91, with the capture of the last great
    stronghold, Acre, the Moslems had regained all their possessions,
    and the great crusades ended, in failure.

    Wirt went wrong? There was a failure of morale
    clearly... . Morris Bishop

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Transition Types**\n\nCompare and contrast the two transition types discussed in the text: the repetitive transition and the question-answer transition. Use specific examples from the text to illustrate your points.\n- **Step 1**: Identify how each transition functions within a paragraph sequence.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the effectiveness of each type based on the examples provided (e.g., the use of ''Behind Huey'' versus the rhetorical question about tourists).\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate the potential drawbacks of overusing either transition type, citing the text''s caution against forced repetition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the two transitions and demonstrate an understanding of their appropriate usage as per the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Transition Logic**\n\nCreate a paragraph that uses both types of transitions discussed in the text to connect two related ideas. For example, if you were writing about the impact of technology on communication, your paragraph would transition from one idea to another using either the repetitive transition or the question-answer transition.\n- **Part A**: Write a 3-sentence paragraph that transitions between two distinct topics (e.g., ''The rise of social media has changed how we communicate... Why do people use social media? Because it allows for instant global connectivity...'').\n- **Part B**: Explain the logical flow of your paragraph, identifying which transition type is used in each sentence and why it is appropriate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include a coherent paragraph with both transitions and a clear explanation of their function within the text''s framework.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Transition Techniques**\n\nThe text warns against forcing transitions, arguing that they should ''smooth and ease the turn'' from one idea to another. Using examples from the text, argue whether or not a writer can effectively use repetition or rhetorical questions as transitions without them feeling forced or artificial.\n- **Part A**: Provide two specific examples from the text where transitions are used naturally and effectively.\n- **Part B**: Explain why these examples succeed in avoiding the pitfalls mentioned by the author (e.g., ''it is awkward and artificial when the term is forced into the final sentence merely to set up the transition'').\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this warning for writers who might try to use transitions in creative or unconventional ways.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the text''s arguments about effective and ineffective transition techniques.'

    The question-and-answer transition makes a very strong tie, but, as with the rhetorical question generally, it is too obvious a strategy to be called upon very often.

    The Summarizing Transition

    This link begins with a phrase or clause that sums up the preceding paragraph and then moves to the main clause, which introduces the new topic. (Unless idiom prohibits it, the elements of the transition should always be in that order: summary of old topic, statement of new one.)

    - and while-clauses frequently carry such transitions:

    If Went through anguish in botany and diffeeabomics—for
    reasensvegymonseum James Thurber

    But while Bernard Shaw pleasantly surprised innumerable cranks
    and revolutionists by finding quite rational arguments for them,
    he surprised them unpleasantly also by discovering something
    else. G. K. Chesterton

    Long summarizing transitions tend to be formal in tone.
    On informal occasions it may be better to avoid a full if- or
    whidestisus¢ke summary more briefly. Here, for
    example, a writer moves from the topic of college teaching
    methods to that of personal responsibility:

    Because of these differences in teaching methods, college throws
    more responsibility upon the student.

    A summarizing transition may take even briefer form, us-
    ing pronouns like this, that, these, those, or such to sum up
    the preceding topic. The historian J. Fred Ryppy from
    the severe geographical conditions of South America to a dis-
    cussion of its resources:

    These are grave handicaps. But Latin America has many resources
    in compensation.

    Although the "these" in that example is perfectly clear,
    such pronouns can be ambiguous when used as the subjects
    of sentences, especially when they refer to the whole of a long,
    complex idea. If you do use such a pronoun in this way, be
    sure that readers understand what it refers to. Should there
    be a doubt, make the pronoun an adjective modifying a word
    or phrase that fairly sums up the preceding point: for example,
    "These handicaps are grave."

    Logical Transitions

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical and Summarizing Transitions**\n\nWrite a paragraph that transitions from the topic of college teaching methods to the concept of personal responsibility, using both summarizing and logical transitions. Your paragraph must include:\n- A summarizing transition that clearly links the previous discussion on teaching methods to the new topic of personal responsibility.\n- A logical transition that explains why the shift to personal responsibility is necessary or beneficial in this context.\n- At least two examples of how these transitions function within a broader writing strategy, referencing the text''s emphasis on clarity and coherence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must demonstrate an understanding of both types of transitions as described in the text and explicitly reference the examples provided in the passage (e.g., ''the historian J. Fred Ryppy'' example).'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Ambiguity in Pronoun Reference**\n\nExplain why the pronoun ''these'' in the sentence ''These are grave handicaps. But Latin America has many resources in compensation.'' is unambiguous, while a pronoun like ''they'' in ''They have been overlooked for years'' could be ambiguous. Use examples from the text to support your explanation and discuss how this relates to the importance of clarity in writing as emphasized by the author.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate specific examples from the text, including the discussion about pronoun ambiguity and the ''these'' example provided. Additionally, you must explain how the use of clear pronouns contributes to a reader''s comprehension.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Transition Techniques**\n\nDesign a transition paragraph that moves from discussing the effects of climate change on coastal ecosystems to the economic implications of those changes. Your paragraph must include:\n- A summarizing transition that reflects the text''s emphasis on connecting ideas logically.\n- A logical transition that explains the relationship between ecological and economic impacts.\n- A reference to at least one example from the text (e.g., the ''college teaching methods'' to ''personal responsibility'' example) to illustrate how transitions contribute to a coherent argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must demonstrate an understanding of both summarizing and logical transitions, integrate a specific example from the text, and clearly show how these techniques enhance the flow of ideas.'

    Finally, you may link paragraphs by words showing logical
    relationships: therefore, however, but, consequently, thus, and
    so, even so, on the other hand, for instance, nonetheless, and
    many, many more. In the following passage the historian and
    political scientist Richard Hofstadter is contrasting "intelli-
    gence" and "intellect." In the first paragraph he defines "in-
    telligence." By placing the transitional phrase on the other
    hand near the beginning of the second paragraph, he signals
    the other half of the contrast:

    . intelligence is an excellence of mind that is employed within a
    fairly narrow, immediate, and predictable range. . . . Intelligence
    works within the framework of limited but clearly stated goals.

    Intellect, on the other hand, is the critical, creative, and contem-
    plative side of mind.

    Here is another dissection—aof Hamlet—in
    which moreover indicates that the new paragraph will develop
    an extension of the preceding idea:

    Ifntay quote again from Mr. theTiblgatel,very lack of a

    rigorous type of causal logic seems to be a part of its point.
    Moreover, the matter goes deeper than this. Hamlet's world is

    preeminently in the interrogative mode. Mack Maynard

    Logical connectives seldom provide the only link between
    paragraphs. Actually, they work in conjunction with word
    repetitions, summaries, pronouns. In fact, all the various tran-
    sitional strategies we have looked at commonly occur in some
    combination. But whatever its form, an interparagraph tran-
    sition should be clear and unobtrusive, shifting readers easily
    from one topic to the next.

    For Practice

    > Read closely an essay or article you like and study how the
    writer links paragraphs.

    > Go through something you have written and underline the link-
    ages between paragraphs. If you find places where the connections
    seem weak, improve them.

    Point of View, Persona, and
    Tone

    Point of View

    Thus far we have looked at how to begin and end essays and
    how to help readers follow the flow of thought. It remains to
    consider several other aspects of a composition, more abstract
    but no less important. These are point of view, persona, and
    tone.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Connectives in Textual Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the excerpt provided in the text regarding logical connectives and their role in paragraph transitions.\n- **Task A**: Identify at least three transitional phrases used by the author to link paragraphs, including examples from the text.\n- **Task B**: Explain how these transitions contribute to the clarity and flow of the argument, using specific instances from the passage (e.g., ''on the other hand'', ''however'').\n- **Task C**: Compare and contrast the effectiveness of transitional phrases versus word repetitions or summaries in linking paragraphs, based on the text''s discussion.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the role of logical connectives in paragraph transitions as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Transitional Strategies in Writing**\n\nUsing the principles from the text about interparagraph transitions, revise the following passage to improve its flow and coherence.\nOriginal Passage: \n"The study shows that diet affects health. However, exercise is also important. Many people neglect exercise. Therefore, a balanced approach is necessary.\n"\n- **Task A**: Identify the existing transitional phrases in the original text and explain their effectiveness.\n- **Task B**: Propose at least two revisions to enhance the flow, incorporating additional transitional strategies mentioned in the text (e.g., word repetitions, summaries).\n- **Task C**: Justify how your revised version improves the readability and logical progression of ideas compared to the original.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect an understanding of the various transitional strategies discussed in the text and demonstrate effective revision skills.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Point of View and Tone**\n\nExamine the section titled ''Point of View, Persona, and Tone'' from the text.\n- **Task A**: Define ''point of view'' as presented in the passage and explain its significance in writing.\n- **Task B**: Differentiate between ''persona'' and ''tone'', providing examples based on the text.\n- **Task C**: Analyze how the author''s tone influences the reader''s perception of the topic, using specific language from the text to support your argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of point of view, persona, and tone as described in the passage and demonstrate a clear understanding of their roles in effective writing.'

- prompt: |-
    Point of view relates to how you present a subject. Two approaches are possible. In a personal point of view you play the role of writer openly, using "I," "me," "my." An impersonal point of view, on the other hand, requires that you avoid all explicit reference to yourself. The difference is not that in a personal point of view the subject is the writer, while in an impersonal one it is something else. Every subject involves, though it is not necessarily the writer. The difference is a question of strategy.

    On many occasions one point of view or the other is preferable. Some topics so intimately involve the writer that they require a personal perspective. It would sound silly to describe your summer vacation impersonally. Don't be afraid to use "I" if it fits your subject and purpose.

    On other occasions a personal point of view is not appropriate. A scientist, writing professionally, usually tries to keep his or her personality below the surface, and properly so: scientific subjects are best treated objectively.

    Of course many topics can be presented from either point of view, though the two approaches will result in different essays. In such cases you must consider occasion and reader and the degree of formality you want. An impersonal point of view seems more formal, a personal one less so.

    Whichever you select, establish it in the opening paragraph. You needn't say, "My point of view will be personal [or impersonal]." Simply use "I" if you intend to write personally, or avoid it if you do not. (Such substitutes for "I" as "this observer," "your reporter," or "the writer" are wordy and awkward and best avoided.)

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Point of View in Academic Writing**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of personal and impersonal points of view in academic writing, using examples from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define both perspectives based on the text''s explanation of their purposes and appropriate contexts.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a specific example where a personal point of view would be suitable (e.g., describing a personal experience) and another where an impersonal approach is more appropriate (e.g., discussing scientific research).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the choice of perspective affects the tone, formality, and clarity of the writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the two viewpoints as outlined in the text and demonstrate a practical understanding of their applications.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Point of View in Writing**\n\nThe text emphasizes that "the difference is a question of strategy." Using this statement, analyze how the choice of point of view influences the effectiveness of an essay.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''strategy'' in the context of writing as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Provide two scenarios where different strategies (personal vs. impersonal) would be more effective based on the topic and audience.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why adhering to the chosen strategy enhances clarity, purpose, or engagement with the reader.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s explanation of ''strategy'' and demonstrate a clear understanding of how it relates to point of view selection.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Point of View in Composition**\n\nThe text advises against using substitutes for "I" such as "this observer" or "the writer." Explain why this advice is important, and provide an example where using "I" would be appropriate and another where it would not.\n- **Step 1**: Discuss the implications of using impersonal language in academic writing.\n- **Step 2**: Describe a situation where a personal point of view is suitable (e.g., a reflective essay) and one where it is not (e.g., a scientific report).\n- **Step 3**: Justify your examples based on the text''s guidelines for formality, audience, and purpose.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must adhere to the text''s recommendations and demonstrate an understanding of when to use or avoid personal pronouns in writing.'

    Maintain point of view consistently. Don't jump back and forth between a personal and an impersonal presentation. At the same time, you can make small adjustments. For example, you may expand "I" to "we" when you wish to imply "I the writer and you the reader." Whether writing personally or impersonally you may address readers as individuals by employing "you," or shift to "one," "anyone," "people," and so on, when you are referring to no one specifically.

    But such shifts in point of view should be compatible with the emphasis you desire, and they should be slight. Radical changes, nine times in ten, are awkward. It is good practice, then, (1) to select a point of view appropriate to your subject, (2) to establish that point of view in the opening paragraph, and (3) to maintain it consistently.

    Persona

    Persona derives from the Latin word for an actor's mask (in the Greek and Roman theaters actors wore cork masks carved to represent the type of character they were playing). As a term in composition, persona means the writer's presence in the writing.

    The derivation from "mask" may be misleading. It does not imply a false face, a disguise, behind which the real individual hides. A writer's persona is always "real." It is there, in the prose. The words you choose, the sentence patterns into which you arrange them, even the kinds of paragraphs you write and how you organize your essay, suggest a personality, which is, for that particular piece of writing, you.

    But, you may object, a persona is not really the person who writes. (Rersoxingly enough, comes from the same Latin word.) Of course, that is true, and it is true that the same writer may assume different personas on different occasions. Still, the only contact readers generally have with a writer is through his or her words. For readers the persona implicit in those words is the real, existential fact about the writer.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Point of View and Persona in Writing**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, explain how a writer''s point of view and persona are interconnected in the writing process.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''point of view'' as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the persona influences the selection of words, sentence structure, and paragraph organization.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from your own experience (or a hypothetical scenario) where changing the point of view required a corresponding shift in the writer''s persona.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly link the concepts of point of view and persona as presented in the text and demonstrate understanding through specific examples.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Persona and Authorial Presence**\n\nThe text suggests that a writer''s persona is ''always real'' and represents the reader''s perception of the author. Discuss how this concept affects the effectiveness of different writing styles (e.g., academic, narrative, persuasive).\n- **Step 1**: Describe how the persona might differ in an academic versus a narrative essay.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these differences impact the reader''s interpretation of the content.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate whether the author''s intended persona can be manipulated to influence the reader''s perception of the argument or story.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of persona with examples from different writing genres.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Persona in Multimodal Writing**\n\nThe text emphasizes that a writer''s persona is reflected in their choice of words, sentence patterns, and paragraph structure. Imagine you are creating a multimodal essay (e.g., combining text, images, and digital elements) on the topic of climate change.\n- **Part A**: Explain how you would use visual elements to reinforce a specific persona (e.g., scientific, concerned citizen, or activist).\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the choice of sentence structure and vocabulary in your written text would align with the chosen persona.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how altering the persona might affect the intended message''s reception by different audiences.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of how persona is conveyed through multiple modes of communication as outlined in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    The question to ask about any persona is not, "Is this really the writer?" The questions are, "Is it really how the writer wants to appear?" And, "Is it how he or she can best appear?" To put the matter another way: Is the persona authentic and appropriate?

    Authenticity means that the personality readers sense in your words is the personality you want them to perceive. To say that a persona is authentic does not necessarily mean that it is really you. We are all many different people, showing one face to friends, another to strangers, still another to the boss. Here authenticity simply means that how you appear in what you write is how you wish to appear.

    But authenticity is not enough. A persona must also be appropriate, efficacious in the sense that it achieves your ends. At the very least it ought not to get in the way.

    Persona is most immediately and directly revealed when a writer discusses himself or herself. For instance, a clear personality emerges in the following passage from Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography. Franklin is explaining that when he educated himself as a youth he learned to drop his habit of "abrupt contradiction, and positive argumentation" and to become more diffident in putting forward his opinions. (He is, of course, talking about the same thing we are—persona.)

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Authenticity in Self-Reflection**\n\nFranklin''s passage discusses his efforts to modify his persona during self-education. Is this an example of authenticity? Support your answer with specific details from the text and explain how Franklin''s actions reflect or contradict the concept of authenticity as defined in the reading.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly address whether Franklin''s behavior is authentic, referencing the definition provided in the text that ''authenticity means the personality readers sense in your words is the personality you wish to appear.'''
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Appropriateness of Persona in Writing**\n\nConsider the claim that a persona must be appropriate for its purpose. In Franklin''s case, why might his decision to become more diffident in expressing opinions have been an appropriate choice? Conversely, what would be an inappropriate use of persona in writing, and how could it hinder the writer''s goals?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of both authenticity and appropriateness as defined in the text, and provide a concrete example from the reading or your own reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Balancing Authenticity and Efficacy in Persona**\n\nThe text states that a persona must be ''authentic and appropriate.'' How might a writer achieve this balance? Use Franklin''s example to illustrate how changing one''s persona can serve both authenticity and efficacy. Additionally, provide an original scenario where a writer might need to adjust their persona for different audiences, explaining the reasoning behind each adjustment.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of authenticity and appropriateness as defined in the text and include a clear, original example that demonstrates practical application.'

    by a positive assuming manner that seldom fails to disgust, tends
    to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those purposes for
    which speech was given us, to wit, giving or receiving information,
    or pleasure: for if you would inform, a positive dogmatical manner
    in advancing your sentiments, may provoke contradiction & prevent
    a candid attention. you wish information & improvement from

    suade those whose concurrence you desire.

    Franklin strikes us as a discerning and candid man, sensitive
    to how he affects people, but sensitive in an unabashedly ego-
    centric way. His advice about not coming on too strong—
    still worth hesedngetiso much on concern for
    others as on a clear-eyed awareness that modesty is the way
    to get on in the world. Yet the very openness and ease with
    which Franklin urges that advice washes away its taint of self-
    serving manipulation.

I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness—  \nthe pining and anguish in which one shivering consciousness  \nlooks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless  \nabyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love have  \nseen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven  \nthat saints and poets have imagined. This is what I long for, and  \nthough it might seem too good for human life, this is what—at  \nleast—founds.\n\nWith equal passion have I sought knowledge. I have wished to  \nunderstand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars  \nshine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which  \nnumber holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, have  \nachieved.\n\nLove and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward  \ntoward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth.  \nEchoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine,  \nvictims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden  \nto their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain  \nmake a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate  \nthe evil, but cannot, and to suffer.\n\nThis has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would  \ngladly live it again if the chance were offered me.\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Motivational Passions**\n\nExplain how the three passions—longing for love, search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for human suffering—interact in the text to shape the author''s life narrative.\n- **Step 1**: Identify which sections of the text correspond to each passion.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these passions are interconnected (e.g., how love and knowledge lead toward higher ideals, while pity grounds the author in reality).\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a reflection on how these three forces create a ''wayward course'' as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference specific passages from the text and demonstrate an understanding of their interplay.'

    Russell is more emotional than Franklin. His attitude toward knowledge and toward other people is less self-serving and more passionate. He is driven to knowledge not because it serves his ambition but because of a compulsive desire to know (though Franklin too could show a disinterested quest for knowledge). Russell sees other people not as helps or hindrances to his career, but as fellow humans, for whose suffering he can feel compassion and sorrow.

    Yet there is more to Russell's persona than the obvious emotionalism. His feelings are constrained within a rational framework. The organization of his paragraphs is tightly analytical, and the whole passage can easily be reduced to an outline. Here is someone who not only feels intensely but whose intellect imposes order upon emotions, giving them a sharper focus. We sense a powerful, complex mind, in which emotion and reason are not at war but are reinforcing allies. Russell's passionate response to life gains intensity because it is shaped by reason.

    Persona, as you can see, is a function of the total composition. It emerges not only from the meanings of words but also from the more abstract, less obviously expressive patterns of sentences and paragraphs and from overall organization.

    While most obvious in autobiographies, persona is not confined to such writing. It exists in all compositions. Even when a writer uses an impersonal point of view, avoiding "I," "me," "my," we sense a personality. In the following passage a historian is discussing dress and personal cleanliness in the Middle Ages:

    Hemp was much used as a substitute for flax in making linen; the thought of hemp curdles the blood.

    In the thirteenth century, Sir Giles, beside the fire, removes all his clothes to scratch himself. (Fleas, no doubt.) Morris Bishop

    Such comments reveal writers as personalities, with their own ways of looking at the bizarre with a pleas-antly cynical humor.

    Even in relatively faceless writing there exists a persona. Here is Charles Darwin describing the mouth of a duck:

    The beak of the shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful and complex structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper mandible is furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or comb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely bevelled so as to be pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth.

    80 THE ESSAY

    Darwin's is an observant, precise mind. He refrains from saying more than facts allow: notice the qualification "(in the specimen examined by me)." Although he does allow emotion occasionally to show (a stereotype), Darwin's tone is essentially sober, objective, painstaking, which, for his purpose, is exactly what it should be.

    Tone

    If persona is the complex personality implicit in the writing, tone is a web of feelings stretched throughout an essay, feelings from which our sense of the persona emerges. Tone has three main strands: the writer's attitude toward subject, reader, and self.

    Each of these determinants of tone is important, and each has many variations. Writers may be angry about a subject or amused by it or discuss it dispassionately. They may treat readers as intellectual inferiors to be lectured (usually a poor tactic) or as friends with whom they are talking. Themselves they may regard very seriously or with an ironic or an amused detachment (to suggest only three of numerous possibilities). Given all these variables, the possibilities of tone are almost endless.

    Tone, like persona, is unavoidable. You imply it in the words you select and in how you arrange them. It behooves you, then, to create an appropriate tone and to avoid those—pomposity, say, or flippancy—which offend.

    Here are a few examples of how skillful writers make tone work for them.

    Tone Toward Subject

    Toward most subjects many attitudes are possible. Often tone is simple objectivity, as in these two paragraphs:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Tone and Persona in Scientific Writing**\n\nExamine the passage about the shoveller-duck''s beak: ''The upper mandible is furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or comb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely bevelled so as to be pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the tone toward the subject (the shoveller-duck''s beak) based on the language used. Justify your answer using evidence from the passage.\n- **Part B**: Compare this tone with Darwin''s approach in his essay, noting how both writers use tone to convey their purpose.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of tone as a web of feelings and its role in shaping the writer''s perspective on the subject.'

    Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to
    the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular succession of
    events.

    POINT OF VIEW, PERSONA, AND TONE 81

    The name of physical science, however, is often applied in a
    more or less restricted manner to those branches of science in
    which the phenomena considered are of the simplest and most ab-
    stract kind, excluding the consideration of the more complex phe-
    nomena, such as those observed in living beings.

    James Clerk Maxwell

    Maxwell's purpose is to define physical science, not to express
    his feelings about it. His language, accordingly, is denotative
    and his tone objective and unemotional.

    The writer of the following paragraph, on the other hand,
    is angry:

    The Exorcist is a menace, the most shocking major movie have
    ever seen. Never before have witnessed such a flagrant combi-
    nation of perverse sex, brutal violence, and abused religion. In ad-
    dition, the film degrades the medical profession and psychiatry. At
    the showing went to, the unruly audience giggled, talked, and
    yelled throughout. As well they might. Although the picture is not
    X-rated, it is so pornographic that it makes Last Tango in Paris seem
    like a Strauss waltz. Ralph R. Mrdenson,

    And in this example an angry tone is expressed more subtly,
    beneath a surface of irony. The writer is describing the efforts
    of nineteenth-century laborers to improve their working
    conditions:

    [A]s early as June 8, th®4Zhartists had pushed through a fac-

    tory law restricting working time for women and juveniles to eleven
    hours, and from May 1, 1848 to ten hours. This was not at all to
    the liking of the manufacturers, who were worried about their
    young people's morals and exposure to vice; instead of being im-
    mured for a whole twelve hours in the cozy, clean, moral atmo-
    sphere of the factories, they were now to be loosed an hour earlier
    into the hard, cold, frivolous outer world. Fritz JRackeiz

    readers as a passive herd to be instructed. The playwright and
    social critic George Bernard Shaw attacks the evils of capi-
    talism in such a manner:

    Just as Parliament and the Courts are captured by the rich, so is the
    Church. The average parson does not teach honesty and equality
    in the village school: he teaches deference to the merely rich, and
    calls that loyalty and religion.

    At the other extreme a writer may establish a more intimate
    face-to-face tone, as though talking to a friend. In the follow-
    ing case Ingrid Bengis is discussing the problem of being the
    "other woman" in a married man's life, of having to share
    him with his wife:

    One or the other of you is going to spend the night with him, the
    weekend with him, Christmas with him. (I've tried all three of us
    spending it together. Doesn't work.) One or the other of you is going
    to go on trips with him.

    Bengis' informal, conversational tone depends on several
    things. For one, she addresses her readers directly, acknowl-
    edging their presence and bringing them and herself into a
    more intimate, and seemingly more equal, relationship. For
    another, she cultivates a colloquial style, one suggesting the
    voice of a friend: the contractions ("I've," "Doesn't") and the
    terse fragment ("Doesn't work").

    A friendly informal tone need not be restricted to com-
    monplace subjects. In much contemporary exposition, even
    of a scholarly sort, writers often relax the older convention
    of maintaining a formal distance between themselves and their
    audience. Here, for instance, is a well-known scholar writing
    about Shakespeare:

    Great plays, as we know, do present us with something that can be
    called a world, a woctddiwretraown in being made
    of people, actions, situations, thoughts, feelings, and much more,
    POINT OF VIEW, PERSONA, AND TONE 83

    but unlike our own in being perfectly, or almost perfectly, significant
    and coherent. Maynard Mack

    While certainly not as colloquial as Ingrid Bengis, Mack ac-
    knowledges his readers ("As we know") and subtly flatters
    their intelligence and sophistication.

    Writers working for the illusion of a talking voice sometimes use italics to suggest the loudness and pitch by which we draw attention to important words. The historian Barbara Tuchman does this effectively in the following passage (she is arguing that freedom of speech does not require that we accept any and all pornography):

    The cause of pornography is not the same as the cause of free speech. There is a difference. Ralph Ginsburg is not Theodore Dreiser and this is not the 1920s.

    Used sparingly, in that way, italics help to suggest a voice with which readers can connect. But note the caution: sparingly. Italics used for emphasis can easily become a mannerism, and then an annoyance.

    Tone Toward Self

    Toward himself or herself a writer can adopt an equally great variety of tones. Objective, impersonal exposition involves a negative presentation of the writer, so to speak. By avoiding personal references or idiosyncratic comments, he or she becomes a transparency through which we observe facts or ideas. A British writer discussing the Battle of Anzio in Italy during World War II begins like this:

    The full story of Anzio, which was originally conceived as a minor landing behind enemy lines but evolved through many ups and downs into a separate Italian front of major importance, needs a history to itself. Within the scope of the present work it is possible only to summarize the main events and their significance in so far as they affected the main front at Cassino. Fred Majdalany

    On the other hand, writers may be more self-conscious and deliberately play a role. In exposition it is often a good tactic to present yourself a bit deferentially, as Benjamin Franklin suggests in the passage quoted earlier. An occasional "it seems to me" or "I think" or "to my mind" goes a long way toward avoiding a tone of cocksureness and restoring at least a semblance of two-way talk unavoidably one-way street from writer to reader. Thus a scholar writing about Chaucer's love poetry escapes dogmatism by a qualifying phrase:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Italics and Tone in Written Communication**\n\nAnalyze how the use of italics and tone contribute to the effectiveness of the passage by Barbara Tuchman (from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing* by Thomas S. Kane).\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two instances where italics are used in Tuchman''s text. Explain how these instances serve to emphasize or clarify specific ideas.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the tone of Tuchman''s passage with that of the British writer discussing the Battle of Anzio. How does the use of tone (objective vs. self-conscious) influence the reader''s perception of the text?\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author suggests that italics should be used ''sparingly.'' What are the potential consequences of overusing them, according to the passage?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both the use of italics and tone, demonstrating an understanding of their roles in shaping reader engagement and clarity.'

    An expository paragraph is essentially an enlargement of a subject/predicate pattern like "Dogs bark." But the subject is more complicated and needs to be expressed in a clause or sentence, called the topic statement, which is usually placed at or near the beginning. The predicates—asserted about the special sequence—these constitute the body of the paragraph, developing or supporting the topic in any of several ways, ways we shall study in subsequent chapters.

    No one can say how long a paragraph should be. Subject, purpose, audience, editorial fashion, and individual preference, all affect the length and complexity of paragraphs. As a rough rule of thumb, however, you might think of expository paragraphs in terms of 120 or 150 words. If most of your paragraphs fall below 100 words, say—they are they need more development. If your paragraphs run consistently to 200 or 300 words, they are probably too long and need to be shortened or divided. Numerous brief paragraphs are liable to be disjointed and underdeveloped. Great long ones fatigue readers. But neither is a very broad average. An occasional short paragraph of 15 to 20 words may work very well; so may an occasional long one of 300.

    The Topic Sentence

    A good topic sentence is concise and emphatic. It is no longer than the idea requires, and it stresses the important word or phrase. Here, for instance, is the topic statement which opens a paragraph about the collapse of the stock market in 1929:

    The Big Bull Market was dead. Frederick Lewis Allen

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Expository Paragraph Structure**\n\nCompose a 150-word expository paragraph that explains the purpose of a topic sentence in an academic essay. Your paragraph must include:\n- A clear topic statement (the first sentence) that introduces the main idea\n- Three supporting predicates that explain how a topic sentence functions (e.g., "A topic sentence provides...", "It establishes...", etc.)\n- A concluding sentence that summarizes the role of the topic sentence in organizing ideas\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must follow the structure described above and demonstrate an understanding of expository writing principles from the text. The final sentence should explicitly reference the ''subject-predicate'' pattern mentioned in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: |-
    **Analysis of Paragraph Length and Development**\n\nEvaluate the following two paragraphs based on the criteria provided in the text:\nParagraph A: (100 words)\n"The collapse of the stock market in 1929 was a turning point. It led to widespread unemployment, economic instability, and social unrest. The Great Depression began as a result of these factors."\n
    Paragraph B: (300 words)\n"The stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the Great Depression. This event had far-reaching consequences that affected various aspects of American life. The economic downturn led to widespread unemployment, reduced consumer spending, and a decline in business investment. As a result, many industries faced severe challenges, leading to mass layoffs. Additionally, the banking system became unstable, with numerous banks failing due to lack of reserves. This crisis not only impacted the economy but also had social and political ramifications, including increased government intervention and changes in economic policy."\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Determine whether each paragraph meets the 'rough rule of thumb' for expository writing (120–150 words). Explain your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Assess whether Paragraph A is underdeveloped and Paragraph B is too long, based on the text's advice about paragraph length. Provide specific examples from the text to support your evaluation.\n- **Part C**: Propose one revision for each paragraph that aligns with the text's recommendations for effective expository writing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text's guidelines on paragraph length and development, using specific examples from the passage.
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluation of Topic Sentence Effectiveness**\n\nAnalyze the following topic sentence from a paragraph about the stock market crash in 1929: "The Big Bull Market was dead." (from Frederick Lewis Allen''s essay)\n- **Part A**: Identify one strength and one weakness of this topic sentence based on the text''s description of a ''good topic sentence.''\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the topic sentence to improve its effectiveness, following the guidelines provided in the text. Your revised sentence should be concise, emphatic, and include a key phrase that highlights the main idea.\n- **Part C**: Compare the original and revised topic sentences using the criteria from the text (e.g., conciseness, emphasis on important words). Explain how your revision aligns with the principles of expository writing described in the passage.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the characteristics of effective topic sentences as outlined in the text.'

    Notice several things. (1) Allen's sentence is brief. Not all topics can be explained in six words, but whether they take six or sixty, they should be phrased in no more words than are absolutely necessary. (2) The sentence is clear and strong: you understand exactly what AHams. (3) It places the key thomhd,‘(deart guts heavy stress and leads naturally into what will follow. Of course, if a topic sentence ends on a key term, it must do so naturally, without violating any rules of word order or idiom. (4) The sentence stands farshe paragraph. This is where topic statements generally belong: at or near the beginning.

    To attract attention, topic sentences sometimes appear in the form of rhetorical questions:

    What then is the modern view of Joan's voices and messages from God? George Bernard Shaw

    What did Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation accomplish? J. G. Randall

    Rhetorical questions are easy ways of generating paragraphs. Perhaps too easy; so use them with restraint. Once is probably enough in a short piece of writing.

    Another eye-catching form of topic statement is the fragment, the grammatically incomplete sentence, as in the second paragraph of this passage (italics added):

    Approaching the lake from the south, spread out, high up in a great V, was a flock of Canada geese. They did not land but continued on their way, trailed by the brass notes of their honking.

    Spring. How perfect its fanfare. No trumpets or drums could ever have so triumphantly announced the presence of royalty. Stood marveling in their wake until, cold, teturned to the firs to see what else Could usummon Ruth Rudner

    But fragments, too, are effective only if they are used with restraint. Most of the time the best topic statement is a strong, clear, grammatically complete, declarative sentence.

    Sentences as the Analytic Elements of a Paragraph

    The sentences of a good expository paragraph reflect a clear, rational analysis of the topic. Here is a brief example, this one by Bertrand Russell. (The sentences have been numbered for convenience.)

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Topic Sentence Structure**\n\nWrite a topic sentence that effectively introduces the main idea of a paragraph discussing the impact of social media on modern communication. Your sentence must adhere to the principles outlined in the text regarding topic sentences, including clarity, strength, and proper structure.\n- **Clarity**: The sentence should clearly state the central idea without ambiguity.\n- **Strength**: It should command attention, possibly using a rhetorical question or a strong declarative statement.\n- **Structure**: Ensure it is grammatically complete and avoids fragments unless used with restraint.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your topic sentence must be concise, clear, and demonstrate understanding of the text''s emphasis on effective topic sentences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Question Effectiveness**\n\nEvaluate the rhetorical question "What then is the modern view of Joan''s voices and messages from God?" based on the criteria provided in the text.\n- **Attention**: Does it successfully draw the reader into the topic?\n- **Clarity**: Is the question clear and relevant to the paragraph it introduces?\n- **Restraint**: Would using this rhetorical question be appropriate in a short piece of writing, or does it risk overuse?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze the effectiveness of the rhetorical question based on the text''s guidelines, demonstrating an understanding of when and how to use such devices.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Construction of a Declarative Topic Sentence**\n\nCreate a topic sentence that introduces a paragraph about the historical significance of the Emancipation Proclamation. Your sentence must be grammatically complete, strong, and clear, following the text''s advice against using fragments unless necessary.\n- **Historical Significance**: The sentence should highlight the proclamation''s role in shaping American history.\n- **Strength**: It should assert the main idea with confidence.\n- **Clarity**: The sentence must be free of ambiguity and directly relevant to the paragraph''s content.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your topic sentence must embody the principles of effective writing discussed in the text, demonstrating an understanding of proper structure and purpose.'

    [1] The intellectual life of the nineteenth century was more com-
    plex than that of any previous age. [2] This was due to several
    causes. [3] First: the area concerned was larger than ever before;
    America and Russia made important contributions, and Europe be-
    came more aware than formerly of Indian philosophies, both an-
    cient and modern. [4] Second: science, which had been a chief
    source of novelty since the seventeenth century, made new con-
    quests, especially in geology, biology, and organic chemistry.
    92 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH

    [5] Third: machine production profoundly altered the social struc-
    ture, and gave men a new conception of their powers in relation
    to the physical environment. [6] Fourth: a profound revolt, both
    philosophical and political, against traditional systems of thought,
    in politics and in economics, gave rise to attacks upon many beliefs
    and institutions that had hitherto been regarded as unassailable.
    [7] This revolt had two very different forms, one romantic, the other
    rationalistic. [8] (I am using these words in a liberal sense.) [9] The
    romantic revolt passes from Byron, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche
    to Mussolini and Hitler; the rationalistic revolt begins with the
    French philosophers of the Revolution, passes on, somewhat soft-
    ened, to the philosophical radicals in England, then acquires a
    deeper form in Marx and issues in Soviet Russia.

    Russell's nine sentences correspond to his steps in analyz-
    ing his topic:

    Examining whether the sentences of a paragraph corre-
    spond with its ideas is a good test of the coherence of the
    paragraph. The correspondence need not be as exact as in
    Russell's paragraph (and usually will not be). But if you can-
    not outline a generally clear relationship, the paragraph is
    probably confused and confusing.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Intellectual Complexity in the Nineteenth Century**\n\nBased on the passage, identify and explain three distinct causes that contributed to the increased intellectual complexity of the nineteenth century. Use the text''s structure as a guide to your answer.\n- **Cause 1**: Reference the first cause mentioned (larger area of inquiry) and provide specific examples from the text (e.g., America, Russia, Europe''s engagement with Indian philosophies).\n- **Cause 2**: Explain how scientific advancements in geology, biology, and organic chemistry led to new knowledge.\n- **Cause 3**: Describe the impact of machine production on society and human perception.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly outline three causes with specific textual examples and demonstrate understanding of the passage''s structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Romantic and Rationalistic Revolts**\n\nThe text describes two opposing intellectual revolts in the nineteenth century: romantic and rationalistic.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast these two revolts based on their origins, development, and outcomes as described in the passage. Use specific examples from the text (e.g., Byron to Hitler for romantic; French Revolution to Marx for rationalistic).\n- **Part B**: Explain why the text uses the term ''liberal sense'' when discussing the romantic revolt. How does this affect the interpretation of the revolts'' evolution?\n- **Part C**: Propose a modern equivalent for each revolt (romantic and rationalistic), ensuring that your examples reflect the same ideological underpinnings as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the passage''s content, provide clear comparisons, and demonstrate an understanding of the historical context.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluating Paragraph Coherence**\n\nThe passage discusses the structure of a paragraph and its relationship to the ideas it presents.\n- **Part A**: Using Russell''s analysis as a model, outline the main idea and plan of the text. Identify at least three sentences that support the main idea and explain their role in the overall argument.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the coherence of the paragraph based on the relationship between its sentences. Provide one example of how the sentences align with the main idea and one example of a sentence that might be confusing without proper context.\n- **Part C**: Suggest one modification to improve the clarity or flow of the paragraph, referencing specific parts of the text (e.g., the ''qualification'' or ''specification'' sections).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of paragraph structure and coherence, with explicit references to the passage''s content.'

- prompt: |-
    The fact that a paragraph like Russell's reveals a coherent logical structure does not imply that the writer worked from an outline. One can proceed in this way, but in writing of any length an outline is tedious and time-consuming. Experienced writers adjust sentences to thought intuitively, without constantly thinking about when to begin a new sentence. Those with less experience must remain more conscious of the problem. Working up paragraphs from outlines provides good practice. But whether it is consciously thought out or intuitive, a well-made paragraph uses sentences to analyze the subject.

    For Practice

    [> Selecting one of the general subjects listed below, compose ten topic sentences, each on a different aspect of the subject, with an eye to developing a paragraph of about 150 words. Aim at clarity, emphasis, concision. Experiment with placing key words at the end of the sentence and with one or two rhetorical questions and fragments.

    The economic future as you see it
    National or local politics

    Popular entertainment

    Sports

    Sexual relationships

    [> Make an outline like that for Russell's paragraph, showing how the sentences of the following paragraph relate to its ideas. The analysis might begin like this:

    Sentence idea

    1 Topic: a paradox about grammar
    2 Specification: first part of the paragraph—people
    grammar as dull

    > [1] A curious paradox exists in regard to grammar. [2] On the one hand it is felt to be the dullest and driest of academic subjects, fit only for those in whose veins the red blood of life has long since turned to ink. [3] On the other, it is a subject upon which people who would scorn to be professional grammarians hold very dogmatic opinions, which they will defend with considerable emotion.
    [4] Much of this prejudice stems from the usual sources of prejudice. [5] Even highly educated people seldom have a clear idea of what grammarians do, and there is an unfortunate confusion about the meaning of the term "grammar" itself. W. Nelson Francis

    Paragraph unity involves two related but distinct concepts:
    coherence and flow. Coherence means that the ideas fit together. Flow means that the sentences link up so that readers are not conscious of gaps. Flow is a matter of style and exists in specific words and grammatical patterns tying one sentence to another. Coherence belongs to the substructure of the paragraph, to relationships of thought, feeling, and perception. Both are necessary if a paragraph is to be truly unified.

    Coherence

    To be coherent a paragraph must satisfy two criteria: First, relevance to the topic. Second, effective ordering be arranged in a way that clarifies their
    logic or their importance. There is, in addition, a negative criterion of irrelevance, be omitted.

    Relevance

    A topic sentence makes a promise that the paragraph must fulfill. Do not wander from the topic. No matter how attractive an idea may seem, let it go if you cannot fit it into the
    topic you have staked out or cannot revise the topic to include it. Here is an example of a paragraph marred by irrelevance:

    [1] College is very different from high school. [2] The professors
    talk a great deal more and give longer homework assignments.
    [3] This interferes with your social life. [4] It may even cost you
    your girlfriend. [5] Girls don't like to be told that you have to stay
    home and study when they want to go to a show or go dancing.
    [6] So they find some other boy who doesn't have to study all the
    time. [7] Another way college is different is the examinations. . .

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Coherence and Flow in Paragraph Structure**\n\nAnalyze the example paragraph provided in the text, which is marred by irrelevance: [1] College is very different from high school. [2] The professors talk a great deal more and give longer homework assignments. [3] This interferes with your social life. [4] It may even cost you your girlfriend. [5] Girls don''t like to be told that you have to stay home and study when they want to go to a show or go dancing. [6] So they find some other boy who doesn''t have to study all the time. [7] Another way college is different is the examinations. . .\n- **Task A**: Identify at least three instances of irrelevance within the paragraph and explain how each instance deviates from the topic sentence.\n- **Task B**: Propose a revised version of the paragraph that demonstrates coherence by focusing on the main idea of "differences between college and high school." Justify your revision using the criteria for relevance and effective ordering provided in the text.\n- **Task C**: Compare and contrast the concepts of coherence and flow, explaining how both are necessary for a unified paragraph according to the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Reasoning on Topic Sentences and Relevance**\n\nThe text emphasizes that a topic sentence makes a promise that the paragraph must fulfill. Using this principle, evaluate the following hypothetical paragraph: [1] The importance of exercise cannot be overstated. [2] It improves your health, boosts your mood, and helps you lose weight. [3] Additionally, it can reduce stress and increase longevity. [4] However, many people find it difficult to maintain a regular exercise routine. [5] Therefore, finding the right type of exercise is essential for long-term success.\n- **Task A**: Determine whether this paragraph is coherent based on the criteria of relevance and effective ordering. Justify your answer by showing how each sentence relates to the topic sentence.\n- **Task B**: Identify one potential addition or modification that could improve the coherence of the paragraph while maintaining its main idea. Explain why this change would enhance coherence according to the text.\n- **Task C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on avoiding irrelevance applies to real-world writing scenarios, such as academic papers or persuasive essays.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Paragraph Construction**\n\nConstruct a paragraph that discusses the topic "the benefits of reading" following these guidelines:\n- **Guideline A**: Begin with a topic sentence that clearly states the main idea.\n- **Guideline B**: Ensure that all supporting sentences are relevant and ordered logically to reinforce the main idea.\n- **Guideline C**: Include at least one example that illustrates a specific benefit of reading, using details from the text''s discussion of coherence and flow.\n\n**Task A**: Write the paragraph with 5-7 sentences.\n**Task B**: Analyze your own paragraph to identify elements that contribute to its coherence and flow, referencing the criteria provided in the text.\n**Task C**: Explain how your paragraph demonstrates the principles of unity through coherence and flow as discussed in the reading.'

- prompt: |-
    The paragraph begins well. The first sentence establishes the topic and the second supports it. Then the writer begins to slide away. Sentences 3 and 4 might be allowed if they were subordinated. But 5 and 6 lose contact. True, some people do not like to take second place to homework, but that is not pertinent here. In sentence 7 the writer tacitly acknowledges that he has wandered, throwing out a long transitional lifeline to haul us back to the topic. Rid of irrelevance, the paragraph might read:

    College is very different from high school. The professors talk a great deal more and give longer homework assignments, which interfere with your social life. College examinations, too, are different... .

    Order of Thought

    Relevance alone is not enough to establish coherence. All the ideas in a paragraph can relate to the topic yet be poorly arranged.

    Arrangement often inheres in the subject itself. A paragraph about baking a cake or preparing to water-ski is committed to following the steps of the process it describes. Telling a story, you must follow a certain sequence of events. And in some subjects there is a logical structure implicit in the subject that determines order of thought, as in this example about the value of opposition in politics:

    The opposition is indispensable. A good statesman, like any other sensible human being, always learns more from his opponents than from his fervent supporters. For his supporters will push him to disaster unless his opponents show him where the dangers are. So if he is wise he will often pray to be delivered from his friends, because they will ruin him. But, though it hurts, he ought also to pray never to be left without opponents; for they keep him on the path of reason and good sense. Walter Ligomann

    There is a necessary order of thought here: first assertion, next a reason supporting it, and then a conclusion, introduced by "so."

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Paragraph Coherence**\n\nUsing the excerpt from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing* and the example about the value of opposition in politics, analyze how the paragraph''s structure contributes to its coherence.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main topic of the paragraph.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the order of ideas (assertion, reason, conclusion) and explain how each part supports the overall argument.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this structure with the example given about college differences, explaining why coherence is achieved through logical sequence rather than just relevance.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must demonstrate an understanding of both the text''s structure and the concept of coherence in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Paragraph Organization**\n\nConsider the revised version of the college paragraph provided in the text. Using the principles from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing*, evaluate the effectiveness of this version compared to the original.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main topic and the supporting ideas in the revised paragraph.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the structure (introduction, contrast, conclusion) contributes to coherence.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the revised version is more coherent than the original, referencing the example about opposition in politics.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must explicitly link the paragraph''s organization to the concept of coherence as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Writing Structure**\n\nCreate a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) that demonstrates coherent writing by following a logical sequence of ideas, similar to the example about opposition in politics.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a topic related to your field of study.\n- **Step 2**: Outline the structure: assertion, reason, conclusion.\n- **Step 3**: Write the paragraph, ensuring each part logically follows the previous one and supports the main argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must demonstrate a clear logical flow and adhere to the principles of coherence outlined in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    There are times, however, when the order of thought is less a function of the subject itself than of the writer's view of it. For instance, if you were writing about the three things that most surprised you the first time you visited, say, New York City, you might not find any logical or temporal relationship between those things.

    One solution in such cases is to arrange ideas in order of relative importance, either climactically, placing the most important last, or anticlimactically, putting it first. If you cannot discern any shadings of importance, consider which order best connects with what has gone before or with what will come next. Should you find no basis whatever for arranging the ideas within a paragraph, then, of course, any order is legitimate. But this is not likely to happen often. Most of the time a proper or at least a most effective way of sequencing ideas does exist.

    Paragraph Flow

    Flow, those visible links which bind the sentences of a paragraph, can be established in two basic ways. (They are compatible; a paragraph may employ both.) The first is to establish a master plan at the beginning of the paragraph and to introduce each new idea by a word or phrase that marks its place in the plan. The second concentrates on linking sentences successively as the paragraph develops, making sure that each statement connects with the one or ones preceding it.

    Setting Up a Master Plan

    The opening sentence makes clear, not only the topic, but also how it will be analyzed and developed:

    There are three kinds of book owners. The first has a standard set and best readers—(Unless the individual owns wood pulp and ink, not books.) The second has a great many books that he has read through, most of them dipped into, but all of them as clean and shiny as the day they were bought. (This person would probably like to make books his own, but is restrained by a false respect for their physical appearance.) The third has a few books or many that are very dog-eared and dilapidated, shaken and loosened by continual use, marked and scribbled in from front to back. (This man owns books.)

Each type reflects different attitudes toward ownership and care of books."\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the paragraph''s flow structure by explaining whether it uses a master plan or sequential linking. Support your answer with specific examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Justify why this structure is effective for conveying the author''s purpose, referencing the text''s discussion on how opening sentences establish the topic and analysis plan.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Logical Sequencing in Writing**\n\nWrite a paragraph that describes your first visit to New York City, following the advice given in the text regarding arranging ideas by importance or relevance. Use at least three distinct experiences from the trip and ensure that your paragraph flows logically according to the principles discussed in the reading.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Arrange your three experiences in order of relative importance (e.g., climactic or anticlimactic), explaining your choice.\n- **Part B**: Connect each experience with the next using transitional phrases that demonstrate sequential linking, as discussed in the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how this sequencing reflects a ''master plan'' established at the beginning of your paragraph.'

    differentiated (break vs. tear, shrubvs. bush) or specifically clarified,
    such as fable, adventure, shake, door, remainder, evil. Most people
    get by without having to clarify these common words in the third
    group until they become an issue. Without an issue definitions of

    Numbering the parts of a pathgwapls—whether
    or with figures—is simple and clear. But it suits only topics
    which can be easily broken into parts. Moreover, it can seem
    mechanical and, overused, prove confusing. In a short essay
    one paragraph using this method of flow is enough.

    The obviousness of "first," "second," "third" can be
    avoided by introducing key terms right in the topic sentence
    to label the particular parts of the subject, and repeating those
    terms as each aspect is brought forward in the body of the
    paragraph (italics are added):

    We are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know,
    and the American dream has therefore become something much
    more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and
    international levels. Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare
    not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and
    no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for
    many millions of people we are an unmitigated disaster.

    One way of creating flow, then, is to announce your plan
    and explicitly fit each unit into that plan. It is not a method
    confined to single paragraphs. You can use it to organize a
    portion of a long paragraph (which is what Baldwin does), or
    expand it to organize a short theme, in which case the units
    would be individual paragraphs rather than sentences. But it
    is, as we said, a mechanical mode of organization to be em-
    ployed with restraint.
    100 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH

    Linking Successive Sentences

    The second way of maintaining flow is to connect sentences

    as you go. Less obvious than "first," "second," "third," this

    means of achieving flow seems more natural. And it can ac-

    commodate more complex relationships among ideas; it is not

    confined to topics that can be broken into a numbered series.
    Sentences can be linked in several ways.

    [> Repeating Key Words

    Verbal repetition is the most obvious link. Sometimes the
    identical word is repeated in a paragraph which

    follows on Saint Patiraok-ferometifntise

    same word, and sometimes synonymous terms:

    We know that among the marks of holiness is the working of mir-
    acles. Ireland is the greatest miracle any saint ever worked. It is a
    miracle and a nexus of miracles. Among other miracles it is a nation
    raised from the dead. Hilaire Belloc

    The repeated words may occur in a variety of positions. Of
    these the most useful are the beginnings of successive sen-
    tences, the endings of such sentences, and the close of one
    sentence and the opening of the one immediately following
    (the italics are added in the following examples):

    No man of note was ever further separated from life and fact than
    Lindbergh. No man could be more reluctant to admit it.

    PARAGRAPH UNITY

    A special case of synonymous repetition involves pronouns
    and demonstratives such as one, another, some, the former,
    the latter, the first, the second, the third, and so on. These
    words link sentences by substituting for an earlier word or
    phrase. This and that (along with their plurals these and those)
    are especially useful in this way and may be employed either
    as pronouns or as adjectives (italics are added):

    The blind in particular seem to become indifferent to climatic ex-
    tremes; and there must be in everyone's cognizance two or three
    immovable sightless mendicants defying rain and chill... .

    This insensitiveness to January blasts and February drenchings
    may be one of the compensations that the blind enjoy. Whatever
    else happens to them they never, perhaps, catch cold. And that is
    more than something. E. v. Lucas

    There is a danger, however, in using this or that as subjects.
    A connection clear to the writer does not always jump at the
    reader. The risk increases when the antecedent of the this or
    that is not a single word but a group of words, even a complex
    idea stretched over several sentences. It is sometimes better
    to use these words not as nouns but as adjectives modifying
    a more precise subject. The sentence sums up the pre-
    ceding point, as Lucas does with "this insensitiveness." As an
    adjective the this still hooks the new sentence to what has
    preceded it, but with less risk of confusion.

    [> Conjunctive Adverbs
    Sentences can also be linked by conjunctive (also called tran-
    sitional) adverbs, which indicate relationships between ideas.
    The relationship may be one of time (presently, meanwhile,
    afterwards, above, below, in front); or of logic
    (therefore, however, as a result).

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Paragraph Unity and Pronoun Usage**\n\nUsing the examples provided in the text, analyze how pronouns like ''this'' and ''that'' function in maintaining paragraph unity.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two sentences from the text where ''this'' or ''that'' is used as a pronoun. Explain how they refer back to earlier ideas.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the use of ''this'' as a pronoun versus its use as an adjective (e.g., "this insensitiveness"). Discuss the difference in function and clarity.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a revision for a paragraph where the antecedent of ''that'' is unclear, ensuring that the reference is unambiguous.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must directly reference the text''s examples and demonstrate an understanding of how pronouns contribute to paragraph cohesion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Conjunctive Adverbs in Logical Relationships**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, construct a paragraph that effectively links two contrasting ideas using conjunctive adverbs.\n- **Part A**: Choose two opposing concepts (e.g., success and failure, order and chaos).\n- **Part B**: Insert a conjunctive adverb (such as "however" or "therefore") to show the relationship between the two ideas.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this adverb reinforces the logical connection you''ve established, referencing the text''s explanation of their function.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be coherent and demonstrate a clear understanding of how conjunctive adverbs bridge ideas in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Pronoun Ambiguity**\n\nThe text warns against using ''this'' or ''that'' as subjects when their antecedents are unclear. Consider the following sentence: "That is a problem, and that must be solved."\n- **Part A**: Identify potential ambiguities in this sentence based on the text''s discussion of pronoun reference.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence to eliminate ambiguity while maintaining its original meaning. Justify your revision using the principles from the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare this scenario with the example given in the text where ''this'' is used as an adjective (e.g., "this insensitiveness"). Discuss why one usage is clearer than the other.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of pronoun reference and its implications for clarity in writing.'

    The following example shows how critic F. L. Lucas creates flow by transitional words (here italicized) in a passage answering the claim that metaphor has no place in prose:

    Io2 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH

    The truth seems that metaphor too is older than any literature—an immemorial human impulse perhaps as much utilitarian as literary.
    For there appears little ground for assigning poetic motives to the first man who called the hole in a needle its "eye," or the projections on a saw its "teeth." /n fine, metaphor is an inveterate human tendency, as ancient perhaps as the days of the mammoth, yet vigorous still in the days of the helicopter. Why then should it be banned from prose?

    "For.... In finehen" establish the logical framework of the argument:

    Assertion Sentence 1
    Reason "For," sentence 2
    Assertion restated "In fine," sentence 3
    Conclusion "then," sentence 4

    Transitional adverbs are best placed at or near the beginning of the sentence. Readers are like people groping down a dark passage, and an important part of the writer's task is to show them the way. Connective words are signal lights telling readers what to expect. However flashes, "Contradiction ahead"; in fact warns, "Here comes a strong restatement of something just said."; and therefore, &d&aclusion or a consequence is approaching."

    Acquiring a working set of conjunctive adverbs is not difficult. English is rich in them. Just to show some sort of contradiction or opposition, for example, we have but, however, still, yet, nonetheless, nevertheless, though, instead, on the other hand, on the contrary, notwithstanding, even so, and the list is not complete. While they show generally the same basic relationship, these words are not exact equivalents. They convey nuances of idea and tone. Nevertheless, for instance, is a more formal word than though. Because of such slight but important diffeeanoeg and tone, good writers have ready at hand a number of transitional adverbs. If you can call only upon but or however you cannot communicate what is implied by yet or still or though.

    **CHAPTER**

    **Paragraph Development:**
    (1) Illustration and Restatement

    In this and the following several chapters we study how expository paragraphs develop. We focus on one technique of development at a time, beginning with the simplest ones, illustration and restatement. Of course, writers often combine techniques. But walking comes before running, and for the moment we concentrate on relatively uncomplicated paragraphs.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Paragraph Development Techniques**\n\nRewrite the provided paragraph about tests using the technique of **illustration and restatement**, as outlined in the text. Your task is to maintain the original meaning but ensure that each idea is supported by an illustration or rephrased for clarity and coherence.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key ideas in the original paragraph (e.g., types of tests, their purposes, student experiences).\n- **Step 2**: For each key idea, provide a brief illustration (e.g., a specific example of a quiz or final exam) or rephrase it using equivalent wording.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that the rewritten paragraph flows logically and demonstrates understanding of the technique described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect an accurate application of the development techniques mentioned in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Paragraph Structure**\n\nExplain why the original paragraph is considered ''lacking unity'' based on the criteria provided in the text. Then, rewrite it using **illustration and restatement**, ensuring that each sentence connects to the central theme of testing in education.\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three reasons from the text that explain the lack of unity in the original paragraph.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the paragraph, integrating illustrations or restatements to create a coherent flow.\n- **Part B** must include at least two examples of illustration and one example of restatement.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation and rewrite must demonstrate an understanding of how paragraph development techniques enhance unity and clarity.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Expository Writing**\n\nCreate a short expository paragraph (three to four sentences) about a topic related to education, using the technique of **illustration and restatement** as described in the text. Your paragraph must include: \n- At least one illustration that clearly supports a point. \n- At least one restatement that rephrases a key idea without changing its meaning. \n- A conclusion that ties together the main ideas through logical reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must showcase an ability to apply the development techniques discussed in the text, with clear evidence of both illustration and restatement.'

- prompt: "Methods of paragraph development fall into three loose groups: (1) those that stay strictly within the topic, offering examples of it or merely repeating it in the varying ways; (2) techniques involving another subject, either related or analogous; and (3) techniques that explore the ramifications of the topic more fully, its causes or effects.\n\nIllustration  \nCiting examples is an easy way to support a generalization:\n\nSome of those writers who most admired technology—Whitman, Henry Adams, and H. G. Wells, for an example—also greatly admired the power of technology. Samuel C. Florman\n\n(1) ILLUSTRATION AND RESTATEMENT 107\n\nBut an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. George Orwell\n\nIllustrations show that you are not talking through your hat. Thus Florman gives us names, grounding his assertion in facts and enabling us to check that assertion against our own knowledge. Illustrations have a second virtue: they anchor an abstraction in particulars, translating difficult ideas into everyday terms. This is what Orwell does.\n\nBrief examples like those by Florman and Orwell do not make paragraphs, of course. But examples can be extended to provide the substance of an entire paragraph. Sometimes the paragraph consists of a single example worked out in detail:\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Illustration and Restatement Techniques**\n\nUsing the definition of illustration provided in the text, write a paragraph that supports the claim: ''Education is essential for personal growth.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least one example from real life or literature that illustrates the importance of education.\n- **Step 2**: Restate the claim using different wording to reinforce your argument.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this approach aligns with the text''s discussion on the role of examples in paragraph development.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must explicitly use an illustration (e.g., a historical figure, a literary character, or a real-world scenario) and demonstrate understanding of both techniques as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Cause and Effect in Paragraphs**\n\nThe text discusses how effects can become causes, reinforcing original causes and producing intensified effects. Using this concept, write a paragraph that explains how a lack of education can lead to a cycle of poverty.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the initial cause (lack of education).\n- **Step 2**: Describe the first effect (limited job opportunities).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this effect becomes a new cause, leading to further negative consequences.\n- **Step 4**: Conclude by tying your example back to the text''s discussion on cause and effect in paragraph development.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must clearly demonstrate the cycle described in the text and use logical reasoning based on the provided examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluation of Paragraph Structure Techniques**\n\nThe text categorizes methods of paragraph development into three groups: illustration/restatement, analogy/other subject, and ramifications/causes/effects. Choose one of these techniques and create a paragraph that illustrates its use.\n- **Step 1**: Select a technique (e.g., ''ramifications'' or ''analogy'').\n- **Step 2**: Write a paragraph that explicitly uses the chosen technique to support a claim about technology''s impact on society.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this approach aligns with the text''s explanation of the technique, using specific details from the provided examples.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must clearly demonstrate the selected technique and reference at least one example from the text to support your explanation.'

    Some of the most abstract terms in the language are really faded metaphors. On examination it turns out that an earlier meaning, now forgotten, is often lively in the extreme. Hence an obvious means of invigorating our jejune vocabulary is to fall back on those lively older meanings. True enough, the average speaker does not know that they ever existed. He is not reminded that "express" once meant, literally and physically, "to press out." But he can learn it instantaneously from a context. It may be that only the archaic literal sense is intended, or it may be that both the physical and the metaphorical are to be grasped simultaneously. In any event, the impact of the divergent use on an attentive reader forces him to a new experience of the word, without sacrificing comprehension. An example of the use of "express" in this revivified fashion will be found in Emily Dickinson:

    Essential Oil—are wrung—

    The Attar from the Rose

    Be not expressed by Suns—alone—

    lis the gift of Screws— Margaret Schlauch

    On the other hand a paragraph may consist of a number of brief examples, as in this passage about the change in modern modes of eating and drinking:

    108 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH

    As far as the home is concerned, the biggest change in what P. C.

Fish arrives as a frozen rectangular block. Soup, stiff with preservatives, comes in a tin or as a powder. Potatoes no longer wear their jackets but arrive pale and naked in an impenetrable plastic bag. Embryonic mashed potato comes in little dry lumps, like cattle-feed pellets. Bread, untouched by human baker, arrives wrapped and sliced in a soft lump, the "crust" seemingly sprayed on. Beer, urged upward by gas, emerges from a steel dustbin. Frank Muir

    For example, for instance, as a case in point, or, a bit more subtly, say, thus, consider. Vary these expressions; do not introduce every illustration with "for example." Nor is it necessary always to place the phrase in the opening position. "For instance," "for example," is equally effective set between subject and verb, where it is still near the beginning but seems less mechanical.

    When the illustrative function of a detail is obvious, you can safely dispense with an introductory phrase. Orwell does not write, "For example, a man may take to drink ..."; nor does Muir label his instances of the oddity of modern food. They depend on the reader's common sense. No infallible rule tells you when "for example" is superfluous and when its absence will confuse a reader. You must try to imagine yourself in the reader's place. If an illustration seems even a bit bewildering without an introductory word or phrase, put one in.

    Introduced or not, examples are most effective when they are specific. In Muir's paragraph the abstract expression "‘the odd form our food is in' is given heft and shape by "frozen rectangular block," "pale and naked in an impenetrable plastic bag," "little dry lumps, like cattle-feed pellets."

    For Practice

    [> Study the paragraph below. Identify the topic sentence. Where do the examples begin? Are they explicitly introduced? Do you think them clear and effective, adequately supporting the topic? Why or why not?

    Primitive peoples often build much of their religious and cultural behavior on this belief in the natural relationship of word and thing. For example, they believe that to know the name of an object, person, or deity is to gain a certain control over it: in Balinese culture, for instance, the name of a god is often used in rituals to invoke his presence.

    The Restatement Paragraph

    At its simplest, restatement involves nothing more than re-
    peating the main idea. It is common as a way of emphasizing
    something important:

    1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has wit-
    nessed. The most explosive year. Malcolm x

    Sufficiently extended, restatement will provide the sub-
    stance of an entire paragraph, as in this passage about why
    American men are unlikely to cry (the paragraph expresses
    attitudes of our culture, not the writer's own beliefs):

    American men don't cry, because it is considered unmasculine to
    do so. Only sissies cry. Crying is a "weakness" characteristic of the
    female, and no American male wants to be identified with anything
    in the least weak or feminine. Crying, in our culture, is identified
    with childishness, with weakness and dependence. No one likes a
    crybaby, and we disapprove of crying even in children, discour-
    aging it in them as early as possible. In a land so devoted to the
    pursuit of happiness as ours, crying really is rather un-American.
    Adults must learn not to cry in situations in which it is permissible
    for a child to cry. Women being the "weaker" and "dependent"
    sex, it is only natural that they should cry in certain emotional
    situations. In women, crying is excusable. But in men, crying is a
    mark of weakness. So goes the American credo with regard to
    crying. Ashley Montagu

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Restatement Techniques**\n\nRestate the following sentence using restatement techniques, ensuring that your version retains the original meaning but presents it in a new way: "The most explosive year. Malcolm X."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main idea of the original statement.\n- **Step 2**: Use paraphrasing and rewording to express this idea without changing its core message.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that your restatement is concise and effectively conveys the same emphasis as the original.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must be a complete sentence that accurately reflects the original intent, demonstrating an understanding of how restatement functions in emphasizing key points.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Restatement in Cultural Analysis**\n\nRestate the paragraph from Ashley Montagu''s text about American men and crying in your own words. Ensure that your version preserves all the main ideas and attitudes expressed in the original passage, including the cultural norms surrounding masculinity and emotional expression.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key points: cultural perception of crying in men, association with weakness, societal disapproval, and the contrast with women''s behavior.\n- **Step 2**: Paraphrase each idea using alternative vocabulary while maintaining the original meaning.\n- **Step 3**: Combine these paraphrased ideas into a coherent paragraph that reflects the same cultural attitudes as the source text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your restatement must accurately capture the original message and demonstrate an ability to convey complex social attitudes through effective rephrasing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Restatement and Taboo Language**\n\nThe text discusses how certain words are tabooed or replaced with euphemisms, as seen in the example of ''little people'' instead of ''fairies.'' Consider the phrase "Open Sesame!" from the story of the Forty Thieves.\n- **Part A**: Explain why this phrase is not considered taboo, based on the text''s discussion of language and cultural practices.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument about why certain words are tabooed while others are not, using examples from both the text and your own understanding of language.\n- **Part C**: Create a hypothetical scenario where a taboo word is used in a non-taboo context, and explain how this usage would challenge or align with the text''s ideas about language and cultural norms.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate concepts from the text with logical reasoning to analyze the role of language in shaping cultural attitudes and taboos.'

Include at least three different types of sentences (e.g., declarative, interrogative, or imperative) and demonstrate how varied syntax can effectively convey the same message without monotony.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your restatement must accurately reflect the original content and clearly show an understanding of the challenges of maintaining clarity while avoiding repetition in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Restatement Challenges**\n\nExplain why the original passage about piracy is considered a restatement, using examples from the text. Then, analyze how the structure of the sentences affects readability and comprehension.

- prompt: |-
    Aside from knowing when to stop, success in handling re-
    statement depends on sufficiently varying the diction and sen-
    tence form. Masefield, for example, keeps the same pattern
    for four successive sentences: "There were pirates in" + a
    verbal phrase. But each sentence differs in its specific content
    (and hence in diction). At the same time the similarity of
    structure reinforces the point that piracy existed everywhere.
    Masefield also uses the repeated sentence structure to build
    toward his main topic—the Mediterranean. In a fifth
    "there were" sentence he signals the climactic significance of
    the Mediterranean by varying the pattern: opening with
    "But," placing "perhaps" in an interrupting position, and
    changing completely the second half of the sentence.

    Negative-Positive Restatement

    Negative-positive restatement begins by saying what is not
    the case, then asserts what is. (Sometimes the order is
    reversed.)

    I am not thinking of philosophy as courses in philosophy or even
    as a subject exclusive of other subjects. I am thinking of it in its old
    Greek sense, the sense in which Socrates thought of it, as the love
    and search for wisdom, the habit of pursuing an argument where it
    leads, the delight in understanding for its own sake, the passionate
    pursuit of dispassionate reasonableness, the will to see things stead-
    ily and altogether. Brand Blanshard

    Specification

    Another special type of restatement is specification, which
    moves from the general to the particular. Brief specifications
    are often found within single sentences as a means of giving
    substance to an abstraction (italics added):

    Bound to the production of staple crops—sugar—
    the soil suffered from erosion and neglect. Oscar Handlin

    112 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH

    A more extended instance occurs in this paragraph about pol-
    itics in Louisiana. The paragraph develops by specifying all
    that is included in the phrase "the same political pattern":

    Throughout the years the same political pattern prevailed. The city
    dominated the state: New Orleans, the nation's oldest
    city—still the political center of Louisiana.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Restatement Techniques in Expository Writing**\n\nThe text discusses three restatement techniques: negative-positive, repeated structure, and specification. Using these concepts, analyze the following excerpt from a hypothetical expository paragraph:\n\n"There were pirates in the Caribbean, there were pirates in the Mediterranean, there were pirates in the Atlantic, there were pirates in every port of call. But in the Mediterranean, the pirates were not just raiders—they were explorers, traders, and diplomats."\n\n- **Part A**: Identify which restatement techniques are used and explain how they contribute to the paragraph''s main idea.\n- **Part B**: How does the shift from repeated structure to negative-positive restatement in the last sentence reinforce the significance of the Mediterranean?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly reference all three techniques and demonstrate understanding of their roles in expository writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Specification in Abstraction**\n\nThe text provides an example of specification within a single sentence: "Bound to the production of staple crops—sugar—the soil suffered from erosion and neglect." Using this model, rewrite the abstract concept of ''urbanization'' into a specific, concrete description.\n\n- **Part A**: Define ''urbanization'' in your own words.\n- **Part B**: Apply specification by describing how urbanization manifests in a single sentence, similar to the example provided.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast your specification with the example given in the text. Highlight how both approaches transform abstract ideas into tangible realities.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate mastery of specification as a restatement technique and show clear comparison with the text''s example.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Restatement Techniques**\n\nThe text describes negative-positive restatement as beginning with what is not the case, then asserting what is. Using this concept, evaluate the following argument:\n\n"Education should not be seen as a means to an end, but as a process of lifelong learning and personal growth."\n\n- **Part A**: Rewrite the statement using negative-positive restatement.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this restatement clarifies or challenges the original argument.\n- **Part C**: Consider the broader implications of viewing education through a negative-positive lens. How might this perspective influence policy or pedagogy?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly use the definition provided in the text and demonstrate critical thinking about the implications of restatement techniques in communication.'

And in central and northern Louisiana, the small farmers, principally Anglo-Saxon; bitter, fundamentalist Protestants, hating the city and all its evil works, leaderless in their disquiet and only vaguely aware that much of what they lacked was in some way coupled with the tteassbkkers whom they alternately voted into and out of public life. Hodding Carter

    While specification resembles illustration, it differs in an important way. An illustration is one of several possible cases. Specification covers all the cases. In the sentence above by Professor Handlin, "tobacco, cotton, rice, sugar" are not simply examples of the staple crops of southern agriculture; they are the staple crops. Similarly Hodding Carter, beginning with the abstract phrase "political pattern," specifies that pattern in its entirety, rather than citing one or two parts by way of example.

    The methods of development we study in this chapter involve two subjects (occasionally more than two). Analogy is a special kind of comparison in which a subject of secondary importance and often of a quite different nature is introduced to clarify or justify some aspect of the main subject. Comparison treats two subjects of the same nature, as does contrast; but the former shows how the subjects are alike, while the latter focuses on how they differ. But despite this difference, comparison and contrast work in the same way, and we consider them together, putting off analogy until the end of the chapter.

    Comparison and Contrast
    Focusing

    Because they involve at least two subjects and offer several possibilities of emphasis, comparison and contrast pose problems of focus. For one thing, you must decide whether to deal only with similarities or only with dissimilarities, or to cover both. The topic sentence must make your intention clear to readers:

    Susanne K. Langer

    It is a temptation to make a comparison between the nineteen twenties and the nineteen sixties, but the similarities are fewer than the differences. Russell Lynes

    Bears and dogs are alike in one intriguing way. Evelyn Jones

    A second decision of focusing concerns the subjects. Will you concentrate on one subject or treat both equally? If you are comparing (or contrasting), say, New York and Los Angeles, you have three possibilities of focus: New York, Los Angeles, or both. Make clear which it will be. But don't be heavy-handed; a topic sentence like "I shall focus here upon New York" is mechanical and obvious. Instead, construct the topic sentence so that the key idea functions as the subject word and thus naturally indicates your focus. If your chief concern is, say, New York:

    In many ways New York is like Los Angeles.
    If it is both places:
    In many ways New York and Los Angeles are alike.

    In the following paragraph notice how the historian J. G. Randall keeps his focus constantly before us. (He is comparing the failure of Reconstruction after the Civil War and the refusal of the U.S. Senate to accept President Wilson's League of Nations policy after World War I. The italics have been added.)

    In the case of both Lincoln and Wilson the soldiers did their part and so did the Executive, but in each case partisanship and narrow-mindedness wrecked the program. Under Lincoln and Johnson, as under Wilson, there was failure of high-minded unity behind the plan of peace that bore promise of success. In each case, instead of needful co-operation, there was stupid deadlock between President and Congress. There was in each case a fateful congressional election whose effect was felt far down in later years: tayae matched against the "critical year" 18@&ch case the President's plan failed in the sense that it failed to be adopted; the opposite plan in each case failed miserably by being adopted.

    Organizing a Comparison or Contrast

    When you compare or contrast any two subjects, which we can call A and B, you do so with regard to specific points, which we'll call 1, 2, 3. Now you may proceed in two ways, organizing around A and B or around 1, 2, 3. Thus in contrasting New York and Los Angeles you might devote the first half of the paragraph (or an entire paragraph) to New York and the second half (or a new paragraph) to Los Angeles. In each section you would cover the same particular points and in the same olidearte;saylfural facilities,

    and nightlife. Conversely, you might prefer to make climate, cultural facilities, and nightlife the primary centers of your organization, devoting a paragraph or portion of a paragraph to each and discussing how the two cities differ.

    Neither way of proceeding is necessarily better. Organizing around A and B stresses each subject in its totality. Organizing around 1, 2, and 3 emphasizes particular likenesses or differences. It all depends on what you want to do. In the following case the writer elected to organize around A and B: Eastern and Western civilizations and Americans and Western Europeans, in their sensitivity to lingering problems around them, tend to make science and progress their scapegoats. There is a belief that progress has precipitated widespread unhappiness, anxieties and other social and emotional problems. Science is viewed as a cold mechanical discipline having nothing to do with human warmth and the human spirit.

    But to many of us from the nonscientific East, science does not have such repugnant associations. We are not afraid of it, nor are we disappointed by it. We know all too painfully that our social and emotional problems festered long before the age of technology. To us, science is warm and reassuring. It promises hope. It is helping us at long last some control over our persecutory environments, alleviating age-old problems but also, and especially, problems of the spirit. F. M. Esfandary

    In the next example, on the other hand, a historian contrasting Catholics and Protestants in the sixteenth century organizes not around the broad categories of Roman and Reformer, but rather around the differences that set them at war:

Using examples from both the Esfandary passage and the historian''s comparison of Catholics and Protestants, explain how these two organizational strategies reflect different purposes in writing.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of each organizational approach based on their respective texts.\n- **Step 2**: Justify your analysis by referring to specific examples from the text (e.g., the East-West contrast in Esfandary''s passage).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the two strategies and demonstrate an understanding of how they serve different rhetorical functions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Historical and Literary Analysis**\n\nThe Esfandary text discusses the differing perceptions of science in Eastern and Western cultures, while the historian''s example contrasts Catholics and Protestants in the sixteenth century. Using these two texts as your foundation, construct a logical argument about how cultural perspectives influence the way people interpret historical events or contemporary issues.\n- **Step 1**: Define the relationship between cultural perspective and interpretation using examples from both texts.\n- **Step 2**: Apply this relationship to a real-world issue (e.g., climate change, technological advancement) to demonstrate its relevance today.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate elements from both texts and show how they support the broader thesis about cultural influence on interpretation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Organizational Strategies in Writing**\n\nThe text provides two contrasting organizational strategies: organizing around A and B, which focuses on totalities, versus organizing around 1, 2, and 3, which emphasizes differences. Using the examples provided (Esfandary''s East-West contrast and the historian''s Catholic-Protestant comparison), evaluate which strategy is more effective for communicating complex ideas.\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach based on the texts.\n- **Step 2**: Justify your evaluation by referencing specific details from both examples (e.g., how the East-West contrast highlights shared values).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a nuanced understanding of both strategies and their implications for clarity, persuasion, and audience engagement.'

    The Catholic believed in the authority of the Church; the Reformer, in the authority of reason. Where the Church had spoken, the Catholic obeyed. His duty was to accept without question the laws which councils had decreed, which popes and bishops administered, and so far as in him lay to enforce in others the same submission to an outward rule which he regarded as divine. All shades of Protestants on the other hand agreed that authority might err; that Christ had left no visible representative, whom individually they were bound to obey; that religion was the operation of the Spirit on the mind and conscience; that the Bible was God's word, which each Christian was to read, and which with God's help and his natural intelligence he could not fail to understand. The Catholic left his Bible to the learned. The Protestant translated the Bible, and brought it to the door of every Christian family. The Catholic prayed in Latin, and whether he understood his words or repeated them as a form the effect was the same; for it was magical. The Protestant prayed with his mind as an act of faith in a language intelligible to him, or he could not pray at all. The Catholic bowed in awe before his wonder-working image, adored his relics, and gave his life into the guidance of his spiritual director. The Protestant tore open the machinery of the miracles, flung the bones and ragged garments into the fire, and treated priests as men like himself. The Catholic was intolerant upon principle; persecution was the corollary of his creed. The intolerance of the Protestant was in spite of his creed. In denying the right of the Church to define his own belief, he had forfeited the privilege of punishing the errors of those who chose to differ from him. James Anthony Froude

    Building the Comparison or Contrast

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Religious Beliefs and Their Implications**\n\nCompare and contrast the beliefs of the Catholic Church and the Reformers as presented in the text, focusing on three key differences: authority, interpretation of scripture, and religious practice.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the specific belief each group holds regarding the source of authority (Church vs. reason).\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how they differ in their approach to interpreting the Bible (Catholic reliance on clergy vs. Protestant individual understanding).\n- **Step 3**: Contrast their religious practices, such as language used in prayer and attitudes toward images or relics.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the two groups'' core beliefs and demonstrate an understanding of how these differences shape their worldview.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Religious Tolerance**\n\nExplain why the Catholic Church was described as "intolerant upon principle" while the Protestant Reformer was "intolerant in spite of his creed." Use specific examples from the text to support your analysis.\n- **Step 1**: Define what it means to be intolerant in each context according to the passage.\n- **Step 2**: Draw a logical conclusion about how their differing beliefs influenced their tolerance levels.\n- **Step 3**: Relate this to the broader implications of religious authority on societal behavior.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s description of both groups and demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of their intolerance.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Religious Practices**\n\nEvaluate the claim that "the Protestant Reformer tore open the machinery of the miracles" as described in the text. Consider the following aspects:\n- **Part A**: Explain what is meant by "tore open the machinery of the miracles." Use specific examples from the text (e.g., treatment of relics, rejection of images).\n- **Part B**: Compare this to the Catholic practice of adoring relics and images, and analyze why these practices were considered magical or superstitious.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how these differences in religious practice reflect broader philosophical differences between the two groups.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s descriptions of both practices and demonstrate an understanding of their symbolic and theological significance.'

    Closely related to the question of organization is a final problem: in what compositional units will the comparison be built out of paragraphs, portions of paragraphs, sentences, halves of sentences? Probably the simplest plan is to spend a paragraph, or several sentences within a paragraph, on one of the two subjects and a unit of roughly equal length on the other. This is what F. M. Esfandiary does in discussing the differences between Eastern and Western attitudes toward science.

    But you may also construct a comparison or contrast in pairs of sentences:

    The original Protestants had brought new passion into the ideal of the state as a religious society and they had set about to discipline this society more strictly than ever upon the pattern of the Bible. The later Protestants reversed a fundamental purpose and became the allies of individualism and the secular state.

    Herbert Butterfield

    Or both parts of the comparison may be held within a single sentence, the total effect being built up from a series of such sentences:

    At first glance the traditions of journalism and scholarship seem completely unlike: journalism so bustling, feverish, content with daily oblivion; the academic world so sheltered, deliberate, and hopeful of enduring products. It is true that both are concerned with ascertination and diffusion of truth. In journalism, however, the emphasis falls on a rapid diffusion of fact and idea; in academic work it falls on a prolonged, laborious ascertination.
    Aillevins

    How you build a comparison or contrast is related, of course, to how you organize it. Using two paragraphs (or two portions of a single paragraph) is better when you are organizing around A and B; than that each subject in its

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Comparative Structure in Academic Writing**\n\nBased on the excerpt from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing* by Thomas S. Kane, describe how a comparison or contrast can be structured using three different compositional units: paragraphs, pairs of sentences, and single sentences. Provide an example for each unit that demonstrates how these structures effectively highlight differences or similarities between two subjects.\n- **Paragraph Structure**: Use two full paragraphs, one focusing on each subject, with a concluding sentence that draws a comparison.\n- **Sentence Pairs**: Create two sentences that contrast two aspects of the same topic (e.g., journalism and scholarship).\n- **Single Sentence**: Construct a single complex sentence that juxtaposes two contrasting ideas while maintaining clarity and logical flow.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your examples must directly reference the text''s discussion on organizational strategies and demonstrate an understanding of how structure influences the effectiveness of comparison/contrast writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Comparative Strategies in Analysis**\n\nUsing the principles from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing*, analyze the excerpt provided by Aillevins that compares journalism and scholarship.\n- **Part A**: Identify the specific structural approach used in the passage (e.g., balanced sentences, paragraph-based comparison).\n- **Part B**: Explain how this structure enhances the clarity of the comparison between journalism and scholarship.\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative organizational strategy that could be used to compare two similar topics, justifying why it would be more or less effective based on the text''s guidance.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must directly reference the text''s discussion on comparison strategies and demonstrate a clear understanding of how structure affects interpretation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Comparative Writing**\n\nDesign a comparison/contrast essay that analyzes two contrasting topics (e.g., technology and tradition, urban life and rural life) using the structural approaches outlined in *The New Oxford Guide to Writing*.\n- **Part A**: Outline the organizational plan for your essay, specifying which compositional units (paragraphs, sentence pairs, single sentences) will be used to highlight key similarities and differences.\n- **Part B**: Write a sample paragraph using one of the structural approaches described in the text, ensuring that it clearly demonstrates how the structure supports the comparison/contrast purpose.\n- **Part C**: Justify why this organizational strategy is appropriate for the topic you have chosen, referencing specific examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must integrate the principles of comparison/contrast writing as discussed in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of how structure influences the effectiveness of the analysis.'

    Think carefully about what you want to accomplish and how
    you can best focus, organize, and work up the material. The
    problem is further complicated by the fact that none of the
    choices we have discussed is absolute. A paragraph is not re-
    stricted to comparing or contrasting: it can do both. It does
    not have to maintain only one focus: a skillful writer can shift.
    And extended comparisons and contrasts can, and do, vary
    their methods of building.

    For Practice

    > Study the following paragraph and consider these questions: (a)
    Is the writer comparing, contrasting, or doing both? (b) Which of
    the two subjects receives the focus? (c) How is the comparison or
    contrast organized and how is it built?

    Let's compare the U.S. to India, for example. We have 203 million
    people, whereas she has 540 million on much less land. But look
    at the impact of people on the land.

    The average Indian eats his daily few cups of rice (or perhaps
    wheat, whose production on American farms contributed to our
    one percent per year drain in quality of our active farmland), draws
    his bucket of water from the communal well and sleeps in a mud
    hut. In his daily rounds to gather cow dung to burn to cook his rice
    and warm his feet, his footsteps, along with those of millions of his
    countrymen, help bring about a slow deterioration of the ability of
    the land to support people. His contribution to the destruction of
    the land is minimal.

    An American, on the other hand, can be expected to destroy a
    piece of land on which he builds a home, garage and driveway.
    He will contribute his share to the 142 million tons of smoke and
    fumes, seven million junked cars, 20 million tons of paper, 48 bil-
    lion cans, and 26 billion bottles the overburdened environment
    must absorb each year. To run his air conditioner he will stripmine
    a Kentucky hillside, push the dirt and slate down into the stream,
    and burn coal in a power generator, whose smokestack contributes
    to a plume of smoke massive enough to cause cloud seeding and
    premature precipitation from Gulf winds which should be irrigating
    the wheat farms of Minnesota. Wayne H. Davis

    Analogy is a special kind of comparison in which a second
    subject is introduced to explain or justify something about
    the main topic. Here the American writer Flannery

    O'Connor addresses a class in creative writing:

    I understand that this is a course called "How the Writer Writes,"
    and that each week you are exposed to a different writer who holds
    forth on the subject. The only parallel I can think of to this is having
    the zoo come to you, one animal at a time; and suspect that what
    you hear one week from the giraffe is contradicted next week by
    the baboon.

    Analogies differ from straightforward comparisons in several ways. First, they are always focused on one topic, the analogical subject being secondary, serving to clarify or emphasize or persuade. Second, the analogical subject usually is of a different nature from the main subject, so different that most of us would not think the two at all similar. Comparison typically involves things of similar nature—such as Ford and Chevrolet, for example, or New Orleans and San Francisco, high school and college. Analogies, on the other hand, often find unexpected similarities in unlike things, such as a course in writing and a visit to the zoo.

    Analogy as Clarification

    In exposition the most common function of an analogy is to translate an abstract or difficult idea into more concrete or familiar terms. That is certainly one of the aims of O'Connor's analogy, as it is of this longer example, in which an astronomer explains the philosophy of science:

    Let us suppose that an ichthyologist is exploring the life of the ocean. He casts a net into the water and brings up a fishy assortment. Surveying his catch, he proceeds in the usual manner of a scientist to systematize what it reveals. He arrives at two generalizations:

    1. No sea-creature is less than two inches long.
    2. All sea-creatures have gills.

    These are both true of his catch, and he assumes tentatively that they will remain true however often he repeats it.

    In applying this analogy, the catch stands for the body of knowledge which constitutes physical science, and the net for the sensory and intellectual equipment which we use in obtaining it. The casting of the net corresponds to observation; for knowledge which has not been or could not be obtained by observation is not admitted into physical science.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Analogy in Exposition**\n\nUsing O''Connor''s analogy from the text, explain how the ichthyologist''s process mirrors the methodology of physical science.\n- **Step 1**: Map each element of the analogy (net, catch, observations) to its corresponding concept in scientific inquiry.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the analogy clarifies the abstract idea of ''the philosophy of science'' as described in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate whether this analogy would be effective for explaining a different abstract concept (e.g., ''the nature of mathematics''). Justify your evaluation based on the text''s discussion of analogy''s role in clarification.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a thorough understanding of how analogies function as explanatory tools, with specific reference to the ichthyologist example.'

    An onlooker may object that the first generalization is wrong.
    "There are plenty of sea-creatures under two inches long, only your
    net is not adapted to catch them." The ichthyologist dismisses this
    objection contemptuously. "Anything uncatchable by my net is ipso
    facto outside the scope of ichthyological knowledge, and is not part
    of the kingdom of fishes which has been defined as the theme of
    ichthyological knowledge. In short, what my net can't catch isn't
    fish." (First of all, you are really guessing, you are claiming a knowledge of the physical universe discov-
    ered in some other way than by the methods of physical science,
    and admittedly unverifiable by such methods. You are a meta-
    physician. Bah!" Sir Arthur Eddington

    Analogy as Persuasion

    As well as clarifying the unfamiliar, analogies often have con-
    siderable persuasive force. Before we look at an example,
    though, we need to distinguish between logical and rhetorical
    analogies. In logic, analogies are a special form of proof; we
    are not concerned with them here.

    Our interest is exclusively in rhetorical analogies, and rhetorical
    analogies never constitute logical proof. At best they
    are what has been called "a weak form of reasoning." They
    merely suggest that because A resembles B in certain respects,
    it also resembles it in others. But since the resemblance be-
    tween A and B is never total and exact, what is true of one
    cannot necessarily be applied to the other.

    For example, some political thinkers have used the "simi-
    larity" of a state to a ship to justify an authoritarian society.
    They argue that a ship can survive storms only when author-
    ity is completely in the hands of the captain, who rightfully
    demands unquestioning obedience. So, they conclude, a state
    can survive only if its citizens submit unhesitatingly to an
    absolute ruler. But, of course, ships and states are not iden-
    tical. What may be needed for safety at sea cannot be assumed
    to apply to good government on land. Such analogies which
    claim to "prove" unwarranted conclusions are called "false"
    or "unfair."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Evaluation of Analogy as Persuasion**\n\nAnalyze the analogy used in the passage where a state is compared to a ship.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key similarities between a state and a ship that are presented as reasons for the analogy.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why this analogy is considered "false" or "unfair" according to the text, using specific examples from the passage.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the implications of using an unfair analogy in persuasive arguments.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the difference between logical and rhetorical analogies and apply it to this example.'

    But even though they are not a form of logical proof, rhetorical analogies can be very persuasive. Consider this one used by Abraham Lincoln in a speech opposing the spread of slavery to territories outside the South:

    If I saw a venomous snake crawling in the road, any man would say might seize the nearest stick and kill it; but if found that snake in bed with my children, that would be another question. I might hurt the children more than the snake, and it might bite them. Much more, if found it in bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn compact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would become me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman alone. But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them, fake it no man would say there was any question how I ought to decide. That is just the case. The new territories are the newly made bed to which our children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not. It does not seem as if there could be much hesitation what our policy should be.

    Lincoln's argument simply assumes that slavery—the "grake' ants does not prove it. But most of his

    audience would not have needed proof. The essential point is that slavery should not be allowed to spread beyond the
    South, and the analogy is a striking, forceful explanation of why not.

    Reading a difficult book and climbing a mountain

    A library and a cemetery

    A person's (or a nation's) conception of reality and the wearing of
    glasses

    Try to develop an analogy in a single paragraph. The usual proce-
    dure is to begin with the main topic (placed first in these examples),
    or you may prefer to start off with the analogy, moving from there
    into your main topic.

    CHAPTER

    Paragraph Development:
    (3) Cause and Effect

    Cause

    One cannot write for very long without having to explain
    why something happened or why it is true or false. There are
    numerous strategies for developing causes or reasons.' The
    simplest is to ask the question "Why?" and then to supply
    the answer:

    If, then, the language of the original colonists was merely the En-
    glish of England, why does ours differ somewhat from theirs today?
    Three reasons can be offered.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Literary and Analytical Reasoning**\n\nUsing the analogy in Annie Dillard''s passage, craft a single paragraph that compares reading a difficult book to climbing a mountain. Your analogy must incorporate at least two elements from the text (e.g., the ''lightning marks'' and the ''straying trail of blood'') and demonstrate how both activities require perseverance and introspection.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must be a single, cohesive paragraph that explicitly references the elements mentioned in the text and illustrates their relevance to the analogy.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Cause and Effect Analysis**\n\nExplain the cause-and-effect relationship between the original colonists'' language and the differences in modern English as described in the text. Use the example of ''why?'' questions to structure your explanation, and incorporate at least two other examples from the text (e.g., the library and cemetery analogy or the glasses and reality conception).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly outline the cause (original colonists'' language) and effect (modern English differences), while integrating at least two additional examples from the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Analogical Reasoning**\n\nDevelop an original analogy that compares a person''s conception of reality to something else, using at least two elements from the text. Your analogy must be presented in a single paragraph and should highlight how both the subject and the analogy require adaptation or change over time.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must be a single, cohesive paragraph that explicitly references two elements from the text and demonstrates their relevance to the analogy.'

    First, the people of Great Britain in the seventeenth century spoke different local dialects. What we now consider to be standard English for England developed from the language of London and the near-by counties. But the settlers of America came not only from that region but also from many others. New England was settled largely from the eastern counties. Pennsylvania received a heavy immigration from the north of Ireland. English as it came to be spoken in New England and much of Pennsylvania thus naturally was not the same English that developed as the standard in England. For instance in what we consider typical British English of today,

    the final r has been lost. It is, however, partially preserved in General American, possibly because the Scotch-Irish of the eighteenth century preserved that sound, as they still do in Ireland.

    A second cause for the difference between the two countries lies in mere isolation. Language is always changing. When two groups of people speaking the same language are separated and remain in comparative isolation, change continues in the language of both groups, but naturally it does not continue in the same direction and at the same rate with both of them. The languages thus tend to become different.

    Third, the language in the United States has been subjected to various influences that have not affected the language in Great Brit-ain, the languages of other early colonists and of later immigrants. George Stewat

    Development by reasons may be more subtle. Instead of using a question-answer strategy and explicitly announcing reasons, a writer may leave the causal relationships implicit. The connection exists in the substructure of ideas but is not spelled out. In the following paragraph, for instance, only the "for" in the opening sentence makes the idea of causality explicit:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Expository Paragraph Structure**\n\nUsing the expository paragraph structure outlined in the text, write a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) explaining how the development of American English differs from British English. Your explanation must include at least two distinct reasons provided in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how these reasons contribute to the differences.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must explicitly reference the causes mentioned in the text (e.g., ''the settlers of America came not only from that region but also from many others'' or ''language is always changing'').'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Causal Relationships in Implicit Writing**\n\nExamine the following passage: ''The new policy will lead to increased efficiency, which will result in lower costs and improved customer satisfaction.''\n- **Part A**: Identify two explicit causal relationships in the paragraph.\n- **Part B**: Create a similar sentence that demonstrates implicit causality without using the word ''because'' or ''therefore''. Your sentence must include at least one cause and its effect, with the connection implied by context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both explicit and implicit causal relationships as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Language Change**\n\nBased on the text''s explanation of language change, construct a logical argument for why languages tend to diverge when groups are isolated from each other. Your argument must include at least two supporting points from the text and explain how these points lead to the conclusion that isolation contributes to linguistic divergence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured with an introduction, body paragraphs with clear supporting points, and a conclusion, all based on the information provided in the text.'

    The cult of beauty in women, which we smile at as though it were one of the culture's harmless follies, is, in fact, an insanity, for it is posited on a false view of reality. Women are not more beautiful than men. The obligation to be beautiful is an artificial burden, imposed by men on women, that keeps both sexes clinging to childhood, the woman forced to remain a charming, dependent child, the man driven by his unconscious desire to be—like — infant—loved and taken care of simply for his beautiful self. Woman's mask of beauty is the face of a child, a oévelatiorgic sexual immaturity of both sexes in our culture. Una Stannard

    Ordering Reasons within the Paragraph

    Sometimes you will work with only a single reason, repeating or expanding it in various ways: this is what Una Stannard does in the preceding paragraph. Other topics involve several reasons, as in the passage by Professor Stewart. In that case you must arrange them in a significant order. If the causes are ssrial-A-tisataused by B, B by C, and C by D—the organization is predetermined: A—B—-C—D.

    But several reasons all contributing to the same consequence may be parallel, that is, having no causal connection within themselves and related only in all contributing to the same result. (Again, the passage by Professor Stewart is an example.) With parallel reasons you have more choice of arrangement. If they have an order in time, you will probably follow that. If they do not, you will probably have to rank the reasons in order of importance, usually, though not invariably, leading up to the most important:

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Reasoning in Paragraph Structure**\n\nUna Stannard''s paragraph presents a single reason (the cult of beauty in women) and expands on it through various supporting points. Professor Stewart''s passage, however, contains multiple reasons that are parallel in nature, all contributing to the same consequence (the need for logical organization in writing).\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify two distinct paragraph structures from the text and explain how they differ in terms of reasoning and organization.\n- **Part B**: Using examples from the texts provided, demonstrate how each structure is applied. For Una Stannard''s paragraph, show how a single reason is expanded through repetition; for Professor Stewart''s passage, arrange parallel reasons in order of importance.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the text emphasizes that ''parallel reasons may be arranged in different ways'' and how this flexibility impacts the writer''s ability to persuade or inform an audience.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both texts and demonstrate a clear understanding of paragraph structure, reasoning, and organizational principles as outlined in the reading.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Causal vs. Parallel Reasoning**\n\nIn the text, it is stated that causal reasons follow a predetermined order (A causes B, which causes C, etc.), while parallel reasons contribute to the same consequence without direct cause-effect relationships.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Provide an example from the texts provided that illustrates causal reasoning and another that demonstrates parallel reasoning. Justify your choices based on the text''s description of these two structures.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the distinction between causal and parallel reasoning affects the way writers organize their arguments. Use specific examples from the texts to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical paragraph that combines both types of reasoning, showing how the writer would structure it according to the principles outlined in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly differentiate between causal and parallel reasoning and demonstrate an ability to apply these concepts in original writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Paragraph Organization**\n\nThe text emphasizes that when multiple reasons are present, they can be arranged either in a causal sequence (A-B-C-D) or in order of importance (most important first).\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Analyze Una Stannard''s paragraph to determine whether it follows a causal or parallel reasoning structure. Support your conclusion with specific details from the text.\n- **Part B**: Using Professor Stewart''s passage, explain how the author organizes parallel reasons in order of importance. Identify at least two reasons and describe their placement within the paragraph.\n- **Part C**: Argue why the flexibility in organizing parallel reasons (in time or importance) is a valuable skill for writers. Use examples from both texts to illustrate your point.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a thorough understanding of how different reasoning structures influence paragraph organization and the implications of these choices for effective writing.'

    I doubt if the English temperament is wholly favourable to the development of the essayist. In the first place, an Anglo-Saxon likes doing things better than thinking about them; and in his memories, he is apt to recall how a thing was done rather than why it was done. In the next place, we are naturally rather prudent and secretive; we say that a man must not wear his heart upon his sleeve, and that is just what the essayist must do. We have a horror of giving ourselves away, and we like to keep ourselves to ourselves.
    "The Englishman's home is his castle," says another proverb. But the essayist must not have a castle, or if he does, both the grounds and the living-rooms must be open to the inspection of the public. A. C. Benson

    Reversing the order of Benson's two reasons would not impair the logic of his paragraph. However, it would disrupt the climactic structure. While Benson nowhere says that he considers the second reason more important, he gives it more than twice the space and repeats it three times.

    paragraph may treat only a single effect, as in this passage
    about the moon affecting the tides:

    the kingdom. From London and from Liverpool we should hear the
    same staryandhéall of the tide had almost ceased. The

    ships in dock could not get out; the ships outside could not get in;
    and the maritime commerce of the world would be thrown into
    dire confusion. Robert Ball

    Multiple Effects

    Often, however, a topic entails several effects, not just one,
    as in the following case (the writer is concerned with what
    the automobile has done to our society):

    Thirdly, worry about the private automobile. It is a dirty, noisy,
    wasteful, and lonely means of travel. It pollutes the air, ruins the
    safety and sociability of the street, and exercises upon the individual
    a discipline which takes away far more freedom than it gives him.
    It causes an enormous amount of land to be unnecessarily ab-
    stracted from nature and from plant life and to become devoid of
    any natural function. It explodes cities, grievously impairs the
    whole institution of neighborliness, fragmentizes and destroys com-
    munities. It has already spelled the end of our cities as real cultural
    and social communities, and has made impossible the construction
    of any others in their place. Together with the airplane, it has
    crowded out other, more civilized and more convenient means of
    transport, leaving older people, infirm people, poor people and
    children in a worse situation than they were a hundred years ago.
    It continues to lend a terrible element of fragility to our civilization,
    placing us in a situation where our life would break down com-
    pletely if anything ever interfered with the oil supply.

    George F. Kennan

    Kennan does not label the logic of his paragraph, not even
    by brief connectives like therefore or and so. But the sentence
    structure keeps the logic clear. Sentence after sentence begins
    with subject-verb, which suggests the cause-effect relation-
    ship: "It [the private automobile] is... It pollutes ... It
    causes ... It explodes ... It has The repetition of this
    pattern supports and clarifies the bogimplarof how

    sentence structure contributes to paragraph unity.

    Cause and Effect

    Thus far we have seen paragraphs that develop reasons to
    support the topic and those that develop effects. Often, how-
    ever, cause and effect are more intimately related. Many
    things are simultaneously causes and effects, as when the re-
    sult you expect an action to have is the reason you do it. In
    Kennan above the dire consequences of the au-
    tomobile are why he worries about it. The journalist Pete
    Idapmellses much the same point in the para- following
    graph, explaining that what the car has done to our society
    makes it "one of our jailers":

    In fact, the automobile, which was hailed as a liberator of human beings early in this century, has become one of our jailers. The city air, harbor-cool and fresh at dawn, # sewer by Thé@t0-hour week, for which so many good union people died, is now a joke; on an average day, a large number of people now spend three to four hours simply traveling to those eight-hour-a-day jobs, stalled on roads, idling at bridges or in tunnels. Parking fees are $5 to $10 a day. The ruined city streets cost hundreds more for gashed tires, missing hubcaps and rattled engines.

    Frequently cause and effect compose a chain. A gives rise to B, B to C, and so on. Thus B would be both the effect of A and the cause of C. This paragraph about the effect of television in the 1950s on boxing (what the writer calls "the Sweet Science") develops such a series of causes and effects:

    The immediate crisis [of boxing] in the United States, forestalling the one high living standards might bring on, has been caused by

    the popularization of a ridiculous gadget called television. This is utilized in the sale of beer and razor blades. The clients of the television companies, by putting on a free boxing show almost every night of the week, have knocked out of business the hundreds of small-city and neighborhood boxing clubs where youngsters had a chance to learn their trade and journeymen to mature their skill. Consequently the number of good new prospects diminishes with every year, and the peddlers' public is already being asked to believe that a boy with perhaps ten or fifteen fights behind him is a topnotch performer. Neither advertising agencies nor brewers, and least of all the networks, give a hoot if they push the Sweet Science back into a period of genre painting.

    In its most basic sense, to define means "to set limits or boundaries." But in practice defining is rarely simple. Consider, for example, trying to set the limits of so vast an abstraction as "democracy." The problem of defining is further complicated by the fact that there are different kinds of definitions, serving different purposes, and using different means.

    Nominal and Real Definitions

    There is an elementary distinction in philosophy between the definition of a word and that of the entity (object, concept, emotion, whatever) which the word signifies. Definitions of words are called nominal (a dictionary definition is an ex-
    ample). Those of entities are called real. (This does not imply
    that nominal definitions are somehow false.) In practice the
    distinction between nominal and real definitions often does
    not matter very much. But sometimes it does. You should
    always be clear in your own mind whether you are primarily
    concerned with the word or the entity, and you must make
    it equally clear to the reader. If you are defining a word, un-
    derline it (equivalent to italic type). In the following para-
    graph, for instance, the writer wishes to make clear how the
    word history is commonly used:
    (4) DEFINITION, ANALYSIS, AND QUALIFICATION 133

    By its most common definition, the word history now means "the
    past of mankind." Compare the German word for history—Ges-
    chichte, which is derived from gesahielgenp happen.

    Geschichte is that which has happened. This meaning of the word
    history is often encountered in such overworked phrases as "all
    history teaches" or the "lessons of history." Louis Gottschalk

    Professor Gottschalk's is a nominal definition. The essayist
    G. K. Chesterton, on the other hand, in defining marriage is
    concerned with the institution and not the wohd—that
    is making a real definition:

    Marriage is not a mere chain upon love as the anarchists say; nor is it a mere crown upon love as the sentimentalists say. Marriage is a fact, an actual human relation like that of motherhood, which has certain human habits and loyalties, except in a few monstrous cases where it is turned to a torture by special insanity and sin. A marriage is neither an ecstasy nor a slavery; it is a commonwealth; it is a separate working and fighting thing like a nation.

    Consensual, Stipulative,
    and Legislative Definitions

    Rather than kinds of definitions, the distinction here is more
    a matter of purpose. The purpose of a consensual definition
    is simply to tell us how people commonly use a word or what
    they understand a thing to be. It is what you find when you
    open your dictionary. A stipulative definition is a special
    meaning given to a word or entity for a particular purpose.
    It differs from the usual (consensual) definition, but is per-
    fectly legitimate so long as the writer clearly explains what he
    or she means and uses the term consistently in its special
    sense. A legislative definition also differs from the conven-
    tional sense; it is put forward as what the word ought to mean.
    It differs from a stipulative definition in that the writer is not
    saying, "For convenience I shall use X to mean such and so."
    Instead, the writer is asserting, "I shall use X to mean such
    and so, and this is its proper sense and everyone else should
    use it in this way too."

    Techniques of Defining

    Definitions are ped in various ways. For convenience

    we consider these techniques one at a time. However, they
    do not exclude one another, and in practice they are often
    combined.

    Definition by Species

    This is one of the most common means of definition. The
    entity or word being defined (called the definiendum)

    is set into its genus (class) and then distinguished from other
    members of that class:

    History is the recital of facts given as true, in contradistinction to
    the fable, which is the recital of facts given as false. Voltaire

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Definition Types**\n\nClassify the statement "Marriage is a fact, an actual human relation..." as either a consensual, stipulative, or legislative definition based on its purpose and intent. Justify your classification by referencing the key distinctions outlined in the text (e.g., ''a consensual definition tells us how people commonly use a word'').\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly identify the type of definition and provide at least two textual references to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Definition Techniques**\n\nUsing the technique of ''definition by species,'' define the term ''history'' as presented in the text. Then, create a new definition for ''government'' using this method.\n- **Step 1**: Apply the definition by species approach to ''history'' as shown in the example (History is the recital of facts given as true...).\n- **Step 2**: Use the same technique to define ''government'' by setting it into its genus and distinguishing it from other forms of political organization.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this method clarifies the meaning of both terms based on the text''s explanation of definition techniques.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include two distinct definitions and demonstrate an understanding of how ''definition by species'' works as described in the reading.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Definitions**\n\nThe text distinguishes between stipulative and legislative definitions. Consider the following claim: "A marriage is a legal contract."\n- **Part A**: Determine whether this is a stipulative or legislative definition based on the text''s explanation of these terms.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument for why defining marriage as a ''commonwealth'' (as stated in the passage) might be more appropriate than a legal contract definition, using the text''s discussion of definitions and their purposes.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on clarity and consistency in definitions relates to real-world debates over marriage definitions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate concepts from both the passage and the text''s explanation of definition types, showing a deep understanding of their applications.'

    Voltaire begins by setting "history" (the thing, not the word) into the genus "recital of facts." Then he differentiates it from the other member of that class, "fable."

    The bulk of a genus-species definition usually goes to differentiation. This may be done explicitly, as in Voltaire's case; that is, you actually mention the other member(s) of the class and explain how the definiendum differs from them. Or it may be done implicitly, where you do not actually name the other member(s) of the class but simply describe the definiendum so completely that it is, by implication, differentiated from them. Obviously a class of any size makes complete explicit differentiation impractical. If you were defining, say, football, it would take many, many pages to distinguish it from every other team sport.

    However you differentiate the thing you are defining, you must be clear about which of its attributes are essential and which are not. For example, the fact that football is played in stadiums (usually outdoors) before large crowds is not essential to its definition: baseball and soccer are also team sports played under similar conditions. On the other hand, the rules of football, the dimensions and the markings of the field, these facts are unique. Such essential attributes are what distinguish a definition. It does not mean that you should ignore incidental attributes altogether. If you were explaining football to a foreign friend, it would be important that he or she understand something about where and when it is played.

    The following explanation of what a map is illustrates a genus-species definition:

    A map is a conventional picture of an area of land, sea, or sky. Perhaps the maps most widely used are the road maps given away by the oil companies. They show the cultural features such as states, towns, parks, and roads, especially paved roads. They show also natural features, such as rivers and lakes, and sometimes mountains. As simple maps, most automobile drivers have on various occasions used sketches drawn by service station men, or by friends, to show the best automobile route from one town to another.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Genus-Species Definitions**\n\nUsing the text''s explanation of genus-species definitions, analyze the following definition: ''A map is a conventional picture of an area of land, sea, or sky.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the genus (the broader category) and the species (the specific type) in this definition.\n- **Step 2**: Determine whether the differentiation is explicit or implicit, based on the text''s explanation. Justify your answer with examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Suggest one additional attribute that should be included in the definition to make it more complete, using reasoning from the text about essential vs. incidental attributes.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of genus-species definitions and demonstrate understanding of both explicit/implicit differentiation and essential/incidental attributes.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Essential Attributes in Definitions**\n\nConsider the definition of football provided in the text: ''Football is a team sport played with an oval ball, on a field marked with specific lines and dimensions, and with a set of rules.''\n- **Part A**: Identify two essential attributes from this definition and explain why they are essential using the text''s criteria for essential vs. incidental attributes.\n- **Part B**: Modify the definition to include an incidental attribute that is still informative, based on the text''s discussion of how to explain where and when a sport is played.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast this approach to defining football with the map definition provided in the text. Highlight similarities and differences in how essential vs. incidental attributes are treated.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of the text''s concepts about essential and incidental attributes in genus-species definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Definition Structures**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of explicit vs. implicit differentiation, analyze the following two definitions:\n1. ''A dog is a mammal that barks.''\n2. ''A dog is a domesticated animal that is commonly kept as a pet.''\n- **Part A**: Determine whether each definition uses explicit or implicit differentiation, explaining your reasoning based on the text''s examples.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate which of the two definitions is more effective in terms of clarity and completeness, using the text''s criteria for good genus-species definitions.\n- **Part C**: Construct a third definition that uses explicit differentiation, following the structure of Voltaire''s example in the text. Your definition must include at least one other member of the class and explain how the definiendum differs from it.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of explicit vs. implicit differentiation and demonstrate an understanding of effective genus-species definitions.'

    The distinction usually made between "maps" and "charts" is that a chart is a representation of an area consisting chiefly of water; a map represents an area that is predominantly land. It is easy to see how this distinction arose in the days when there was no navigation over land, but a truer distinction is that charts are specially designed for use in navigation, whether at sea or the air.

    Maps have been used since the earliest civilizations, and explorers find that they are used in rather simple civilizations at the present time by people who are accustomed to traveling. For example, Arctic explorers have obtained considerable help from maps of the coast lines showing settlements, drawn by Eskimo people. Occasionally maps show not only the roads, but pictures of other features. One of the earliest such maps dates from about B&C0 It shows not only roads, but also lakes with fish, and a canal with crocodiles and a bridge over the canal. This is somewhat similar to the modern maps of a state which show for each large town some feature of interest or the chief products of that town. C. C. Wylie

Next he distinguishes "map" from the other member of its class ("chart"). Finally, in the third paragraph, he gives us information about maps which, although not essential to the defntetiesting and enlightening.

    In working out a genus-species definition, then, the essential questions to ask yourself are these:

    A synonymous definition is simply explaining something in different words, usually simpler words. Synonyms are useful when you must use a term readers cannot reasonably be expected to know:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Genus-Species Definitions**\n\nUsing the expository paragraph on maps and charts from the text, construct a genus-species definition for ''map'' that includes all three essential elements: (1) the class to which it belongs, (2) the unique quality distinguishing it from a chart, and (3) an additional relevant characteristic that enhances clarity.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the genus (class) of ''map'' based on the text''s discussion.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the defining feature that differentiates ''map'' from ''chart'' as described in the passage.\n- **Step 3**: Add a third element that provides further context or clarification, such as an example or function.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your definition must be complete and accurate, using only information provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Synonym Usage in Expository Writing**\n\nIn the excerpt from ''Huge "pungs" ...'', the author uses the synonym ''pungs'' to explain a term that might be unfamiliar to readers. Using the definition of a synonymous definition provided in the text, explain why this approach is effective for expository writing.\n- **Step 1**: Identify what ''pungs'' refers to based on context.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how using a synonym (as opposed to a technical term) improves clarity for readers.\n- **Step 3**: Reference the text''s explanation of synonymous definitions and apply it to this example.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of both the definition and its application in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning About Definitions and Classification**\n\nThe text distinguishes between ''maps'' and ''charts'' based on their purpose and content. Construct a logical argument explaining why a chart is not considered a type of map, using the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: State the main distinction made between maps and charts according to the passage.\n- **Step 2**: Use this distinction to argue that a chart cannot be classified as a map.\n- **Step 3**: Incorporate an example from the text (e.g., the early map with lakes and crocodiles) to support your reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically structured, clearly referencing the text''s definitions and examples.'

    Other, not lying, not giving false testimony. In Japan self-respect (jécli@rally "a self that is weighty," and its opposite is "a self that is light and floating." When a man says "You must respect your self," it means, "You must be shrewd in estimating all the factors involved in the situation and do nothing that will arouse criticism or lessen your chances of success." "Respecting yourself" often implies exactly the opposite behavior from that which it means in the United States. An employee says, "I must respect myself (jicho)," and it means, not that he must stand on his rights, but that he must say nothing to his employers that will get him into trouble. "You must respect yourself" had this same meaning, too, in political usage. It meant that a "person of weight" could not respect himself if he indulged in anything so rash as "dangerous thoughts." It had no implication, as it would in the United States, that even if thoughts are dangerous a man's self-respect requires that he think according to his own lights and his own conscience.

    Defining by Metaphor and Simile

    Metaphors and similes, which draw a kind of comparison, sometimes help to clarify the meaning of a word or concept. In a famous passage, the seventeenth-century Anglican clergyman Jeremy Taylor defined prayer using a series of metaphors, which culminated in the image of a lark:

    Prayer is the peace of our spirit, the stillness of our thoughts, the
    evenness of recollection, the seat of meditation, the rest of our
    cares, and the ocean of tempest; prayer is the issue of a quiet
    mind, of untroubled thoughts, it is the daughter of charity and the
    sister of meekness; and he that prays to God with an angry, that is,
    with a troubled and discomposed spirit, is like him that retires into
    a battle to meditate, and sets up his closet in the outposts of an
    army, and chooses a frontier-garrison to be wise in. Anger is a per-
    fect alienation of the mind from prayer, and therefore is contrary to
    that attention which presents our prayers in a right line to God. For
    so have a lark rising from his bed of grass, and soaring up-
    wards, singing as he rises, and hopes to get to heaven, and climb
    above the clouds; but the poor bird was beaten back with the loud
    sighings of an eastern wind, and his motion made irregular and
    unconstant, descending more at every breath of the tempest than it
    could recover by the liberation and frequent weighing of his wings:
    till the little creature was forced to sit down and pant, and stay till
    the storm was over; and then it made a prosperous flight, and did
    rise and sing, as if it had learned music and motion from an angel
    as he passed sometimes through the air about his ministries here

    Thrift by derivation means thriving; and the miser is the man who does not thrive. The whole meaning of thrift is making the most of everything; and the miser does not make anything of anything. He is the man in whom the process, from the seed to the crop, stops at the intermediate mechanical stage of the money. He does not grow things to feed men; not even to feed one man; not even to feed himself. The miser is the man who starves himself, and everybody else, in order to worship wealth in its dead form, as distinct from its living form. G. K. Chesterton

    Paired or Field Definition

    Occasionally the sense of one word or concept is intimately tied to that of a second (or of several) so that the terms can be defined only by reference to one another. Such words comprise a field of meaning; for example, think of the titles designating commissioned rank in the United States Army: captain cannot be understood without reference to first lieutenant and ranger; these in turn imply second lieutenant and lieutenant colonel and so on through the entire series of grades. In this paragraph a scholar defines the two kinds of source material available to historians:

    Written and oral sources are divided into two kinds: primary and secondary. A primary source is the testimony of an eyewitness, or of a witness by any other of the senses, or of a mechanical device like the dictaphone—that which was present at the events of which he or it tells (hereafter called simply eyewitness). A secondary source is the testimony of anyone who is not an eyewitness, that is not present at the events of which he tells. A primary source must thus have been produced by a contemporary of the events it narrates. It does not, however, need to be original in the legal sense of the word original—that the very document (usually the first written draft) whose contents are the subject of discussion—whether a copy or a printed edition will do just as well; in the case of the Greek and Roman classics, seldom are any but later copies available.

    Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of people in this world. The
    first kind of people are People; they are the largest and probably
    the most valuable class. We owe to this class the chairs we sit down
    on, the clothes we wear, the houses we live and, indeed (when

    we come to think of it), we probably belong to this class ourselves.
    The second class may be called for convenience the Poets; they
    are often a nuisance to their families, but, generally speaking, a
    blessing to mankind. The third class is that of the Professors or
    Intellectuals, sometimes described as the thoughtful people; and
    these are a blight and a desolation both to their families and also
    to mankind. Of course, the classification sometimes overlaps, like
    all classification. Some good people are almost poets and some bad
    poets are almost professors. But the division follows lines of real
    psychological cleavage. We not offer it lightly. It has been the fruit
    of more than eighteen minutes of earnest reflection and research.

    Chesterton develops his point by asking, in effect, "What
    kinds of people are there?" The strategy of paragraph building is also called classification. (Chesterton uses the terms
    Classification and class several times.) Speaking strictly, anal-
    ysis and classification are not identical. The first begins with
    the general and works into particulars; the second starts with
    the particulars and sorts them into categories. But, practically
    speaking, the difference is not very significant. Both are con-
    cerned with a class and a number of specifics, and the problem
    is to make clear that a class encompasses particulars. Thus in
    Chesterton's humorous analysis the broad category "people"
    142 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH

    is composed of the particular groups "People," "Poets," and
    "Professors."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Classification Strategies**\n\nChesterton presents a classification system that divides people into three categories: People, Poets, and Professors. Using the text''s explanation of analysis versus classification, explain how this classification strategy differs from traditional categorization methods.\n- **Step 1**: Define the key distinction between analysis and classification as presented in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Compare Chesterton''s approach to a common classification (e.g., animals by species).\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this method of categorization is considered ''humorous'' based on the text''s description of the three classes.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definitions and demonstrate an understanding of how Chesterton''s approach reflects psychological cleavage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Classifications**\n\nThe text notes that classifications can overlap, such as ''some good people are almost poets'' and ''some bad poets are almost professors.'' Construct a logical argument that evaluates the validity of this overlapping classification system.\n- **Part A**: Define the criteria for valid classification according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Use examples from Chesterton''s classification to demonstrate how overlap can occur without invalidating the system.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the text supports or refutes the idea that overlapping classifications are inherently flawed.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of psychological cleavage and provide a clear, logical defense of Chesterton''s approach.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Classification Logic**\n\nDesign a new classification system for ''things'' that follows Chesterton''s method of psychological cleavage. Explain your reasoning and how it reflects the text''s emphasis on categorization as a means of understanding human nature.\n- **Step 1**: Identify a broad category (e.g., ''objects'') and define its particulars based on psychological traits.\n- **Step 2**: Create three distinct subcategories that reflect different types of human behavior or thought processes.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this system is both logical and reflective of the text''s perspective on classification.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an original application of Chesterton''s classification strategy and explicitly reference the text''s discussion of psychological cleavage.'

    Sorting out concrete topics, whether people or varieties of apples, is the easiest kind of analysis. But the technique also works with abgtmsietidns—ethe club, for instance, or the economic classes of a complex society. In the following example the writer explains how the watches were arranged on a nineteenth-century sailing vessel. (The term watch has a double meaning: the two divisions of the crew, who alternated in working the ship, and the periods of the twenty-four-hour day when the groups were on duty.)

    The crew are divided into two divisions, as equally as may be, called the watches. Of these, the chief mate commands the larboard, and the second mate the starboard. They divide the time between them, being on and off duty, or as it is called, on deck and below, every other four hours. The three night watches are called the first, the middle, and the morning watch. If, for instance, the chief mate with the larboard watch have the first night watch from eight to twelve, at that hour the starboard watch and the second mate take the deck, while the larboard watch and the first mate go below until four in the morning, when they come on deck again and remain until eight. As the larboard watch will have been on deck eight hours out of the twelve, while the starboard watch will have been up only four hours, the former have what is called a "forenoon watch below," that is, from eight A.M. till twelve A.M. In a man-of-war, and in some merchantmen, this alternation of watches is kept up throughout the twenty-four hours, which is called having "watch and watch"; but our ship, like most merchantmen, had "all hands" from twelve o'clock till dark, except in very bad weather, when we were allowed "watch and watch."

    Analysis of a Process

    A process is a sequence of operations directed toward a specific end. Knitting a sweater, for example, is a process, from buying the pattern and wool to the final blocking and shaping. So is the election of a political candidate or registering for college.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Process Analysis in Maritime Operations**\n\nUsing the passage about the ship''s watch system, describe how the process of dividing and rotating crew members on a sailing vessel aligns with the definition of a process as a sequence of operations directed toward a specific end.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key components of the watch rotation system from the text (e.g., divisions, shifts, roles).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these elements form a structured sequence leading to the ship''s operational goals (safety, efficiency, crew well-being).\n- **Step 3**: Compare this maritime process with another example of a process mentioned in the text (e.g., knitting a sweater or college registration).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both the maritime and general examples, demonstrating an understanding of processes as systematic sequences with defined outcomes.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning in Time Management**\n\nUsing the watch schedule described in the text, calculate the total number of hours each crew member (chief mate, second mate, first mate) spends on deck and below during a 24-hour period.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the duration of each shift based on the text''s description (e.g., four hours on deck, four hours below).\n- **Step 2**: Use the given schedule to compute individual time allocations for each crew member.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the described system ensures fairness in time distribution among crew members.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show clear mathematical reasoning and explicitly reference the text''s details about shifts and roles.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Process Analysis**\n\nDesign a process for managing a college registration system using principles from both texts (watch rotation and process analysis).\n- **Step 1**: Outline the key stages of the college registration process, similar to how the ship''s watch system is structured.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how time management and role distribution in the maritime example can be applied to student enrollment.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this process would be more efficient than a traditional one without such structure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both texts'' concepts of structured sequences and systematic operations, showing an ability to apply abstract principles to a real-world scenario.'

    In most cases the steps are clearly defined. The writer's task is first to understand the process, analyzing its stages in his or her own mind; and second to explain those stages clearly. Here is an example, more abstract than knitting a sweater, describing the methodology of science:

    [T]here is a fairly clear pattern of the operation of the scientific method. First, regularities are recognized as such and recorded. Then, a formulation is sought which, preferably in the simplest and most general way, contains these regularities. This then has the status of a law of nature. The newly formulated law may, and usually will, predict further regularities which were previously unknown. Finally, the objective is a combination of two or more of these laws into a still more general formulation. For instance, the great significance of Einstein's theory of special relativity is due to the fact that it provides a combination of the electromagnetic laws with those of mechanics.

    Qualification >

    It is often necessary to admit that what you are asserting is not absolutely true or always applicable. Doing so is called qualification. Qualification always risks blurring your focus. Suppose, for example, that a writer is urging a criticism of college football. He or she begins:

    College football is a semi-professional sport.

    This is clear and emphatic. But it isn't exactly true: the issue is not that simple.

    Now suppose that, recognizing this complexity, the writer adds a second sentence:

    College football is a semi-professional sport. Some universities do play a purely amateur game.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Scientific Methodology**\n\nUsing the example of Einstein''s theory of special relativity provided in the text, explain how the scientific method operates as described in the passage. Your answer should include:\n- A clear description of each stage of the scientific method as outlined in the text (recognition of regularities, formulation of a law, prediction of new regularities, and unification into a more general theory).\n- An application of this process to another example from real life or science.\n- An explanation of how the text''s emphasis on ''simplifying and generalizing'' relates to the concept of ''unification'' in scientific theories.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of the scientific method as described, with specific references to the text and logical connections between concepts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Qualification in Writing**\n\nExplain the role of qualification in writing using the example provided in the text. Your response should include:\n- A definition of qualification based on the text''s explanation.\n- An analysis of why the writer''s initial statement (''College football is a semi-professional sport'') is considered too absolute and needs qualification.\n- A comparison between the two sentences in the example (the absolute statement vs. the qualified one), highlighting how the second sentence improves clarity and focus.\n- A logical argument for why qualification is essential in persuasive writing, even if it risks blurring focus.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s example and demonstrate an understanding of the balance between clarity and accuracy in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Process Writing**\n\nWrite a set of clear, step-by-step instructions for a simple task (e.g., making a sandwich, assembling a bookshelf, or watering plants). Your instructions must include:\n- At least five distinct steps.\n- A logical sequence that follows the natural order of the task.\n- An explanation of why each step is necessary and how it contributes to the final outcome.\n- A reflection on the process of breaking down a complex task into simple, definable steps, referencing the text''s discussion about ''analyzing its stages'' and ''explaining these clearly''.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your instructions must be comprehensive and follow the principles outlined in the text, with explicit connections to the concepts of analysis and explanation.'

    The new sentence makes the writer less vulnerable to the charge of oversimplification, but the protection has been purchased at the expense of possibly confusing readers, who are no longer sure what to expect. Will the paragraph be about universities which subsidize football, or about those which do not?

    As this example suggests, qualification involves at least the appearance of contradiction. The trick is to qualify without confusing readers as to the main point. It is not difficult to do, once you understand a few basic principles.

    DWhenever possible, subordinate the qualification.

    College football is a semiprofessional sport, although some universities do play a purely amateur game.

    This makes better sense. By expressing the qualification in the adverbial clause reduces its importance. The thought, however, still progresses awkwardly.

    (4) DEFINITION, ANALYSIS, AND QUALIFICATION 145

    Placing the qualification uppermost in the reader's mind brings us to a second principle.

    [> When you plan, the qualification first and wind up on the main point.

    Although some universities do play a purely amateur game, college football is a semiprofessional sport.

    Use qualifying words and phrases.

    Although a few universities do play a purely amateur game, big-time college football is, in general, a semiprofessional sport.

    The addition of such expressions as "a few," "big-time," and "in general" further limits the writer's assertion. So phrased, the sentence has sufficient qualification to forestall easy challenge from those who disagree with it. Yet it remains clearly focused.

    [> When a qualification must be expressed in a separate sentence, lag it with a word stressing its obviousness and follow it by repeating the major idea.

    Big-time college football is a semiprofessional sport. Of course a few universities do play a purely amateur game. But these are only a few; on the whole, the game is subsidized.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Qualification Techniques in Writing**\n\nBased on the passage provided, analyze how the author uses qualification techniques to clarify ambiguity in the sentence: "College football is a semiprofessional sport, although some universities do play a purely amateur game."\n- **Step 1**: Identify two specific qualification methods mentioned in the text (e.g., subordinating the qualification or using adverbs).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how each method contributes to reducing reader confusion while maintaining the main point.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author might prefer one method over the other based on the passage''s discussion of clarity and focus.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference at least two techniques from the text and demonstrate an understanding of their role in effective writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Qualification Principles to a New Scenario**\n\nImagine you are writing about the topic: "Universities that subsidize football are more likely to have successful athletic programs." Construct a sentence that incorporates at least two qualification methods from the text.\n- **Part A**: Choose two qualification techniques from the passage (e.g., subordinating the qualification, using adverbs).\n- **Part B**: Apply these techniques to craft a clear and focused sentence.\n- **Part C**: Explain how your sentence avoids oversimplification while maintaining the main idea, referencing the text''s discussion of balancing qualification with focus.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must explicitly use the two chosen techniques and demonstrate an understanding of their role in effective writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Qualification Placement**\n\nThe passage discusses two approaches to qualification: placing it first or last in a sentence. Which approach is more effective for the following scenario?\n- **Part A**: Writing about a controversial topic (e.g., college sports funding).\n- **Part B**: Writing about a general, non-controversial topic (e.g., university course offerings).\n- **Part C**: Explain your reasoning for each part based on the text''s discussion of reader focus and clarity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference both approaches from the text and demonstrate an understanding of their effectiveness in different contexts.'

    It is not always possible to include a qualification in the same sentence that carries the main point. In that event, introducing the qualification with an admission of its truth tends to disarm it. "Of course" (or "certainly," "obviously," "admittedly," "it is true that"), you write, "such and such is the case." The initial adverb tells the reader that you are well aware of the exception, which, the adverb implies, doesn't matter very much. With the qualification completed, you then reassert your main point, beginning it with a strong signal of contradiction ("but," "however," "yet," "still," "even so").

    At times a qualification requires several sentences or even an entire paragraph. For example, George R. Stewart, arguing that the American colonists constituted an essentially homogeneous culture, writes:

    With few exceptions the colonists of European stock were of northwestern European origins, and there can have been, racially, only negligible differences among them. Even in their cultural backgrounds they differed little. They were heirs of the European Middle Ages, of the Renaissance, and of the Reformation. They were Christians by tradition, and nearly all were Protestants.

    Naturally the groups differed somewhat, one from another, and displayed some clannishness. They were conscious of their differences, often more conscious of differences than of resemblances. Thus a Pennsylvania governor was already voicing the cry that the American conservative has echoed ever since. "We are being overwhelmed by the immigrants!" he said in effect. "Will our country not become German instead of English?"

    Nevertheless, from the perspective of two centuries and from the point of view of the modern world with its critical problems of nationality and race, the differences existing among the various colonial groups fade into insignificance. We sense, comparatively speaking, a unified population. In the political realm, indeed, there were divergences that might lead even to tarrings and featherings, but racially and socially and religiously the superficial differences were less important than the basic unity.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Qualification Structure**\n\nWrite a paragraph that demonstrates your understanding of how qualifications function in argumentation, using the example from Stewart''s text. Your paragraph must include:\n- An introductory sentence that states the main point about qualification use in writing.\n- At least two qualifications (using ''of course,'' ''admittedly,'' or similar adverbs) that acknowledge exceptions or nuances.\n- A concluding sentence that reasserts the main point, contrasting the exception with the broader assertion.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be self-contained and demonstrate an understanding of how qualifications are used to balance assertions with exceptions in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Qualification in Historical Context**\n\nExplain how Stewart''s use of qualification helps convey his argument about the American colonists'' cultural homogeneity. Your answer must include:\n- A clear thesis statement that summarizes Stewart''s main claim.\n- At least two qualifications (using ''however,'' ''yet,'' or similar words) that acknowledge differences among the colonists.\n- A conclusion that reasserts Stewart''s main point, emphasizing how these qualifications do not undermine his overall argument about unity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must be logically structured and demonstrate an understanding of how qualifications support a broader thesis in historical analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Qualification Principles to Modern Contexts**\n\nWrite a short essay (one paragraph) that applies the principles of qualification discussed in the text to a modern issue. Your essay must:\n- Begin with a strong main assertion about the use of qualifications in contemporary discourse.\n- Include at least two qualifications that acknowledge complexities or exceptions in the issue.\n- Conclude by reasserting the main point, highlighting how these qualifications strengthen the argument rather than weaken it.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must be self-contained and demonstrate a clear understanding of how qualifications are used to balance assertions with nuance in modern writing.'

    Professor Stewart's second paragraph qualifies the point he makes in the first and returns to in the third. Notice that he begins paragraph two with "Naturally," removing the sting from the concession, and that he opens paragraph three with an emphatic "Nevertheless."

    Good sentences are the sinew of style. They give to prose its
    forward thrust, its flexibility, its strong and subtle rhythms.
    The cardinal virtues of such sentences are clarity, emphasis,
    concision, and variety. How to achieve these qualities will be
    our major concern in this part. First, however, we must un-
    derstand, in a brief and rudimentary way, what a sentence is.

    It is not easy to say. In fact, it is probably impossible to
    define a sentence to everyone's satisfaction. On the simplest
    level it may be described as a word or group of words stand-
    ing by itself, that is, beginning with a capital letter and ending
    with a period, question mark, or exclamation point. (In speech
    the separateness of a sentence is marked by intonation and
    pauses.)

    And yet an effective sentence involves more than starting
    with a capital and stopping with a period. The word or words
    must make sense, expressing an idea or perception or feeling
    clear enough to stand alone. For example, consider these two
    sentences:

    The package arrived. Finally.

    The first consists of a subject and verb. The second is only a
    single word, an adverb detached from a verb (arrived). The
    idea might have been expressed in one sentence:

    1§2 THE SENTENCE

    The package finally arrived.
    The package arrived, finally.
    Finally, the package arrived.

    But we can imagine a situation in which a speaker or writer,
    wanting to stress exasperation, feels that finally should be a
    sentence by itself.

    As that example indicates, there are sentences which con-
    tain subjects and verbs and sentences which do not. The first
    kind is grammatically complete" and
    is the conventional form sentences take in composition. The
    second type of sentence {Finally in our example) does not
    contain a subject and verb and is called #ragment. Fragments
    are more common in speech than in writing, but even in for-
    mal composition they have their place, which we'll consider
    in a subsequent chapter.

    The Grammatical Sentence

    The grammatically complete sentence is independent, con-
    tains a subject and a predicate, and is properly constructed.
    That definition may sound a bit formidable, but it really isn't.
    Let's briefly consider each of those three criteria.

    Grammatical Independence

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Function**\n\nConsider the two sentences: ''The package arrived.'' and ''Finally.''\n- **Part A**: Analyze why ''Finally'' is considered a sentence fragment in this context. Reference the text''s definition of grammatical independence and explain how it differs from a complete sentence.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the original statement to create a grammatically complete sentence that incorporates the adverb ''finally.'' Use the examples provided in the text (e.g., ''The package finally arrived'' or ''Finally, the package arrived'') to justify your choice.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definition of a grammatical sentence and demonstrate an understanding of how fragments differ from complete sentences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Sentence Function and Intonation**\n\nImagine a scenario where a speaker is expressing exasperation. The original statement is ''The package arrived.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why the speaker might choose to say ''Finally.'' as a separate sentence to convey this emotion. Reference the text''s discussion on intonation, pauses, and the role of fragments in speech.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the grammatical completeness of ''The package arrived'' versus ''Finally, the package arrived.'' Use the text''s examples (e.g., ''Finally, the package arrived'') to support your analysis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of intonation, pauses, and sentence fragments as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Types**\n\nThe text distinguishes between grammatically complete sentences and sentence fragments. Consider the statement: ''Finally.''\n- **Part A**: Determine why this is classified as a fragment based on the criteria of grammatical independence. Reference the text''s definition of a complete sentence (subject and predicate) and explain how this applies.\n- **Part B**: Construct an original example of a sentence fragment using at least one adverb or prepositional phrase, and identify its function in a larger context. Use the examples from the text to justify your choice.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of grammatical independence and provide a clear example that aligns with the text''s definitions.'

    Grammatical independence simply means that the words constituting the sentence are not acting as a noun or modifier or verb in connection with any other word or words. For example, "Harry was late" is independent. "Became Harry was late" is not. Because "became" turns the words into an adverb (more exactly, an adverbial clause). The construction should modify another verb or clause as in "The men were delayed in starting because Harry was late."

    1. The fact that "Because Harry was late" is not independent does not mean it cannot serve as a sentence. In the right context it could effectively stand alone. But it would be a fragment.

    A DEFINITION 153

    To take one more case. "They failed to agree" is a grammatical sentence. "That they failed to agree" is not. It is a noun clause and could function as the subject of a verb:

    "That they failed to agree was unfortunate."
    Or as the object of one:

    "We know that they failed to agree."

    Subject and Predicate

    The heart of a grammatical sentence is the subject and predicate. In a narrow sense the subject is the words identifying who or what the sentence is about, and the predicate is the verb, expressing something about the subject. In a broader sense, the subject includes the subject word(s) plus all modifiers, and the predicate includes the verb together with its objects and modifiers. For instance in "The man who lives next door decided last week to sell his house,"

    or grammatical, subject is "man," and the narrow, or grammatical, verb is "decided." The broad, or notional, subject is "The man who lives next door," and the broad, or notional, predicate is "decided last week to sell his house."

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Identification of Grammatical Independence**\n\nConsider the sentence fragment: "Because Harry was late."\n- **Part A**: Explain why this phrase is not grammatically independent, citing the definition of a grammatical sentence provided in the text.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the fragment as a complete sentence while maintaining its original meaning. Justify your choice of structure based on the subject-predicate relationship described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly reference the text''s definition of a grammatical sentence and demonstrate understanding of how to convert a fragment into an independent clause.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Noun Clauses**\n\nExamine the noun clause: "That they failed to agree."\n- **Part A**: Identify the function of this clause in the sentence "That they failed to agree was unfortunate." Explain how it serves as a subject based on the text''s explanation of subject and predicate.\n- **Part B**: Construct your own sentence where this noun clause functions as an object of a verb. Use the example provided in the text: "We know that they failed to agree."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s definition of noun clauses and their ability to function as subjects or objects within a grammatical sentence.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Subject-Predicate Relationships**\n\nConsider the sentence: "The man who lives next door decided last week to sell his house."\n- **Part A**: According to the text, identify the narrow subject and narrow predicate of this sentence.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the phrase "who lives next door" functions within the sentence, referencing the text''s explanation of modifiers in subject and predicate.\n- **Part C**: Create a new sentence with a similar structure, ensuring that your narrow subject and predicate are correctly identified. Justify your choice based on the text''s definition of subject and predicate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how modifiers and clauses interact with the subject and predicate as defined in the text.'

    The verb in a grammatical sentence must be finite, that is,
    limited with reference to time or person or number. English
    has several nextfirms called participles and infini-
    tives {Sexxymple, and to be). These can refer to any
    interval of time and can be used with any person or with
    either number. But by convention these nonfinite forms can-
    not by themselves make a sentence. Thus Harry was late is a
    grammatical sentence, but Harry being late isn't because it
    contains only the participle being instead of a finite form such
    as was.

    Proper Construction

    Even though a group of words is grammatically independent
    and contains a subject and a finite verb, it will not qualify as
    1§4 THE SENTENCE

    a grammatical sentence unless it is put together according to
    the rules. "Rules" here does not mean regulations arbitrarily
    laid down by experts. It means how we, all of us, use English.
    Thus Harry late was is not a good sentence. We simply do
    not arrange these words in that order.

    Here's one other example of a nonsentence resulting from
    bad construction:

    Harry was late, and although he was sorry.

    And can only combine elements that are grammatically
    equaherewanbjects of the same verb, for instance.

    In this case and joins two unequal nodestructions—the
    pendent clause Harry was late and the dependent (adverbial)
    clause although he was sorry. The construction can be turned
    into a legitimate grammatical sentence in either of two ways:

    Harry was late, although he was sorry.
    Harry was late, and he was sorry.

    The Building Blocks

    The basic slots of a grammatical serttensebjattat
    verb, object, and bheofllfeer-bymmyny kinds of
    words, phrases, and dependent clauses, the building blocks of
    sentences.

    Phrases and dependent clauses are both functional word
    gooupsretwords acting collectively in a gram-
    matical function, as a subject, for instance, or direct object or
    adverb, and so on. Functional word groups are enormously
    important. They enable us to treat ideas too complex to be
    expressed in single words as though they were, grammatically,
    only one word. Take these two sentences:

    I know Susan.

    I know that you won't like that movie.

    A DEFINITION 1§§

    Susan is the direct object of know. So is that you won't like
    that movie. For purposes of grammar the six-word clause
    functions like the one-word proper noun. Being able to use
    the full range of functional word groups available in English
    is essential to writing well. Here is a quick summary.

    Phrases

    A phrase is a functional word group that does not contain
    subject-finite verb combination, although some phrases do
    use nonfinite verb forms. We can distinguish five kinds of
    phrases: verb, prepositional, participial, gerundive, and
    infinitive.

    A verb phrase is a main verb plus any auxiliaries:

    They have been calling all day.

    A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition (in, of, to, and
    so on) plus an object, plus (often though not invariably) mod-
    ifiers of the object:

    Three people were sitting on the beautiful green lawn.

    The chief function of prepositional phrases is to modify,
    either as adjectives or as adverbs. A participial phrase is
    constructed around a participle, usually in the present (run-
    ning, for example) or past (run) participle form. It acts as an
    adjective:

    The man running down the street seemed suspicious.

    Here the participial phrase modifies man. A gerundive phrase
    also uses the present participle but in a construction that func-
    tions as a noun. In the following example the gerundive

    phrase is the subject of the verb phrase can be:

    Running for political office can be very expensive.

    156 THE SENTENCE

    An infinitive phrase, finally, is built around one of the infin-
    itives (usually the active present form). Infinitive phrases may act either as nouns or as modifiers. In this
    sentence the phrase is the direct object of the verb, a nounal
    function:

    They want me to go to medical school.
    Here it is an adjective modifying time:

    We had plenty of time to get there and back.

    Clauses

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Phrase Types**\n\nClassify the following sentence into its component phrase types, identifying each as verb, prepositional, participial, gerundive, or infinitive: \"Running for political office can be very expensive.\"\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main clause and its structure.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the function of each phrase (nounal, modifier, etc.).\n- **Step 3**: Reference specific definitions from the text to justify your classification.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly identify all phrase types and explicitly connect them to the definitions provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Clause and Phrase Functions**\n\nRewrite the sentence \"They want me to go to medical school.\" using an infinitive phrase as the subject, while maintaining the original meaning.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the function of the current infinitive phrase in the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Construct a new sentence where the infinitive phrase serves as the subject.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this restructured sentence adheres to the definitions of infinitive phrases provided in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate mastery of infinitive phrase functions and clearly reference the text''s definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Structure**\n\nConsider the sentence \"The man running down the street seemed suspicious.\"\n- **Part A**: Identify the function of the participial phrase and explain how it modifies the noun it precedes, using the text''s definition of participial phrases.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the functions of gerundive and participial phrases as described in the text. Provide an example for each that highlights their distinct roles.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence containing both a prepositional phrase and a participial phrase, ensuring that each phrase fulfills its respective function according to the text''s definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate all concepts from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how different phrase types contribute to sentence structure.'

- prompt: "A clause is a functional word group that does contain a subject and a finite verb. There are two basic clauses—independent and dependent. An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence. In fact a simple sentence like We saw you coming is an independent clause. But usually the term is reserved for such a construction when it occurs as part of a larger sentence. The sentence below, for instance, consists of two independent clauses:\n\nWe saw you coming, and we were glad.\n\nA dependent clause cannot stand alone as a grammatically complete sentence. It serves as part of a sentence—a object, adjective, or adverb. If we were to place when before the opening clause in the example above, we would turn it into a dependent (adverbial) clause modifying the second clause (which remains independent):\n\nWhen we saw you coming we were glad.\nDependent clauses may also act as nouns, either as subjects (as in the first of the following sentences) or as objects (as in the second):\n  \nA DEFINITION 157\n\nWhy he went at all is a mystery to me.\nWe knew that she would be pleased.\n\nAnd as adjectives:\n\nThe point that you're trying to make just isn't very clear.\n\nAbsolutes\n\nAn absolute is something more than a functional word group but less than a sentence. It is connected by idea but not through grammar to the rest of the statement in which it occurs:\n\nShe flew down the stairs, her children tumbling after her.\n\nThis absolute tells us something about the circumstances attending the lady's rush downstairs, but it doesn't modify anything in the main clause, nor is it an object or a subject. It simply is not a grammatical part of that clause. (The term absolute derives from a Latin word meaning \"free, unrestricted.\")\n\nThe Basic Types of Grammatical Sentences\n\nDepending on the number and type of clauses they contain, grammatical sentences fall into three patterns: the simple, the compound, and the complex. In addition, there are compound-complex sentences, though they are not truly basic.\n\nThe Simple Sentence\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Clause Types and Sentence Structure**\n\nClassify the sentence ''When we saw you coming, we were glad'' into one of the basic types of grammatical sentences (simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex), and explain your reasoning based on clause structure.\n- **Step 1**: Identify whether the sentence contains independent and/or dependent clauses.\n- **Step 2**: Determine how many independent and dependent clauses are present.\n- **Step 3**: Use the definitions provided in the text to justify which category this sentence belongs to.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must be accurate, and you must explicitly reference at least two definitions from the text (e.g., ''A dependent clause...'').'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Absolute Phrases**\n\nAnalyze the sentence ''She flew down the stairs, her children tumbling after her.''\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain what function the absolute phrase ''her children tumbling after her'' serves in this sentence.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the absolute phrase with a dependent clause (e.g., ''When we saw you coming''). Use specific definitions from the text to support your comparison.\n- **Part C**: Construct an original example of an absolute phrase that provides context about the circumstances of an action, ensuring it is not grammatically connected to the main clause.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of both absolute phrases and dependent clauses, as well as the ability to create a new example based on the text''s definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Structures**\n\nThe text discusses simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences. Consider the sentence ''We saw you coming, and we were glad.''\n- **Part A**: Classify this sentence into one of the basic types and justify your classification using the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how changing the sentence to ''When we saw you coming, we were glad'' transforms it into a different type of sentence. Reference specific definitions from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Create a compound-complex sentence that includes both an independent clause and a dependent clause, ensuring it is grammatically correct and follows the structure described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate all three types of sentences (simple, complex, compound) and demonstrate the ability to construct a compound-complex sentence based on the text''s definitions.'

    Simple sentences consist of one subject-verb nexus (Nexus means a grammatical connection between words, as in The children laughed.) Usually a simple sentence has only one subject and one verb, but it may have—and do—several

    158 THE SENTENCE

    of each and remain simple, providing that the various subjects and verbs comprise a single connection, as in the sentence The children and their parents laughed and were glad, in which the single nexus may be indicated like this:

    The Compound Sentence

    A compound sentence consists of at least two independent subject-verb nexuses:

    The children laughed, and their parents were glad.

    Compound sentences often have three independent clauses or even four or five. In theory there is no limit. In practice, however, most compound sentences contain only two clauses. Stringing out a number is likely to make an awkward, bling sentence.

    The two (or more) independent clauses comprising a compound sentence may be united in two ways. One is coordination, connecting clauses by a coordinating conjunction— and, but, for, or, nor, either, not, neither...

    .. but also, both ... and:

    The sea was dark and rough, and the wind was strong from the east.

    The second method of joining clauses is parataxis, which is simply butting them together without a conjunction (conventionally they are punctuated by a semicolon):

    The sea was dark and rough; the wind was strong from the east.

    A DEFINITION

    As we shall see later (Chapter 19) these two ways of connecting independent clauses are not necessarily interchangeable. In most cases one will be better than the other.

    The Complex Sentence

    A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. Here are several examples:

    independ. depend.
    1 4
    We saw |that you were tired.

    depend, independ,
    J 4
    Because the day was cloudy, they put off the picnic.

    independ. depend.
    1 L
    I like the people| who live next door.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structures**\n\nCompare and contrast compound sentences using coordination (e.g., ''and'', ''but'') with those using parataxis (e.g., semicolons). Construct a compound sentence with two independent clauses using each method. Explain which method you find more effective for clarity in written communication, citing examples from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include at least one example of each structure and demonstrate an understanding of when each is most appropriate based on the text''s explanation of their differences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Sentence Construction Rules**\n\nCreate a complex sentence that includes both an independent clause and a dependent clause. Identify the type of dependent clause used (e.g., noun, adjective, adverb) and explain how it functions within the sentence structure. Then, rewrite the sentence using coordination to transform it into a compound sentence. Compare the two versions in terms of clarity and complexity, referencing the text''s discussion on the purpose of each sentence type.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly define the dependent clause type and show how the transformation affects the sentence''s meaning and structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Types**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, analyze why a compound sentence is generally more effective than a complex sentence when describing multiple unrelated events. Construct an example of each and explain your reasoning based on the text''s explanation that ''in most cases one will be better than the other.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include clear examples of both sentence types and demonstrate an understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses according to the text.'

- prompt: |-
    In a complex sentence the independent clause is called the main clause, and the dependent clauses are subordinate clauses that function as a noun or adverb or adjective—these are called subordinates.

    Of course a complex sentence may contain a number of subordinate clauses, but it can only have one main clause. This type of sentence is very important in composition, and we shall study it more closely in Chapter 19.

    The Compound-Complex Sentence

    A compound-complex sentence must have at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent:

    independ. depend. independ.
    1 1 4
    We thought that we would go, but we decided not to.

    . Grammatical sentences must satisfy three criteria: they must (a)

    be grammatically independent, (b) have a subject and a finite
    verb, and (c) be properly constructed.

    . The parts of a sentence are subject, verb, object, and modifier.
    . These parts may be filled by single words or by functional word

    groups.

    . Functional word groups act grammatically as though they were

    one word. They include phrases and dependent clauses.

    . A phrase does not contain a subject-finite verb combination,

    though it may have a subject and a nonfinite verb form, either
    a participle or an infinitive.

    There are several kinds of phrases; prepositional, participial, gerundive, and infinitive.

    Clauses may be independent or dependent. Only dependent
    clauses act as functional word groups.

    1. Dependent clauses are classified according to their grammatical role as noun, adverbial, or adjectival clauses.

    1. An absolute is more than a functional word group but less than

    a sentence. It is related in idea but not in grammar to the rest
    of the sentence in which it occurs.

    Grammatical sentences come in three basic types—simple,
    compound, and compound-complex. Of the last two,

    the compound-complex sentence.

    In the last chapter we defined three grammatical sentences—
    simple, compound, and disjunctive,

    though not grammatically complete, may still stand as a sen-
    tence. From these types derive seven sentence styles: the seg-
    regating sentence, the freight-train sentence, the cumulative,
    parallel, balanced, subordinating, and—once again—the
    ment. We shall review them in this chapter.

    We need to be clear at the outset about two points. First,
    none of these styles is inherently better or worse than the
    others. Each is suited to some effects, ill-adapted to others.
    Second, the styles are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a skillful
    writer uses all of them.

    The Segregating Style

    At its purest the segregating sentence is grammatically simple,
    expressing a single idea.' A segregating style consists of a se-
    ries of such sentences. In practice the style is rarely confined

    1. "Idea" is a slippery word. Here it means simply one subject plus one pred-
    ication about that subject: The night was dark expresses a single idea. Most
    sentences consist of several: The night was dark, and it was lonely. Or,.with
    the two predications more closely connected: The night was dark and lonely.

    162 THE SENTENCE

    to technically simple, one-idea statements. That would be mo-
    notonous. Instead, a segregating style consists of relatively
    short, uncomplicated sentences, even though some of them
    may not be simple in the grammatical sense. Here, for ex-
    ample, a critic is describing how a particular novelist works:

    He writes, at most, 750 words a day. He writes and rewrites. He
    polishes and repolishes. He works in solitude. He works with ag-
    ony. He works with sweat. And that is the only way to work at
    all. Beverly Nichols

    As this passage shows, a segregating style can be very effec-
    tive. Short sentences are strong and repetitive, qualities ex-
    actly suited to Nichols's purpose. He wants to stress that
    writing often iwerksutilbn isftinonotonous

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Sentence Styles in Writing**\n\nWrite a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) about a daily routine that uses the segregating style.\n- **Step 1**: Use short, simple sentences to convey each action or thought.\n- **Step 2**: Repeat a key phrase or idea to emphasize its importance.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure your paragraph is structured in a way that highlights the repetitive and segmented nature of the segregating style.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must demonstrate an understanding of how the segregating style functions, as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Styles**\n\nThe text states that no sentence style is inherently better or worse, but each is suited to certain effects. Consider the following two scenarios:\n- **Scenario A**: A speech about a historical event where the audience needs to be engaged and retain information.\n- **Scenario B**: A letter expressing deep personal grief.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Determine which sentence style would be most effective for each scenario, justifying your choice based on the text''s description of styles.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the freight-train sentence might not be suitable for Scenario B, using specific details from the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that exemplifies the style you selected for Scenario A and explain how it meets the criteria for that style.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of sentence styles and their appropriate uses.'

    The importance of the relationship between sentence style and purpose is essential to good writing. The same general point may be put in any of various ways, but no two of the ways will be the same, and only one will be exactly what you want to say.

    Segregating sentences are especially useful in descriptive and narrative writing. They analyze a complicated perception or action into its parts and arrange these in a significant order. In the following passage, W Somerset Maugham describes a Chinese criminal being led to his place of execution (in colonial times the British vice-consul had to be present when the victim of the crime was English):

    The judge gave order and the vice-consul rose and walked to
    the gateway, where their chairs awaited them. Here stood the crim-
    inal with his guard. Notwithstanding his tied hands he smoked a
    cigarette. A squad of little soldiers had been sheltering themselves
    under the overhanging roof, and on the appearance of the judge
    the officer in charge made them form up. The judge and the vice-
    consul settled themselves in their chairs. The officer gave an order
    and the squad stepped out. A couple of yards behind them walked
    the criminal. Then came the judge in his chair and the vice-consul.

    SENTENCE STYLES 163

    This is a fine example of a segregating style. The sentences
    are short and uncomplicated (even though three of them are
    not simple, and none treats only a single idea). They break
    the scene into a series of tableaux, each rendered without
    comment. The effect is to distance us from the action, yet the
    technique is not that of a callous observer, but of an artist
    willing to let the event speak for itself. Like all effective styles,
    Maugham's deepens meaning, shocking us into seeing that in
    the society he is describing life and death do not matter very
    much.

    The segregating style, then, can be effective in description
    and narration. It is less useful in exposition, where you must
    combine ideas in subtle gradations of logic and importance.
    These subtleties cannot be conveyed by a series of short, in-
    dependent statements, which treat all ideas as equally
    important.

    Individually used, however, segregating sentences are val-
    uable in exposition, especially set beside longer statements,
    where they will seem strong and clear:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Style and Purpose**\n\nConsider the passage from W Somerset Maugham''s description of the Chinese criminal being led to execution. How does the use of segregating sentences serve the purpose of the passage?\n- **Step 1**: Analyze how the short, uncomplicated sentences contribute to the overall effect of distancing the reader from the action.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this technique with the description of the same event in a single long sentence. Explain why the segregating style enhances the artistic intent of Maugham''s writing.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your conclusion by referencing the text''s assertion that ''the technique is not that of a callous observer, but of an artist willing to let the event speak for itself.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect sentence style to purpose and demonstrate understanding of the text''s central argument about artistic intent.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Sentence Style in Exposition**\n\nExplain how segregating sentences can be effectively used in exposition, as noted in the text. Provide an example from the passage provided or create a new one that illustrates this technique.\n- **Step 1**: Define what is meant by ''segregating sentences'' and their role in exposition.\n- **Step 2**: Create a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) that demonstrates how segregating sentences can enhance clarity in an explanatory text about a scientific process.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this approach is effective based on the text''s discussion of ''subtle gradations of logic and importance.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your example must directly apply the concept from the text and demonstrate logical reasoning about sentence structure and purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Comparative Analysis of Sentence Styles**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of segregating sentences in descriptive/narrative writing (as in Maugham''s passage) with their use in exposition. How does the purpose of the text influence the effectiveness of this sentence style?\n- **Step 1**: Identify two key differences between the two uses of segregating sentences based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a specific example from the text that illustrates each difference.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the purpose of the writing (description vs. exposition) determines when segregating sentences are most effective, using direct quotes or paraphrases from the text to support your analysis.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both examples and textual evidence to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of sentence style in different contexts.'

    Short sentences like these are emphatic and create variety.
    (More examples will be seen in Chapters 21 and 23, where we
    discuss emphasis and variety.) Every writer should be able to
    handle the short sentence to stress particular ideas and, when
    the occasion warrants, to compose brief passages in a segregating style. On the whole, however, the style is too limited
    for general use in exposition. In unskilled hands it soon begins
    to sound like a third-grade reader: Dick has a dog. The dog's
    name is Spot. Spot is a friendly dog.

    game or a party. Use a segregating style to analyze the scene or
    action.

    The Freight-Train Style

    Several kinds of sentences do what the segregating style does
    not tolerate. They enhance ideas. The simplest of these is the
    freight-train style, so called because it couples short, independent clauses to make longer sequential statements. It is a
    development of the compound sentence (see page 106)

    has an old and honored history:

    And the rain descended and the floods came, and the winds blew,
    and beat upon the house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
    Matthew, 7:27

    The freight-train sentence has several virtues. It is useful
    when you wish to link a series of events, ideas, impressions,
    feelings, or perceptions as immediately as possible, without
    judging their relative value or imposing a logical structure
    upon them. Children often experience reality in this immediate, accepting way, and authors writing for children or trying to suggest a childlike vision may employ the style:

    Both Hemingway use the sentence to describe an experience taking place within the mind.
    The style suggests the continuous flow of dreaming, for we
    fantasize in a stream of loosely connected feelings and ideas
    and images, not in neatly packaged sentences of intricately
    related clauses and phrases tied together by if but, yet,
    therefore, consequently, on the other hand. Indeed, we some-
    times fantasize not in words at all but in imagined percep-
    tions, as Hemingway implies ("and you would hear the ice
    against the pail"). Hemingway also goes further than Gra-
    hame in imitating the mental state of fantasy: his one sentence
    is much longer and its flow unimpeded by punctuation. This
    technique is a variety of what is called "stream of conscious-
    ness," a way of writing that suggests a mind feeling, dreaming,
    thinking in a loose associational manner.

    Multiple Coordination and Parataxis

    The Grahame, Hemingway, and biblical examples all use mul-
    tiple coordination, linking clauses by coordinating conjunc-
    tions—such as in most, by using the word and.
    Instead of being coordinated, however, independent clauses
    can be butted together without conjunctions, in which case
    they are conventionally punctuated by semicolons, though
    sometimes commas are clear enough. This is called parataxis.
    Although either multiple coordination or parataxis is pos-
    sible in a freight-train sentence, they are not exact equivalents.
    Broadly speaking, the first is used when the ideas or
    feelings or perceptions are loosely related—such as a desire for a quick and fluid movement from clause to clause.
    These conditions are true of the three examples we have just
    seen, as they are of the following relatively short sentence by
    Hemingway:

    It was a hot day and the sky was bright and the road was white
    and dusty.

    There is movement here, involving both the scene and the
    sense by which we perceive it: we feel the heat, see the sky,
    lower our eyes to gaze down the road. The sentence style
    directs our senses much as a camera directs them in a film,
    guiding us from one perception to another, yet creating a con-
    tinuous experience. The freight-train style, then, can analyze
    experience much like a series of segregating sentences. But it
    brings the parts more closely together, and when it uses mul-
    tiple coordination, it achieves a high degree of fluidity.

    On the other hand, fluidity is not always desirable. Ideas
    or perceptions may be repetitive, with little change and noth-
    ing to flow together. Then parataxis is preferable to multiple
    coordination. In the following example Virginia Woolf,
    marizing a diary of an eighteenth-century Englishman visiting
    France, uses a freight-train style to mock his insularity:

    This is what he writes about, and, of course, about the habits of the
    natives. The habits of the natives are disgusting; the women hawk
    on the floor, the forks are dirty; the trees are poor; the Pont Neuf is
    not a patch on London Bridge; the cows are skinny; morals are
    licentious; polish is good; cabbages cost so much; bread is made
    of coarse flour.

    SENTENCE STYLES 167

    Each detail is another instance of the same underlying insen-
    sitivity. By hooking her clauses with semicolons (in one case
    with a comma) Woolf stresses the dull, unyielding vision of
    the diarist.

    Along with its advantages, the freight-train sentence has
    limitations. Like the segregating style, it does not handle ideas
    very subtly. The freight-train sentence implies that the
    thoughts it links together with grammatical equality are
    equally significant. But usually ideas are not of the same order
    of importance; some are major, others secondary. Moreover,
    this type of construction cannot show very precise logical
    relationships of cause and effect, condition, concession, and
    so on. It joins ideas only with such general conjunctions as
    and, but, or, nor or even less exactly with semicolons and
    commas.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Comparative Analysis of Sentence Styles**\n\nCompare the freight-train style and parataxis as presented in the reading, focusing on their effects on reader perception and narrative flow:\n- **Step 1**: Define both styles using examples from the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how each style influences the reader''s experience of the narrative (e.g., does one create a sense of continuity while the other emphasizes disjointedness?).\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate which style is more effective for conveying complex ideas, and justify your reasoning based on the text''s discussion of their limitations.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference both styles and demonstrate an understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses as discussed in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Narrative Technique**\n\nExplain how Virginia Woolf uses the freight-train style to mock the insularity of her diary writer, citing specific examples from the text:\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two key features of the freight-train style as described in the passage.\n- **Step 2**: Relate these features to the content of Woolf''s example (the diary entries about France).\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how this stylistic choice reinforces the author''s critique of the diarist''s perspective.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s analysis of Woolf''s writing and demonstrate an understanding of how style serves narrative purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Logical Relationships in Sentence Structures**\n\nGiven the limitations of the freight-train sentence discussed in the passage, design a sentence structure that effectively conveys cause-and-effect relationships while maintaining clarity and logical flow:\n- **Step 1**: Describe how your proposed structure differs from the freight-train style.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why this alternative structure would be more suitable for expressing complex logical connections (e.g., conditional, concession).\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example sentence that demonstrates this structure in action, citing specific grammatical elements from the text that support your design.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate concepts from the passage and demonstrate a clear understanding of how different sentence structures affect logical communication.'

    A second deficiency of the freight-train sentence is that it lacks a clear shape. Being open-ended, it has no necessary stopping place; one could go on and on adding clauses. As a way of providing it with a clearer structural principle, the freight-train sentence is sometimes composed in three units and is called a triad:

    Her showmanship was superb; her timing sensational; her dramatic instinct uncanny. Robert Coughlan

    Business executives, economists, and the public alike knew little of the industrial system they were operating; they were unable to diagnose the malady; they were unaware of the great forces operating beneath the Surditce. Thurman

    Often, as in these examples, the three clauses are paratactic rather than coordinated because the triadic sentence tends to

    2. These sentences are also called tricolons. Loosely, colon designated in ancient Greek rhetoric an independent clause that was part of a longer sentence. A tsiealovtence of three such clauses.

    be repetitive. But it can use conjunctions when shifts in subject occur:

    Then the first star came out and the great day was over and in the vestibule Baw my grandmother saluted by her sons who wished her a happy holiday. Ludwig Lewisohn

    In keavenohitlse final clause is substantially longer than the two that precede it. Movement to a longer, more complicated famastruction is a refinement of the triadic sentence:

    The canisters were almost out of reach; made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if anyone attempted to assist him in counting his money. Emily Bronte

    Occasionally the shift may work in the opposite direction, from long to short:

    Calvin Coolidge believed that the least government was the best government; he aspired to become the least President the country ever had; he attained his desire. Irving stone

    The Cumulative Sentence

    Most commonly a cumulative sentence consists of an initial independent clause followed by a number of subordinate constructions which accumulate details about the person, place, event, or idea. Though the elements that come after the main clause are technically subordinate, they carry the main load of the sentence and are fully as important.

You must explicitly reference at least two examples from the text to support your analysis.'

    building with chipped arte moderne detailing, the windows now

    entrance, among the dusty oleander, a rubber mat that reads
    WELCOME. Joan Didion

    Cumulative sentences are also useful in character sketches:

    She [Anne Morrow Lindbergh] was then twenty-one, a year out of
    Smith College, a dark, shy, quiet girl with a fine mind and a small
    but pure and valuable gift for putting her thoughts and fancies,
    about the earth, sky, and sea, on paper. John Lardner

    Though less often used in narration, the cumulative sen-
    tence can also handle a series of events, as in this account of
    an English military expedition into France in 1359:

    The unwieldy provision carts, draught horses, and heavily armed
    knights kept the advance down to nine miles a day, the huge horde
    moving in three parallel columns, cutting broad highways of litter
    and devastation through an already abandoned countryside, many
    of the adventurers now traveling on foot, having sold their horses
    for bread or having slaughtered them for meat. John Gardner

    Like the freight-train style, the cumulative has the problem
    of being open-ended, without a natural stopping place. But
    the deficiency may be made good by artful construction. In
    the following example the writer, dedeoibargph of
    his parents, opens with the clause "When they sat for a pho-
    tograph together," follows this with accumulated details, and
    ends by assessing the meaning of the picture:

    What happens in that sentence is that the accumulation is
    gathered between dashes and intrudes into the middle of the
    main sentence ("When they sat for a photograph together ...
    it was a portrait not only of contrasts, but of a nation's lower
    middle class coming out of its cocoon"). That sentence be-
    comes a frame enclosing the details, a pattern nicely suited to
    what the sentence is about.

    Finally, there is another variety of the cumulative sentence,
    in which the order is reversed: the accumulated details precede
    the main clause instead of following it. In the following ex-
    ample a novelist, discussing her art, begins by listing the es-
    sentials of a story.

    parallel because both relate to the verb went. In the
    following sentence, the italicized clauses are parallel, both
    modifying the verb will come:

    We waithe when we are ready and when we choose.

    Parallelism occurs in all types of sentences as a way of or-
    ganizing minor constructions. When major ideas are involved,
    we speak of a parallel style, as in this sentence, where three
    parallel objects follow the preposition "in":

    Ints energy, its lyrics, its advocacy of frustrated joys, rock is one
    long symphony of protest. magazine Time

    And here, three infinitive phrases modifying the word
    "campaign":

    The Department of Justice began a vigorous campaign to break up

    the corporate empires, to restore the free and open market, and to

    plant the feet of the industry firmly on the road to competition.
    Thurman Arnold

    Parallel constructions are subject to a strict rule of style:
    they must be in the same grammatical form. Consider this
    opening of a sentence by the eighteenth-century political
    writer Edmund Burke:

    To complain of the age we live in, to murmur at the present pos-
    sessors of power, to lament the past, to conceive extravagant hopes
    of the future, are the common dispositions of the greatest part of
    mankind. ...

    According to the rule the four subjects of the verb are must
    be in the same grammatical form, and Burke has made them
    all infinitives. They could have been gerunds {complaining,
    murmuring, lamenting, conceiving) or nouns {complaints,
    murmurs, tameeztsjons). But in any case the point is
    that they must all be the same. To combine different forms
    would violate the eukrapfermixing an infinitive with
    a gerund (To complain of the age we live in, murmuring
    against the present possessors of power). Such awkward
    mixtures are called shifted constructions and are regarded as a
    serious breach of style, sloppy and often ambiguous.
    Extended parallelism is not a hallmark of modern writing,
    as it was in the eighteenth century, when the parallel style was
    predominant in formal prose. On the other hand it is foolish
    and unseeing to dismiss parallel sentences as out-of-date.
    They are still useful and by no means uncommon:

    Advantages of Parallelism

    Parallel sentences have several advantages. First, they are im-
    pressive and pleasing to hear, elaborate yet rhythmic and or-
    dered, following a master plan with a place for everything and
    everything in its place.

    Second, parallelism is economical, using one element of a
    sentence to serve three or four others. Piling up several verbs
    after a single subject is probably the most common parallel
    pattern, as in the two examples just above. Paralleling verbs
    is particularly effective when describing a process or event.
    The sequence of the verbs analyzes the event and establishes
    its progress, and the concentration on verbs, without the re-
    current intervention of the subject, focuses the sentence on
    action. Here is an example, a description of prairie dogs, writ-
    ten by the American historian Francis Parkman:

    As the danger drew near they would wheel about, toss their heads
    in the air, and dive in a twinkling into their burrows.

    And another, an account of an invasion of Italy in 1494 by
    Charles VIII of France:

    Charles borrowed his way through Savoy, disappeared into the
    Alps, and emerged, early in September, at Asti, where his ally met
    him and escorted him to the suburbs. Ralph Roeder

    A third advantage of parallelism is its capacity to enrich
    meaning by emphasizing or revealing subtle connections be-
    tween words. For instance, in the example by Roeder the par-
    allelism hints at the harebrained nature of Charles's expedi-
    tion. Similarly Bernard Shaw, writing about Joan of Arc,
    insinuates a sardonic view of humanity below the surface of
    this prosaic summary of Joan's life:

    Joan of Arc, a village girl from the Wasgesrn about 1412,
    burnt for heresy, witchcraft, and sorcery in fef®bilitated after
    a fashion in 1456; designated venerable in d@@4yed Blessed
    in 1908; and finally canonized in 1920.

    Of course, Shaw's irony is carried essentially by the words themselves, but the rapid parallel progression of the verbs enables us to see more easily the wickedness which human beings are capable, destroying a woman whom later they would deem saintly.

    The meaning reinforced by a parallel style does not have ironic. It can have any emotional or intellectual coloring.

    In the first of the following examples we can hear a sly amusement; in the second, anger; and in the third, eloquence:

    Limitations of Parallelism

    The parallel style handles ideas better than do the segregating or freight-train sentences. However, it suits only ideas that are logically parallel: several effects of the same cause, for instance, or three or four conditions of a single effect. When writers try to force parallelism onto ideas that are not logically parallel, they obscure rather than clarify meaning.

    A second disadvantage of the parallel style is that it seems a bit formal for modern taste. And a third is that parallelism can be wordy rather than economical if the style to dominate them, padding out ideas to make a parallel sentence, instead of making a parallel sentence to organize ideas.

    Yet despite these limitations parallelism remains an important resource of sentence style, one which many people neglect. It is a most effective way of ordering perceptions or ideas or feelings, of shaping a sentence, and of attaining economy and emphasis.

    Parallelism and Balance

    The difference between parallelism and balance is that in the
    former the elements involved must stand in an identical gram-
    matical relationship to the same word or construction. Bal-
    anced words or constructions, however, do not have to be
    parallel (though they can be). Thus in the sentence above by
    Defoe the six clauses are separate and independent, not related
    to anything.

    But parallelism and balance often go hand in hand, and
    nothing prevents the same constructions from being both par-
    allel and balanced, if they are performing an identical gram-
    matical function, are in the same form, and roughly equal in
    length. Here are two examples:

    As for me, frankly cleave to the Greeks and not to the Indians,
    and Aspire to be a rational animal rather than a pure spirit.
    George Santayana

    The sentence balances two coordinated clauses of similar
    structure and length. Within the first, the prepositional
    phrases "to the Greeks and not to the Indians" are parallel
    and antithetical. In the second clause "a rational animal rather
    than a pure spirit" is a parallel construction, and balance (in
    this case antithesis) is provided by playing "rational animal"
    against "pure spirit."

    "A communist" and "such philosophical anarchists as Van-

    too much longer than the first to constitute a balance. How-
    ever, balance does occur in the two "who" clauses, though
    these are not parallel because they modify different nouns.

    The Advantages of Balance

    Balanced construction has several virtues. It is pleasing to our
    eyes and ears, and gives shape to the sentence, one of the
    essentials of good writing. It is memorable. And by playing
    key terms against each other, it opens up their implications.
    For example, the following sentence by Charles Dickens
    makes us consider the plight of those who lack the cash to
    turn their ideas to account:

    Talent, Mr. Micawber has; capital, Mr. Micawber has not.

    Anthony Hope implies a skeptical assessment of politicians
    and bureaucrats:

    Ability we don't expect in a government office, but honesty one
    might hope for.

    And here the movie critic Pauline Karelments on the film
    Love Story:
    178 THE SENTENCE

    In itself, a love idyll like this may seem harmless, but it won't be
    by itself very long.

    Keelislaint is that shlock films, if they are popular, usher
    in a host of even worse imitations. Notice how the sentence
    swings and advances on the phrases "in itself" and "by itself."
    Beyond highlighting specific words and ideas, balance has
    a deeper significance. It expresses a way of looking at the
    world, just as freight-train or cumulative sentences express
    their own angles of vision. Implicit in the balanced style is a
    sense of objectivity, control, and proportion. In the following
    passage about Lord Chesterfield, the critic F. L. Lucas rein-
    forces his argument by the reasonableness of his balanced sen-
    tences. The very style seems to confirm the fairness and lack
    of dogmatism suggested by such phrases as "seem to me" and
    "T think":

    In fine, there are things about Chesterfield that seem to me rather
    repellant; things that it is an offense in critics to defend. He is typ-
    ical of one side of the eighteenth weatusyitt-sféems to

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Balanced Construction in Criticism**\n\nThe text discusses how balanced sentences can express a ''way of looking at the world'' and convey objectivity. Using the example from F. L. Lucas''s passage about Lord Chesterfield, explain how balance contributes to the critic''s argument.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two key phrases in Lucas''s passage that exemplify balanced construction (e.g., ''seem to me rather repellant; things that it is an offense in critics to defend'').\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the balance between these ideas reinforces the critic''s argument about Chesterfield''s character.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this to the example of Anthony Hope''s sentence, where balance implies a ''skeptical assessment'' of politicians.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how balanced construction reflects a ''way of looking at the world'' and support your analysis with specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Balance in Writing**\n\nWrite a balanced sentence that highlights the dual nature of a contemporary issue, such as climate change or social media. Use the structure seen in the text''s example: ''In fine, there are things about Chesterfield that seem to me rather repellant; things that it is an offense in critics to defend.''\n- **Step 1**: Choose a contemporary issue and identify two opposing aspects (e.g., progress vs. environmental impact).\n- **Step 2**: Construct a sentence where each part of the balanced structure reflects one aspect of the issue, maintaining grammatical parallelism.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this balance mirrors the text''s assertion that ''balanced style is implicit in a sense of objectivity, control, and proportion.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct, demonstrate clear opposition between the two aspects, and explicitly connect your example to the text''s discussion of balanced construction as a reflection of worldview.'

    Many its most typical side. But it does not seem to me the really

    example of things to pursue in life than of things to avoid.

    Because the balanced style keeps a distance between writer
    and suxspadts well for irony and comedy. For instance,
    the novelist Anthony Trollope implies humorous disapproval
    of a domineering female character in this way:

    It is not my intention to breathe a word against Mrs. Proudie, but
    still ¢annot think that with all her virtues she adds much to her
    husband's happiness.

    The balance suggests the objectivity of the author and in-
    creases the credibility of his criticism, while at the same time
    the second clause comically reveals him indulging in the very
    gossip he forswears in the first.

    After a painful struggle yielded to my fate: sijhed as a lover, I
    obeyed as a son; my wound was insensibly healed by time, ab-
    sence, and the habits of a new life.

    Writing from the calmer waters of age, when the tempests of
    twenty seem less catastrophic, Gibbon is smiling. The very
    parallelism and balance of this triadic sentence, as formal as a

    Balance and parallelism do not communicate meaning by themselves. The primary units of meaning, of course, are words. But balanced and parallel constructions do reinforce and enrich meaning. Or, to be more exact, certain kinds of meaning. Not every sentence can be cast in this mold, or should be. Like every style, parallelism and balance have limitations as well as potentialities. Their very sanity, reasonableness, and control make them unsuitable for conveying the immediacy of raw experience or the intensity of strong emotion. Moreover, their formality is likely to seem too elaborate to modern readers, a less "natural" way of writing than the segregating style or the freight-train or cumulative sentences.

    However, we ought not to equate formality with artificiality or to think naturalness the only ideal. All well-constructed sentences result from art, even those—perhaps especially those—that create the illusion of naturalness. Remember, too, that natural is a tricky word. To men and women of the eighteenth century, parallelism and balance reflected nature, which they understood as a vast but comprehensible structure of ordered parts.

    Perhaps the best lesson a modern writer can learn from the parallel and balanced styles is the necessity of giving shape to what he or she thinks and feels. The shape congenial to the eighteenth century seems unnatural to us. But while we no longer write like Thomas Jefferson or Samuel Johnson, we can still use parallelism and balance as ways of organizing some aspects of experience and knowledge, and as means of attaining economy, emphasis, and variety in our sentences.

    3. Convoluted structure: the main clause is split in two, opening and closing the sentence; the subordinate constructions intrude between the parts of the main clause.

    4. Centered structure: the main clause occupies the middle of the sentence and is both preceded and followed by subordinate constructions.

    The four patterns may be mixed in varying degrees and frequently are. Even so, it is probably true that most subordinate sentences follow one pattern or another.

    The Loose Sentence

    At its simplest the loose sentence contains a main clause plus a subordinate construction:

    We must always be wary of conclusions drawn from the ways of the social insects, since their evolutionary track lies so far from ours. Robert Ardrey

    The number of ideas in loose sentences is easily increased by adding phrases and clauses, related either to the main constructions or to a preceding subordinate one:

    | found a large hall, obviously a former garage, dimly lit, and packed with cots. Eric Hoffer

    I knew had found a friend in the woman, who herself was a lonely soul, never having known the love of man or child. Emma Goldman

    As the number of subordinate constructions increases, the loose sentence approaches the cumulative style (discussed on pages 124–125). It is possible to draw a line between loose and cumulative sentences. Indeed, cumulative sentences (or rather, most of them) are a special variety of the loose style. The difference is relative, depending on the length and weight of the subordinate constructions. In the cumulative sentence these take over, becoming more significant than the main clause, which serves primarily to introduce them. The following passage describing a Welsh town illustrates how loose structure evolves into a cumulative style:

    Lihangtepkiasantly, with its white cottages, and orchard and other trees, on the western slope of a green hill; looking far and wide over green meadows and little or bigger hills, in the pleasant plain of Glamorgan; a short mile to the south of Cowbridge, to which smart little town it is properly a kind of suburb.

    Loose sentences are appropriate for writing that aims to be colloquial, informal, relaxed. It puts first things first, as most of us do when we talk. On the other hand, loose structure lacks emphasis and easily becomes formless. Its unity derives not so much from a structural principle as from the coherence of thought. A loose sentence is well formed to the degree that it expresses a completed idea or perception. A good example is the following passage, which begins a description of the Brooklyn home belonging to the writer's grandmother:

    Her house was a narrow brownstone, two windows to every floor except the ground, where the place of one window was taken by a double door of solid walnut plated with layers of dust-pocked cheap enamel. gtsallow stoop.... William Alfred

    Alfred's sentence is unified by what it thesattbes—the

    of the house. When that perception ends and our eyes are turned upon the stoop, the writer wisely begins a new sen-
    tence. Of course, this question of when to stop, of knowing when one statement should end and another begin, applies to all kinds of sentences. But it causes special problems with loose structure, where the absence of a clear stopping place may tempt you to ramble on and on.

    The Periodic Sentence

    Periodic sentences reverse the pattern of loose structure, be-
    ginning with subordinate constructions and putting the main
    clauses at the end:

    If there is no future for the black ghetto, the future of all Negroes
    is diminished. Stanley Sanders

    Given a moist planet with methane, formaldehyde, ammonia, and
    some usable minerals, all of which abound, exposed to lightning
    or ultraviolet radiation at the right temperature, life might start al-
    most anywhere. Lewis Thomas

    There is no one formula for the periodic sentence. Often,
    however, the opening subordinate constructions are adverbial
    clauses, as in the example by Stanley Sanders, or participial
    phrases, as in that by Lewis Thomas.

Provide examples from both sentences to support your analysis.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show a clear comparison of periodic and loose structures, using specific elements from the text.'

- prompt: "Whatever kinds of subordination it uses, the periodic style  \nis emphatic. Delaying the principal thought increases its im-  \nportance. To the degree that more and more subordinate  \nclauses and phrases are accumulated at the beginning, further  \npostponing the main clause, the sense of climax increases  \n(within limits, of course; too long a delay will cause confu-  \nsion).

- prompt: |-
    While not as emphatic as periodic or as informal as loose construction, the centered style has several advantages, especially in long sentences with numerous subordinate elements. It enables a writer to place those elements more clearly. If half-a-dozen or more phrases and dependent clauses all precede the main construction (as in the periodic style), or all follow it (as in the loose), some may seem to float free. The link becomes obscure, especially when writing about ideas. The chance of obscurity is reduced if the main clause can be placed in the middle of the subordinate elements.

    Another advantage of the centered sentence is that it is easier to arrange sentence elements to reflect the natural order of the event or the ideas. Jonathan Swift does exactly this in the following passage criticizing England's participation in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714):

    After ten years' fighting to little purpose, after the loss of above a hundred thousand men, and a debt remaining of twenty millions, we at length hearkened to the terms of peace, which was concluded with great advantage to the empire and to Holland, but none at all to us, and clogged soon after with the famous treaty of partition.

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.

    Allowed a broad and uncritical meaning of "idea," we may
    say that Swift's sentence contains nine of them: (1) the "ten
    years' fighting"; (2) the "little purpose," or lack of result; (3)
    the "loss" of the men; (4) the "debt remaining"; (5) the "hear-
    kening" to peace; (6) the conclusion of the peace; (7) the "ad-
    vantages" that followed for England's allies; (8) the absence
    of such advantages for England herself; and (9) the "clogging"
    of the peace. Here the order of the sentence mirrors events.
    In reality, as in the sentence, the fighting comes first, then the
    absence of positive results, the loss of life, the debt, and so
    on. Effecting a workable compromise between the natural or-
    der of thought or of events on the one hand, and the gram-
    matical order of the sentence on the other, is one of the most
    difficult tasks a writer faces. When you are dealing with a long
    and complicated subject, the centered sentence may prove the
    easiest solution to the problem.

    The Fragment

    A fragment is a single word, a phrase, or a dependent clause
    standing alone as a sentence. It is considered fragmentary
    rather than a grammatical sentence because it is not gram-
    matically independent and may not contain a subject and a
    finite verb. In formal writing fragments are generally a fault,
    though occasionally valuable for emphasis or variety. Before
    looking at examples of such positive fragments, we need to
    understand the common forms that fragments may take and
    how, when they are a fault rather than a virtue, they may be
    corrected.

    As an instance of a single-word fragment, consider this an-
    swer to a question:

    Do you understand?

    Perfectly.

    If we were to see the word perfectly printed all by itself, we
    should be puzzled. We know what the word means, but com-
    pletely isolated it makes no sense. It is not grammatically
    meaningful. Of course we rarely encounter words in such
    utter isolation. Usually they occur in the context of other
    words (or of clarifying social situations), and we can easily
    supply what is needed to complete the meaning:

    [| understand] perfectly.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Meaning**\n\nAnalyze how Swift''s sentence in the text demonstrates a relationship between the natural order of events and the grammatical structure of a sentence.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least three ideas from Swift''s sentence that correspond to events in chronological order.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these ideas are arranged within the sentence to mirror the sequence of events.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the challenge faced by a writer in balancing natural meaning with grammatical structure, referencing the text''s assertion about this being ''one of the most difficult tasks.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both the content of the text and the structural analysis of Swift''s sentence.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Fragment Analysis**\n\nExamine the single-word fragment ''perfectly'' in the context of the dialogue: ''Do you understand? Perfectly.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why the word ''perfectly'' is considered a fragment when isolated but meaningful within the conversation.\n- **Part B**: Describe how the surrounding context (the question and the response) provides grammatical completion to the fragment.\n- **Part C**: Compare this example with the text''s discussion on fragments in formal writing, explaining why such fragments may be considered a fault or a virtue depending on context.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the rules and exceptions related to fragments as described in the text.'

    Fragments in composition are less likely to be single words than phrases or clauses, usually modifiers detached from the words they modify. Three very common cases are the participial phrase, the adjectival clause, and the adverbial clause; each is italicized in the examples below:

    DETACHED PARTICIPIAL PHRASE: saw ler. Going down the street.

    DETACHED ADJECTIVAL CLAUSE: Everyone left except John. Who decided to stay.

    DETACHED ADVERBIAL CLAUSE: It was very late. When the party broke up.

    Awkward fragments such as these can be fixed in one of two ways. Either the fragment may be made part of the sentence where it acts as a modifier:

    I saw her going down the street.
    Everyone left except John, who decided to stay.
    It was very late when the party broke up.

    SENTENCE STYLES 189

    Or, the fragment may be kept as a separate statement but made grammatically complete, either by removing the word or words which render it subordinate or by supplying, if necessary, a subject and verb:

    I saw her. She was going down the street.
    Everyone left except John. He decided to stay.
    It was very late. The party broke up.

    Though these alternative corrections result in grammatical sentences, they have slight differences in meaning. ("Slight" differences in meaning are often the difference between good and mediocre writing.) Turning the fragment into a complete sentence gives it more emphasis.

    A final type of fragment is the verbless statement:

    All people, whether they live in the city or the country.

    Here modifiers surround a noun ("people"). But this noun, presumably the intended subject of a sentence, has no verb; the writer never predicates anything about "people." Cases like this may require more extensive revision. Sometimes, if the noun is followed by a modifying clause, the verb of the clause may be adapted as the main verb:

    All people live in the city or the country.

    In this instance, the correction is too simpleminded to be what the writer intended. He or she needs to think out the idea and supply an appropriate predication, perhaps something like:

    All people, whether they live in the city or the country, want the conveniences of modern life.

    Effective Fragments

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Correction Techniques**\n\nIdentify and correct the following awkward fragments using the correction strategies outlined in the text:\n1. Going down the street.\n2. Everyone left except John. Who decided to stay.\n3. It was very late. When the party broke up.\n\n**Task**: For each fragment, apply one of the two correction methods described (integrating into a sentence or making it a complete statement). Ensure that your corrected sentences preserve the original meaning and adhere to proper grammar rules.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your corrections must demonstrate an understanding of how fragments can be transformed into full sentences while maintaining their intended emphasis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Verbless Statements**\n\nExamine the following verbless statement from the text: "All people, whether they live in the city or the country."\n- **Part A**: Explain why this is considered a fragment and identify the grammatical issue.\n- **Part B**: Suggest two different ways to correct the sentence based on the strategies provided. For each correction, justify your choice by referencing the text''s discussion of modifying clauses and predication.\n- **Part C**: Compare the two corrected versions in terms of clarity, emphasis, and grammatical completeness. Which version best serves the purpose of conveying the writer''s intent? Why?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a deep understanding of verbless statements and their correction according to the text''s examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Fragment Types**\n\nCreate three original sentences that incorporate different types of fragments (participial, adjectival, or adverbial) as modifiers. Ensure that each sentence is grammatically complete and that the fragment is integrated properly into the main clause.\n- **Sentence 1**: Use a detached participial phrase to describe an action occurring simultaneously with the main clause.\n- **Sentence 2**: Incorporate a detached adjectival clause to add additional information about a noun.\n- **Sentence 3**: Employ a detached adverbial clause to provide context or time for the main action.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must demonstrate your ability to apply the correction strategies from the text and show a clear understanding of how fragments function in writing.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Fragment Usage and Grammar**\n\nUsing the provided passage on fragments, compose a grammatically complete sentence that incorporates at least one fragment from the list of practice problems (e.g., ''In the morning when the sun came up''). Ensure your sentence is both grammatically correct and stylistically appropriate for formal writing.\n\n**Task Requirements**:\n- **Part A**: Identify which part of the original fragment you are using as a modifier in your new sentence.\n- **Part B**: Justify why this usage is appropriate based on the text''s advice about when to use fragments in formal composition.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final sentence must be grammatically correct and demonstrate an understanding of the purpose and proper context for using fragments.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Fragment Functions in Narrative**\n\nExamine the two provided fragments: ''That girl is very nice. The one you introduced me to.'' and ''The boy climbing the tree. That''s my cousin.'' Using the text''s explanation of fragment function, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain why each fragment functions as a non-restrictive clause in the context of narrative writing.\n- **Part B**: Construct a sentence that uses a similar fragment structure to introduce a character or setting, ensuring it aligns with the text''s guidance on using fragments for emphasis or clarification.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s explanation of fragment usage and demonstrate an understanding of how fragments can serve narrative purposes without being full sentences.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Fragment Use in Formal Writing**\n\nThe text argues that fragments should be used ''very occasionally in formal composition'' and only when they serve a specific purpose. Based on the passage, evaluate the following two examples:\n- **Example 1**: ''Not everyone likes football. My brother, for instance.''\n- **Example 2**: ''Older people who lived through the Depression and the Second World War. And experienced great changes in our society.''\n\n**Task Requirements**:\n- **Part A**: Identify which example best fits the text''s recommendation for using fragments in formal writing, providing specific textual evidence from the passage to support your choice.\n- **Part B**: Propose a revision for the other example that aligns with the text''s guidelines on fragment use, ensuring the revised sentence is grammatically complete and maintains the original meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must directly reference the text''s advice about fragment usage and demonstrate an understanding of when fragments are appropriate in formal writing.'

    Aside from being grammatical, a well-written sentence must be clear and interesting. Clarity means that it says to the reader what the writer intended to say; interesting, that it reads well, attracting us by its economy, novelty, sound, and rhythm. To a considerable degree these virtues are a matter of diction, that is, of word choice; and in the section on diction we shall look at them again from that point of view. But they also depend on sentence structure. In this chapter and the next we consider how sentence structure in itself contributes to clarity and interest. It does so by aiming at concision, emphasis, rhythm, and variety.

    Concision is brevity relative to purpose. It is not to be confused with absolute brevity. A sentence of seven words is brief; but if the idea can be conveyed with equal clarity in fewer words, it is not concise. On the other hand, a sentence of fifty words is in no sense brief, but it is concise if the point can be made in no fewer words. Observing a few general rules of sentence construction will help you avoid certain kinds of wordiness.

    192 THE SENTENCE

    > Do Not Waste the Main Elements
    of the Sentence

    (In these and all following examples, the headword—that the unnecessary words are...)

    WORDY The fact of the war had the effect of causing many changes.
    CONCISE The war caused many changes.

    The main elements of a sentence are its subject, verb, and object. They should convey the core of the thought. Suppose we abstract subject, verb, and object from the sentences above:

    fact had effect
    war caused changes

    Clearly the thwisibalfilesslength of the original sentences is more efficient: from "war caused changes" a reader quickly grasps the nub of the idea. But who could guess the writer's point from "fact had effect"?

    As you compose a sentence, then, get the essence of the thought into the subject, verb, and object. Not doing so often results from uncertainty about what your subject is. A sentence that starts out on the wrong foot will stagger under a load of excess verbiage as you struggle to get at what you mean:

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Conciseness and Core Meaning**\n\nThe sentence ''The fact of the war had the effect of causing many changes'' is wordy, as demonstrated in the text. Using the principle that a concise sentence should focus on its subject, verb, and object, rewrite this sentence to be both brief and clear.\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify the core elements (subject, verb, object) from the original sentence.\n- Formulate a concise version that retains the essential meaning without unnecessary words.\n- Justify why your revision is more efficient and directly conveys the idea.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect an understanding of conciseness as ''brevity relative to purpose'' and demonstrate how your revised sentence achieves this.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Avoiding Wordiness in Sentence Construction**\n\nThe text emphasizes that wordy sentences often result from uncertainty about the subject, verb, and object. Consider the following example: ''The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.''\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify the main elements (subject, verb, object) in this sentence.\n- Rewrite the sentence to be more concise, ensuring that all essential information is retained without superfluous words.\n- Explain how your revision improves clarity and efficiency while maintaining the original meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how subject-verb-object focus reduces wordiness and enhances readability.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Sentence Structure**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of sentence structure in achieving clarity and interest through concision, emphasis, rhythm, and variety. Using the principle that ''conciseness is brevity relative to purpose,'' analyze the following two sentences:\n\nSentence A: ''Do Not Waste the Main Elements of the Sentence''\nSentence B: ''Avoid wasting the main elements of the sentence.''\n\n**Task**:\n- Compare the two sentences based on conciseness and clarity.\n- Explain which sentence is more concise, and why.\n- Justify how the choice of words affects the reader''s understanding and the overall effectiveness of the message.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate an analysis of word choice and structure to demonstrate mastery of the principles outlined in the text.'

    The first baseman wears a special leather glove that is designed for easy scooping and long-range catching, while the catcher wears a large glove that is heavily padded to protect him from fast pitches.

    The subject of the first clause is "the first baseman"; of the second, "the catcher." But these are the wrong subjects: the writer is contrasting the gloves, not the players. If the true

    (1) CONCISION 193

    subject ("glove") is used, the sentence steps off properly and
    moves along easily:

    The first baseman's glove is designed for easy scooping and long-
    range catching, while the catcher's is large and heavily padded to
    protect him from fast pitches.

    Awkward Anticipatory Construction

    This is a special case of failing to use the main sentence ele-
    ments effectively:

    WORDY This is the kind of golfer that is called a hacker.
    CONCISE _ This kind of golfer is called a hacker.

    In an anticipatory sentence the notional mybyéett—that

    the sentence is really abowhe-grammatical subject.

    Instead it is introduced (or "anticipated") by a pronoun (it,
    this, that, these, those, there) which functions as the gram-
    matical subject. (The tbedtifeonstrgction

    matically but for all practical purposes works the same way.)
    A verb like is, are, or seems links the notional subject to the
    pronoun, and an adjectival phrase or clause, modifying the
    notional subject, tells us what is being predicated about it:

    This is the man who witnessed the accident.
    There are many property owners who object to new schools.

    Those are the people from Chicago.

    Anticipatory constructions require more words than com-
    parable direct statements. Sometimes the construction is le-
    gitimized by emphasis or idiom; then the extra words are cer-
    tainly not deadwood. But unless there is such a purpose, a
    direct statement is preferable. Seems and its close relative
    appears are especially frequent in awkward anticipatory

    TQ4NTENCE THE

    sentences. Some writers, whether excessively cautious or po-
    lite, habitually hedge their bets, preferring a hesitant claim like

    It seems that this professor did not prepare his lectures very well.
    to the bolder assertion:
    This professor did not prepare his lectures very well.

- prompt: |-
    Regarding any anticipatory construction, then, ask yourself whether idiom or emphasis justifies it. Sometimes one or the other will. Changing "It is true that we did not like the idea at first" to "That we did not like the idea at first is true" saves one word but results in a stiff sentence, too formal for many occasions. Similarly, revising "This is the man who witnessed the accident" to "This man witnessed the accident" de-emphasizes the point, hardly an improvement when one wants to make a strong statement. But sometimes you will find that no such reason justifies an anticipatory construction. Then it is simply wordy, and you ought to replace it with a more direct statement.

    Adverbs and adjectives ought to link as directly as possible
    with what they modify. The writers of the first examples
    above are afraid of adverbs. (Many people are, perhaps made
    timid by uncertainty about the ending.) "Unnatural" re-
    ally describes "acted," but instead of directly connecting it to
    that verb, the writer hangs it on the empty word "way" in an
    unnecessary prepositional phrase. Similarly, the adverbial
    phrase "in a brief statement" can be rendered with equal clar-
    ity and far more economy by "briefly." The other three sen-
    tences labor under ponderous adjectival phrases or clauses
    when much briefer construction will do.

    Wordy modification often results from failing to use participle.
    In cases like the first example an abstract noun
    ("thought"), which requires a preposition and an article, can
    be replaced by one word, "thinking." The second example
    here shows how to prune an adjectival clause consisting of a
    relative word ("that") + a linking verb ("was") + a participle
    ("suggested") or other predicative term. By dropping the rel-
    ative word and the linking verb, you can move directly from
    the noun to the participle (or predicative word).

    Sometimes an entire adverbial clause can be cut back to the
    operative participle.

    A predicate adjective stands after the noun it notionally mod-

    CONCISE Pitchers are divided into two abatses—starters
    relievers.

    In sentences like these, the colon or dash says: "Here comes
    a series of particulars." If you let the punctuation mark talk,
    you won't need deadwood like "which include" or "these
    classes are." (The only difference between the colon and the
    dash in this function is that the colon is a bit more formal.
    However, each mark has other, very different tasks in which
    they are not equivalents.)

    The colon or dash can also set up an important idea delayed
    for emphasis:

    An ellipsis (plural, ellipses) is the omission of words implied
    by the grammar but not necessary to complete the sense. The
    writer using an ellipsis assumes that readers can supply the
    missing words from the context.

    Ellipses often secure concision with no loss of clarity or
    emphasis. They may even enhance those qualities. In the first
    example above, the sense does not require the second "is";
    moreover, the revision allows the sentence to end on the key
    term "brother." In the second, the concise version stresses
    "late" and avoids repeating "you"; while in the third, drop-
    ping "lost" from the second clause makes a striking
    statement.

    The unusual quality of some ellipses, however, limits their
    usefulness. For example, "He lost his wallet; she, her pock-
    etbook" has a literary flavor that might seem odd in a matter-
    of-fact, colloquial passage.

    Use Parallelism

    WORDY These books are not primarily for reading, but they are
    used for reference.

    CONCISE These books are not primarily for reading but for
    reference.

    WORDY The beginner must work more slowly, and he must
    work more consciously.

    CONCISE The beginner must work more slowly and more
    consciously.

    Parallelism means that two or more words, phrases, or
    clauses are grammatically related in the same way to the same
    thing. In "The man and the boy came in together," "man"
    and "boy" are parallel because each acts as a subject of the
    same verb ("came in"). Or in "She stood and raised her
    hand," "stood" and "raised" are parallel because each is a
    verb of the same subject ("She").

    Parallelism is like factoring in mathematics; instead of re-
    peating an +2aay + az, the mathematician writes a(2x
    + 3y + z). In a grammatically parallel construction the gov-
    erning term need not be stated two or three times. In the first
    example, the phrase "for reference," by being made parallel
    to "for reading," does duty for the entire second clause.

    But at times parallelism improves nothing. Emphasis or
    rhythm often justifies a certain amount of repetition. Thus in
    the second example above, the so-called "wordy" version
    would be preferable if the writer wished to stress "he must
    work."

    CHAPTER :

    The WalbiWeitten
    (2) Emphasis

    In speech we achieve emphasis in a variety of ways: by talking
    loudly (or sometimes very softly); by speaking slowly, care-
    fully separating words that ordinarily we run together; by
    altering our tone of voice or changing its timbre. We also
    stress what we say by nonvocal means: a rigid, uncompro-
    mising posture; a clenched fist; a pointing finger; any of nu-
    merous other body attitudes, gestures, facial expressions.

    Writers can rely upon none of these signals. Yet they too
    need to be emphatic. What they must do, in effect, is to trans-
    late loudness, intonation, gesture, and so on, into writing.
    Equivalents are available. Some are merely visual symbols for
    things we do when talking: much punctuation, for example,
    stands for pauses in speech. Other devices, while not un-
    known in speech, belong primarily to composition. Some of
    these we shall look at in this chapter.

    First, though, we need to distinguish two degrees of em-
    pumapisasitotatich applies to the entire sentence,
    gnudtial emphasis, which applies only to a word, or a group
    of words, within the sentence. As an example of total em-
    phasis, consider these two statements:

    1An old man sat in the corner.
    2. In the corner sat an old man.

    (2) EMPHASIS 201

    Sentence (1) is matter of fact, attaching no special importance
    to what it tells us. Sentence (2), however, like a close-up in a
    film, suggests that the fact is important. Now this distinction
    does not mean that the second version is superior to the first:
    simply that it is more emphatic. Whether or not the emphasis
    makes it better depends on what the writer wants to say.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Emphasis Techniques in Written Communication**\n\nCompare and contrast the two sentences provided in the text about emphasis:\n\n1. An old man sat in the corner.\n2. In the corner sat an old man.\n\n- **Step 1**: Analyze how the structure of each sentence affects the reader''s perception of importance.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why reversing the subject and verb changes the emphasis, using examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Apply this principle to create a new sentence that emphasizes a different part of the sentence (e.g., ''The dog barked at the mailman'').\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of how sentence structure influences emphasis, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Visual and Punctuation Emphasis**\n\nUsing the techniques discussed in the text, design a paragraph that emphasizes the importance of a particular topic (e.g., climate change) without using vocal cues.\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three visual or punctuation devices from the text that you will use to emphasize key points.\n- **Part B**: Create a sample paragraph with these devices, ensuring that each device serves a distinct purpose in highlighting the topic''s significance.\n- **Part C**: Justify why these choices are effective based on the text''s explanation of how writers can translate vocal emphasis into written form.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be coherent and demonstrate an understanding of how different emphasis techniques can convey meaning without verbal cues.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Structure for Emphasis**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''The dog barked at the mailman.''\n- **Part A**: Determine which part of the sentence is emphasized based on the text''s explanation of total vs. partial emphasis.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence to shift the emphasis to a different part (e.g., the action, the subject, or the object). Explain your choice using examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a parallel example using a different scenario (e.g., ''The teacher assigned homework'') and analyze how structure affects emphasis in both sentences.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of total and partial emphasis as described in the text, showing an ability to apply these principles to various sentence structures.'

    By their nature strong sentences (that is, those having total emphasis) cannot occur very often. Their effectiveness depends on their rarity. Writing in which every sentence is emphatic, or even every other, is like having somebody shout at you.

    Partial emphasis (emphasis within the sentence), however, is characteristic of all well-written sentences. Usually one word (or phrase or clause) is more important than the others. Consider these two variations of the same statement:

    1. It suddenly began to rain.
    2. Suddenly, it began to rain.

    If we suppose that the writer wished to draw our attention to "suddenly," sentence (2) is better. By moving it to the opening position and isolating it with a comma, the writer gives the word far more weight than it has in sentence (1). Again there is no question of an absolute better or worse. Each version is well-suited to some purpose, ill-suited to others.

    The Emphatic Sentence

    There are a number of ways of stressing a statement in its totality.

    > Announcement

    An announcement (in the sense it has here) is a preliminary statement which tells the reader, "Watch out, here comes something important": \
    202 THE SENTENCE

    Finally, last point about the man: he is in trouble.
    Benjamin DeMott

    The construction receiving the stress should be phrased concisely and vigorously and separated from the preceding announcement by a colon or dash (though sometimes a comma will do).

    Anticipatory constructions, which we saw on page 141 as a potential source of deadwood, can function effectively as a form of announcement. They are low-key, reducing the introduction to little more than a pronoun (or there) + a verb:

    This was the consequence we feared. Evelyn Jones

    It is abalgig—ethtsuman beings to understand each Other. Joy Packer

    The Fragment

    A fragment is a construction which, like a sentence, begins with a capital and ends with full-stop punctuation, but which does not satisfy the traditional definition of a sentence.' While they are often serious grammatical faults, fragments can be used positively as a means of emphatic statement, drawing attention because of their difference:

    And that's why there's really a very simple answer to our original question.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Emphasis in Sentence Structure**\n\nCompare and contrast the emphasis in the two versions of the sentence: ''It suddenly began to rain.'' vs. ''Suddenly, it began to rain.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify which word(s) receive primary emphasis in each version based on their position within the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the placement and punctuation (comma or not) affect the weight given to the emphasized word according to the text''s discussion on partial emphasis.\n- **Step 3**: Use the example from the text where an anticipatory construction is used as a form of announcement, and explain how that structure might be modified to achieve similar emphasis in a different sentence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of both total and partial emphasis, as well as the use of punctuation and structure to convey rhetorical effect.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Announcement Structures**\n\nCreate an announcement sentence that introduces a key point, followed by a supporting statement. Use the examples from the text (e.g., ''Finally, last point about the man: he is in trouble.'') to guide your structure.\n- **Part A**: Write the announcement using either a colon or dash as specified in the text.\n- **Part B**: Provide a supporting sentence that directly responds to the announcement.\n- **Part C**: Analyze how this structure effectively draws attention to the key point, referencing the text''s explanation of announcements as ''preliminary statements which tell the reader... here comes something important.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a correctly formatted announcement and supporting sentence, along with an analysis that directly references the text''s definition of announcements.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Fragment Use**\n\nThe text describes fragments as ''constructions which... do not satisfy the traditional definition of a sentence,'' yet they can be used for emphasis. Construct a fragment that serves as an emphatic statement, and explain its effectiveness based on the text''s discussion of fragments as a means of drawing attention through their difference from full sentences.\n- **Part A**: Write a fragment that is grammatically incomplete but emphasizes a particular idea.\n- **Part B**: Explain why this fragment functions as an emphatic statement according to the text, referencing the concept of ''difference'' in its structure.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast this fragment with a full sentence that conveys the same message, highlighting how each approach achieves emphasis differently.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a correctly formatted fragment and a detailed explanation that directly references the text''s perspective on fragments as rhetorical devices.'

    The Short Sentence

    Short sentences are inherently emphatic. They will seem es-
    pecially strong in the context of longer, more complicated
    statements. Often the contrast in length reinforces the con-
    trast in thought:

    As Thompson and the Transcript man had said, Vanzetti was nat-
    urally and quietly eloquent. So he was electrocuted. Phil strong

    Again, it's an incontrovertible fact that, in the past, when contra-
    ceptive methods were unknown, women spent a much larger pro-
    portion of a much shorter life pregnant, or nursing infants whom
    they had borne with little or no medical help. And don't believe
    that that's a natural, a healthy thing for human beings to do, just
    because animals do it. itn't. , Elizabeth Janeway

    The Imperative Sentence
    At its simplest the imperative sentence is a command:

    Come here!
    Listen to me!

    Its distinguishing fhatuitedrayssally-suib-
    ject and begins with the verb, although some commands use
    a noun of address or an actual subject:

    John, come here!
    You listen to me!

    While commands are rare in composition, imperative sen-
    tences can be emphatic in other ways:

    Insist on yourself; never imitate. Ralph Waldo Emerson

    Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown
    off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's wing that falls on the
    rails. Henry David Thoreau

    204 THE SENTENCE

    Consider, for example, those skulls on the monuments.
    . Aldous Huxley

    Aside from being strong, imperative sentences also link
    writer and reader. Emerson does not say "men and women
    must insist on themselves"; he addresses you. Thoreau urges
    you to participate in a new way of life, and Huxley invites
    you to look with him at the statuary he is examining. Huxley's
    sentence also illustrates another use of the imperative: moving
    readers easily from one point to another.

    206 THE SENTENCE

    Periodic sentences can be constructed in various ways.
    Many are built by beginning the sentence with adverbials, like
    the fifth example above. Others start off with a
    noun clause:

    That John Chaucer was only an assistant seems certain.
    John Gardner

    That the author of Everyman was no mere artist, but an artist-
    philosopher, and that the artist-philosophers are the only sort of
    artists like seriously bevilb news to you.

    George Bernard Shaw

    However they are constructed, periodic sentences make
    stronger statements than do loose, requiring that we pay at-
    tention and suspend understanding until the final words pull
    everything together. But this type of sentence has limitations.
    It quickly grows tiresome, for the alertness it demands wea-
    ries readers. Furthermore, periodic structure has a formal, lit-
    erary tone, unsuitable for informal occasions. Yet despite
    these limitations an occasional periodic sentence supplies val-
    uable emphasis and has the further advantage of varying your
    style.

    The Rhestidcl

    In discussing paragraphs (page 68) we saw that rhetorical
    questions can serve as topic sentences. They can also establish
    emphasis. Most emphatic rhetorical questions are, in effect,
    disguised assertions:

    A desirable young man? Dust and ashes! What was there desirable
    in sink that? Strachey Lytton

    The question says, of course, that he was not desirable
    young man."

    Some emphatic questions are more complicated in mean-
    ing, combining an implicit avowal with an actual query:

    (2) EMPHASIS 207

    Yet this need not be. The means are at hand to fulfill the age-old
    dream: poverty can be abolished. How long shall we ignore this
    under-developed nation in our midst? How long shall we look the
    other way while our fellow human beings suffer? How long?
    Michael Harrington

    Even here, however, Harrington is trying not so much to
    elicit an answer as he is to convince us that allowing poverty
    to continue is indefensible. (Notice, incidentally, that each of
    those two examples also contains other kinds of emphatic
    statement: short sentences, fragments, repetitions.)

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Periodic and Rhetorical Sentence Structures**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of periodic sentences in the examples provided with the rhetorical questions used for emphasis. Specifically, address the following:\n- How do periodic sentences achieve emphasis through structure?\n- What is the difference between a rhetorical question that serves as a topic sentence and one that serves to establish emphasis?\n- Why does the text suggest that periodic sentences have limitations in terms of reader engagement despite their ability to provide strong emphasis?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate concepts from both paragraph 206 (periodic sentences) and paragraph 207 (emphasis through rhetorical questions), demonstrating an understanding of how these structures serve different rhetorical functions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Question Functions**\n\nExamine the example rhetorical question: ''How long shall we ignore this under-developed nation in our midst?'' from Michael Harrington''s text.\n- **Part A**: Identify the implicit avowal embedded in the question. Explain how this avowal functions to strengthen the argument presented.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast this rhetorical question with the example from Strachey Lytton: ''A desirable young man? Dust and ashes! What was there desirable in sink that?''\n- **Part C**: Based on the text''s discussion of emphasis, explain why Harrington''s rhetorical question is more effective than Lytton''s in achieving persuasive intent.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how rhetorical questions can serve as disguised assertions and how their structure influences their effectiveness.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Sentence Structures for Rhetorical Effect**\n\nConstruct a rhetorical question that serves to establish emphasis, similar to the examples in the text. Your question must: \n- Include at least one implicit avowal (as seen in Harrington''s example)\n- Use a structure that mirrors either a periodic sentence or a rhetorical question with fragmented syntax\n- Clearly state the persuasive intent of your question\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show an ability to synthesize elements from both paragraph 206 (periodic sentences) and paragraph 207 (rhetorical questions), demonstrating original reasoning about how sentence structure can be used for rhetorical effect.'

    Generally the same sentence contains both the negative and
    the positive statements (as in the first examples here). In
    an extended passage, negative and positive may be expressed
    in separate sentences (the third example).

    Less commonly the progression may be from positive to
    negative, as in this sentence by G. K. Chesterton about social
    conventions:

    Conventions may be cruel, they may be unsuitable, they may even
    be grossly superstitious or obscene, but there is one thing they never
    are. Conventions are never dead.

    Rhythm and Rhyme

    Rhymers—phrasal and unstressed syllables—are an inevitable aspect of prose, though rarely as regular or as obvious as in poetry. Since rhythm of some sort is
    inescapable, good writers are aware of it and make it work
    for them. Later, in Chapter 22, we shall look at prose rhythm
    a bit more closely, considering how it is controlled and how
    it contributes to meaning. One contribution we touch upon
    here is the most common ways in which
    rhythm conveys emphasis are by clustered stresses and metrical runs.

    A stressed syllable is spoken relatively loudly, an unstressed
    one more softly. Stressed syllables are marked by /, unstressed
    by x, as in

    above.

    A metrical run consists of a number of stressed and unstressed
    syllables recurring in a more or less regular pattern. This, of
    course, is common in poetry, but much less so in prose.

    Clustering stresses simply means constructing a sentence so
    that three or four or more stressed syllables occur successively. Obviously such clustering cannot be extensive or frequent. Done skillfully, as in the examples above, it endows
    an idea with considerable importance. It can also contribute
    to meaning in subtle ways. For example, the rhythm of Al-
    len's sentence reinforces the sense of unalterable finality con-
    veyed by "dead."

    For one brief moment the world was nothing but sight-ttie
    x xf
    sound, the sneelbuch, the taste of sea. Sheila Kaye-Smith

    The rhythmic regularity of that sentence not only makes it
    memorable but also enhances the emotional intensity of the
    experience.

    Like clustered stresses, metrical runs cannot be maintained
    for very long or employed very often. Otherwise prose begins
    to sound awkwardly poetic. It is a mistake, however, to sup-
    pose that such passages have no place in prose, that prose
    must avoid any rhythmic effects at all. As we suggested,
    rhythm is always there, but it should be unobtrusive, direct-
    ing a reader's response, but without drawing attention to
    itself.

    Rhyme

    Rhyme, the repetition of identical or very similar sounds, is,
    like rhythm, a technique we associate more with poetry than
    with prose. When it does occur in prose it is usually a way of
    emphasizing particular words within the sentence (we shall
    see examples later in the chapter). Occasionally, however,
    rhyme serves to unify and emphasize an entire sentence, most
    commonly in the form of alliteration (the repetition of suc-
    cessive or near-successive initial sounds):

    Reason will be replaced by Revelation. w. H. Auden
    210 THE SENTENCE

    Emphasis Within the Sentence

    Emphatic sentences are only occasionally needed. But it is
    usually necessary to establish appropriate emphasis upon par-
    ticular words within the sentence. Good writers do this sub-
    tly. Rather than scattering exclamation points, underlinings,
    and capitals, they rely chiefly upon the selection and posi-
    tioning of words.

    Important source of emphasis. A special class

    called intensives do nothing but stress the term they modify:
    great, gxtuthyely, much, very, terribly, awfully, and

    many, many more. But on the whole intensives are not very
    satisfactory. They quickly become devalued, leading to a
    never-ending search for fresh words. Imaginative writers can
    and do discover unusual and effective ones, as in this descrip-
    tion of the modern superstate:

    These goalocinese monstrous states ... Susanne K. Langer

    Still it is best not to rely upon intensives as a primary device
    of emphasis.

    Pairing and Piling Modifiers

    As we shall see in a few pages, adjectives and adverbs can be
    made emphatic by where they are placed and how they are
    punctuated. But aside from that, they may be paired and piled
    up (that is, grouped in units of two or of three or more). Here
    are a few instances of paired modifiers:

    They [a man's children] are his for a brief and passing season.
    Margaret Mead

    This antiquated and indefensible notion that young people have no
    rights trtjlare ... twenty-one Evelyn Jones

    (2) EMPHASIS 211

    [Lady Mary Wontkeyue was like] a dilapidated macaw with

    a hard, piercing laugh, mirthless and joyless, with a few unimagin-
    ative phrases, with a parrot's powers ofservation and a parrot's
    hard and poisonous bite. Edith Sitwell

    Working as a team, paired adjectives impress themselves
    upon the reader. And they often do more, reinforcing a point
    by restatement ("a brief and passing season") or suggesting
    subtle contrasts and efnplefnammnas Sitwell's
    sentence leads us to think about the distinction between
    "mirth" and "joy" and about how a laugh can be both "hard"
    and "piercing."

    Adjectives may also be accumulated in groups of three or
    more; as in this description of an famaHyAmerican

    ... awilful, clannish, hard-drinking, fornicating tribe.
    William Gibson

    Or this one of a neighbor taking a singing lesson:

    A vile beastly rotten-headed fool-begotten brazen-throated pernicious
    piggish screaming, teaming, perplexing, split-mecrackle
    crash-megiggle insane ass.... is practicing howling below-stairs
    with a brute of a singing-master so horribly, that my head is nearly
    off. Edmund Lear

    Passages like these, especially the second, are virtuoso per-
    formances in which exaggeration becomes its own end. Of
    course, exposition cannot indulge itself like this very often.
    But sobriety needs relief, and verbal exuberance dazzles and
    delights. Whatever may be the objective truth of such fusil-
    lades of modifiers, they bring us into startling contact with
    the thoughts and feelings of the writer— the immediate of
    communication.

    Position

    Two positions in a clause or sentence are more emphatic than
    any other— and the closing. Elsewhere emphasis
    must depend on inversion, isolation, modification, restate-
    ment, and so forth. (Of course these techniques may work in
    harness with positioning to give even greater strength to
    opening and closing words.)

    Opening with key words has much to recommend it. Im-
    mediately, readers see what is important. E. M. Forster, for
    example, begins a paragraph on "curiosity" with the follow-
    ing sentence, identifying his topic at once:

    Curiosity is one of the lowest human faculties.

    Putting the essential idea first is natural, suited to a style aim-
    ing at the simplicity and directness of forceful speech:

    Great blobs of rain fall. Rumble of thunder. Lightning streaking blue
    on the building. P. Donleavy.

    Donleavy's sentences mirror the immediacy of the experience,
    going at once to what dominates his perception—the
    feel of rain, thunder, lightning. (The two fragments also en-
    hance the forcefulness of the passage.)

    Beginning (or ending) with the principal idea is advantageous in developing a contrast, which is strengthened if the
    following clause or sentence opens with the opposing term:

    Science was traditionally aristocratic, speculative, intellectual in intent; technology was lower-class, empirical, action-oriented.
    Lynn White, Jr.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Emphasis and Clarity in Writing**\n\nUsing the principles of emphasis and clarity discussed in the text, rewrite the following sentence to enhance its impact:\n\n''He was a man of great wisdom, yet his actions often seemed misguided.''\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main idea or key point of the original sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Apply positioning techniques (e.g., placing the essential idea at the beginning or end) to strengthen emphasis.\n- **Step 3**: Use modifiers or rephrasing to clarify the contrast between wisdom and actions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your rewritten sentence must clearly reflect the text''s principles of emphasis through structure, and it must demonstrate a clear contrast between the two elements (wisdom and actions).'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Positioning Techniques for Contrast**\n\nConstruct a paragraph that highlights the contrast between tradition and innovation using the positioning techniques described in the text. Your paragraph should follow these guidelines:\n- **Part A**: Begin with the main idea or key point (e.g., ''Tradition is rooted in the past, while innovation emerges from the future'').\n- **Part B**: Use the closing sentence to reinforce the contrast by emphasizing the opposing term.\n- **Part C**: Ensure that each subsequent sentence builds on the positioning technique to maintain clarity and emphasis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must clearly demonstrate the use of positioning to highlight contrast, with a strong opening and closing sentence that reflect the text''s discussion on emphasis in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Writing Techniques**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of starting or ending sentences with key ideas. Using this principle, analyze the following excerpt and determine whether it is an effective example of this technique:\n\n''In a world where technology advances rapidly, we must consider the ethical implications of our creations.''\n\n- **Part A**: Identify the main idea of the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Determine whether the sentence begins or ends with the key idea and explain why this is significant according to the text.\n- **Part C**: Suggest one alternative rephrasing that would enhance the clarity and emphasis, following the principles outlined in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must clearly apply the text''s discussion on positioning and emphasize the importance of key ideas in writing.'

    Postponing a major point to the end of the sentence is more formal and literary. The writer must have the entire sentence in mind from the first word. On the other hand, the final position is more emphatic than the opening, perhaps because we remember best what we have read last:

    So the great gift of symbolism, which is the gift of reason, is at the same time the seat of man's peculiar darakeressi—the lunacy. Susanne Kanger

    (2) EMPHASIS 213

    Like the opening position, the closing is also useful for reinforcing contrasts and iterations:

    We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was "legal" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did was "illegal." Martin Luther Sting,

    But Marx was not only a social scientist; he was a reformer. W. T. Jones

    Inexperienced writers often waste the final position. Consider, for instance, how much more effective is the revision of this statement:

    As the military power of Kafiristan increases, so too does the pride that Dravot has.

    REVISION: AS the military power of Kafiristan increases, so too does Dravot's pride.

    In topic sentences, finally, the closing position is often reserved for the idea the paragraph will develop (if it can be done without awkwardness). Here, for instance, is the opening sentence of a paragraph about Welsh Christianity:

    The third legacy of the Romans was Welsh Christianity. George Macaulay Trevelyan

    Isolation

    An isolated word or phrase is cut off by punctuation. It can occur anywhere in the sentence but is most common—and most éifebrigisniate or end, positions, as we have seen, emphatic in themselves:

    Leibnitz, it has sometimes been said, was the last man to know everything. Colin Cherry

    Children, curled in little balls, slept on straw scattered on wagon beds. Sherwood Anderson

    If the King notified his pleasure that a briefless lawyer should be made a judge or that a libertine baronet should be made a peer, the gravest counsellors, after a little murmuring, submitted.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Emphasis and Sentence Structure Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: "Leibnitz, it has sometimes been said, was the last man to know everything."\n- **Part A**: Identify the isolated phrase in the sentence and explain its function based on the text''s discussion of isolation.\n- **Part B**: Compare this sentence with the revision provided: "As the military power of Kafiristan increases, so too does Dravot''s pride." Explain how the placement of the subject and object affects emphasis according to the text''s advice on ending positions.\n- **Part C**: Using the example from the text about Welsh Christianity, construct a topic sentence where the closing position emphasizes the paragraph''s main idea. Ensure that your sentence is both grammatically correct and thematically focused.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must incorporate the concepts of emphasis, isolation, and topic sentences as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Reinforcement of Contrast Through Placement**\n\nExamine the statement: "We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was ''legal'' and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did was ''illegal.''"\n- **Part A**: Explain how the placement of the contrasting ideas (''legal'' vs. ''illegal'') reinforces the message according to the text''s discussion on emphasis at the end of sentences.\n- **Part B**: Create a similar sentence that emphasizes a contrast between two opposing actions or concepts. Use the closing position for the contrasted idea and apply the principles from the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on why the text advises against wasting the final position in inexperienced writers'' sentences. Provide an example of how proper emphasis can transform a weak sentence into a stronger one, using the Kafiristan revision as a model.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of contrast reinforcement and effective sentence structure based on the text.'

    And then, you will recall, he [Henry Thoreau] told of being present at the auction of a deacon's effects and of noticing, among the innumerable odds and ends representing the accumulation of a lifetime, a dried tapeworm. E. B. White

    It is also possible to use both ends of a sentence. See how neatly this sentence isolates and emphasizes the two key terms "position" and "difficult":

    The positionsstifave positions, other than upright—of the poet born in Wales or of Welsh parentage and writing his poems in English is today made by many people unnecessarily, and trivially, difficult. Dylan Thomas

    Isolating a word or phrase in the middle of the sentence is less common but by no means rare:

    1 was late for lédabstennexeusably so—and homework. Emily Brown

    Whether the isolated expression comes first, last, or in between, it must be set off by commas, dashes, or a colon. (As isolating marks, colons never go around words within a sentence; usually they precede something at the end, though they may also follow an initial word.) Generally, dashes mark a longer pause than commas and hence imply stronger stress: "thaaddetd yratit' emphasizes the adverb a little more than does "Suddenly, it began to rain." A colon before a closing term is stronger than a comma, but about the same as a dash.

    Isolation involves more, however, than just punctuating a word or phrase you wish to emphasize. The isolation must occur at a place allowed by the conventions of English grammar. In the following sentence "Harry" may properly be split from its verb and isolated by an intruding adverbial phrase:

    Harry, it was clear, was not the man for the job.

    But it would be un-English arbitrarily to place a comma between "Harry" and the verb:

    Harry, was not the man for the job.

    The emphasis gained by ssobatasis—dhlgen-
    eralerelodsan merely add strength to particular
    words: it conveys nuances of meaning. Suppose, for instance,
    that the sentence by Macaulay quoted above were to end like
    this:

    ... the gravest counsellors submitted, after a little murmuring.

    The words are the same and the grammar and the logic, but
    not the implications. Macaulay, while admitting that the
    counsellors of Charles II occasionally protested, stresses their
    submissiveness; the revision, while acknowledging that they
    submitted, makes their protest more important. In short, the
    two sentences evaluate the king's ministers differently.

    As one example of how isolation can endow a word
    with special meaning, read this sentence by Lewis Thomas:

    There was a quarter-page advertisement in The London Observer
    for a computer service that will enmesh your name in an electronic
    network of fifty thousand other names, sort out your tastes, prefer-
    ences, habits, and deepest desires and match them up with opposite
    numbers, and retrieve for you, within a matter of seconds, friends.

    Balance

    A balanced sentence (see pages 128 ff.) divides into roughly
    equal parts on either side of a central pause. Usually the pause
    is marked by a comma or other stop, though now and then
    it may be unpunctuated. The halves of a balanced sentence
    are often independent clauses, but sometimes one will be a
    dependent clause or even a long phrase. In any case, the two
    parts must be roughly the same in length and of comparable
    significance, although they need not be of the same gram-
    matical order.

    In balanced construction words are stressed by being po-
    sitioned so that they are played against one another:

    It is a sort of cold extravagance; and it has made him all his
    enemies. C. Chesterton

    He had a wife he could do nothing; he had a wife
    he did whatever she chose. Thomas Babington Macaulay

    Chesterton draws our attention to the connection between a
    "cold extravagance" and making "enemies." Macaulay, play-
    ing "do nothing" against "did whatever she chose," com-
    ments wryly on the freedom of the married man.

    Polysyndeton and Asyndeton

    Despite their formidable names, polysyndeton and asyndeton
    are nothing more than different ways of handling a list or
    series. Polysyndeton places a conjunction (and, or) after every
    term in the list (except, of course, the last). Asyndeton uses
    no conjunctions and separates the terms of the list with com-
    mas. Both differ from the conventional treatment of lists and
    series, which is to use only commas between all items except
    the last two, these being joined by a conjunction (with or

    without a cooptienald:

    CONVENTIONAL We stopped on the way to camp and bought
    supplies: bread, butter, cheese, hamburger, hot
    dogs, and beer.

    POLYSYNDETON We stopped on the way to camp and bought
    supplies: bread and butter and cheese and ham-
    burger and hot dogs and beer.

    ASYNDETON We stopped on the way to camp and bought
    supplies: bread, butter, cheese, hamburger, hot
    dogs, beer.

    The conventional treatment of a series emphasizes no par-
    ticular item, though the last may seem a little more important.
    In polysyndeton emphasis falls more evenly upon each mem-
    ber of the series, and also more heavily:

    I was bright and clean and polished. Alfred Kazin

    It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly dread, whenever
    the ialmas. Joan Didion

    In asyndeton too the series takes on more significance as a
    whole than it does in the conventional pattern. But the stress
    on each individual item is lighter than in polysyndeton, and
    the passage moves more quickly:

    His care, his food, his shelter, his education—all by-
    products of his parents' position. Margaret Mead

    Polysyndeton and asyndeton do not necessarily improve a
    series. Most of the time the usual treatment is more appro-
    priate. However, when I wish a different emphasis re-
    member that polysyndeton and asyndeton exist.

    Repetition

    In a strict sense, repetition is a matter more of diction than of
    sentence structure. But since it is one of the most valued
    means of emphasis we shall include it here.

    Repetition is sometimes a virtue and sometimes a fault.
    Drawing the line is not easy. It depends on what is being
    repeated. Important ideas can stand repetition; unimportant
    ones cannot. When you write the same word (or idea) twice,
    you draw the reader's attention to it. If it is a key idea, fine.
    But if not, then you have awkwardly implied importance to
    something that does not matter very much. In the following
    examples, of course, we are concerned with positive repeti-
    tion, involving major ideas.

    Repetition may take two basic forms: restating the same
    idea in different terms (called tautology by rhetori-
    cians) and repeating the same exact word (or a variant form
    of the same word).

    Tautologia
    In tautology the synonyms are frequently stronger than the
    original term:

    That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-
    dressing. Malcolm X

    A second term need not be strictly synonymous with the
    first, and often it is not. Rather than simply restating the idea,
    the new terms may add shades of meaning:

    October 7 began as a commonplace enough day, one of those days
    that sets the teeth on edge with its tedium, its small frustrations.
    Joan Didion

    One clings to chimeras, by which one can only be betrayed, and
    the entire Goye-+rtezlom dispppsiiisity —of

    James Baldwin

    In Ridsom's "frustrations" signifies a worse con-
    dition than "tedium," but the ideas relate to the extent that
    tedium may contribute to frustration. In Baldwin's, "possi-
    bility" implies a deeper despair.

    Now and then, a writer uses an expression just so he or she
    can replace it with another:
    (2) EMPHASIS 219

    That consistent stance, repeatedly adopted, must mean one of
    two—no, three—things. John Gardner

    Finally, repetition of an idea may involve simile or
    metaphor:

    It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sen-
    timental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hand
    som gakgpotenes. George Orwell

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Repetition in Rhetoric**\n\nUsing the definitions and examples provided in the text, explain how repetition serves as a rhetorical device for emphasizing key ideas.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two distinct types of repetition mentioned (e.g., tautology, restating in different terms).\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the example from Malcolm X: ''That''s camouflage, that''s trickery, that''s treachery, window-dressing.'' Justify why this is an instance of tautology and how it emphasizes the concept of deception.\n- **Step 3**: Compare and contrast restating in different terms (as seen in Joan Didion) with tautology. Explain which method is more effective for conveying complex ideas and why.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference both types of repetition and provide a clear analysis of their rhetorical functions.'

    [ImHenry] James nothing is forestalled, nothing is obvious; one is
    forever turning the curve of the unexpected. James Huneker

    The image contained in a simile or metaphor often both
    clarifies and emphasizes an idea by translating it into more
    concrete or familiar terms. Consider Orwell's sentence. (In-
    cidentally, he is paraphrasing a view he does not agree with;
    he believes that abuses of language should be struggled
    against.) We cannot see a "sentimental archaism" (we may
    not even know what one is). But, familiar with candles and
    electric light, we can understand that a preference for candles
    is somehow perverse. And Huneker, practicing the very qual-
    ity he praises in the novelist Henry James, startles us by the
    unexpectedness of his metaphor.

    Repeating the Same Word

    This is a very effective means of emphasis and susceptible to
    considerable variation. Greek and Roman rhetoricians distin-
    guished about two dozen varieties of verbal repetition, de-
    pending on the positions and forms of the repeated terms.
    For example, the words may begin successive clauses, or end
    them, or even end one and begin the next; the words may be
    repeated side by side, or three or four times, or in variant

    2. A simile is a literal comparison commonly introduced by like or as: Robert
    Burns's line "my love is like a red rose" contains a simile. A meta-

    phor is a literal identification, as if Burns had written "my luv is a red, red
    rose." Sometimes metaphors simply use the second term to mean the first:
    "my red, red rose"="my luv."

    forms. In ancient rhetoric each pattern had its own learned
    name. We needn't bother with those here. But you should
    realize that the patterns themselves are still very much in use.
    Nor are they used only by writers consciously imitating the
    classics. They are at home in the prose of men and women
    who belong to our world and have something to say about
    it. The patterns of repetition remain vital because we enjoy
    unusual and clever combinations. Here, then, are some ex-
    amples of skillful verbal repetition, which not only emphasize
    important words but also are interesting and entertaining in

    themselves:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Metaphor and Simile in Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the metaphor used in Henry James''s quote: "nothing is forestalled, nothing is obvious; one is forever turning the curve of the unexpected." \n- **Step 1**: Identify the literal and figurative meanings of the phrase ''turning the curve of the unexpected.'' \n- **Step 2**: Compare this metaphor to the simile in Robert Burns''s poem: "my love is like a red rose." Explain how both devices serve to clarify or emphasize an idea through concrete imagery.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the unexpectedness in James''s metaphor contributes to the overall theme of ambiguity and complexity in his work.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate both literary devices (metaphor and simile) and their function in textual analysis, without referencing external materials.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Verbal Repetition Patterns**\n\nExplain the effect of verbal repetition in the following sentences from the text: \n1. "The words may begin successive clauses, or end them, or even end one and begin the next; the words may be repeated side by side, or three or four times, or in variant forms." \n2. "Here, then, are some examples of skillful verbal repetition, which not only emphasize important words but also are interesting and entertaining in themselves."\n- **Part A**: Identify two different repetition patterns used in these sentences and explain their purpose. \n- **Part B**: Provide an original example of verbal repetition that demonstrates the same effect as the examples given in the text. Justify your choice based on the principles of rhetoric described in the reading.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical devices and their practical application in writing.'

But, familiar with candles and electric light, we can understand that a preference for candles is somehow perverse." \n- **Part A**: Explain how the simile in this sentence clarifies an abstract concept (sentimental archaism) using concrete imagery. \n- **Part B**: Use logical reasoning to argue why the preference for candles, as described in the simile, is considered ''perverse.'' Connect this to the broader idea that language should be struggled against, as mentioned by Orwell.\n- **Part C**: Construct a metaphor that illustrates a modern equivalent of ''sentimental archaism,'' using two familiar concepts and explaining how they relate to the original concept.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate literary devices with logical reasoning and demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between language, abstraction, and concrete imagery.'

    Mechanical Emphasis

    Mechanical emphasis consists of exclamation points and of printing or writing words in an unusual way. Italic type is probably the most common method of calling attention to a word or phrase. (In handwriting or typing, the equivalent to italics is a single underline.)

    It is so simple a fact and one that is so hard, apparently, to grasp:
    Whoever debases others is debasing himself. James Baldwin

    Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. It does not keep the country free. It does not settle the west. It does not educate.

    Ralph Waldo Emerson

    222 THE SENTENCE

    Other devices of mechanical emphasis include quotation marks, capital letters, boldface and other changes in the style or size of type, different colored links, wider spacing of words or letters, and Kegatronds-plaqphgases on separate lines. Advertisements reveal how well all these techniques work.

    In composition, however, they work less effectively. An experienced writer does not call upon exclamation points or underlining very often. They quickly lose their value, revealing that one does not know how to create emphasis and so has shouted.

    Certainly in the examples above the italics and the exclamation point are effective. But in each case the mechanical device merely strengthens an emphasis already attained by more compositional means. Baldwin's sentence puts the key idea last and carefully prepares its way with a colon. Thoreau draws our attention to "it" not only by using italics but by repeating the word at the beginning of three brief, emphatic sentences. And Emerson stresses "how often" more by isolating it than by the exclamation point.

    When things that we see or hear are repeated in identical or similar patterns the result is rhythm. In prose there are two patterns, both involving words, or more exactly the sounds of words. The most obvious is syllabic stress. Loud and soft syllables. Loud syllables are said to be stressed and for purposes of analysis are marked by /; soft syllables are unstressed and marked. Writers create syllabic rhythm by arranging stresses and nonstresses in more or less regular patterns, as in:

    x / x / x / x /

    A lucky few escaped the fire.

    The second pattern is rhythmic intonation. Intonation is a change in the pitch of the voice, a kind of melody important in speaking. Think, for example, of how many shades of meaning you can give to the words yes and no, not only by loudness and softness but by altering the rise and fall of your

    1. Distinguishing only two degrees of loudness and softness is arbitrary. In actual speech innumerable gradations exist. However, limiting the number to two is convenient. Sometimes an intermediate stage, called secondary stress, is distinguished and marked. The process of analyzing syllabic rhythm is called

    291§NTENCE THE

    rhythm based on intonation is created by repeating phrases or clauses of similar construction so that the same "melody" plays several times. Here is an instance from a poem by Alfred Tennyson:

    The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
    moans round with many voices.

    We hear this sentence as a three-part construction with an identical pattern of intonation in the first two clauses. The third repeats the melody in the fost words but varies it

    in the concluding phrase. Intonational rhythm coexists with syllabic. Thus Tennyson's lines also show an almost perfect alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables:

    xX / \ / xX / \ / xX /

    The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
    \ / x / xX xX

    Moans round with many voices.

    Finally a word of caution: there is an inevitable subjective element in rhythm, which is, after all, something we hear. Even sensitive, experienced readers do not all "hear" the same sentence in exactly the same way. We cannot say, however, that rhythm is purely a matter of perception, different for each one of us. Writers and unders do—regulate what their readers hear, not completely, but within fezky limits.

    Effective Rhythm

    Rhythm is effective when it pleases the ear. Even more important, good rhythm enters into what a sentence says, enhancing and reinforcing its meaning. A necessary condition of effective rhythm is that a passage be laid out in clear syntactic units (phrases, clauses, whole sentences); that these have something in common (length, intonation, grammatical structure); and that there be a loose but discernible pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. Generally the syntactic units, while showing some similarities, are very far from exactly the same. Nor are the syllables laid out in precisely repeated patterns. In this respect prose rhythm is much looser than that of traditional accented poetry, which has a much more predictable arrangement of stressed and unstressed syllables.
    Here are two examples of rhythm in prose:

    x x x i X x i i XX i XX x/ x x x i
    There was a magic, and a spell and a curse; but the magic has been

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Prose Rhythm Characteristics**\n\nAnalyze the rhythm of the two provided prose examples, identifying and explaining how they demonstrate effective rhythm as defined in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the syntactic units (phrases, clauses) in each example and note their similarities and variations.\n- **Step 2**: Examine the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in both examples, noting any discernible rhythms without relying on musical notation.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how these elements contribute to the meaning or tone of the text, referencing the text''s assertion that ''good rhythm enhances and reinforces its meaning.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the rhythmic patterns to the textual analysis and demonstrate understanding of the role of rhythm in prose.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhythm Theory to Creative Writing**\n\nWrite a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that demonstrates effective rhythm as discussed in the text. Your paragraph must include:\n- **At least two syntactic units with varying lengths but similar grammatical structures.\n- A pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables that creates a loose, discernible rhythm.\n- A clear thematic focus (e.g., nature, emotion, action) that is reinforced by the rhythm.\n**Task**: Explain how your paragraph meets the criteria for effective rhythm as outlined in the text, referencing specific elements like syntactic units, stress patterns, and their relationship to meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to apply theoretical concepts to original writing and articulate the connection between rhythm and textual meaning.'

    Dettfasis moves in carefully articulated parts: two
    primary clauses separated by the semicolon, and, within each
    of these, three secondary units marked by commas. Each of
    the six units has a similar pattern of stressed and unstressed
    syllables, a pattern regular enough to be sensed, yet not so
    relentless that it dominates the sentence, turning it into sing-
    song. In the passage by Hemingway the basic units are simple
    sentences. The syllabic rhythm is less obvious than in Duf-
    fus's case, partly because Hemingway's sentences are not fur-
    ther broken up and partly because the pattern of stresses and
    nonstresses is a bit more irregular.

    Awkward Rhythm

    Poor rhythm usually results from either or both of two
    causes: (1) the sentence is not organized so that phrases and
    clauses create a pattern out of which rhythm can evolve; (2)
    syllables are poorly grouped, being either so irregular that no
    pattern at all can be grasped, or so rapnelaevidly
    a steady, obtrusive beat overrides everything else.

    Consider this example of poor rhythm:

    Each party promises before the election to make the city bigger and
    better, but what happens after the election?

    There are two problems: first, the initial clause does not break
    into well-defined groups. This fault can be corrected by
    changing the position of the adverbial phrase, using it as a
    sentence opener or as an interrupter, and in either case punc-
    tuating it:

    Before the election, each party promises to make the city bigger
    and better... .

    Each party, before the election, promises to make the city bigger
    and better... .

    Now the clause is organized into potential rhythmic units.

    The second fault is that the writer has mixed a statement
    and a question in the same sentence. The different intonations
    clash, leaving the ear dissatisfied. It would be wiser to place
    the ideas in separate sentences:

    Before the election, each party promises to make the city bigger
    and better. But what happens after the election?

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhythm and Sentence Structure**\n\nAnalyze the two examples of poor rhythm provided in the text and explain how they fail to create a consistent rhythmic pattern.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two primary causes of poor rhythm mentioned in the passage (sentence organization and syllable grouping).\n- **Step 2**: Apply these principles to both examples, explaining how each example violates one or both causes.\n- **Step 3**: Suggest at least two revisions for the second example that would improve its rhythm based on the text''s recommendations.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the relationship between sentence structure and rhythmic flow as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhythm Principles to Literary Analysis**\n\nUsing the principles of rhythm discussed in the passage, evaluate the following excerpt from Hemingway''s writing: ''The sun was setting behind the mountains. The sky turned red and orange.''\n- **Part A**: Assess whether this excerpt exhibits a consistent rhythmic pattern based on the text''s description of Hemingway''s simple sentences.\n- **Part B**: Compare this with Duffus''s style, explaining how the syllabic rhythm in Duffus''s work differs from Hemingway''s.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the passage''s rhythm is effective or ineffective based on the text''s criteria for good rhythm.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must directly reference the text''s definitions of good and poor rhythm, including the role of phrase organization and syllable grouping.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhythm and Syntax**\n\nThe text discusses how awkward rhythm can result from mixing statements and questions in a sentence. Using this principle, construct an example of a well-structured sentence that avoids these issues.\n- **Part A**: Write a sentence that clearly separates the statement and question into distinct sentences.\n- **Part B**: Explain why your revised sentence is more effective in terms of rhythm and clarity based on the text''s guidelines.\n- **Part C**: Compare this with the original example from the text (''Each party promises... but what happens...'') and explain how your revision addresses the two faults identified in the passage.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how sentence structure directly impacts rhythmic flow as described in the text.'

    Other improvements might be made. For instance, shortening the question to "But what happens afterwards?" would make it less repetitious and more emphatic. But just as it stands, adding no words and taking none away, our revision shows that poor rhythm can often be improved simply by rearranging the words.

    Sometimes, however, mere rearrangement is not enough. Consider this case:

    (3) RHYTHM "7

    / x / x / /

    The man was standing on the sas and ‘tar ‘below we saw the boy, who
    xX /X x

    wore an old, unpressed, "and ragged suit.

    The sentence has one of the same difficulties as the first ex-
    ample: it needs to be divided more clearly (or at least its first
    two clauses do). But it also has a different problem: its syllabic
    rhythm is too regular. With one exception the sentence scans
    as a series of unvaried iambs." The regularity dominates the
    sentence, obscuring shadings of emphasis.

    If the iambic pattern is made less relentless the sentence
    sounds much better:

    xX / / X X X/ xf Xf X XT /

    The man stood on the stairs; far below we saw the boy, dressed in an
    / x / / x /

    old, unpressed, ragged suit.

    The changes—focusing on "standing" and
    "dressed" for "who wore," and replacing two "ands" with a
    semicolon and a uprttmaxebseake sameness of
    the syllabic beat. Yet they leave pattern enough to please the
    ear. Furthermore, the clustered stresses now focus the reader's
    attention upon key points:

    / xf x sw / / /
    man stood ... boy dressed . . old, unpressed, ragged suit

    Meaningful Rhythm

    Good rhythm enters into the meaning of the sentence, not
    only reinforcing the words but often giving them nuances
    they might not otherwise have.

    2. An iamb is a unit of two syllables, a nonstress and a stress, as in the word
    xX f x

    above. The one exception in the example is the four syllables "-ing
    x x /

    on the stairs."

    Mimetic means "imitative." Mimetic rhythm imitates the perception a sentence describes or the feeling or ideas it conveys:

    x / / x / / ix {x x x x / x f
    The tide reaches flood stage, slackens, hesitates, and begins to ebb.
    Rachel Carson

    The flowing tide is suggested by the very movement of this
    sentence, which runs smoothly and uninterruptedly to a mid-
    point, slows down, pauses (the commas), and then picks up
    and runs to its end. Here is a similar, somewhat longer, sen-
    tence about Niagara Falls:

    / x / x x f x f / x xf x x f x
    On the edge of disaster the river seems to gather herself, to pause, to
    x / xX xX x x
    i a head nobie in ruin, and then, with a slow grandeur, to ‘plunge into
    x x /
    the sternal thunder and white chaos below. Rupert Brooke

    Mimetic rhythm may also imply ideas more abstract than
    physical movement, as in this passage describing the life of
    peasants:

    x f x x f / x ¢ x f xX

    Black bread, rude root, dark night, laborious day, weary arm at sunset;
    / /
    and life ebbs away. John Ruskin

    The six unrelieved stresses at the beginning mirror the dreary
    monotony of the peasant's existence. Then nonstressed syl-
    lables become more numerous and the sentence picks up
    speed and runs to a close, just as life slips away (in Ruskin's
    view) from the peasant before he has held and savored it. ¢

    Metrical Runs

    A metrical run is a relatively regular pattern of stresses and
    nonstresses. This is, of course, a feature of traditional poetry,
    (3) RHYTHM 229

    but not common in prose. It is, as we have seen, a fault when
    it is not controlled. But used with restraint and skill, metrical
    runs are effective. Though not speanficafiy, like

    mimetic rhythms, they make a sentence memorable and in-
    tensify its mood and meaning:

    This is a story about love and death in the golden land, and begins with
    x / x
    the country. Joan Didion

    Smith and Didion achieve their metrical runs in part by using
    prepositional phrases. A typical prepositional phrase consists
    of a one- or two-syllable preposition, a noun marker /a, an,
    the, this, that, and so on), and an object of (usually) one or
    two syllables. Neither the preposition nor the marker is
    stressed, while the object (or one of its syllables) is, so that
    one of these metrical patterns is likely:

    xX /

    at home

    xX xX /

    in the house

    x x / X

    in the morning
    x x x f

    in the event

    Such metrical patterns (or "meters") are said to be rising
    since the stress comes at or near the end. By adding modifiers
    or doubling the objects of a preposition or stringing together
    several phrases, it is possible to sustain a rising pattern over
    the whole or a portion of a sentence:

    x xi X % / x x / /
    about love and death in the golden land

    Sometimes a metrical run occurs at the end of a sentence,
    bringing it neatly to a close:

    effect is subtly to draw our attention. Responding uncon-
    sciously to the rhythm, we feel that a sentence is important
    and we are more likely to remember it. Certainly a metrical
    run will not dogmefking silly, but it will help us to
    think about something important.

    Rhythmic Breaks

    One advantage of maintaining a fairly regular rhythm is that
    you can alter it for special effect:

    The roses have faded at Mabreditynthe frost.

    Amy Lowell

    There are four rising meters up to the comma, then an un-
    expected stress upon "nipped," which throws great weight
    upon that word, making it the center of the sentence. And it
    is a key word, for the sentence alludes to the sad story of
    Josephine, Napoleon's first wife, who was divorced by him
    for political reasons and who retired to her palatial home of
    Malmaison, famous for its roses.

    And look, finally, once again at the sentence by Logan

    The rising meters which run throughout most of the sentence
    abruptly change at the end to three clustered stresses, making
    the "far-off sea" the climax of the vision.

    Rhyme

    Rhyme is the repetition of sounds in positions close enough
    to be noticed. It is not an aspect of rhythm; even so we shall
    glance at it. We associate rhyme chiefly with poetry, espe-
    cially in the form of end chysimg-efhseiccessive or

    alternate lines with the same sound:

    The grave's a fine and private place,
    But none, think, do there embrace. Andrews Marvell

    Poetry also often uses inner shynts-wiepaating
    a line, as with the and i vowels and the p's of fitMarvell's
    line.

    Despite its association with poetry, rhyme occurs in prose,
    usually as inner rhyme (prose writers rarely end sentences or
    clauses with the same sound). Like rhythm, rhyme can affect
    the ear both pleasantly and unpleasantly, and it can enhance
    meaning.

    It seems unlikely that sounds have inherent, culture-free
    significance in themselves. Particular sounds may acquire
    loose meanings; for example, we seem to associate the ee
    sound with smallness (teeny, weeny). But psychologists who
    have studied this phenomenon think that such "meanings"
    are culturally conditioned and will vary from one group to
    another.

    Even if language sounds do not possess inherent universal
    meanings, the fact that within a particular culture
    certain sounds can evoke particular attitudes. Even here,

    232 THE SENTENCE

    however, one must be careful in talking about "meaning."
    Such meaning is broad and resists precise interpretation. In
    the following description by Mark Twain of a town on the
    Mississippi, the frequent / sounds, the sfs3 andtis,n's
    probably contribute to the sense of peace and quiet. Words like
    lull, lullaby, loll, slow, silent, ssh, shush, and hush have con-
    ditioned us to associate those sounds with quietness. But that
    is about all we can say.

    After all these years tan picture that old time to myself now, just
    as it was then: the white town drowsing in the sunshine of a sum-
    mers morning; the streets empty or pretty nearly so; one or two
    clerks sitting in front of the Water Street stores, with their splint-
    bottomed chairs tilted back against the walls, chins on breasts, hats
    slouched over their faces, sblagte—-shathngs enough

    loafing along the sidewalk, doing a good business in watermelon

    great Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling

    town, and the "point" below, bounding the river-glimpse and turn-
    ing it into a sort of sea, and withal a very still and brilliant and
    lonely one.

    If we do not insist upon interpreting their "meaning" too
    exactly, then, it is fair to say that sounds can convey or re-
    inforce certain moods.

    They may also contribute to meaning in another, less direct
    way. By rhyming key words, writers draw attention to them.
    Here, for instance, Virginia Woolf uses an image by re-
    peating s sounds and by the alliteration of the /'s and the c's:

    Dust swirls down the avenue, hisses and hurries like erected cobras
    round the corners.

    swept grasses and sinewy weeds waving away from a thin beach
    ever speckled with drift and decaying things—worm-ridden
    bers, dead porpoises. Lafcadio Hearn

    Yet prose rhyme is risky. Hearn succeeds, but the alliter-
    ation (and other rhyme) in these passages seems a bit much:

    Her eyes were full of proud and passionless lust after gold and
    blood; her hair, close and curled, seems ready to shudder in sunder

    Excesses like this have led some people to damn and blast all
    rhyme in prose. Undoubtedly a little goes a long way. But it
    does have a place. The trick is to keep the rhyme unobtrusive,
    so that it directs our responses without our being aware of its
    influence. Certain things should be avoided: obvious and jingling rhyme or inadvertent repetitions of sound that draw
    attention to unimportant words. More positively, rhyme
    pleases the ear and makes us more receptive to what the sentence says, as in this passage by John Donne (a seventeenth-century poet who also wrote great prose):

    One dieth at his filongth, being wholly at ease, and in quiet,
    and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eats with
    pleasure; but they lie down alike in the dust and the worm covers
    them.

    Thus rhyme's positive contribution in prose. It
    is less important, and less common, than rhythm, but it is far
    from negligible. Too great a concern with sound, too much
    "tone painting," is a fault in prose (in poetry too, for that
    matter). Controlled by a sensitive ear, however, the sounds
    of a sentence can enrich its meaning.

    Both of those passages consist chiefly of short, simple sentences. The first them poorly, the second effectively.

    Where does the difference lie? The first writer has not grasped the twin principles of recurrence and variety which govern sentence style. A professional author, understands them very well.

    Recurrence means repeating a basic sentence pattern. Variety means changing the pattern. Paradoxical as it sounds, good sentence style must do both. Enough sameness must appear in the sentences to make the writing seem all of a piece; enough difference to create interest.

    (4) VARIETY 235

    How much recurrence, how much variety depend on subject and purpose. For instance, when you repeat the same point or develop a series of parallel ideas, the similarity of subject justifies the similarity in structure. Thus Adams repeats the same pattern in his second through seventh sentences because they have much the same content, detailing the steps President Harding took to divert the scandal threatening his administration. Here the recurrent style evolves from the subject.

    In the other passage, however, the writer makes no such connection between style and subject, and so the recurrence seems awkward and monotonous. The ideas expressed in the separate sentences are not of the same order of value. For example, the fact that the theater is in Hartford is less important than that it shows foreign films. The sentence style, in other words, does not reinforce the writer's ideas; it obscures them.

    Nor has the writer offered any relief from his short, straightforward statements. Adams has. Moreover, Adams uses variety effectively to structure his paragraph, opening with a relatively long sentence, which, though grammatically simple, is complicated by the correlative But construction. And he closes the paragraph by beginning a sentence, for the first time, with something other than the subject.

    Adams's brief sentences work because the subject justifies them and because they are sufficiently varied. Lacking similar justification or relief, the four sentences of the first passage are ineffective. They could be improved easily:

    The Art Cinema, a movie theater in Hartford, specializes in foreign films. It is noted for the high quality of its films; in fact, many people consider them good art.

    There is still recurrence: in effect the passage consists of three
    similar short clauses plus an appositive. But now there is more
    variety. In the first sentence an appositive interrupts subject
    236 THE SENTENCE

    and verb; in the second there are two clauses instead of one,
    the latter opening with the phrase "in fact." Subordinating
    the information about Hartford also keeps the focus where it
    belongs, on the films.
    Of course, in composing a sentence that differs &thars,

    a writer is more concerned with emphasis than with variety.
    But if it is usually a by-product, variety is nonetheless im-
    portant, an essential condition of interesting, readable prose.
    Let us consider, then, a few ways in which variety may be
    attained.

    Changing Sentence Length and Pattern

    From the beginning she had known what she wanted, and pro-
    ceeded single-minded, with the force of a steam engine towards
    her goal. There was never a moment's doubt or regret. She wanted
    the East; and from the moment she set eyes on Richard Burton, with
    his dark Arabic face, his "questing panther eyes," he was, for her,
    that lodestar East, the embodiment of all her thoughts. Man and
    land were identified. Lesley Blanch

    It is not necessary, or even desirable, to maintain a strict
    alternation of long and short statements. You need only an
    occasional brief sentence to change the pace of predominately
    long ones, or a long sentence now and then in a passage com-
    posed chiefly of short ones:

    We took a hair-raising taxi ride into the city. The rush-hour traffic
    of Bombay is a iightmarertiotas in Tokyo; nor

    from exuberance, as in Rome; not from malice, as in Paris; it is a
    chaos rooted in years of practiced confusion, absentmindedness,
    selfishness, inertia, and an incomplete understanding of mechanics.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Emphasis**\n\nConsider the sentence: "From the beginning she had known what she wanted, and proceeded single-minded, with the force of a steam engine towards her goal."\n- **Part A**: Identify two different ways in which this sentence demonstrates emphasis, referencing specific elements like appositive placement or clause structure.\n- **Part B**: Compare the emphasis in this sentence to that in the sentence: "Dave Beck was hurt. Dave Beck was threatened when he was questioned and was forced off the executive board of the A&GL." Explain how the structure contributes to the reader''s interpretation of the events.\n- **Part C**: Justify why maintaining strict alternation between long and short sentences is not always necessary for effective writing, using examples from the text provided.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of emphasis and variety in sentence structure as presented in the reading.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Sentence Variety in Narrative Writing**\n\nExamine the passage: "We took a hair-raising taxi ride into the city. The rush-hour traffic of Bombay is a nightmare in Tokyo; nor from exuberance, as in Rome; not from malice, as in Paris; it is a chaos rooted in years of practiced confusion..."\n- **Part A**: Identify two different sentence lengths and structures used to create variety in this passage. Explain how these variations affect the reader''s understanding of the traffic situation.\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with the structure of the sentence: "Dave Beck was hurt. Dave Beck was threatened when he was questioned and was forced off the executive board of the A&GL." How does the repetition of subject ("Dave Beck") serve a specific purpose in terms of variety and emphasis?\n- **Part C**: Propose one alternative way to rewrite the first sentence of the passage without changing its meaning, using a different sentence structure that still maintains the original emphasis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how sentence length and structure contribute to narrative clarity and reader engagement.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Sentence Construction Principles**\n\nUsing the principles of sentence variety discussed in the text, construct a paragraph that describes a personal experience. The paragraph should:\n- **Include at least three different sentence structures** (e.g., simple, compound, complex)\n- **Demonstrate clear emphasis on key points** using appositives or clause placement\n- **Maintain a balance between long and short sentences** to create rhythm and flow\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must reflect the writing strategies outlined in the text, with explicit attention to how each sentence contributes to overall clarity and reader interest.'

    Sometimes variation in length can be used to emphasize a
    key idea. In the following passage the historian Herbert Buttenfrebd through two long sentences (the second a bit
    shorter than the first) strong short statement:

    The Whig historian is interested in discovering agency in history,
    even where in this way he must avow it only implicit. It is characteristic of his method that he should be interested in the agency
    rather than in the process. And this is how he achieves his
    simplification.

    Fragments

    Fragments, usually a special kind of short sentence, make for
    effective tarsatiand-easy to use (italics highlight the fragments in the next examples):

    Sam steals like this because he is a thief. Not a big thief. He tried
    to be a big thief once and everybody got mad at him and made
    him go away to jail. He is strictly a small thief, and he only steals
    for his restaurant. Jimmy Breslin

    Examinations tend to make me merry, often seeming to me to be

    by professors and the institution. invariably become facetious in
    all the critical hours. All that solemnity for a few facts! touldn't
    believe they were serious. hever quite understood it.

    Mary Caroline Richards

    Used with restraint, fragments like these are a simple way to
    vary your sentences. They are, however, more at home in a
    colloquial style than in a formal one.

    Rhetorical Questions

    Like fragments or any other kind of unusual sentence, rhetorical questions are rarely used for variety alone. Their
    primary purpose is to emphasize a point or to set up a topic
    for discussion. Still, whenever they are employed for such
    ends, they are also a source of variety:

    But Tonbeteubjerantone must say something—
    what must one say about Toronto? What can one? What has any-
    body ever said? It is impossible to give it anything but commendation. if not squalid like Birmingham, or cramped Caltken,

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Purpose**\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical question: "What must one say about Toronto? What can one?" From the text provided, explain how this rhetorical question serves both to emphasize a point and introduce variety in sentence structure.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary purpose of the rhetorical question based on the text''s explanation of its function.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the variation in sentence length (long vs. short) contributes to the overall effect.\n- **Step 3**: Relate this to the text''s assertion that rhetorical questions are used not just for variety but to emphasize a point or set up discussion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the rhetorical question''s structure and function to the text''s explanation of its use in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Fragment Usage in Style**\n\nConsider the passage: "Sam steals like this because he is a thief. Not a big thief." From the text, explain how the use of fragments contributes to the tone and style of the passage.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the effect of using short, fragmented sentences in this context.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this to the text''s statement that fragments are more at home in a colloquial style than a formal one.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author might choose this stylistic choice despite its informal nature.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how fragment usage affects tone and align with the text''s perspective on formality.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Devices**\n\nThe text states that rhetorical questions are rarely used for variety alone; their primary purpose is to emphasize a point or set up discussion. Using this principle, analyze the following passage: "But Tonbeteubjerantone must say something—what must one say about Toronto?"\n- **Part A**: Explain how the rhetorical question serves to emphasize a specific point in the text.\n- **Part B**: Identify the logical structure of the sentence that supports this function.\n- **Part C**: Contrast this with the use of fragments in the Sam steals passage, explaining how each device serves different purposes in writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of rhetorical questions and fragments, demonstrating an understanding of their distinct functions in communication.'

    Varied Openings

    Monotony especially threatens when sentence after sentence
    begins the same way. It is easy to open with something other
    than the usual subject and verb: a prepositional phrase; an
    adverbial clause; a connective like therefore or an adverb like
    naturally, or, immediately following the subject and splitting
    it from the verb, a nonrestrictive adjectival construction. Take
    a look at this passage:

    In the first decade of the new century, the South remained primarily
    rural; the beginnings of change, in those years, hardly affected the
    lot of the Negro. The agricultural system had never recovered fully
    from the destruction of the old plantation economy. Bound to the
    production of stafites+tobacod, suf- sugar—the

    fered from erosion and neglect. Those who cultivated it depended
    at best upon the uncertain returns of fluctuating world markets. But
    the circumstances under which labor was organized, particularly
    Negro labor, added to those difficulties further hardships of human
    Creation. Oscar Handlin

    Handlin's five sentences show considerable variety in their
    openings: a prepositional phrase, a subject, a participial
    phrase, a subject, and a connective word.

    To say that a word has meaning is to say that it has purpose.
    The purpose may be to signify something—that is, to an object or person other than the writer, to an abstract conception such as "democracy," or to a thought or feeling in the writer's mind. On the other hand, the purpose may be to induce a particular response in the readers' minds or to establish an appropriate relationship between the writer and those readers. We shall consider each of these three uses of words; we shall call them.

    Before we do that, however, we need to glance at several misconceptions about words and also at two aspects of meaning fundamental to all the purposes for which words may be used. These aspects concern denotative and connotative meaning and the various levels of usage.

    First the misconceptions.

    Words Are Not Endowed with Fixed and "Proper" Meanings

    When people object to how someone else uses a word, they often say, "That isn't its proper meaning." The word disinterested, for example, is frequently employed in the sense of "uninterested." If someone dislikes this usage, they argue that the proper meaning of disinterested is "objective, unbiased."

    In such arguments, "proper meaning" generally signifies meaning sanctioned by past usage or even by the original, etymological sense of the word. But the dogma that words come to us out of the past with proper meanings—fixed, immutable, and only meanings a word has are those that the speakers of the language choose to give it. If enough speakers of English use disinterested to mean "uninterested," then by definition, that is the meaning given to the word.

    Those who take a conservative attitude toward language have the right, even the duty, to resist changes which they feel lessen the efficiency of English. They should, however, base their resistance upon demonstrating why the change does make for inefficiency, not upon an authoritarian claim that it violates proper meaning.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Purpose and Meaning in Language**\n\nUsing the text''s definition of purpose, explain how a word like ''disinterested'' can have multiple meanings while still being considered correct.\n- **Step 1**: Define the two primary purposes for using words according to the text (signifying something and inducing a response).\n- **Step 2**: Apply this framework to discuss how ''disinterested'' may be used in different contexts to signify different things (e.g., objective vs. uninterested) while fulfilling its purpose of conveying meaning or prompting a reaction.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text argues that ''proper meaning'' is not fixed, and explain how this aligns with the idea that words are tools for communication rather than rigid definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must explicitly connect the concepts of purpose and meaning to the example of ''disinterested'' and demonstrate an understanding of the text''s stance on word flexibility.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Denotative and Connotative Meaning**\n\nConsider the word ''home.''\n- **Part A**: List two denotations (literal meanings) of ''home'' based on the text''s discussion of denotative meaning.\n- **Part B**: Identify two connotations (associated meanings) that ''home'' might carry, referencing the text''s explanation of connotative meaning.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text differentiates between these two types of meaning and why this distinction is important for understanding a word''s purpose in communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define denotative and connotative meanings, provide specific examples from the text, and explain their relevance to the broader discussion of word usage.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Language Change**\n\nThe text argues that ''proper meaning'' is not fixed and that language evolves. Consider the example of the word ''disinterested.''\n- **Part A**: Using the text''s perspective, explain why a conservative speaker might argue that changing the meaning of ''disinterested'' to mean ''uninterested'' is incorrect.\n- **Part B**: Counter this argument by referencing the text''s claim that ''proper meaning'' is determined by usage. Provide an example from everyday language that illustrates how words can change meanings over time.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the text''s statement: ''To say that a word has meaning is to say that it has purpose.'' How does this relate to the idea that language is dynamic and constantly evolving?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s arguments about language change, demonstrate understanding of the role of usage in defining meaning, and connect these ideas to the broader concept of purpose in word usage.'

    As a user of words you should be guided by consensus,
    that is, the meanings agreed upon by your fellow speakers of
    English, the meanings recorded in dictionaries. We shall look
    at what dictionaries do in Chapter 29. For now, simply un-
    derstand that dictionary definitions are not "proper mean-
    ings" but succinct statements of consensual meanings.

    In most cases the consensus emerges from an activity in
    which individual language users participate without knowing
    that they are, in effect, defining words. The person who says
    "I was disinterested in the lecture" does not intend to alter
    the meaning of disinterested. He or she has simply heard the
    word used this way before. In a few cases people do act de-
    liberately to establish a consensual meaning, as when mathe-
    maticians agree that the word googol will mean "10 raised to
    the 100th power." In any case, meaning is what the group
    consents to. This is the only "proper meaning" words have,
    and any subsequent generation may consent to alter a
    consensus.

    But while the unconscious agreement which establishes the
    meaning of a word is a group activity, it originates with in-
    dividuals. Particular speakers began using disinterested in the
    sense of "uninterested" or square in the sense of "extremely
    conventional and unsophisticated." From the usage of indi-
    vidual people the change spreads through the group—for
    ter or worse.

    By such a process word meanings change, sometimes rap-
    idly, sometimes glacially. Often the change occurs as a re-
    sponse to historical events. When the eighteenth-century
    historian Edward Gibbon writes of "the constitution of a Ro-
    man legion" he means how it was organized, not, as a modern
    reader might suppose, a written document defining that or-
    ganization. The latter sense became common only after the
    late eighteenth century, with the spread of democratic revo-
    lutions and the formal writing down of a new government's
    principles.

    Because words must constantly be adapted to a changing
    world, no neat one-to-one correspondence exists between
    words and meanings. On the contrary, the relationship is
    messy: a single word may have half a dozen meanings or
    more, while several words may designate the same concept or
    entity. Thus depression means one thing to a psychologist,
    another to an economist, and another still to a geologist. But
    psychological "depression" may also be conveyed by mel-
    ancholia, the blues, or the dismals, in the dumps, low, and so
    on.

    One-to-one correspondences do in fact exist in the highly
    specialized languages of science and technology and mathe-
    matics. To a chemist sodium chloride means only the com-
    pound that compound is always designated in
    words by sodium chloride. The common term salt, in contrast,
    has a number of meanings, and we must depend on the con-
    text (that is, the words around it) to clarify which sense the
    writer intends:

    Pass the salt.
    She's the salt of the earth.
    They're not worth their salt.
    He's a typical old salt.
    Her wit has considerable salt.
    The crooks intended to sa/t the mine.
    They are going to sa/t away all the cash they can.

    But while one-to-one correspondences might seem desirable,
    having a distinct word for every conceivable object and idea
    and feeling would not be practical. The vocabulary would
    swell to unmanageable proportions. And probably we would
    like it less than we suppose. The inexact correspondence of
    words and meanings opens up possibilities of conveying sub-
    tleties of thought and feeling which an exactly defined vocab-
    ulary would exclude. The fact that sodium chloride means one
    thing and only one thing is both a virtue and a limitation. The
    fact that salt means many things is both a problem and an
    opportunity.

    Words, then, are far from being tokens of fixed and per-
    manent value. They are like living things, complex, many-
    sided, and responsive to pressures from their environment.
    They must be handled with care.

    Denotation and Connotation

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Semantic Flexibility**\n\nGiven the text''s discussion on the multiple meanings of words, explain why a single word like ''depression'' can have different connotations depending on context. Use examples from the text (e.g., psychology, economics, geology) to illustrate how the same term is used differently in specialized fields.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least three distinct contexts where ''depression'' is defined.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast the connotations of ''depression'' in each context using the text''s emphasis on semantic flexibility.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this semantic variability is both a limitation and an opportunity, as per the author''s argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s examples and explicitly address the duality of word meanings as presented in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Ambiguity in Common Terms**\n\nThe text uses ''salt'' as an example of a common term with multiple meanings. Using the provided examples, explain why the word ''salt'' is ambiguous and how context determines its meaning.\n- **Part A**: List at least five different definitions of ''salt'' from the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the surrounding words (context) in each example clarifies the intended meaning. Use specific examples from the text such as ''Pass the salt.'' or ''She''s the salt of the earth.''\n- **Part C**: Discuss the trade-off between having precise definitions and maintaining flexibility in language, as the author describes in the passage.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s examples and explicitly address the balance between specificity and ambiguity in vocabulary.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Word Classification**\n\nThe text distinguishes between denotation and connotation. Consider the word ''salt'' and its various meanings.\n- **Part A**: Define ''denotation'' and ''connotation'' using the text''s explanation.\n- **Part B**: For each of the five definitions of ''salt'', determine whether the connotation is positive, negative, or neutral. Explain your reasoning based on the text''s examples.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why the flexibility of word meanings (as discussed in the passage) is essential for effective communication, using at least two examples from the text to support your claim.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s definitions and examples, ensuring that all reasoning is grounded in the provided material.'

    Denotation and connotation are aspects of a word's meaning, related but distinct. Denotation is a word's primary, specific sense, as the denotation of red is the color (or, from the viewpoint of physics, light of a certain wavelength). Connotation is the secondary meaning (or meanings), associated with but different from the denotation. Red, for instance, has several connotations: "socialist," "anger," and "danger," among others.

    Using a circle to represent a word, we may show the denotation as the core meaning and the connotation as
    fringe meanings gathered about that core. The line enclosing the denotation (D in the diagram) is solid to signify that this meaning is relatively fixed. The line around the connotation (C) is broken to suggest that the connotative meanings of a word are less firm, more open to change and addition.

    Connotations may evolve naturally from the denotation of a word, or they may develop by chance associations. Rose connotes "fragrant," "beautiful," "short-lived" because the qualities natural to the flower have been incorporated into the word. On the other hand, that red connotes "socialist" is accidental, the chance result of early European socialists' using a red flag as their banner.

    Red

    C: anger

    Sometimes a connotative meaning splits off and becomes a second denotation, the nucleus, in effect, of another word configuration. Thus "socialist" has become a new primary meaning of red when used as a political term. Around this second nucleus other connotations have gathered, such as (for most Americans) "subversive," "un-American," "traitorous," and so on:

    two quite different connotations, that have gathered about the
    nucleus: (1) "valuable, worthy of honor and emulation" and
    (2) "foolish, ridiculous, out-of-date; to be avoided." With
    such words the large outer, or connotative, circle is signifi-
    cant; the nucleus small and insignificant.

    For many words denotation and connotation are both im-
    portant aspects of meaning. Rose (in the sense of the flower)
    has a precise botanical denotation: "any of a genus (Rosa of
    the family Rosaceae, the rose family) of usu[ally] prickly
    shrubs with pinnate leaves and showy flowers having five pet-
    als in the wild state but being often double or semidouble un-
    der cultivation." At the same time rose also has strong conno-
    tations: "beautiful," "fragrant," "short-lived," and so on.

    Context

    The denotation of any word is easy to learn: you need only
    look in a suitable dictionary. Understanding connotations,
    however, is more difficult. Dictionaries cannot afford the
    space to treat them, except in a very few cases. You can gain
    practical knowledge of a word's range of connotation only
    by becoming familiar with the contexts in which the word is
    used.

    Context means the surroundings of a word. In a narrow
    sense, context is the other terms in the phrase, clause, sen-
    tence and an immediate linguistic environment. More
    broadly, context comprises all the other words in the passage,
    even the entire essay or book. It widens further to include a
    composition's relation to other works, why it was written,
    and so on. In speech, context in this inclusive sense involves
    the occasion of a conversation, the relationship between the
    talkers, even others who may be listening.

    But one does not have to explore all the ramifications of
    context to get at a word's connotation. Usually the terms im-
    mediately around it supply the vital clue. Real old-fashioned

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Connotation and Denotation in Literary Contexts**\n\nConsider the word ''rose'' as analyzed in the text. Using your understanding of denotation and connotation, construct a paragraph that describes a scene where the word ''rose'' is used in a literary context to convey both its literal meaning and its implied associations.\n- **Step 1**: Define the denotative meaning of ''rose'' using the provided definition from the text.\n- **Step 2**: Identify at least three connotative meanings of ''rose'' as listed in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Create a vivid, original scene where the word is used to evoke both literal and figurative meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must integrate both denotative and connotative aspects, and you must explicitly reference at least two of the connotations listed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Contextual Connotation in a Literary Passage**\n\nThe text states that ''context means the surroundings of a word.'' Using this definition, analyze how the surrounding words in the following passage might influence the connotation of ''rose'':\n\n"In the garden, the rose bush was a symbol of love and beauty. Its crimson petals, though fragile, held a timeless allure."\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two words that immediately surround ''rose'' in the passage.\n- **Step 2**: Determine how these surrounding words contribute to the connotation of ''rose'' in this context.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this connotation with the connotations of ''rose'' in a different context, such as a medical report or a historical document.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must demonstrate an understanding of how context shapes meaning and explicitly connect your interpretation to the text''s explanation of context.'

    new experience in an ad for men's cologne evokes the opposite

    word, revealing certain of its connotations, concealing others.
    Thus {fdal'flavor" mask the unfavorable connotation
    of old-fashioned, leaving us aware only of the positive one.

    Not only does the linguistic context serve both to reveal
    and to hide certain of a word's connotations. It may also ac-
    tivate latent implications that ordinarily are not associated
    with a word. The meaning "rich in taste," for instance, is not
    one we customarily associate with old-fashioned. Yet in real

    Context also helps you determine whether a word is func-
    tioning primarily in its denotative or connotative sense. With
    words like rose that carry both kinds of meaning, only con-
    text reveals which is operating, or if both are in varying de-
    grees. Clearly this sentence calls upon only the denotation of
    rose.

    Our wakiveoses have, in spite of their great variety, contrib-
    uted little to the development of our garden roses.

    But when the poet Robert Burns tells of his feelings for a
    young lady, while still denoting the flower, he uses the word
    primarily for its connotations:

    In choosing words, then, you must pay attention both to denotative and to connotative meaning. With a purely denotative word like szasv@je problem is simple. If you make a mistake with such a word, it is simply because you do not know what it means and had better consult a dictionary (or textbook). But when words must be chosen with an eye to their connotations, the problem is more difficult. Connotative meaning is more diffuse, less readily looked up in a reference book, more subtly dependent on context. Here mistakes are easier to make. For instance, if you want readers to like a character you are describing, it would be unwise to write "a fat man with a red face," even though the words are literally accurate. Fat and red are negatively charged in such a context. More positive would be "a stout [or plump] man with rosy cheeks."

    Levels of Usage

    Levels of usage refers to the kind of situation in which a word is normally used. Most words suit all occasions. Some, however, are restricted to formal, literary contexts, and others to informal, colloquial ones. Consider three verbs which roughly mean the same thing: exacerbate, annoy, bug. Talking among your friends, you would not be likely to say, "That person really exacerbated me." On the other hand, describing a historical episode you wouldn't (or shouldn't) write, "The Spartan demands bugged the Athenians." But you could use annoy on both occasions, without arousing derision in either friends or readers of your work.

    The three words differ considerably in their levels of usage. Exacerbate is a literary word, appropriate to formal occasions. Bug (in this sense) is a colloquial, even slang, term appropriate to speech and very informal writing. Annoy is an all-purpose word, suitable for any occasion. When in the next chapter we discuss the practical problem of appropriateness, we shall use the labels formal, amfbryeudyal to distinguish these broad levels of usage.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.

Explain how these connotations might influence readers'' perceptions of the character.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence using synonyms that carry more positive connotations. Justify your choice of words based on their denotative and connotative meanings.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the importance of selecting appropriate vocabulary in different contexts, referencing the levels of usage discussed in the text. Provide an example where using a ''colloquial'' word in a formal context would be inappropriate.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of both connotative and denotative meanings, as well as the appropriate use of language based on level of formality.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Levels of Usage in Verbal Communication**\n\nChoose three verbs that have similar meanings but different levels of usage. For each verb, provide an example sentence that illustrates its appropriate context.\n- **Part A**: Select a formal, informal, and neutral-level verb.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the selected verbs are appropriate for their respective contexts. Reference the text''s discussion on the distinction between literary and colloquial terms.\n- **Part C**: Create a scenario where using the wrong level of usage could lead to misunderstandings or negative reactions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly differentiate the levels of usage for each verb and provide real-world examples that reflect their appropriate applications.'

Justify your choices based on their denotative and connotative meanings.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how understanding levels of usage is essential for effective communication in both formal and informal settings. Provide an example where misusing a word''s level of formality could lead to unintended consequences.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of connotation, denotation, and levels of usage to demonstrate comprehensive understanding of language application.'

- prompt: |-
    From the more theoretical viewpoint we are taking here,
    we may think of level of usage as a peripheral part of a word's
    connotation. As with connotation in general, it is not easy to
    look up the level of usage of any particular word. Dictionaries
    label an occasional term "colloquial" or "slang," but not in
    every case; and they do not label formal words like exacerbate
    at all. You have to depend on your own knowledge as a guide.

    In recent years the line between formal and informal usage
    has blurred considerably (though not enough for Spartans to
    bug Athenians). The distinction still exists, however, and
    careful writers pay attention to it.

    Finally, we shall discuss the point with which we began—the
    purpose a word is chosen to serve. This aspect we shall call
    the "telic mode" of meaning, from the Greek word telos,
    meaning "end," and the Latin modus, meaning "manner."
    Though the phrase sounds forbidding, it is a useful brief label
    for an obvious but important fact: that part of a word's mean-
    ing is the purpose it is expected to fulfill, and that words may
    serve different purposes.

    To get a bit further into this matter it will help to look at
    a well-known diagram called the "communication triangle":

    The diagram simply clarifies the fact that any act of com-
    munication involves three things: someone who communi-
    cates (for our purposes, a writer); something the communi-
    cation is about (the topic); and someone to whom the
    communication is made (the reader). The broken lines joining-
    these elements indicate an indirect relationship between
    them.

    It is indirect because it must be mediated by words. Di-
    rectly, each corner of the triangle connects only to words. The
    writer selects them, the reader interprets them, and the topic
    is expressed by them. Words thus occupy a central, essential,
    mediating position in the triangle:

    In selecting his or her words, a writer may be concerned primarily with any of the three areas of the triangle: writer-topic, writer-reader, or writer-peaker. These correspond to the three functions of meaning. We shall call them respectively: "referential," "interpersonal," and "directive."

    WRITER READER,

    The Referential Mode

    Referential meaning connects writer and topic. In this mode the writer chooses words for exactness and economy with which they signify, or refer to, what he or she observes, knows, thinks, sees—that is in his or her mind.

    Most writing involves chiefly this mode of meaning. Here are three examples:

    MEANING 255

    Mary [Queen of Scots] had returned to Scotland in 1561, a widow of nineteen, after an absence of thirteen years in France. ... D. Harris Wilson

    The principle of verification is supposed to furnish a criterion by which it can be determined whether or not a sentence is literally true. ... A. J. Ayer

    Calculus is a lousy subject. Student

    In all these cases the writers select words for their referential value, to make clear what is in their minds. The historian, aiming to be factually accurate, and the philosopher, aiming to be conceptually exact, chose diction on the basis of denotation: "in 1561," "a young widow of nineteen," "verification." The student, expressing how he feels, selects "lousy" for its connotation; and while it would be more difficult to unravel all the implications of "lousy" than to explain the meanings of "widow" or "criterion," the word is exactly right.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Referential Meaning in Historical Context**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''Mary [Queen of Scots] had returned to Scotland in 1561, a widow of nineteen, after an absence of thirteen years in France.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the referential purpose of this sentence. What specific information is being conveyed about Mary''s life events?\n- **Step 2**: Compare the use of ''widow'' and ''nineteen'' to the use of ''in 1561'' and ''thirteen years.'' How do these words contribute to the referential accuracy of the statement?\n- **Step 3**: Based on the text, explain why precise denotative language is essential in historical writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of referential meaning as defined in the text and its application to historical narrative.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Interpersonal Meaning in Personal Expression**\n\nExamine the sentence: ''Calculus is a lousy subject.''\n- **Step 1**: Determine the interpersonal function of this statement. What emotional or attitudinal message does the speaker convey through their choice of word?\n- **Step 2**: Compare the connotation of ''lousy'' to the denotation of ''difficult'' or ''challenging.'' How does this affect the interpersonal meaning?\n- **Step 3**: Using the text, explain how the selection of words for connotative value can shape the relationship between writer and reader in personal writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of denotation and connotation as discussed in the text and their impact on interpersonal meaning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Directive Meaning in Persuasive Writing**\n\nThe sentence: ''The principle of verification is supposed to furnish a criterion by which it can be determined whether or not a sentence is literally true.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the directive function of this statement. What action or clarification does the writer intend for the reader to perform?\n- **Step 2**: Compare the use of ''supposed'' and ''furnish'' in terms of their directive intent. How do these words influence the reader''s understanding of the principle?\n- **Step 3**: Based on the text, explain how directive meaning can be used to clarify complex ideas in academic writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of directive meaning as defined in the text and its application to philosophical or academic discourse.'

- prompt: |-
    In each case, of course, the diction will affect readers' attitudes toward both subject and writer, and to that degree the words will operate in the interpretive and interpersonal modes. Ayer's abstract diction may well bore people interested in philosophy, for instance. A mathematician, depending on his sense of humor, might be amused or annoyed by the student's characterization of calculus. But although such spillover effects are very real, the fact remains that in all these examples the diction aims at referential accuracy and operates primarily in that mode of meaning.

    The Interpersonal Mode

    We choose words chiefly for their referential meanings. Those words, however, will also affect the link between readers and you. It follows that you should select even referential diction with an eye on the reader. You must consider what readers know and do not know, how they resemble you and how they differ, what degree of formality or informality you wish to establish with them. Such considerations may lead you, for example, to look for an easier word even though it is a bit less exact than a technical term.

    But beyond showing a general concern for readers in choosing the words with which you discuss your topic, you may also wish occasionally to include words that will directly affect the attitudes toward you. Now you are in the interpersonal mode of meaning.

    First, certain expressions create a favorable image of yourself. Inevitably you exist in your words whether to or not, a hidden voice of which readers are aware, sometimes dimly, sometimes with acute consciousness, and which we call the persona (see page 58). Since a persona is inevitable, you had better strive for an attractive one. Modesty, for instance, is generally a virtue in a writer. An occasional expression like I think, it seems to me, to my mind suggests to readers that here is a modest writer, undogmatic, aware of his or her fallibility. The following passages illustrate such interpersonal diction (the italics are added):

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Diction and Referential Meaning**\n\nUsing the concept of referential accuracy and interpersonal diction from the reading, analyze how the choice of words in the following sentence affects both the message and the reader''s perception: "I think that this argument is sound."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the referential meaning of the phrase ''I think.''\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the use of ''I think'' contributes to the writer''s persona.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the balance between accuracy and the reader''s perception of the writer''s confidence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both referential meaning and interpersonal effects, demonstrating an understanding of how diction shapes communication.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Interpersonal Diction in Academic Writing**\n\nConsider the two sentences below:\n1. "This theory is a well-established fact."\n2. "This theory has been widely accepted by experts in the field."\n- **Part A**: Analyze how each sentence reflects different interpersonal strategies.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the referential meanings of both sentences.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate which sentence would be more effective for a formal academic audience, explaining your reasoning based on the text''s discussion of diction and reader expectations.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how interpersonal diction influences reader perception while maintaining referential accuracy.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Use of Diction for Persona Development**\n\nConstruct a paragraph in which you express your opinion on a topic, using diction that reflects both referential accuracy and an attractive persona. The topic can be any subject related to academic writing.\n- **Part A**: Identify at least two words or phrases that serve as expressions of modesty (e.g., ''I think,'' ''it seems to me'').\n- **Part B**: Justify how the chosen diction contributes to the reader''s perception of your confidence and openness to critique.\n- **Part C**: Ensure that the paragraph is logically structured and uses referential meaning to support your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to balance interpersonal effectiveness with precise communication, as outlined in the text.'

    sentence they may well draw too much attention and annoy the reader. Still, occasionally acknowledging your limitations is one way of creating a favorable impression upon readers. Beyond suggesting a déffabenttive persona, you

    can also use words in the interpersonal mode which graciously acknowledge your readers' presence. Without being insincere or obsequious you can draw readers into your exposition so that they seem to share more directly in your ideas and feelings. The judicious use of we, our, us, for instance, implies a common ground of knowledge and values, subtly flattering to readers (again, in the examples that follow italics are added):

    Let us define a plot. E. M. Forster

    No doubt, if one has more than one self (like most of us), it had better be one's better self that one tries to become. F. L. Lucas

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Personal and Interpersonal Language Use**\n\nUsing the text, explain how the use of personal pronouns like ''I'', ''my'', and ''me'' can be both a strength and a weakness in academic writing. Provide two examples from the text that demonstrate this duality.\n- **Example 1**: Reference the quote by F. L. Lucas: "Even when modesty is called for and a personal point of view is possible, a few I thinks and in my opinions go a long way." Explain how this reflects the strength of using ''I'' in certain contexts.\n- **Example 2**: Cite the text''s assertion that "Such personal disclaimers are not always a virtue. At times modesty may strike a note that is weak or false." Justify how overuse of ''my'' can weaken an argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both examples and explicitly address the balance between asserting individuality and maintaining academic objectivity as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Interpersonal Modes in Expository Writing**\n\nThe text suggests that using ''we'', ''our'', and ''us'' can create a shared perspective with readers. Construct an argumentative paragraph (3-4 sentences) that uses these words to engage the reader while maintaining academic credibility.\n- **Step 1**: Begin by stating a clear thesis about the importance of interpersonal language in writing.\n- **Step 2**: Use ''we'' or ''our'' to introduce your position and acknowledge the reader''s perspective.\n- **Step 3**: Incorporate ''us'' to emphasize collective responsibility or shared understanding.\n- **Step 4**: Conclude with a call to action that uses ''we'' to reinforce unity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be coherent, use the specified pronouns effectively, and demonstrate an understanding of how they contribute to reader engagement without compromising academic tone.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Personal Pronoun Use in Literature**\n\nThe text contrasts ''I'' with ''we'' in discussing personal and impersonal viewpoints. Analyze a passage from the provided excerpts that uses either ''I'' or ''we'' and explain how its choice affects the author''s intent.\n- **Part A**: Select one quote (e.g., "Let us define a plot.") and discuss the effect of using ''us'' in this context.\n- **Part B**: Compare this with a quote that uses ''I'' (e.g., "No doubt, if one has more than one self..."), explaining how the personal pronoun reflects the author''s intent.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the text supports the idea that ''we'' is a more effective tool for academic writing than ''I''. Justify your answer with references to the text''s discussion on modesty and reader engagement.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must be thorough, drawing directly from the provided quotes and the text''s arguments about personal vs. impersonal language in writing.'

    Any words, then, that refer to the writer in the role of
    writer or to the reader in the role of reader operate in the
    interpersonal mode of meaning. To the degree that such
    words create an attractive image of the former and graciously
    acknowledge the latter, they will add to the effectiveness of
    any piece of writing. In exposition, however, such diction,
    while important, necessarily remains infrequent.

    The Directive Mode of Meaning

    The last of the three modes of meaning relates to the reader-
    topic side of the communication triangle. Here you select
    words primarily for their value in assisting readers to under-
    stand or feel about the topic. Understanding and feeling are
    quite different responses: the former function of intelligence,
    the other of emotion. Words concerned with facilitating
    understanding we shall call constructive diction—tended to evoke emotion, emotive diction.

    Constructive diction includes the various connectives and
    signposts which clarify the organization of a composition and
    the flow of its ideas: however, even so, on the other hand, for
    example, in the next chapter, and so on. While such words
    and phrases indicate real connections within the topic, their
    essential function is to help readers follow the construction
    of thought.

    How much constructive diction you include in a compo-
    sition depends both upon the amount of help you think read-
    ers need and upon your own preferences for spelling out log-
    ical relationships or leaving them implicit. You can overuse
    such diction, boring or even annoying readers with too many
    however and therefore. Most people, however, are more
    likely to err on the other side, giving readers too little help.

    The other kind of interpretive diction aims at feeling. In
    emotive diction, connotations play a major role, especially
    those carrying strong negative or positive charges. Examples
    about advertising copy. The word Brut on a man's co-
    logne tells us nothing referential, nothing about the product.
    Brut aims at our emotions. Cleverly combining strong macho
    connotations with others of sophistication and elegance, the
    name is intended to overcome masculine resistance to toilet-
    ties as "sissy" (or perhaps to appeal to women, who buy most
    of these products for their men).

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Interpersonal vs. Directive Modes in Expository Writing**\n\nIn the context of expository writing, analyze the role of words that refer to the writer and reader in the interpersonal mode versus those that serve the directive mode. Provide an example from the text that illustrates how a word used in the directive mode might be misinterpreted if it were placed in the interpersonal mode.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the two modes, explain their functions, and demonstrate understanding of the text''s distinction between constructive diction (directive) and emotive diction (interpersonal).'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Constructive vs. Emotive Diction in Advertising**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of constructive diction and emotive diction in the example provided by the text about the "Brut" cologne advertisement. Explain how the directive mode is used to convey information, while the interpersonal mode is employed to evoke emotional responses.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the definitions given in the text, including the roles of constructive diction and emotive diction, and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct functions in communication.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Balancing Constructive Diction in Writing**\n\nDiscuss the potential consequences of overusing or underusing constructive diction in expository writing. Provide a logical argument for why the text suggests that most writers tend to err on the side of providing too little help to readers.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of constructive diction, including its purpose in clarifying organization and flow of ideas, and demonstrate an understanding of the balance between explicit and implicit logical relationships.'

    Emotionally loaded diction is also the stock-in-trade of the political propagandist. The Marxist who writes of "the bourgeois lust for personal liberty" uses bourgeois (a leftist sneer word for all things pertaining to capitalism) and "lust" for their capacity to arouse disapproval in a socialist audience. Similarly the conservative who complains of "pinko liberals in Washington" employs rightist sneer words. Diction may also

    MEANING 259

    be loaded positively, calling forth feelings of affection and approval: "grass-roots Americanism," "old-fashioned flavor," "an ancient and glorious tradition."

    There is nothing wrong in trying to arouse the emotions of readers. It is the purpose for which the emotion is evoked that may be reprehensible, or admirable. The devil's advocate uses loaded diction, and so do the angels.

    Many words operate in both the referential and directive modes simultaneously. In fact, it is not always easy to know which mode is paramount in particular cases. Both Marxist and conservative, for example, may believe that bourgeois and pinko really denote facts. Still, most of us feel that such words are largely empty of reference and have their meaning chiefly in their emotive force. On the other hand, some words work effectively in both modes, like those italicized in the following passage (the author is describing some fellow passengers on a bus tour of Sicily):

    Immediately next to me was an aggrieved French couple with a small child who looked around with a rat-like malevolence. He had the same face as his father. They looked like very cheap microscopes. Lawrence Durrell

    "Rat-like" and "cheap microscopes" have genuine reference; they would help an illustrator drawing a picture of this father and son. At the same time the words arouse the emotional response that Durrell wants in the reader.

    Conclusion

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Loaded Diction in Political Discourse**\n\nAnalyze the use of loaded diction in the excerpt from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing* by Thomas S. Kane. Specifically, identify and explain two examples of words that are used as emotive tools rather than referential terms. For each example, discuss how the choice of word reflects a political or ideological stance (e.g., ''bourgeois'' as a sneer term for capitalism, ''pinko'' as a sneer term for liberalism).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between referential and emotive functions of language in the text, demonstrating an understanding of how diction can be used to sway audience sentiment.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Dual Functionality of Language in Literature**\n\nExamine the passage from Lawrence Durrell''s description of passengers on a bus tour of Sicily. Identify two words that serve both referential and directive functions, as discussed in the text. For each word, explain how it contributes to both the literal description of the characters and the emotional tone intended by the author.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the dual modes of language operation (referential and directive) and show how specific words achieve both purposes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Loaded Diction in Political Rhetoric**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''loaded diction is inherently unethical.'' Using examples from the text, argue whether this statement is valid or not. Consider the following points:\n- The purpose for which emotions are evoked (e.g., persuasion vs. manipulation)\n- The distinction between referential and emotive functions of language\n- The potential for words to be used by both ''angels'' and ''devils'' as mentioned in the text\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate concepts from the text, providing a nuanced analysis of the ethical implications of using loaded diction in communication.'

    The relative importance of the three modes of meaning varies considerably from one kind of writing to another. Scholarly and scientific papers, for example, make the writer-topic axis paramount; advertising and political propaganda use that of reader-topic; applications for jobs and letters of appeal, for example, lie along the writer-reader axis. We can suggest such differences in emphasis in our triangular diagram by moving

    260 DICTION

    the circles representing words from the center of the triangle toward one or another of its sides. Some of the examples we have used might be visualized like this:

    Some expressions (in 156/, for instance) are chosen solely for reference, that is to explain the topic; a few solely to in-
    fluence fealiegs' about the topic (Brut). Other words
    function in two areas of meaning: either primarily within one
    but extending partially into another (pinko, bourgeois, I think,
    young widow), or more evenly balanced (rat-like).

    But whether designed to serve a single end or several, dic-
    tion succeeds only to the degree that it does in fact serve an
    endadensalbingomprehend your observations,
    ideas, feelings, and affecting their responses both to the topic
    and to you in ways that you wish. To the degree that it fails
    to achieve your purpose, your diction fails entirely.'

    4. A purpose itself may be silly or stupid, of course, but then the fault lies in
    the writer's bonaephiomantshts in the say—not diction—
    how itis said. Writers may use words well by a happy chance, that is, without
    really understanding their effédtjus achieve a purpose they are blind to.

    But lucky prose is rare. The general truth holds: good diction is diction chosen
    to achieve a conscious purpose.

    MEANING 261

    You must, finally, realize that words inherently have mean-
    ing in some or in all of the modes we have enumerated. If you
    do not choose words wisely, words will, in effect, choose you,
    saying things about the topic you do not intend and affecting
    readers in ways you do not want.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Diction and Purpose**\n\nUsing the passage provided, explain how the writer''s purpose influences the selection of diction in different types of writing (e.g., scholarly papers, advertising, job applications).\n- **Step 1**: Identify the three primary modes of meaning mentioned in the text and their associated writing contexts.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the triangular diagram concept to compare how diction is prioritized in each context.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example for each writing type that demonstrates how diction serves its purpose, referencing specific terms from the text (e.g., ''reference'', ''influence'', ''writer-topic'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must demonstrate a clear understanding of the relationship between purpose and diction as outlined in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Diction in Literary Contexts**\n\nExamine the example phrases from the text: ''pinko, bourgeois, young widow'' and ''rat-like''. Using the concepts of single-end vs. multi-end diction from the passage, analyze how these words function in terms of meaning and purpose:\n- **Part A**: For each phrase, determine whether it serves a single or multiple end of meaning. Justify your answer using definitions from the text (e.g., ''function in two areas of meaning'').\n- **Part B**: Explain why the word ''rat-like'' is considered to have more balanced meaning compared to ''pinko''. Reference specific terms from the text (e.g., ''more evenly balanced'').\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the passage''s emphasis on diction serving an end (or ends) relates to the broader concept of effective communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s discussion of diction and its role in achieving writer intent.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Diction in Writing**\n\nThe passage argues that ''good diction is diction chosen to achieve a conscious purpose.'' Using this principle, evaluate the effectiveness of the following two examples from the text:\n- **Example 1**: ''Some expressions (in 156/, for instance) are chosen solely for reference''\n- **Example 2**: ''Writers may use words well by a happy chance, that is, without really understanding their effédtjus achieve a purpose they are blind to.''\n- **Part A**: For each example, determine whether the diction serves a conscious purpose or not. Support your evaluation with definitions from the text (e.g., ''diction succeeds only to the degree that it does in fact serve an end'').\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the two examples in terms of their relationship to the passage''s main thesis about diction and purpose.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical writing scenario where conscious diction is crucial, and explain how the principles from the text would guide the writer''s choices.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s central argument about diction and its relationship to purpose.'

    What you think or feel or see or hear. Precision also establishes an appropriate relationship between you and your readers and guides their responses. But in exposition precision is largely a matter of expressing your topic clearly.

    That is more complicated than it sounds. It is not simply a question of deciding what you perceive or think or know or feel, and then of choosing appropriate words. The distinction between what goes on in our minds and how we put it into language is not that clear-cut. Words both limit and reveal reality. We do not so much "choose" words to fit our perceptions and ideas, as we see and think in terms of the words we know. To be more exact, the two processes—thinking, knowing, seeing, feeling, on the one hand; and using words, on the other hand— are interconnected. The process of acquiring new words increases our capacity to understand ourselves and the world around us; and as our sensitivity to self and the world expands, we seek words that will express the subtler, more complicated persons we are becoming.

    Therefore, sentences are important; paragraphing and clear organization are important. But words are fundamental. The essential virtue of words is that they be clear. At the same time it is desirable that they be simple, concise, and original. To a considerable degree these virtues overlap: words that are simple and concise will be clear. Yet there are occasions when these qualities of diction work at cross purposes. Sometimes, for example, the need to be exact will override the need to be simple or concise. But in general you should aim first at clarity, then strive for simplicity and concision.

    In this and the next two chapters we'll consider how to use words well. First, we look chiefly at clarity and simplicity; next at concision; and finally at original, unusual diction which gives extraordinary power and perceptiveness to writing.

    Here, then, are some things to keep in mind as you struggle to use words clearly and simply.

    Concreteness and Abstraction

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Clarity and Simplicity in Writing**\n\nConsider the following two sentences:\n1. "The process of acquiring new words enhances one''s ability to comprehend both internal thoughts and external realities."\n2. "Gaining new vocabulary improves understanding of oneself and the world around us."\n\nWhich sentence is more aligned with the text''s emphasis on clarity and simplicity? Justify your answer by analyzing the original passage''s focus on how words shape perception and the importance of clear, simple language in communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s discussion on the interconnection between thinking and language, and demonstrate an understanding of why one version is more effective than the other.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Word Choice and Precision**\n\nThe text argues that words both limit and reveal reality. Choose a common word (e.g., "light", "time", or "truth") and construct two sentences: one that illustrates how the word "limits" reality, and another that illustrates how it "reveals" reality.\n- **Sentence 1**: Use the word in a context where it constrains meaning (e.g., "Light is the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation").\n- **Sentence 2**: Use the word in a context where it expands understanding (e.g., "Light brings hope and guidance").\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must directly reflect the text''s assertion that words are both limiting and revealing, with clear examples from everyday language or abstract concepts. You must also explain how these two uses of the word align with the text''s central thesis about the relationship between language and perception.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Diction and Organization**\n\nThe text emphasizes that "sentences are important; paragraphing and clear organization are important." Using the following outline, write a short paragraph (5-6 sentences) that addresses the challenge of balancing clarity, simplicity, concision, and originality in writing.\n- **Step 1**: Introduce the core challenge: finding words that are both clear and concise.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how overcomplicating language can obscure meaning.\n- **Step 3**: Present a solution using an example from your own experience or observation (e.g., a time when simple language improved communication).\n- **Step 4**: Conclude by linking the example to the text''s argument about the role of words in shaping perception.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must integrate all four elements and demonstrate an understanding of how the text connects word choice to effective writing.'

    Abstract words signify things that cannot be directly perceived: honor, for instance, is an abstract word, as are generosity or idea or democracy. Concrete words refer to perceptible things: a rose, a clap of thunder, the odor of violets.

    No hard-and-fast distinction exists between abstract and concrete. Often it is a matter of degree. Depending on its context the same term may now be used abstractly, now concretely, like rose in these sentences:

    CONCRETE On the hall table a single yellow tea rose stood
    in a blue vase.

    LESS CONCRETE Roses were growing in the garden.

    ABSTRACT The rose family includes many varieties.

    The closer a word comes to naming a single, unique object
    the more concrete it is. When diction moves from the specific
    and perceptible to the general and imperceptible, it becomes
    abstract.

    Do not suppose that abstract diction is necessarily a fault.
    264 DICTION

    If you deal with ideas, abstraction is inevitable. The following
    sentence is clear and concise, and almost all of its important
    words are abstract, yet they are essential to its clarity:

    All too often the debate about the place, purpose, and usefulness
    of films as a means of instruction is clouded by confusion, defen-
    siveness, and ignorance. Sol Worth

    Even when dealing with ideas, however, wise writers do
    not stay too long on high levels of abstraction, especially if
    aiming at readers who do not share their expertise. They
    know that many readers find it hard to enjoy or understand
    words remote from the eyes and ears. Occasionally; they
    make us "see" and "hear" ideas by using images in the form
    of examples, analogies, similes, or metaphors. In the following
    case the abstract tone of extremes is
    distinguished from concrete, visual reality in the image,' "a very
    flat country":

    It is often said truly, though perhaps not understood rightly, that
    extremes meet. But the strange thing is that extremes meet, not so
    much in being extraordinary, as in being dull. The country where
    the East and West are one, is a very flat country. c. Chesterton

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Abstract and Concrete Diction**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, classify the words ''honor'' and ''rose'' as either abstract or concrete, and explain your reasoning based on their contextual usage. Additionally, create a sentence that uses both terms in a context where one is used abstractly and the other concretely.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the classification of each word using the text''s criteria (e.g., ''rose'' refers to a perceptible thing).\n- **Step 2**: Construct a sentence that demonstrates their different usages in distinct contexts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly identify both words'' classifications and provide an example sentence that reflects their dual meanings.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Abstraction Levels in Writing**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''The debate about the place, purpose, and usefulness of films as a means of instruction is clouded by confusion, defensiveness, and ignorance.''\n- **Part A**: Identify three abstract nouns in this sentence and explain why each is considered abstract based on the text''s definition.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence using concrete examples to replace the abstract terms without losing its original meaning. Show how your changes make the ideas more tangible for readers unfamiliar with the topic.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the balance between abstraction and concreteness in effective writing, citing the text''s advice about avoiding excessive abstraction for general audiences.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of abstract nouns and their role in communication, as well as the ability to adapt language for different readers.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Diction Types**\n\nThe text states that ''the closer a word comes to naming a single, unique object the more concrete it is.'' Apply this principle to the following terms: ''sun'' and ''light''.\n- **Part A**: Determine whether each term is best classified as concrete or abstract, justifying your answer based on the text''s criteria.\n- **Part B**: Construct two sentences that use ''sun'' and ''light'' in different contexts where one is used concretely and the other abstractly. Explain how each sentence reflects the distinction described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the term ''light'' might be considered abstract even though it refers to a perceptible phenomenon, using the text''s explanation about abstraction moving from specific to general.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definition of abstraction and concreteness, showing an understanding of how words can shift between categories based on context.'

    And in the following description of a Japanese train crew,
    notice how the abstract terms "trim" and "dapper" are made
    perceptible:

    Everything about them is trim and dapper; the stylized flourishes of
    the white gloved guard, for instance, as he waves the flag for the
    train to start from Sano station, or the precise unfumbling way the
    conductor, in equally clean white gloves, clips one's ticket, arms
    slightly raised, ticket held at the correct angle and correct distance
    from the body, clipper engaged and operated in a sharp single
    movement. Ronald P. Dore

    1. An image is a word that refers to something we can sense—that
    hears, touch, and so on. See pages 23 for a fuller discussion.
    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 265

    If unrelieved abstraction can be a fault even when writing
    about abstract subjects, it is a far worse fault when writing
    about a subject that is not abstract at all. When you describe
    what you see, hear, touch and taste, use the most specific,
    concrete words you know:

    TOO ABSTRACT The large coves are surrounded by various
    buildings.

    MORE CONCRETE The large coves are surrounded by summer cottages, boat houses, and piers jutting into the
    water.

    EVEN BETTER The large coves are surrounded by summer cottages, trimly painted, with bright red and blue
    and green shutters; by boat houses, a few seeming about to slide into the lake, but most still used and well-maintained; and by piers
    jutting into the water, in good repair with sturdy railings, from which hang clean white life-rings.

    Inexperienced writers often complain, "I haven't anything
    to write about." There's plenty to write about; all you have
    to do is look and listen.

    Specificity

    Aside from being concrete or abstract, words may also be
    general or specific. Here, too, it is a matter of degree. A general word designates a class: for example, "dog" is a general
    word, while "golden retriever" is a specific word.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Concrete and Abstract Language**\n\nUsing the example from the passage about the Japanese train crew, explain how the abstract terms ''trim'' and ''dapper'' become perceptible through concrete descriptions.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two specific instances in the passage where ''trim'' and ''dapper'' are described using sensory details (sight, movement, etc.).\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these descriptions convey the abstract qualities of ''trim'' and ''dapper'' without directly using those words.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this approach to the example in the text about coves and buildings, explaining how both use concrete details to make abstract ideas understandable.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between concrete descriptions and abstract concepts, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Specificity in Writing**\n\nRewrite the sentence ''The large coves are surrounded by various buildings.'' using the principles of specificity from the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three specific types of buildings that could be found in such a location.\n- **Part B**: Describe one sensory detail for each type of building that adds concreteness to the description.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this level of specificity enhances the reader''s ability to visualize the scene, as discussed in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your rewritten sentence must include concrete details and demonstrate a clear application of the principles of specificity.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Abstract and Concrete Descriptions**\n\nThe text argues that abstract concepts can be made perceptible through concrete descriptions. Construct an example where you describe an abstract emotion (e.g., ''confidence'') using only concrete, sensory details.\n- **Part A**: Choose one abstract emotion to describe.\n- **Part B**: Use at least three specific sensory details (sight, sound, touch) that convey the emotion without using any abstract words.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this approach aligns with the text''s argument that concrete descriptions can make abstract ideas understandable.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your example must demonstrate a clear understanding of how concrete details can communicate abstract concepts as outlined in the text.'

    Ambiguity
    Ambiguity means that a word can be read in either of two ways and the context does not make clear which way is intended. (The term ambiguity is sometimes also applied when three or more interpretations are possible.)

    Ambiguity often is the result of a word's having two different senses:

    It was a funny affair. ("Laughable" or "strange"?)

    He's mad. ("Crazy" or "angry"?)

    Large abstractions are often ambiguous, particularly if they involve value judgments. Words like democracy, romantic, and Christian encompass a wide range of meanings, some of them contradictory. A writer, or a reader, can easily make mistakes with such words, sliding unconsciously from one sense to another, an error which logicians call equivocation.

    Pronouns may be ambiguous if it is not clear which of two possible antecedents they refer to:

    Children often anger parents; they won't talk to them.

    We sat near the heater, as it was cold. (The "heater" or the un-
    niendioned

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Ambiguity and Clarity in Language**\n\nExplain why the sentence "He''s mad" is ambiguous, using examples from the text. Then, propose one alternative phrasing that eliminates ambiguity while preserving the intended meaning. Justify your choice based on the text''s definition of ambiguity as ''a word can be read in either of two ways and the context does not make clear which way is intended.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both the concept of ambiguity and the importance of clarity in writing, using examples directly from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of General vs. Specific Terms**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of general terms (like ''emotion'') with specific terms (like ''fear'' or ''terror'') in the context of describing feelings. Use the text''s explanation that ''it is a common error to pick words that mean too much'' to support your analysis. Provide an example from literature or everyday language where using a general term might be appropriate and another where using a specific term is necessary.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s perspective on word choice, demonstrating an ability to distinguish between appropriate uses of general and specific terms.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Resolution of Ambiguity in Pronoun References**\n\nIdentify the ambiguity in the sentence ''Children often anger parents; they won''t talk to them.'' Then, revise the sentence to resolve the ambiguity without changing its original meaning. In your explanation, reference the text''s definition of pronoun ambiguity as ''when it is not clear which of two possible antecedents they refer to.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly address the ambiguity in the sentence and demonstrate an understanding of how to clarify pronoun references using grammatical or contextual adjustments.'

    Some connectives are prone to ambiguity. Or, for instance,
    can signify (1) a logical disjunction, that is, A or B but not
    both; and (2) an alternative name or word for the same thing:
    "The shag, or cormorant, is a common sea bird along the New
    England coast." Because after a negative statement may also
    be ambiguous:

    We didn't go because we were tired. ("We did not go and the
    reason was that we were tired"; or, emphatically, "We did go and
    we certainly were not tired"?)

    On other occasions ambiguity lurks, not in a single word,
    but in an entire statement:

    I liked this story as much as liked all his others. ("I like all his
    stories, including this one"; or "I don't like any of his stories, in-
    cluding this one"?)

    So be it, until Victory is ours, and there is no enemy, but Peace.
    ("... there is no enemy, and now we have Peace"; or"... there
    is no enemy except Peace"?)

    Clever writers exploit ambiguity as a kind of irony, seem-
    ing to say one thing while meaning another. Joan Didion, in
    the following description of a wedding, wryly comments on
    marriage by using "illusion" both in its technical, dressmak-
    ing sense of a bridal veil and in its more commonplace mean-
    ing of a false hope or dream:

    A coronet of seed pearls heldilusion veil.

    And the nineteenth-century statesman and novelist Benjamin
    Disraeli had a standard response to all would-be authors who
    sent him unsolicited manuscripts:

    Many thanks; $hall lose no time in reading it.

    Connotation

    The connotation of a word is its fringe or associated mean-
    ings, including implications of approval or disapproval. (See
    pages 179 ff.) When a connotation pulls awkwardly against
    the context, even though the basic meaning of the word fits,
    the term must be replaced. In the following sentence, for ex-
    ample, unrealistic has the wrong connotations for the writer's
    purpose:

    In such stories it is exciting to break away from the predictable
    world we live in and to enter an unrealistic world where anything
    can happen.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Connotation and Contextual Appropriateness**\n\nEvaluate the sentence: "In such stories it is exciting to break away from the predictable world we live in and to enter an unrealistic world where anything can happen."\n- **Task A**: Explain why the word ''unrealistic'' has the wrong connotation in this context according to the text.\n- **Task B**: Propose a revision of the sentence that maintains the intended meaning while using a word with appropriate connotation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s explanation of connotation and provide a revised example that aligns with the writer''s purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Ambiguity in Literary Irony**\n\nExamine the line from Joan Didion: "A coronet of seed pearls held illusion veil."\n- **Task A**: Identify two distinct meanings of ''illusion'' as used in this sentence based on the text''s discussion of ambiguity.\n- **Task B**: Discuss how the dual meaning of ''illusion'' contributes to the ironic tone of Didion''s description of a wedding.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s examples and demonstrate an understanding of how ambiguity can be used for literary effect.'

- prompt: "The problem is that the writer approves of the story because  \nit stimulates the imagination. But usually unrealistic connotes  \ndisapproval (\"Don't be so unrealistic\"; \"Her plan is too un-  \nrealistic to work\").

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Connotation and Denotation in Language**\n\nConsider the term ''unrealistic.'' According to the text, while its denotative meaning refers to something that is not realistic, its connotative meaning often carries a negative implication. Contrast this with the term ''imaginative,'' which is described as more appropriate for certain contexts.\n- **Part A**: Explain why ''unrealistic'' might be considered a negative term in everyday usage, even if it technically describes something that is not based on reality.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from literature or daily life where the use of ''imaginative'' would be more appropriate than ''unrealistic,'' and explain how this reflects the text''s discussion of connotation versus denotation.\n- **Part C**: Justify why terms like ''gastastic'' or ''bewonder-filled'' are preferable in certain contexts, even though they are not standard words.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of denotation and connotation as discussed in the text, with specific examples that demonstrate understanding of their distinction.'

    Legitimate words may become barbarisms when misused in grammatical shifts. As we'll see in the next chapter, grammatical shifts can be valuable in writing. (It means changing the normal grammatical function of a word, turning a noun, for example, into a verb, as in "The car nosed down the street.") But if it serves no valid purpose, such a shift is simply a barbarism:

    Our strive for greatness is one of our best qualities. (For striving)

    They made their deciding. (For decision)
    270 DICTION

    Awkward shifts are common with adjectives and adverbs. Usually the problem is leaving off a necessary-ly:

    She dances beautiful. (For beautifully)

    They did it satisfactory. (For satisfactorily)

    A rough rule is that adverbs of three or more syllables end in -ly that those having one or two syllables are rather idomatic: some always end (-ly), others never do (-ly), and still others may be used either way (slow or slowly, quick or quickly).

    On the fringe of barbarism are many trendy words such as finalize and adverbs ending in -wise such as weatherwise, unwearablewise. There seems little justification for a word like finalize, which says nothing that complete or finish does not say. On the other hand, one can argue that weatherwise is at least more concise than the phrase in regard to the weather. One's tolerance for such terms depends on how liberal or conservative one is with regard to language (or languagewise).

    Idiom

    An idiom is a combination of words functioning as a unit of meaning, as in "to take the subway [bus, streetcar] home." Often one or more of the words has a special sense different from its usual meaning and confined to that idiom. Thus to take here means "to get on and travel in." In its idiomatic sense such a word cannot be replaced by any of its usual equivalents: we cannot Urarry, or fetch the subway home."

    Idioms are always a difficulty in learning foreign languages.
    They are not easily reduced to rules and each must be mem-
    orized. Even native speakers make mistakes with idioms. The
    most frequent errors involve verb-preposition combinations:
    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 271

    I complained with my parents about their attitude.
    IDIOMATIC: complained to

    She concluded in saying....
    IDIOMATIC: concluded by

    That is where we fool ourselves of our efficiency.
    IDIOMATIC: fool ourselves about

    They can't decide what to do with their problem.
    IDIOMATIC: do about their problem

    Errors like these probably come from confusing two idioms
    {complain about and argue with, for example), or from se-
    lecting an inappropriate one of several possible verb-
    preposition idioms (we do with physical objects—‘"What
    shall we do with this wase@3-ehutt problems,

    difficulties, abstractions of various khallswe‘&What

    about that crack in the vase?").

    Although they are most likely with verbs and prepositions,
    mistakes in idiom occur with other grammatical patterns.
    Some verbs, for instance, do not combine idiomatically with
    certain objects:

    People only /ook out for prestige. (Prestige is looked for, valued,
    esteemed.)

    Robert Frost gives the image of a silken tent in a field. (Poets create
    or develop images.)

    Adjectives and nouns also enter into idiomatic combina-
    tions:

    We have a great standard of living.
    IDIOMATIC: high

    The English prefer dining-room comedy.
    IDIOMATIC: drawing-room comedy

    Colloquial and Pretentious Diction

    Colloquialisms are expressions appropriate to informal, con-
    versational occasions. In writing they may sound out of
    place:

    We have a swell professor of mathematics.
    BETTER: nice, interesting, pleasant

    Colloquial words are a problem when they fit awkwardly
    with their contexts or when they are vague. And frequently
    colloquialisms are vague. (What, for example, does swe/l mean
    in the sentence above?) In speech we compensate for verbal
    vagueness by gestures, tone of voice, the common ground of
    knowledge and experience we share with our friends. None
    of these aids to communication is available to the writer.

    On the other hand, some colloquialisms are remarkably expressive, and these are more acceptable now than they were a generation ago, when writers were more scrupulous about levels of usage. Today, we feel freer to mix formal words and colloquial ones. The result, if controlled by word sense and taste, is a clear gain in precision and variety (italics added in both cases):

    Joan's voices and visions have played tricks with her reputation.
    George Bernard Shaw

    There's another wrinkle to this. Elizabeth Janeway

    An extreme form of colloquialism is slang. We all use slang, and we all recognize it. But we find it very difficult to define.
    Sometimes slang is an ordinary word given a special meaning: heavy in the sense of serious, or cool in the sense of unper-
    turbed or a little better than all right. Other slang terms occur only as Sbarigstenead,

    Slang tends to be short-lived: that of one generation sounds silly to the next. (There are exceptions; some slang terms are
    notably lekag-hivsiinedoeagds also to be

    richly suggestive in meaning, conveying a wide range of at-
    titudes and responses and values in a brief expression (square,
    hep). But the richness is likely to hide an imprecision: often
    we feel that a slang term says exactly what we want to say,
    but we find it very difficult to explain what that something
    is.

    Even more than colloquialisms, slang has an air of infor-
    mality. That tone can be useful, helping to create a good
    writer-reader relationship or a likable persona. Used intelli-
    gently, an occasional bit of slang will not only say exactly the
    right thing but also please us by its novelty (italics added):

    Pretentiousness is using big words to no purpose (except perhaps to show off). It results in long-winded, wooden sentences filled with deadwood. Shorter, simpler words mean shorter, clearer sentences:

    BETTER: Told yes, he went to the bulletin board.

    Television shows which demonstrate participation in physical exercise will improve your muscle tone.
    BETTER: Television exercise shows improve your muscle tone.

    Remember, though, that not all unusual or learned terms are a flaw, even when they could be replaced by simpler ones. Skillful writers employ uncommon words to draw attention or to imply a subtlety. Here, for instance, a learned word wittily conceals a vulgar insult:

    Among those who distrust the [literary] critic as an intrusive middleman, edging his vast steatopygous bulk between author and audience, it is not uncommon to wish him away, out of the direct line of Vision. Carlos Baker

    Cliches and Jargon
    A cliche is a trite expression, one devalued by overuse:

    an agonizing reappraisal the bottom line

    at this point in time the finer things of life
    cool, calm, and collected the moment of truth
    history tells us the voice of the people

    Many cliches are simply stale phrases:

    dead as a doornail pleased as Punch
    gentle as a lamb sober as a judge

    happy as a lark the patience of Job

    in the pink the pinnacle of success
    light as a feather white as snow

    Cliches are dull and unoriginal. Worse, they impede clear perception, feeling, or thought. Cliches are verbal molds into which we force experience. Instead of shaping reality for ourselves, we accept it, and pass it on, precast (and probably miscast).

    Cliches, however, ought not to be confused with dead metaphors. Expressions like the key to the problem of the matter, the mouth of the river ever were clichés, are so no longer. They are simply old metaphors long dead and now useful, everyday diction. A cliche attempts to be original and perceptive but fails. A dead metaphor, on the other hand, makes no pretense to newness; it has dried and hardened into a useful expression for a common idea.

    A special kind of cliche is the euphemism, which softens or conceals a fact considered improper or unpleasant. Euphemisms for death include to pass away, to depart this life, to go to that big house, and the trite "eternal rest." Similarly, for sexual matters, and diseases are often named euphemistically. Politicians, diplomats, advertisers are adept with euphemisms:

    dedication to public service = "personal ambition," a frank exchange of views = "continued disagreement," tired blood = "anemia."

    Jargon

    Jargon is technical language misused. Technical language, the precise diction demanded by any specialized trade or profession, is necessary when experts communicate with one another. It becomes jargon when it is applied outside the limits of technical discourse. Jargon is really a kind of pretentiousness, a learned and mysterious language designed to impress the nonexpert:

Support your conclusion with definitions from the text, explaining how they differ from fresh metaphors.\n- **Part A**: Define the key differences between a cliché and a dead metaphor based on the text''s explanation of their purpose and evolution.\n- **Part B**: Apply these distinctions to ''to pass away'' and ''eternal rest,'' justifying your classification using examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare these euphemisms with fresh metaphors like ''the river of time''—explain why one is a cliché and the other is not, based on the text''s discussion of old versus new metaphors.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s definitions of clichés and dead metaphors to support your analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating Jargon in Technical Communication**\n\nThe passage describes jargon as technical language misused outside its proper context. Examine the sentence: ''Given a stockpile of innovative in-house creativity for the generation of novel words, substituting members for the input of letters whenever feasible, and fiscally optimized by computer capacity for targeting in on core issues relating to aims, goals, and priorities, and learned skills, we might at last be freed from our dependence on the past.''\n- **Part A**: Identify three instances where jargon is used incorrectly according to the text. Explain why each instance violates the definition of jargon provided in the passage.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite one of these jargon-laden phrases using clear, non-technical language that aligns with the text''s discussion of proper technical communication.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the misuse of jargon can obscure meaning and hinder effective communication, drawing on examples from both the passage and the text''s explanation of jargon as pretentious language.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the text''s definition of jargon and its improper use in technical communication.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analyzing Euphemisms in Political Language**\n\nThe passage provides examples of euphemisms used by politicians, such as ''personal ambition'' for dedication to public service. Consider the phrase ''continued disagreement.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why this phrase is considered a euphemism based on the text''s definition of euphemisms as expressions that soften or conceal unpleasant facts.\n- **Part B**: Compare ''continued disagreement'' with a direct statement like ''they disagree.'' Use logical reasoning to explain how the euphemism affects the perception of the situation.\n- **Part C**: Construct an original euphemism for a negative event (e.g., failure, loss) that follows the text''s definition of euphemisms. Justify your choice based on the text''s explanation of their purpose and function.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of euphemisms and demonstrate an understanding of how they are used to soften or conceal unpleasant truths.'

    This is in fact a parody by Lewis Thomas, a biologist who does not write jargon. It catches the faults of jargon perfectly: the abstract, polysyllabic Latinism (capacitization, optimized); the trendy word (creativity, in-house, input, core issues); the pointless redundancy (aims, goals, and priorities); and the awesome combination of anollifeeréwords (innovative in-house creativity, computer capacitization).

    At its worst jargon is incomprehensible. (The word originally meant the twittering of birds.) Even when it can be puzzled out, jargon is nothing more than puffed-up language, a kind of false profundity in which simple ideas are padded out in polysyllabic dress.

    Awkward Figures

    Figures of speech are words used less for their literal meaning than for their capacity to clarify or intensify feelings or ideas. For the writer of exposition the most common and important figures are the simile and metaphor.

    A simile is a comparison, generally introduced by like or as. The essayist Robert Lynd describes the bleak houses of a nineteenth-century city as looking "like seminaries for the production of killjoys." A metaphor is more complicated. For now let us say only that it expresses an implicit comparison, not a literal one (as a simile does):

    When Walked to the mailbox, a song sparrow placed his incomparable seal on the outgoing letters. E. B. White

    White does not literally say that the bird's song is like a bright stamp or seal, but the comparison is there.

    In Chapter 27 we look at figures at greater length and in a more positive light (see page 213 ff.). Here we are concerned with their misuse. A metaphor or simile can be faulty in any of three ways: it can be inappropriate, mixed, or overwhelming.

    Mixed metaphors ask us to perceive simultaneously two things that simply cannot go together:

    He put his foot in his mouth and jumped off the deep end. We must feel with the fingertips of our eyeballs.

    Inappropriate figures contain implications that do not fit the context and are likely to imply meanings the writer does not intend:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Jargon in Scientific Writing**\n\nExplain why the term ''capacitization'' is considered jargon and how it fails to convey clear meaning, using examples from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define what jargon is according to the text (e.g., ''puffed-up language,'' ''false profundity'').\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the word ''capacitization'' by breaking it down into its components (''capacitance'' + ''ization'') and explain how this creates ambiguity.\n- **Step 3**: Compare the original meaning of the word ''jargon'' (twittering of birds) to its current usage in scientific writing, highlighting the contrast in meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect jargon to the text''s definition of false profundity and demonstrate understanding of the word''s etymological shift.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Identifying Faulty Metaphors**\n\nEvaluate the following sentence for misuse of metaphor: ''The project was a complete disaster, so we had to start over from the beginning.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify whether this is a simile, metaphor, or neither. Justify your answer based on the text''s definition of metaphor as an implicit comparison.\n- **Step 2**: Determine if the metaphor is inappropriate, mixed, or overwhelming. Support your classification with reasoning from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a revision that eliminates the metaphor while maintaining the intended meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the three types of faulty metaphors and show how the revised sentence avoids the misuse described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing Figures of Speech**\n\nCompare and contrast similes and metaphors as defined in the text, using examples from the provided passage.\n- **Step 1**: Define a simile using the text''s example (''like seminaries for the production of killjoys'').\n- **Step 2**: Define a metaphor using E.B. White''s example (''a song sparrow placed his incomparable seal on the outgoing letters'').\n- **Step 3**: Analyze how both figures of speech serve different purposes in exposition, based on the text''s discussion of their importance for clarifying or intensifying ideas.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of figures of speech and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct roles in writing.'

    A green lawn spread invitingly from the road to the house, with a driveway winding up to the entrance like a snake in the grass.

    Since the writer intended no sinister implications, comparing the driveway to a snake is misleading. Moreover, the simile, aside from being misleading and trite, is ridiculous. A snake in the grass is a kinetic image in one motion—and a wriggling driveway is silly.

    Overwhelming figures ride roughshod over the main idea, as in the following sentence (about the considerable girth of the comedian Jackie Gleason):

    Out of that flesh grew benign tumors of driving energy and unsatisfied appetite that stuck to his psyche and swelled into a galloping disease that at once blights and regenerates him.

    False Hyperbole

    Hyperbole (often shortened to hype in modern usage) is deliberate exaggeration intended to intensify importance or emotional force. Though no hyperbole is ever intended to be taken literally, we may properly call it false only when the exaggeration far outdistances the real value of the idea or feeling:

    Football is the most magnificent sport ever developed by the mind of man. It tests physical skill, stamina, courage, and intelligence more thoroughly than any other human activity.

    One shudders to think of what the world would have been like if Shakespeare had never written The Tempest.

    Although these are silly exaggerations, hyperbole can be used legitimately. It is an old and useful figure of speech (though not as fashionable today as it once was). In the nineteenth century politicians delighted in spread-eagle oratory, and historians cultivated a hyperbolical style. In the following passage, for example, the American historian William H. Prescott

    writes about the ill effects of the gold which Spain had expropriated from the New World in the 1500s:

    The golden tide, which, permitted a free vent, would have fertilized the region, through which it poured, now buried the land under a deluge which blighted every green and living thing.

    Mark Twain was a master of hyperbole, as he reveals in this description of a tree after an ice storm:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Figurative Language and Hyperbole**\n\nThe passage describes a driveway as "a snake in the grass." Analyze this simile using the definitions of figurative language provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify whether this is a simile, metaphor, or other figure of speech.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why the author''s use of this simile is considered misleading and trite.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your reasoning based on the text''s discussion of figurative language and hyperbole.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of the difference between similes and metaphors, as well as the criteria for effective or ineffective figurative language.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Hyperbole Analysis**\n\nConsider the sentence: "Football is the most magnificent sport ever developed by the mind of man."\n- **Part A**: Classify this statement as a hyperbole. Explain your reasoning based on the text''s definition of hyperbole.\n- **Part B**: Compare this example with Mark Twain''s description of a tree after an ice storm from the text. Identify at least two similarities and one difference between these examples of hyperbole.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the text''s discussion of the historical use of hyperbole in politics and history. How might the context of the original usage influence the interpretation of this sentence?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s definitions and examples to show a comprehensive understanding of hyperbole as a rhetorical device.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Literary Devices**\n\nThe passage discusses how false hyperbole can distort the main idea.

    ... it stands there the acme, the climax, the supremest possibility
    in art or nature, of bewildering, intoxicating, intolerable magnifi-
    cence. One cannot make the words strong enough.

    Twain is at his best when he uses ears—when
    hyperbole for comic effect:

    [On the New England weather] time spring have counted one
    hundred and thirty-six different kinds of weather inside of four-and-
    twenty hours.

    [On the music of Richard Wagner] Another time we went to Mann-
    heim and attended a siti Vir@a-—otherwise opera—called
    engrin." The banging and slamming and booming and crashing
    were beyond belief, the racking and pitiless pain of it remains
    stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time had
    my teeth fixed.

    Repetitiousness

    A word, unless it is important, will sound awkward if it is
    repeated too closely. It ought to be replaced by a synonym
    or a pronoun:

    The auto industry used to produce cars that lasted, but they didn't
    make enough profit so planned obsolescence came into use.
    BETTER: ... came into fashion.

    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 279

    This narrative is narrated by a narrator whom we cannot completely
    trust.
    BETTER: This story is told by a narrator whom we cannot completely
    trust.

    However, repetitiousness must be distinguished from le-
    gitimate restatement, in which words are repeated for em-
    phasis or clarity:

    He [a lax governor] took things easy, and his fellow freebooters
    took everything easily. Carter Hodding

    [Oliver Goldsmith's "The Deserted Village" is] a poem written not
    in ink but in tears, a rich suffusion of emotion rising up in a grubby
    room in Grub street for a grubby little Irish village.

    Sean O'Faolain

    The line between awkward repetition and effective restate-
    ment is not easy to draw. As a general rule, a repeated word
    should be important, able to stand the attention readers will
    give it.

    Verbal profundity is the fallacy that words which look impressive must mean a lot. The person, for example, who exclaimed of a painting that it exhibits "orderly and harmonious juxtapositions of color patterns" seemed to be saying a great deal. But if the words mean anything more than "color harmony," it is difficult to say.

    Closely related to verbal profundity is the desire for elegance, often a variety of what in the last chapter we called pretentious diction. A sentence like

    A worker checks the watch's time-keeping performance.

    is an attempt to cast a verbal spell over the job of quality control in a watch factory. This is shorter, simpler, and clearer:

    A worker checks the watch's accuracy.

    Confusion about the subject also leads to wordiness:

    Music is similar to dress fads in that its styles change from time to time. Perhaps the change is subtle, but no one style of music will remain on top for a very long time. I am not talking about classical music, but rather about popular music that appeals to the majority of young people.

    This writer did not begin with word specific enough before the subject. He chose too general a term ("music"). The final sentence reveals that he himself felt the problem, for he spends twenty words explaining what kind of music he means. How much easier to have begun

    Popular music is similar to dress fads...

    Sometimes deadwood stems from ignorance of words. That's the problem here:

    In this novel, part of the theme is stated directly in so many words, and part is not so much said in specific words but is more or less hinted at.

    Had the writer known the terms explicit and implicit he could have made the point more clearly and concisely:

    In this novel, part of the theme is explicit, and part is implicit.

    A limited vocabulary is no disgrace. We all suffer that handicap, and education is the process of overcoming it. But while it may be pardonable, not knowing the right word often re-

    Finally, excessive caution contributes to deadwood. Some
    people are afraid to express anything as certain. They will
    write:

    It seems that Columbus discovered the New World in 1492.

    Certainly some things call for caution. But no one can lay
    down a blanket rule about when qualification is necessary and
    when it is verbose. We'll consider the question in closer detail
    later in the chapter; for the moment remember that extreme
    caution in writing is more often a vice than a virtue.

    A false sense of what is significant, confusion about what
    you want to say, ignorance of words, and timidity, then, are
    some of the psychological factors leading to deadwood. In
    practice, they are manifested in either of two ways: circum-
    locution, using too many words to say something; andit-
    lessness, saying something that doesn't need to be said at all.

    Circumlocution
    > Avoid Mi¢aningteserbs

    English often conveys subtleties by stringing verbs:
    I was going to go tomorrow.

    Here the verbs are justified by the meaning (that a planned
    future action is now uncertain or negated). But when a string
    of verbs says nothing that cannot be said with equal clarity
    or force in fewer words, the result is deadwood:

    The current foreign situation should serve to start many Americans
    to begin thinking.
    BETTER: ... should start many Americans thinking.

    Nucleonics investigates the smaller particles that go to make up the
    nucleus of the atom.
    BETTER: ... that make up the nucleus of the atom.

    A special case of empty verb strings is the awkward passive
    construction. The focus of thought or tact may make the pas-
    sive voice necessary. Generally, however, you should write in
    the active voice. Overuse of the passive lards sentences with
    empty words:

    The writer's point must be clearly stated by him at the beginning
    of the paragraph.

    BETTER: The writer must clearly state his point at the beginning of
    the paragraph.

    (In the last example, however, note that if one wished to emphasize "work," the passive would be justified.)

    > The Best Is Mandatory

    In practice this principle often boils down to not using a
    phrase if a word will do:

    She conducted herself in an irrational manner.
    BETTER: She conducted herself irrationally.
    BETTER YET: She acted irrationally.

    He didn't take the advice given to him by his doctor.
    BETTER: He didn't take his doctor's advice.

    It leaves us with the thought that. ...
    BETTER: It leaves us thinking that....

    A common kind of adjectival wordiness is using a full rel-
    ative clause to introduce a participle or adjective that could
    be attached directly to the noun:

    CONCISION 285

    This is the same idea that was suggested last week.
    BETTER: This is the same idea suggested last week.

    The family who are living in that house are my friends.
    BETTER: The family living in that house are my friends.

    In such clauses the relative word (that, which, who) acts as
    the subject and is immediately followed by a form of be which
    is, in turn, followed by a participle or adjective. The relative
    word is verb contribute nothing except to hook the
    adjective or participle to the noun. Occasionally clarity, em-
    phasis, or rhythm justify the whole clause. Mostly they do
    not.

    The direct, economic use of participles is a resource of style
    that inexperienced writers underuse. The economy also ap-
    plies to adverbial clauses, which can sometimes be boiled
    down to one or two operative words:

    Because they lacked experience, they didn't do a good job.
    BETTER: Lacking experience, they didn't do a good job.

    Now and then, independent clauses or separate sentences
    may be pruned and subordinated by means of participles:

    These ideas are out of date, and they don't tell us anything new.
    BETTER: These ideas are out of date, telling us nothing new.

    Participles are also more economical than gerunds (the

    [> Specificity Means Concision

    Beginning with a word too general for your idea creates a
    need for wordy modification:

    People who enter college for the first time find it difficult to adjust
    to the teaching.

    "People" is too inclusive. To specify what kind of "people,"
    the writer must add seven words. English provides no single
    term meaning "people who enter college for the first time"
    (except matriculants, a Latinism too forbidding for this
    writer's purpose). Students, however, would be more precise
    than people, and freshmen, more precise still (even though
    second-semester freshmen are not, strictly speaking, entering
    college for the first time). With freshmen only one modifier
    is needed:

    College freshmen find it difficult to adjust to the teaching.

    While most frequent with nouns, failure to be specific oc-
    curs with verbs as well:

    The sudden change motivated him into a rage.
    BETTER: The sudden change enraged him.

    They emerged victorious.
    BETTER: They won.

    The too-general verb is often a form of he, have, or seem.
    When these merely link a noun or modifier to the subject,
    they can often be replaced by a more exact verb:

    The people were supportive of conservation.
    BETTER: The people supported conservation.

    Pointlessness

    Pointless words serve no purpose. They do not need to be made more concise; they need to be eliminated. There are two broad causes of pointless diction: (1) failing to credit readers' intelligence, and (2) failing to focus on the subject.

    Failing to Credit Readers' Intelligence

    Think about your readers, and avoid telling them what they already know or can easily infer from the context.

    Won't Define What Is Common Knowledge

    Accountants sometimes function as auditors (people from outside a company who check the books kept by the company's own accountants).

    288 DICTION

    All the italicized words in that sentence are dead. If readers understand "accountants" they can suppose that "auditors" requires definition. Gratuitous definitions not only make deadwood, but interfere with communication in another, more serious way.

    Insult their intelligence.

    Granted, it is not easy to decide when a word ought to be defined. In the following instance the naturalist Joseph Wood Krutch, writing for general readers, realizes that they will not understand geological terms and neatly explains what they need to know:

    To even the most uninstructed eye a scorpion fossilized during the Silurian or Devonian epoch, like three hundred million years ago, would almost certainly look like a scorpion.

    Ask yourself whether a definition is needed by the reader whom you have in mind. (And remember that it is not too much to ask people to look into a dictionary now and again.)

    [> Don't Spell Out What Is Clearly Implied

    Unless there is a clear chance of confusion, you do not have to state what is entailed in a word's meaning (the deadwood is italicized):

    Her dress was blue in color.
    He was very tall.

    Naumbadgtatival often contain deadwood caused by overexplicitness. In many cases the adjective is unnecessary:

    There is considerable danger involved.
    We question the methods employed.
    The equipment needed is expensive.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Pointless Diction**\n\nIdentify and analyze three examples of ''deadwood'' (pointless words) in the provided passage, explaining how each violates the principle of not failing to credit readers'' intelligence.

Compare this with the example given by Joseph Wood Krutch in the text where he defines geological terms for general readers. How does Krutch''s approach align with the principle of avoiding unnecessary definitions?'

    Each pesya has a special purpose when it is used.
    This question has two sides to it.

    Most countries of the world have their own coinage.
    In other cases it is the noun that is dead:

    They committed an act of burglary.

    The quarterback is noted for his passing ability.
    It has existed for a long period of time.

    She was an unusual kind of child.

    The punt return resulted in a fumble situation.

    The last major barrier to the westward expansion movement was
    the Rocky Mountains.

    Categorizing words such as kind, sort, type, class, and so
    on are especially prone to dead use. Emphasis or tone will
    sometimes justify "He is the kind of man [that] he is wise, the more concise "He is a man who is preferable."

    Often in these noun-adjectival combinations, the adjectives
    can be used substantively, that is, as nouns:

    On quilts, silk patches replaced the homespun ones.
    BETTER: On quilts, silk patches replaced homespun.

    Verbs, too, hide implicit meanings, which, whether ex-
    pressed as a complement or a modifier, are often better left
    unsaid:

    She always procrastinates things.
    He tends to squint his eyes.

    I have been told by various people that smoking is sophisticated.

    290 DICTION

    Sometimes an idea is clearly implied by the total context
    rather than by any single word. Each of these phrases is dead:

    I dislike television. Most programs on television are unbelievable.

    A good personality will help anyone, no matter what profession he
    or she chooses in life.

    A special but frequent form of overexplicitness is the un-
    needed connective, especially common with conjunctive ad-
    verbs like however, therefore, furthermore, and so on. The
    following sentence does not really need the connective:

    People think that stamp collecting requires money; However, it
    doesn't.
    BETTER: People think that stamp collecting requires money; it
    doesn't.

    The negated verb establishes the contradiction, and removing
    "however" even strengthens the point.

    Failing to Focus on the Subject

    Here deadwood comes from lering away from the topic,
    from pursuing irrelevancies:

    > Don't Open Up Topics You Will Not Develop
    Now an idea in itself may be interesting, but if it does not
    support your topic it is just deadwood:

    The people had come to the new world for freedom of several
    different kinds, and had found injustice instead.

    There is nothing inherently dead in "of several different
    kinds." But the writer does not discuss these kinds of freedom
    (nor does his subject require him to). To mention them at all,
    then, is a mistake. The phrase contributes nothing to the main
    point. Even worse, it mutes the contrast between the key
    terms "freedom" and "injustice" and misleads readers by
    pointing to a path of development they will not find.

    > Avoid the Distinction Without a Difference
    A pointless distinction is naming several varieties of some-
    thing when those varieties do not matter for your purpose:

    Under the honor system, teachers do not have to stand guard during
    exams, tests, and quizzes.

    There are of course real differences among exams, tests, and
    quizzes, and had the writer been concerned with the various
    modes of testing students must endure, the distinctions would
    have been vital. But in fact the topic is the honor system, and
    the distinction is empty. One word would do, probably
    "tests," the most general.

    Why so cautious? Resembles does not mean "identical with";
    it doesn't need the protection of "somewhat." Writing so tim-
    idly is like holding up one's trousers with belt, suspenders,
    and several huge safety pins. As we discussed on pages 106-
    8, qualification is often necessary if you are to treat ideas
    without ignoring their complexity. But pointless qualification
    is wordy foolishness.

    The verbs seem and tend and the windy phrase can be said
    to be (in place of a simple is) often indicate overqualification:

    After a square dance the people are pretty tired, but it seems that

    Another verb that is often deadwood is would. This aux-

    I would have gone if had known you were there.
    Or to anticipate a future effect:

    Figurative Language

    Whenever language is simple, plain, direct, whenever it em-
    ploys words in their conventional meaning, we say that it is
    literal. Literal comes from the Latin litera, "letter"; what is
    literal is according to the letter. Consider, for example, this
    statement: "A writer's style should be purposive, not merely
    decorative." It is to be read literally: the words mean nothing
    more, and nothing less, than what they say.

    In figurative language the same idea has been expressed like this: "Style is the feather in the arrow, not the feather in the cap." Figurative means that a word has been stretched to accommodate a larger or even very different sense from that which it usually conveys. A writer can make this stretch because of a likeness between different concepts, a likeness the context reveals. Thus the literal meaning of "feather in the arrow" is the stabilizer that keeps the arrow straight; the figurative meaning is that style keeps prose on target.

    A writer must provide clues for readers so they may understand figurative words. In speech, we signal such meanings by gestures, facial expressions, pronunciation, or tone of voice (think of how we say "generous" to twist its sense to "stingy" when we say of a cheap acquaintance, "He's a generous guy!"). In writing, the context, the sentence, the paragraph, and even total edition—controls the word, making it fly in an unusual direction.

    Effective figures depend on total diction, on all your words. You do not improve writing by sticking in occasional similes or metaphors. They must be woven into prose. When they are, figures of speech add great richness. Look again at the comparison of style to the feathers of an arrow. It enhances meaning on at least four levels. First, it clarifies and concretizes an unfamiliar and abstract idea ("style") in a striking visual image. Second, it enlarges our conception of style, endowing style with the functions of the feather in the arrow (providing stability and guidance) and disassociating it from the qualities of a feather in a cap (vanity, pretentiousness, pointless decoration). Third, the figure implies judgment: that style in the "arrow-feather" sense is good, while style in the "hat-feather" sense is bad. Finally, the figure entertains: we take pleasure in the witty succinctness with which a complicated idea is made clearer and enriched by the image of the two feathers.

- prompt: |-
    Thus figures clarify, they expand and deepen meaning, they express feelings and judgments, and they are pleasurable. We observe these virtues over and over as we look at the more common figures of speech. The most frequent and most useful are similes and metaphors. Similes first.

    Similes
    A simile is a brief comparison, usually introduced by like or as. The preposition like is used when the following construction is a word or phrase:

    My words swirled around his head like summer flies.
    E. B. White

    The conjunction as introduces a clause, that is, a construction containing its own subject and verb:

    The decay of society was praised by artists as the decay of a corpse is praised by worms. G. K. Chesterton

    A simile consists of two parts: tenor and vehicle. The tenor is the primary subject of the figure, such as "the decay of society" and "artists" in Chesterton's. The vehicle is the thing to which the main subject is compared—"summer flies" and the "decay of a corpse" and "worms."

    Usually, though not invariably, the vehicle is, or contains, an image. An image is a word or expression referring to something we can perceive. "Summer flies," for example, is an image, primarily a visual one, though like many images it has a secondary perceptual appeal: we can hear the flies as well as see them.

    Vehicle commonly follows tenor, as in the two instances above. But the vehicle may come first, emphasizing the main subject by delay and also arousing our curiosity by putting the cart before the horse:

    Like a crack in a plank of wood which cannot be sealed, the difference between the worker and the intellectual was ineradicable in Socialism. Barbara Tuchman

    Most similes are brief, but they may be expanded—usually by breaking the vehicles into parts and applying each to the tenor. A historian, writing about the Italian patriot Garibaldi, explains that

    Similes Clarify

    Similes have many uses. One is to clarify an unfamiliar idea or perception by expressing it in familiar terms:

    298 DICTION

    Cold air is heavy; as polar air plows into a region occupied by tropical aigets. underneath the warm air and lifts it up even

    as it pushes it back. A cold front acts physically like a
    COWCaitcher. Wolfgang Langewiesche

    Finding familiar equivalents often involves concretion,
    which is turning an abstraction into an image readers can
    imaginatively see or hear or touch. It has been said, for ex-
    ample, that the plot of one of Thomas Hardy's novels is

    as complicated as a medieval mousetrap. Virginia Woolf

    Even though few of us have seen a medieval mousetrap, the
    phrase cleverly suggests a labyrinthine Rube Goldberg
    contrivance.

    Occasionally the process may be reversed so that a simile
    abstracts, that is, moves from the concrete to the abstract:

    The taste of that crane soup clung to me all day like the memory
    of an old sorrow dulled by time. Jom c. Neiharat

    Then the apse [of a medieval cathedral] is pure and beautiful
    Gothic of the fourteenth century, with very tall and fluted windows
    like single prayers. Hilaire Belloc

    Similes can also be emphatic, especially when they close a
    sentence or passage, like those by Neihardt and Belloc.

    Similes Expand the Subject

    Most similes ever primarily function is to ex-

    phaome-dhan provide a perceptible equivalent of an

    abstract idea. Any vehicle comes with meanings of its own,
    and these enter into and enlarge the significance of the tenor.
    Ballasts "single prayers" does not help us to see the
    windows of the cathedral. But it does enlarge our conception
    of those windows, endowing them with the connotations we

    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 299

    associate with prayer: the upward lift of the spirit, the urge
    to transcend mortal limits.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Simile Functions**\n\nUsing examples from the text, explain how similes can serve three distinct functions: clarifying unfamiliar ideas, expanding the subject, and abstracting from the concrete.\n- **Function 1 (Clarify)**: Use the example of cold air being compared to a cowcatcher. Explain how this simile makes an abstract concept (cold front behavior) more understandable.\n- **Function 2 (Expand)**: Analyze the comparison between the cathedral''s windows and ''single prayers.'' Discuss how this simile adds depth to the description of the windows by linking them to spiritual connotations.\n- **Function 3 (Abstract)**: Examine the line about the taste of crane soup clinging like an old sorrow. Describe how this simile moves from a concrete sensory experience to an abstract emotional state.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference all three functions and provide clear examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Simile Structure**\n\nCompare and contrast two similes from the text that demonstrate different approaches to figurative language: one that uses concretion (turning abstraction into image) and one that abstracts from the concrete.\n- **Simile A (Concretion)**: Analyze the example where the plot of a novel is compared to a medieval mousetrap. Explain how this simile transforms an abstract concept (complicated plot) into a tangible, relatable image.\n- **Simile B (Abstraction)**: Examine the line about the cathedral''s windows being like ''single prayers.'' Discuss how this simile moves from a concrete description to an abstract spiritual meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must highlight the structural differences between concretion and abstraction in similes, supported by specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Simile Usage**\n\nWrite a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) that uses a simile to demonstrate one of the three functions discussed in the text. Your simile must: \n- Clarify an unfamiliar concept, or \n- Expand the subject, or \n- Abstract from the concrete.\n\n**Example Structure**: \n''The sound of the distant train was like the rhythmic pulse of a heartbeat, clarifying the steady, unyielding nature of time.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your simile must be original, clearly demonstrate one function, and include an explanation of how it achieves that purpose in your response.'

    Here are two other examples of similes rich in implication.

    The first one is from the old soldiers:

    "The easy phrases covered the cruelties of war, like sand blowing in
    over the graves of their comrades. Thomas Pakenham"

    The image suggests the capacity of the mind to obscure the
    horror of war, even in those, perhaps especially in those, who
    endured it.

    In this second example the novelist Bakesen is dis-
    cussing life on a farm in South Africa:

    "Sometimes visitors from Europe drifted into the farm like wrecked
    timbers into still waters, turned and rotated, till in the end they were
    washed out again, or dissolved and sank."

    The image implies a great deal about such drifters: their lack
    of will and purpose, the futility with which they float through
    life, their incapacity to anchor themselves to anything solid,
    their inevitable and unmarked disappearance.

    Clearly, one advantage of similes and figures
    of meaning. Compressing a range of ideas
    and feelings into few words, similes deepen prose.

    Similes Express Feelings and Judgments

    Many similes are emotionally charged. Pakenham's image of
    sand blowing over the graves of fallen soldiers, for example,
    is heavily freighted with sadness. And in the following figure
    the naturalist Rachel Carson does more than describe the
    summer sea; she reveals its beauty:

    Or again the summer sea may glitter with a thousand moving pin-
    pricks of light, like an immense swarm of fireflies moving through
    a dark wood.

    Emotional connotations often involve judgments. The poet
    Rupert Brooke, writing about a conversation with a salesman,
    imagines how the man's mind works:

    "The observer could see thoughts slowly floating into it, like carp in
    a pond."

    This simile operates on several levels: it translates an abstrac-
    tion (the process of thinking) into an arresting visual image.
    It suggests the slowness and ponderousness of this particular
    mind. And it implies a judgment, even if humorously: this is
    not a mind the writer admires.

    One other example, more extended, of a judgmental simile.
    The historian Barbara Tuchman is talking about the attitudes
    of English Socialists just before World War I:

    Their touch had no substance, like a dry wind on a July
    afternoon. Sharon Curtin

    Curtin's simile does all the usual thisygsfa-compares
    miliar expememee familiar one, implies something
    about the loneliness of old age, even passes a judgment on life.
    But it does more: it unifies perceptions that most of us would
    not have put together.

    Similes may also cut across the boundaries that separate the
    senses:

    There was a glamour in the air, a something in the special flavour
    of that moment that was like the consciousness of Salvation, or the
    smell of ripe peaches on a sunny wall. Logan Seniiiall

    302 DICTION

    In that image two disparate sense perceptions blend into a
    uexhedience, and the fused aroma and vision of the
    peaches and the sunlit wall connect with the writer's con-
    sciousness of religious mystery.

    Metaphor

    Like a simile, a metaphor is also a comparison. The difference
    is that a simile compares things explicitly; it literally says that
    X is like Y. A metaphor compares things implicitly. Read
    literally, it does not state that X is like Y; but rather that X is
    Y:

    Cape Cod is the bared and bended arm of Massachusetts.
    Henry David Thoreau

    Thoreau writes "is," not "is like." However, we understand
    that he means the Cape resembles a human arm, not that it
    really is an arm. The metaphor has simply taken the compar-
    ison a step closer and expressed it a bit more economically
    and forcefully.'

    A metaphor has the same two parts as a simile: tenor—or
    the main subject—and vehicle—the
    comparison. In Sdnorraa'she tenor is "Cape Cod"
    and the vehicle is "the bared and bended arm." In many meta-
    phors both parts are stated. In some, however, the writer re-
    fers only to the vehicle, depending on the context to supply
    the full comparison. Such a figure is called an implied farsed
    mathppohan a full one. Had Thoreau written "the
    bared and bended arm of Massachusetts" in a context which
    clearly indicated he meant Cape Cod, his metaphor would
    have been implied.

    1. It is sometimes argued that metaphors are more figurative than similes and even in some ways essentially different. Here we need not assume any greater virtue in metaphors. They are more economical and generally more emphatic. For these reasons they are sometimes preferable to similes. But on some occasions the explicit comparison of a simile is better.

    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 303

    Fused metaphors may involve metonymy. Metonymy
    means substituting for one concept another that is associated
    with it. The novelist Joseph Conrad, discussing the difficulty
    of saying exactly what one wants to say, speaks of

    the old, old words, worn thin, defaced by ages of careless usage.

    Conrad does not actually say that words are coins, but he
    implies the full metaphor by the expressions "worn thin" and
    "defaced," qualities of old coins. The logic of the figure runs
    like this:

    Words are (like) old coins.

    Old coins are often worn thin by passing from hand to hand and
    their faces nearly rubbed away.

    Therefore, words can be "worn thin" and "defaced."

    Another figure often found in metaphors and closely re-
    lated to metonymy is synecdoche, which is substituting a part
    for the whole, as when a ship is referred to as a "sail." In the
    following passage the religious revivals staged by the evan-
    gelist MieRhe Semple compared (implicitly) to
    an amusement park:

    With rare ingenuity, Aimee kept the Ferris wheels and the merry-
    go-round of religion going night and day. Carey McWilliams

    The logic goes like this:

    Aimee's revivals were (like) an amusement park.
    An amusement park contains Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds.

    Therefore, events at the revivals were (like) Ferris wheels and merry-
    go-rounds.

    a memorable image in the mind:

    What distinguishes a black hole from a planet or an ordinary star
    is that anything falling into it cannot come out of it again. If light
    cannot escape, nothing else can and it is a perfect trap: a turnstile
    to oblivion. Cauer Nigel
    306 DICTION

    Finally, metaphors may be extended through several sen-
    tences or even an entire paragraph. In fact, exploring and ex-
    panding a metaphor can be an effective way of generating a
    piece of prose. Here is a brief example:

    Man is born broken. He lives by mending. The grace of God is
    glue. Eugene O'Neill

    And here are two longer ones. The first is a metaphor comparing Time magazine to a tale told to little children:

    It's like a nursery book in which the reader is slapped and
    tickled alternately. It is full of predigested pap spooned out with
    confidential nudges. The reader is never on his own for an instant,
    but, as though at his mother's knee, he is provided with the right
    emotions for everything he hears or sees as the pages turn.

    Marshall McLuhan

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Metaphor Function in Literature**\n\nAnalyze the metaphor "a bulge of colorless slime on a giant spoon" from William Gibson''s text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify and explain the literal and figurative meanings of each element (e.g., "bulge", "colorless slime", "giant spoon").\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how this metaphor evokes an emotionally charged response, referencing the text''s note about castor oil.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this metaphor to the one in O''Neill''s poem, noting similarities in emotional impact and use of metaphorical imagery.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must connect the metaphor''s elements to the broader discussion of metaphors as emotionally charged expressions in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Extended Metaphor Analysis**\n\nExamine Marshall McLuhan''s extended metaphor comparing Time magazine to a tale told to children.\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain three key elements of this metaphor (e.g., "predigested pap", "confidential nudges", "never on his own").\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the metaphor reflects the text''s argument about the role of metaphors in generating prose.\n- **Part C**: Contrast this extended metaphor with Eugene O''Neill''s metaphor about man being born broken, discussing differences in structure and purpose.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of extended metaphors as a literary device for shaping narrative and meaning.'

- prompt: |-
    Notice how the metaphor determines the diction: "slapped and tickled," "predigested pap," "spooned out," "nudges," "never on his own," "mother's knee," "provided with." Even the phrase "as the pages turn" suggests the passivity of a child for whom the baby-sitter turns the pages.

    The other example of an extended metaphor returns us to the passage with which we began this section, Thoreau's comparison of Cape Cod to a bent arm. The image opens a paragraph in the book Cape Cod:

    Cape Cod is the bared and bended arm of Massachusetts: the shoulder is at Buzzard's Bay; the elbow, or crazy-bone, at Cape Mallow; the wrist at Truro; and the sandy fist at Provincetown—behind which the State stands on her guard, with her back to the Green Mountains, and her feet planted on the floor of the ocean, like an athlete protecting her Bay—rbdkiest storms,

    and, ever and anon, heaving up her Atlantic adversary from the lap of the #arthrustefdward her other fist, which keeps

    guard the while upon her breast at Cape Ann.

    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 307

    The figure organizes the entire paragraph, which develops the image of "the bare and bended arm" both by analysis and by expansion. Thoreau breaks it down into its parts—"elbow," "wrist," Aippstiés-eauh of these to Cape Cod. At

    the same time he expands the metaphor into the larger inclusive image of the bfeetr'—"bahky' fist," "hxedst''deiolnneating other parts of

    Massachusetts.

    If you wish to develop a metaphor (or simile), remember that you can work in either of these ways, or even, like Tho-
    reau, in both: inwardly, differentiating the elements of the
    image and relating these to your main topic; or outwardly,
    exploring the larger entity to which the image belongs, as the
    "pared arm" is a natural part of a boxer in a defensive stance.

    Finding Metaphors

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Metaphorical Structures**\n\nUsing Thoreau''s metaphor of Cape Cod as ''the bared and bended arm of Massachusetts,'' construct a metaphor that compares a modern city to a different natural entity, such as a tree, river, or mountain.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a natural entity (e.g., "a tree") and describe how each part of the city corresponds to a part of the entity.\n- **Step 2**: Justify your metaphor by explaining how the relationship between the parts of the city mirrors the relationships within the natural entity.\n- **Step 3**: Analyze how this metaphor reflects broader themes of structure and function, as Thoreau''s does in his description of Cape Cod.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your metaphor must be original and clearly grounded in the text''s discussion of metaphor development.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Extended Metaphors**\n\nExplain how the extended metaphor in Thoreau''s passage about Cape Cod functions as a unifying device, similar to the way in which the metaphor of "the bared and bended arm" is used.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two specific elements of the metaphor (e.g., "elbow," "wrist") and their corresponding parts of Cape Cod.\n- **Step 2**: Describe how these elements contribute to the overall imagery and meaning of the passage.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this approach to the text''s suggestion that a metaphor can be developed both inwardly (by analyzing the image) and outwardly (by exploring the larger entity).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must demonstrate an understanding of how metaphors serve as structural frameworks in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Metaphorical Reasoning**\n\nCreate a metaphor that compares a student''s learning process to a natural phenomenon, such as a river, storm, or season.\n- **Step 1**: Select a natural phenomenon and describe how each stage of the learning process corresponds to a phase of the phenomenon.\n- **Step 2**: Justify your metaphor by explaining the functional relationships between the parts of the learning process and the parts of the natural phenomenon.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on how this metaphor aligns with the text''s discussion of metaphors as tools for understanding complex ideas.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your metaphor must be original, clearly structured, and demonstrate an ability to apply metaphorical reasoning to abstract concepts.'

    There is no formula for creating metaphors. Sometimes the
    literal detail of a scene lends itself to figurative use, as in the
    following sentence explaining why the writer was not allowed
    into a large office to observe the regimented life of clerks:

    I knew those rooms were back there, but couldn't get past the
    opaque glass doors any more than could get past the opaque glass
    Smiles. Barbara Carson

    Another source of metaphor is metonymy, which describes
    something in terms of an associated quality. Here is a sentence
    about the coming of spring in which birdsongs are described
    as if they were, themselves, birds:

    The birds have started singing in the valley. Their February squawks
    and naked chirps are fully fledged now, and lprigs fly in the
    air. Annie Dillard

    More often, however, a metaphor or simile involves a com-
    parison which, while apt and revealing, does not grow natu-
    rally out of the subject as do the images by Garson and

    308 DICTION

    Dillard. For instance one philosopher discusses the style of
    another like this:

    The style is not, as philosophic style should be, so transparent a
    medium that one looks straight through it at the object, forgetting
    that it is there; it is too much like a window of stained glass which,
    because of its very richness, diverts attention to itself.

    Brand Blanshard

    But whether a metaphor arises from "inside" the subject
    or from "outside," its coming depends on imagination. There
    is no magic for discovering metaphors. It is a talent, and some
    people are more adept at seeing resemblances than the rest of
    us. Still, we can all profit from letting our minds run free from
    inhibitions. In a first draft don't be frightened of a simile or
    metaphor, even if it sounds far-fetched.

    Using Metaphors Effectively

    When you revise, however, become more detached and crit-
    ical about figures (as about all phases of your writ-
    ing). To use metaphors and similes effectively, remember
    these principles:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Metaphor and Simile in Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the metaphor used in Brand Blanshard''s quote: ''The style is too much like a window of stained glass which, because of its very richness, diverts attention to itself.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the subject and the simile/metaphor.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the metaphor illuminates the nature of the author''s style.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this metaphor with the simile in Annie Dillard''s sentence: ''Their February squawks and naked chirps are fully fledged now, and lprigs fly in the air.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must demonstrate an understanding of how metaphors and similes function in literary context and how they reveal deeper meanings.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Creative Use of Metaphor in Writing**\n\nCompose a metaphor that effectively describes the process of learning a new skill, incorporating at least two elements from the text (e.g., ''opaque glass doors'' or ''stained glass window'').\n- **Step 1**: Choose a metaphor that aligns with the theme of growth or transformation.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how each element in your metaphor relates to aspects of learning.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this metaphor is appropriate based on the text''s discussion of metaphor creation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a clear, original metaphor and demonstrate an understanding of the principles outlined in the text regarding effective metaphor use.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Metaphorical Language**\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the metaphor ''The birds have started singing in the valley.

- prompt: "[> Metaphors and Similes Should Be Fresh and Original  \nAvoid trite figures: \"quiet as a mouse,\" \"white as a sheet,\"  \n\"the game of life,\" \"a tower of strength.\" Clever humorists  \ncan make such clichés work for them, but only by playing  \nupon their staleness. If you can think of nothing more original  \nthan \"his face was white as a sheet,\" you are better off saying  \nsimply, \"His face was very white.\"\"\n\n3. As mentioned on pp. 198-99, such trite similes and metaphors may be described as \"dying,\" to distinguish them from figures already dead. Dead metaphors are those that have passed beyond the figure and acquired a new literal sense. They are perfectly  \nlegitimate, and you should not feel doubtful about them. Once \"mouth of a  \nriver\" was probably a fresh and vivid image.

Can you imagine a town hall in a pasture, nibbling  \ngrass and swatting flies with its tail?  \n\n[> Metaphors and Similes Should Be Appropriate to the  \nContext  \n\nFigures of speech have their own levels of formality and in-  \nformality. Even when it does not possess a specifically  \nward connotations, a simile or metaphor must not be too col-  \nloquial or too learned for the occasion. It would not do to  \nwrite in a paper for a history professor that \"Napoleon went  \nthrough Russia like a dose of salts.\"\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Metaphors and Similes in Context**\n\nConsider the metaphor: "The town hall has been weathered by cold winds and harsh snows like an old mare turned out to graze."\n- **Part A**: Explain why this metaphor is inappropriate for describing a town hall.

Justify your choice with references to the text''s guidelines on figurative language.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of how vehicle selection affects clarity and appropriateness in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating Dead Metaphors**\n\nExplain why the phrase "mouth of a river" is considered a dead metaphor according to the text.\n- **Part A**: Describe what makes a metaphor ''dead'' based on the text''s definition.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from everyday language that is also a dead metaphor, and explain its evolution from a fresh figure to a literal expression.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between living and dead metaphors as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creating Effective Figurative Language**\n\nWrite a metaphor or simile that is appropriate for a formal academic essay, following the guidelines from the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify the vehicle (the comparison) and the tenor (the subject being compared).\n- **Part B**: Explain why this figure of speech is suitable for the context, referencing the text''s advice on formality and appropriateness.\n- **Part C**: Compare your metaphor to a trite simile like "quiet as a mouse," explaining why it is more effective.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how to craft fresh and appropriate figurative language without relying on clichés.'

    Metaphors and Similes Should Not Be Awkwardly Mixed

    When several similes or metaphors appear in the same passage, they ought to harmonize in thought and image. Mixtures like the following are awkward at best and silly at worst:

    The moon, a silver coin hung in the draperies of the enchanted night, fled her glance, which gilded the rooftops with a joyful phosphorescence.

    This sounds oppressive—tantalizing about the picture it so lushly describes. If the moon is a "coin" how can "she" "let fall [a] glance"? How can "silver" be used for gilding, which means to cover with gold? Why mix the three elements of silver, gold, and phosphorus? Can "phosphorescence" be "joyful"? Do "coins" hang in "draperies"?

    Even dead metaphors and similes must be mixed carefully. Although such expressions no longer have figurative value, they can bring each other embarrassingly to life. The dead metaphors, "mouth of a river" and "leg of a journey," for instance, work well enough alone, but it would be clumsy to write that "the last leg of our journey began at the mouth of the river."

    You must be careful, too, about the other, nonfigurative words you use with a simile or metaphor, even when these words are to be read literally. Because this writer was careless with his contextual diction, his metaphor fails:

    The teacher leaves the students to develop the foundations of their education.

    "Foundations," of course, are "built" or "laid," not "developed."

    > Metaphors and Similes Should Not Be Overworked

    Metaphors and similes ought not to be sprinkled about profusely, especially in expository writing. Even when they do not clash, too many are likely to cancel one another. Their rarity is their being relatively uncommon, for

    if every other sentence contains a simile or a metaphor, readers soon begin to discount them.

    Personification, really a special kind of metaphor, is referring
    to inanimate things or to abstractions as if they were human.
    A simple instance of personification is the use of personal
    pronouns to refer to objects, as when sailors speak of a ship
    as "she." Here is a more subtle instance, a description of the
    social changes in an area of London:
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 311

    As London increased, however, rank and fashion rolled off to the
    west, and trade, creeping on at their heels, took possession of their
    deserted abodes. Washington Irving

    "Rank" and "fashion" signify aristocratic Londoners;
    "trade" designates the merchant class. These abstractions are
    personified by the verbs: the aristocrats "roll off" elegantly
    in carriages, the tradesmen "creep" in with the deference of
    self-conscious inferiors.

    The purpose of personification is to explain, expand, vivify:

    There is a rowdy strain in American life, living close to the surface
    but running very deep. Like an ape behind a mask it can display
    itself suddenly with terrifying effect. It is slack-jawed, with leering
    eyes and loose wet lips, with heavy feet and ponderous cunning
    hands; now and then when something tickles it, it guffaws, and
    when it is angry it snarls; and it can be aroused more easily than
    it can be quieted. Mike Fink and Yankee Doodle helped to father
    it, and Judge Lynch is one of its creations; and when it comes lum-
    bering forth it can make the whole country step in time to its own
    irregular pulse beat. Bruce Catton

    Personification (or perhaps "animalification")

    makes his point with extraordinary clarity and strength:
    mindless savagery is no abstraction; it is an ever-present
    menace.

    Allusions

    An allusion is a brief reference to a well-known person, place,
    or happening. Sometimes the reference is explicitly identified:

    As it is, he is like that man in The Pilgrim's Progress, by some ac-
    counted man, who the more he cast away the more he had.
    W. Hudson

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Personification in Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the passage from Bruce Catton''s text: ''There is a rowdy strain in American life... and when it comes lum-bering forth it can make the whole country step in time to its own irregular pulse beat.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify which elements of the passage are personified. Explain why these elements are considered personified using the definition provided in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the personification serves to convey the idea of ''mindless savagery'' as an ever-present menace. Justify your reasoning with examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this use of personification to the example given by Washington Irving in the text. Highlight at least two similarities and one difference in how the authors use personification to communicate their messages.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the definitions provided in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of the purpose and effects of personification in literature.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Allusion Analysis**\n\nExamine the sentence from W.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Figurative Language**\n\nThe text defines personification as ''referring to inanimate things or abstractions as if they were human.'' Consider the phrase: ''the aristocrats "roll off" elegantly in carriages, the tradesmen "creep" in with the deference of self-conscious inferiors'' from Washington Irving''s passage.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the verbs ''roll off'' and ''creep'' are considered personification based on the definition provided.\n- **Part B**: Use logical reasoning to explain how this type of personification helps the reader understand the social dynamics between the aristocrats and the tradesmen.\n- **Part C**: Construct an original example of personification that demonstrates your understanding of the concept. Your example must include at least two inanimate objects or abstractions and show how they are given human characteristics.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the definition provided in the text and demonstrate a clear ability to apply the concept of personification in both analysis and original creation.'

    More often the reference is indirect, and the writer depends
    on the reader's recognizing the source and significance:

    We [Western peoples] tend to have a Micawberish attitude toward
    life, a feeling that so long as we do not get too excited something
    is certain torn up. Barbara Ward

    A writer making an allusion should be reasonably sure that it
    will be familiar. Barbara Ward, for instance, could fairly refer
    to Mr. Micawber, confident that her readers know Dickens's
    David Copperfield to remember Mr. Micawber,
    burdened by family and debt, yet cheerfully optimistic that
    some lucky chance will rescue him from ruin.

    Some allusions are not to persons, but to well known passages—from the Bible, say, or a line from Shakespeare.
    The passage may be paraphrased or quoted literally, although
    it is not usually enclosed in quotation marks. There is no
    question of plagiarizing; the writer assumes readers know
    what he or she is doing. In this sentence, for instance, the
    allusion is to the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes (3:1-8):

    I didn't know whether should appear before is yotirmdhere
    to show and a time to hide; there is a time to speak, and also a
    time to be silent. Norman Brown

    While many allusions are from literature, some refer
    to historical events or people, ancient or more recent:

    These galactic monstrous states, are not natural beings.
    . . . [Moloch was an ancient Semitic deity to whom children were
    sacrificed. ] Suzanne K. Langer

    And it is not opinions or thoughts that Time provides its readers as
    news comment. Rather, the newsreel is provided with a razzle-
    dazzle accompaniment of Spike Jones noises. [Spike Jones was a
    popular orchestra leader of the 1940s for wacky, comic
    arrangements of light classics and pop tunes. He used automobile
    horns, cow bells, steam whistles, and so on.]* Marshall McLuhan

- prompt: |-
    Whatever the source of an allusion, its purpose is to enrich
    meaning by packing into a few words a complex set of ideas
    or feelings. Think, for instance, of how much is implied by
    describing a politician's career as "Napoleonic," or an acci-
    dent as being "Titanic."

    But remember that to work at all, allusions must be (1)
    appropriate to your point and (2) within the experience of
    your readers.

    Irony

    Irony consists of using words in a sense very different from
    their usual meaning. The simplest case occurs when a term is
    given its opposite value. Here, for example, a historian de-
    scribes a party at the court of the English king James I:

    Later the company flocked to the windows to look into the palace
    courtyard below. Here a vast company had already assembled to
    watch the King's bears fight with greyhounds, and mastiffs bait a
    tethered bull. These delights were succeeded by tumblers on tight-
    ropes and displays of horsemanship. c. p. v. Akrigg

    By "delights" we are expected to understand "abominations," "detestable acts of cruelty."

    In subtler form, irony plays more lightly over words, per-
    vading an entire passage rather than twisting any single word
    into its opposite. An instance occurs in this sentence (the
    writer is commenting on the decline of the medieval ideal of
    the knight):

    4. The fact that it is necessary to explain who Spike Jones was indicates that
    allusions to contemporary people and events may quickly become dated.
    314 DICTION

    In our end of time the chevalier has become a Knight of Pythias,
    or Columbus, or the Temple, who solemnly girds on sword and
    armor past his own drugstore. Monis Bishop

    None of Bishop's words means its reverse; the sentence is
    to be read literally. Still, Bishop intends us to smile at con-
    temporary men playing at knighthood. The irony lies in the
    fact that some of the words ought not to be taken literally.
    Twentieth-century businessmen ought not to "solemnly gird
    on sword and armor," blithely unaware of the disparity be-
    tween knightly ideals and modern life.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Irony in Literary Context**\n\nAnalyze the following passage from Monis Bishop: "In our end of time the chevalier has become a Knight of Pythias, or Columbus, or the Temple, who solemnly girds on sword and armor past his own drugstore."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the irony in this sentence. Explain how the words are used in a sense different from their usual meaning.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this form of irony to the example given by the author (the historian describing a party at James I''s court). Discuss the difference between ''simple'' and ''subtler'' forms of irony as described in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your interpretation using specific examples from the text, including the definition of irony provided.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both types of irony and their application in literary contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Creative Use of Allusion in Writing**\n\nCreate a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that uses an allusion to enrich the meaning of your text. Ensure that: \n- The allusion is appropriate to your point and within the experience of your readers. \n- The allusion is not dated or obscure. \n- Your paragraph must include at least one word that implies a complex set of ideas or feelings, as demonstrated by the examples in the text (e.g., ''Napoleonic'' for a politician''s career).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must effectively use an allusion to convey a nuanced meaning without relying on reference material.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analysis of Irony in Historical Context**\n\nExamine the example from the historian describing a party at James I''s court: "These delights were succeeded by tumblers on tightropes and displays of horsemanship."\n- **Step 1**: Explain how the word ''delights'' is used in a sense very different from its usual meaning. \n- **Step 2**: Compare this to the irony in Bishop''s passage, focusing on how both examples use language to highlight social or cultural contrasts. \n- **Step 3**: Discuss the role of irony in revealing underlying values or judgments about society, as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of irony and allusion from the text to analyze literary devices in historical contexts.'

    Disparity is the common denominator in both these examples of irony: the difference between the ideal and the actual, between what we profess and what we do, between what we expect and what we get. In stressing such disparities, irony is fundamentally different from simile and metaphor, which build upon similarity. The whole point of irony is that things are not what they seem or what they should be or what we want them to be. They are different.

    Irony reveals the differences in various ways. One is by using words in a double sense, making them signify both the ideal and the actual ("delights"). Another is by juxtaposing images of what could be (or once was) and of what is (the chevalier girding on his sword and the neighborhood drug-gist). Either way, we are made conscious of the gap between "ought" and "is": people ought to treat dumb animals kindly; they do take pleasure in torturing them.

    The writer employing irony must be sure that his or her readers will understand the special value of the words. Sometimes one can depend on the general knowledge and attitudes of the audience. The ironic sense of Akrigg's "delights" is clear because modern readers know that such amusements are not delightful.

    But sometimes irony must be signaled, as in this passage by the historian Barbara Tuchman (she is discussing the guilt of the Nazi leaders):

    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 315

    When it comes to guilt, a respected writer—respectable
    middle-aged man—has given his considered verdict on the Nazi program,
    that evil is commonplace—that means something so ordinary that
    you are not bothered by it; the dictionary definition is "commonplace and hackneyed." Somehow that conclusion does not seem adequate or even apt. Of course, evil is commonplace; of course we all partake of it. Does that mean that we must withhold disapproval, and that when evil appears in dangerous degree or vicious form we must not condemn but only understand?

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Irony''s Core Concept**\n\nGiven the definition of irony as ''the difference between the ideal and the actual,'' explain how the phrase "delights" in Akrigg''s text is an example of irony.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the ideal meaning of "delights."\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the actual meaning conveyed by the context.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this disparity constitutes irony, referencing the text''s assertion that ''irony is fundamentally different from simile and metaphor.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the dual meaning and its implications for the text''s message.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Irony in Historical Context**\n\nExplain how Barbara Tuchman''s use of irony in her passage critiques the notion that ''evil is commonplace.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the ironic contrast between the writer''s assertion and the reader''s expectation.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the text uses juxtaposition to highlight this contrast (e.g., the ''respectable middle-aged man'' vs. the Nazi program).\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this irony for the reader''s understanding of moral responsibility, based on the text''s assertion that ''irony reveals the gap between "ought" and "is."''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the historical context with the literary device of irony, showing how it challenges the reader''s assumptions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Irony in Figurative Language**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of irony in Akrigg''s text and Tuchman''s passage.\n- **Part A**: Describe the two types of irony presented (verbal vs. situational).\n- **Part B**: Analyze how each author signals their ironic intent (e.g., contextual clues, reader assumptions).\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the effectiveness of each use of irony in conveying the authors'' messages, referencing the text''s claim that ''irony is fundamentally different from simile and metaphor.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your comparison must demonstrate a deep understanding of irony''s role in figurative language and its distinct characteristics.'

    The specifically ironic words are "respected" and "considered verdict." The first is cued by the qualification "respected in some circles," with its barbed insinuation: "respected, but not by you or me." "Considered verdict" is pushed into irony not so much by any particular cue as by the total context. If "banality" is the only judgment the other writer can make, her jualgityenter{Huchmith suggests—is
    ering. "Verdict" has another ironic overtone. The word
    signifies a judicial decision, and Tuchman implies that her
    Opponent is presumptuous in delivering a verdict as if she
    were judge and jury.

    In other ways, too, Tuchman reveals her feelings and thus
    contributes to the tone of irony. The repetition of the itali-
    cized "of course" implies the commonplaceness of the ideas.
    And the rhetorical question, stressing the undeniable truth of
    Tuchman's point, underscores the folly she is attacking.

    Irony may be used in a variety of tones. Some irony is
    genial, amusing and amused, like that by Morris Bishop. Some
    is more serious (Akrigg) or even angry (Tuchman). But what-
    ever its tone, irony contributes significantly to a writer's per-
    sona. It is a form of aombtante-fenougthus
    it represents an intrusion of the writer into the writing. He
    or she stands forth, moreover, in a special way: as a subtle,
    complex, witty presence, deliberately using intellect to dis-
    tance emotion. This does not mean that irony diminishes
    emotion. On the contrary: irony acts like a lens, concentrating
    the emotions focused through it. But it does mean that irony
    constrains emotion rather than allowing it to gush.

    Irony, finally, may function in prose in two ways: (1) as a
    specific figure of speech, a device for expressing a particular
    judgment; or (2) as a mode of thought, an encompassing vi-
    sion of people and events. In this broad aspect irony is the
    stance some writers take toward life. They alone may prop-
    erly be described as ironists. The rest of us, though we are
    not ironists in this deeper sense, can profitably use irony now
    and then.

    Overstatement and Understatement

    Overstatement and understatement are special kinds of irony.
    Each depends on the disparity between the reality the writer
    describes and the words he or she uses. Overstatement ex-
    aggerates the subject, magnifying it beyond its true dimen-
    sions. Understatement takes the opposite tack: the words are
    intentionally inadequate to the reality.

    Overstatement

    The rhetorical name for overstatement is hyperbole, from a
    Greek word meaning "excess." Loosely speaking, there are
    two kinds of overstatement: comic and serious. Like carica-
    ture, comic hyperbole ridicules or burlesques by enlargement.
    Comic overstatement has deep roots in American literature.
    It is a major element in the tales told by such folk heroes
    as Mike Fink, Brey Crockett. Much of Mark Twain's
    humor depends on overstatement. Here, for instance, is a pas-
    sage from his essay "The Awful German Language," included
    in A Tramp Abroad:

    An average sentence in a German newspaper, is a sublime and
    impressive curiosity; @ccupies a quarter of a column; it contains
    all the ten parts of seecjulamortder, but mixed; it is

    built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the

    Serious overstatement differs only in its end, which is per-
    suasion rather than laughter. The writer may wish to impress
    us with the value of something or to shock us into seeing a
    hard truth. Shock is the tactic of H. L. Mencken, who cudgels
    what he regarded as the venality, stupidity, and smugness of
    life in the 1920s:

    It is ... one of my firmest and most sacred beliefs, reached after an
    enquiry extending over a score of years and supported by incessant
    prayer and meditation, that the government of the United States, in
    both its legislative arm and its executive arm, is ignorant, incom-

    318 DICTION

    timorous, sniveling, poltroonish, ignominious mob of serfs and
    goose-steppers ever gathered under one flagchristendom since

    the end of the Middle Ages, and that they grow more timorous,
    more sniveling, more poltroonish, more ignominious every day.

    Comic or serious, overstatement relies on several devices.
    It likes the superlative forms of adjectives, the hugest num-
    bers, the longest spans of time, extremes of all sorts. It prefers
    sweeping generalizations: every, all, always, never, none. It
    admits few qualifications or disclaimers, and if it does qualify,
    it may turn the concession into another exaggerated claim
    (like Mencken's "and from this judgment I except no more
    than twenty living lawmakers"). It rides upon words with
    strong emotional connotations like "sniveling," "poltroon-
    ish," "ignominious," "knavish." Its sentence structure is
    likely to be emphatic, with strong rhythms and frequent rep-
    etitions. Short statements are stressed by being set beside
    longer ones.

    In the hands of writers like Twain or Mencken, over-
    statement is powerful rhetoric, shocking, infuriating, hilari-
    ous. But this very power is a limitation. Overstatement is hard
    to take for very long and quickly loses its capacity to shock
    or amuse. Even worse, overstatement like Mencken's is often
    abused. It is, after all, assertion, not reasoned argument, and
    it easily degenerates into shrill name-calling.

    Understatement

    Understatement stresses importance by seeming to deny it.
    Like overstatement it can be comic or serious. Twain is being
    funny in this passage:

    I have been strictly reared, but if it had not been so dark and solemn
    and awful there in that vast, lonely room, do believe should have
    said something which could not be put into a Sunday-school book
    without injuring the sale of it.

    A special form of understatement is *itotes, a term sometimes used as a synonym for understatement in general. More narrowly it means emphasizing a positive by doubling a negative as when we express admiration for a difficult tennis player by exclaiming, "Not bad," or stress someone's bravery by saying that he "did not play the coward."

    Whatever we call it, understatement is a powerful figure of speech. To naive readers it sometimes seems callous or insensitive: some of Swift's contemporaries, for example, thought his irony to be mere cruelty. But when it really connects with subject and reader, understatement is more explosive than hyperbole.

    Puns

    A pun is a word employed in two or more senses, or a word used in a context that suggests a second term sounding like it. In either case the two meanings must interact, usually, though not necessarily, in a humorous way. In the first of the two following examples, the pun depends on different senses of the same word; in the second, on one word's sounding like another:

    A cannon-ball took off his legs, so he laid down his arms.
    Thomas Hood

    During the two previous centuries musical styles went in one era and out the other... . Frank Muir

    While puns resemble irony in simultaneously using words in different senses, they differ in important ways. For one thing, a pun is today almost exclusively a device of humor (though in earlier centuries poets and dramatists often em-
    ployed puns for serious meanings). Here, for instance, Mark Twain makes a joke by punning on the expression "raising chickens":

    Even as a schoolboy poultry-raising was a study with me, and I may say without egotism that as early as the age of seventeen was acquainted with all the best and speediest methods of raising chickens, from raising them off a roost by burning Lucifer matches under their noses, down to lifting them off a fence on a frosty night by insinuating a warm board under their feet.

But a good pun—one  \nboth clever and vevedlingakisg.\n\nZeugma\n\nZeugma (pronounced ZOOG-ma) is a special kind of pun  \ninvolving a verb used with two or more objects, but with a  \ndifference of meaning. Here the novelist Lawrence Durrell is  \ndescribing the plight of a maiden chased by lustful monks:\n  \nJoanna, pursued by the three monks, ran about the room, leaping  \nover tables and chairs, sometimes throwing a dish or a scriptural  \nmaxim at her pursuers.\n\nAnd here is a wry d&fimiann:\n\nPiane,parlor utensil for subduing the impenitent visitor. It is  \noperated by depressing the keys of the machine and the spirits of  \nthe audience. Ambrose Bierce\n\nZeugma, like puns generally, is a comic figure of speech. It  \nis witty and amusing, and increases meaning by linking dis-  \nparities: Pwirellisf dishes and scriptural maxims re-  \nveals their equal inefficacy in Joanna's plight.\n\nImagery\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Punning and Literary Devices**\n\nAnalyze the pun involving ''atrophy'' in the passage: "The Road to Filthown the Spreading Atrophy." Explain how this pun connects to the concept of ''low humor'' and the historical context of tranquilizers. Then, compare it with Zeugma as a literary device by describing a scenario where a verb is used with two objects that have different meanings.\n- **Step 1**: Discuss the double meaning of ''atrophy'' in relation to the text''s mention of tranquilizers.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with Zeugma, providing an example from literature or everyday life.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on how both devices reveal unexpected similarities, as noted by S.J. Perelman.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of the historical context and literary analysis without reference to the text beyond what is provided.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Creative Application of Zeugma in Narrative**\n\nCreate a short narrative (3-4 sentences) that uses Zeugma as the central device. The story should involve a character interacting with two objects or concepts, where the verb used with both has different meanings. Include at least one reference to the example provided by Ambrose Bierce about the ''piano'' and the ''spirits of the audience.''\n- **Step 1**: Introduce the scenario and character.\n- **Step 2**: Use Zeugma with two distinct objects or concepts.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the Zeugma enhances the narrative''s humor or meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the specific elements of Zeugma as defined in the text and reflect on its role in storytelling.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analysis of Puns and Their Social Context**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''puns are unseemly in anything but avowedly humorous writing.'' Use examples from the text (the ''atrophy'' pun, Zeugma) to argue for or against this assertion. Discuss how puns function as a form of social commentary or critique, drawing on S.J. Perelman''s observation about their ability to reveal ''unrealized similarities.''\n- **Part A**: Present a historical perspective on the perception of puns in literature.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the ''atrophy'' pun and Zeugma serve as both humor and social critique.\n- **Part C**: Conclude with your stance on whether puns should be considered unseemly, referencing the text''s discussion of their role in revealing unexpected connections.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of humor, social context, and literary devices as discussed in the text.'

- prompt: "An image is a word or expression that speaks directly to one  \nor more of the senses, as in this description of the Seine in  \nParis:\n\nThe river was brown and green—live-green bridges—  \nand a rainbow-coloured scum floated at the sides. Rrys Jean\n\nImages are classified according to the sense to which they  \nprimarily appeal. Visual images, like those in the sentence  \nabove, are the most common. Next in frequency, probably,  \nare auditory images, directed to the ear:\n\nThe [medieval] house lacked air, light, and comfort modern;  \npeople had little taste for privacy. They lived most of their lives on  \nthe streets, noisy indeed by day, with pounding hammers, scream-  \ning saws, clattering wooden shoes, street cries of vendors of goods  \nand services, and the hand bells of pietists, summoning all to pray  \nfor the soukseefi. Morris Bishop\n\nImages can appeal to other senses: to smell, taste, touch,  \neven to the muscular sense of movement and balance (these  \nare called kinesthetic images). Here, for example, is an in-  \ndictment of the odors of a modern city:\n\n... [T]he reek of gasoline exhaust, the sour smell of a subway  \ncrowd, the pervasive odor of a garbage dump, the sulphurous fumes  \nof a chemical works, the carbolated rankness of a public lavatory  \n... the chlorinated exudation of ordinary drinking water. ...\n\nLewis Mumford\n\nOften an image stimulates two or more senses simultane-  \nously, though it is directed primarily to one. Thus in Rhys's  \nsentence about the Seine, the imagery, while essentially visual,  \nalso suggests the feel of the water and the smell of the scum.\n\nAt their simplest, images re-create sensory experience.  \nBishop makes us \"hear\" a medieval city. In the following  \npassage the writer \"images\" the experience of walking in a  \nsmall stream:\n\nExploring a streambed can be done on a purely sensual level.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Image Classification**\n\nClassify the following images based on the primary sense they appeal to, and explain how they might stimulate additional senses:\n1. "The river was brown and green—live-green bridges—and a rainbow-coloured scum floated at the sides." (Rhys Jean)\n2. "...the reek of gasoline exhaust, the sour smell of a subway crowd, the pervasive odor of a garbage dump..." (Lewis Mumford)\n3. "How it all feels—soft, mossy mud under feet; cold fast mountain..." (Unknown author)\n\n**Task**: For each image, identify the primary sense and then describe at least one additional sense that is indirectly stimulated. Your answer must reference specific examples from the text to support your classification.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Creative Application of Image Stimulation**\n\nDesign a multi-sensory description of a scene that stimulates at least three different senses, using the text''s examples as inspiration:\n- **Part A**: Choose a setting (e.g., a market, a forest, a city street) and describe it using imagery from the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how your description incorporates multiple sensory appeals, citing specific examples from the text to justify your choices.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s discussion of kinesthetic images (movement and balance) could be integrated into your scene.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how different senses can be combined in a single image, as shown in the text''s examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Image Function**\n\nAnalyze the function of imagery in the following passage from the text:\n"Exploring a streambed can be done on a purely sensual level. How it all feels—soft, mossy mud under feet; cold fast mountain..." (Unknown author)\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain how this passage re-creates sensory experience, using examples from the text to support your analysis.\n- **Part B**: Compare this imagery to Bishop''s description of a medieval city in the text. How do the two passages differ in their approach to stimulating senses?\n- **Part C**: Discuss the role of kinesthetic images in enhancing the reader''s experience, using the streambed passage as an example.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate concepts from the text regarding image classification and sensory stimulation.'

    water or the touch of a sun-warmed gentle brook; water wrapping
    itself around your ankles or knees, swirling in little eddies, sparkling
    in small pools, rushing away white and foamy over rapids, or
    calmly meandering over glistening pebbles. Ruth Rucner

    Rasduepison also shows how images may be mixed
    to appeal to several senses. Many of her words are tactile:
    "soft mud under feet," "the touch of a sun-warmed gentle
    brook," "water wrapping itself around your ankles or knees."
    Others are visual: "moss, wet rock," "swirling in little ed-
    dies," "sparkling," "glistening pebbles." Still others, kines-
    thetic: "swirling" again, "rushing away," "calmly
    meandering."

    But images can be stretched to signify more than sensual
    experience. Here, for instance, is a description of a California
    landscape, scene of a murderous love affair:

    324 DICTION

    The lemon groves are sunken, down a three- or four-foot retaining
    wall, so that one looks directly into their foliage, too lush, too un-
    settlingly glossy, the greenery of nightmare; the fallen eucalyptus
    bark is too dusty, a place for snakes to breed. Joan Didion

    Literally these images describe the trees and the bark-
    strewn ground. Yet they suggest unnaturalness and evil too,
    a morbid aura of death. We cannot say that they "mean" evil
    and death, as we may say that the vehicle of a metaphor sig-
    nifies something for which it stands. Nonetheless the images
    have overtones that give the passage a sinister vibrato.

    At times this sort of implication is carried so far that an
    image acquires symbolic value, rendering a complex, abstract
    idea in a sharp perception. At the end of the following sen-
    tence the novelist and essayist George Orwell turns an image
    into a symbol of judgment:

Even  \n\nliteral language is memorable when it is unusual, whether in  \nthe form of uncommon words or of everyday ones used in  \nodd senses or in striking collocations.  \n\nA collocation is a group of words considered as a unit of  \nmeaning. For example, in the sentence \"Ambitious people  \nseek a place in the sun\" the phrase \"a place in the sun\" is a  \ncollocation, a conventional and predictable one in that con-  \ntext. In \"Wise people seek a place in the shadows\" the phrase  \n\"in the shadows\" is, for the context, less usual, more surpris-  \ning.

    Unusual words ought not to be used just because they are
    unusual, but because they are also precise and economic. Auto-
    morphism a native, one born in a

    particular region—country—soots meaning,

    loosely, "the land itself." Thus the word is not simply a fancy
    equivalent to native; it stresses Chesterton's point that patri-
    otism is rooted in soil. Lagniappe, common in Louisiana
    though not elsewhere, is borrowed from American Spanish
    and means something extra thrown in for goodwill, like the
    thirteenth roll in a baker's dozen; it has here the advantage of
    concision, of saying in a single word what otherwise would
    require a phrase of three or four terms. Mumchance, an older
    English word seldom heard today, means "silently," and im-
    plies a shocked, stunned silence.

    Sometimes an unusual word is not foreign or archaic, but
    technical, made striking by being applied outside its normal
    context, like the business terms in this sentence by Rudyard
    Kipling:

    Very minute are the instructions of the Government for the disposal,
    wharfage, and demurrage of its dead.

    UNUSUAL WORDS AND COLLOCATIONS 327

    Here again we see that the unusual words are exactly right.
    Kipling implies the callousness of the British government to-
    ward those who died in its service in India: their coffins
    merchandise, and the charges for loading and storage are care-
    fully calculated.

    Unusual Meanings

    Uncommonness may reside not so much in the rarity of the
    word itself, as in the meaning it carries. A writer may evoke
    an older meaning, closer to the etymological sense. Robert
    Frost, writing about the United States, speaks of the "land
    realizing itself westward." We think of realize as meaning "to
    understand clearly," and we must pause a moment to grasp
    that Frost calls up the older sense of "to make real": the na-
    tion created its reality as it drove westward. And in the fol-
    lowing sentence imagination does not have its common
    meaning of "creative faculty," but rather signifies the pro-
    ductions of that creativity:

    Universities flourished; scholars wrote their profundities and nov-
    elists their imaginations. Moris Bishop

    Everyday words may also be made striking by being shifted out of their usual grammatical roles. Here a writer describing the coming of spring employs "indestructible" as a noun:

    Under the spruce boughs which overlay the borders, the first shoots of snowdrops appeared, the indestructible. E. B. White

    Neologisms

    Neologisms constitute a special class of rare words. Literally "new words," they are made up by the writer. Some are new in being original combinations of phonemes (that is, sounds). James Thurber invents several such neologisms to describe the family car being hit by a trolley:

    Tires booped and whoosed, the fenders qudetedked, the
    steering wheel rose up like a spectre and disappeared in the direc-
    tion of Franklin Avenue with a melancholy whistling sound, bolts
    and gadgets flew like sparks from a Catherine wheel.

    Thurber's coinages are onomatopoeic (imitating sound). In the
    next example the neologism is formed by adding a suffix
    which does not conventionally go with the word (and in the
    process making a pun):

    But once there came to "the grey metropolis" a Finnish lady—a
    most perfect representative of non-Aryan beauty and anythingarian
    chaom--td only men, but what is more wonderful, most

    women, fell captive the moment they saw her. George Saintsbury

    But probably most neologisms are novel compound words.
    Barbara Tuchman describes the most remarkable quality of a
    particular statesman as his tybatbevdamnedness'';
    eler in Sicily complains of the crude duckboards placed for
    tourists around an excavation of beautiful mosaics:

    It was a groan-making thing to do and only an archeologist could
    have thought of it. Lawrence Durrell

    Such constructions are called nonce compounds, which are distinct from the conventional compounds we all use, like teenager or schoolboy. Nonce compounds are usually hyphenated, unlike conventional compounds, some of which are hyphenated and some written as one unit. Occasionally a nonce compound consists of a number of words strung together in a phrase acting as a single grammatical part (usually a modifier) like the ten-word adjectival in this sentence (it modifies a three-word noun):

    UNUSUAL WORDS AND COLLOCATIONS 329

    Unusual Collocations

    An unusual collocation is an unlikely combination of words, each commonplace in itself but rarely used with the other(s). This description of a midwestern steel plant is an example:

    Republic Steel stood abrupt out of the flat prairie. Howard Fast

    We do not think of buildings as "standing abrupt," but for that very reason the diction is memorable, like the structures it describes rearing dominantly out of the flat land. Here are several other instances:

    ... the cracklin®ylea Thomas

    The clammy hauteur of President Hoover.. ..
    Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.

    Under the trees, along the cemented paths go drifts of girls, sym-
    pathetic and charming. . .. William Golding

    Any grammatical nexus may be made unusual; a subject and verb, for instance:

    But her smile was the coup de grace and her sigh buried him
    deep. W. Somerset Maugham

    Or a verb and complement:

    He smiles his disappointments and laughs his angers.
    E. E. Cummings

    Unusual Verbs

    Verbs are a fertile source of implied meanings when joined
    with unlikely subjects or objects:

    But the weeks blurred by and he did not leave. Egy Willard R.
    330 DICTION

    . No &itdsiangd the silence. sunflecked Joan Lindsey

    Often an unusual verb implies a comment:

    The more we prattle about morality, the more the world shows us
    how complicated things really are. Samud c. Floman

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Unusual Collocations in Literary Context**\n\nConsider the sentence: "Republic Steel stood abrupt out of the flat prairie."\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain the unusual collocation ''stood abrupt'' using the definition provided in the text. Why is this combination notable despite both words being common on their own?\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar unusual collocation that could be used to describe a modern setting, such as a city or a digital environment. Justify your choice based on the concept of ''unusual collocations'' from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how unusual combinations can create memorable diction in literature.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Understanding Nonce Compounds in Sentence Structure**\n\nThe sentence provided includes a ten-word adjectival nonce compound: "breathless, gosh-gee-whiz-can-all-this-be-happening-to-me TV-celebrity-author."\n- **Part A**: Explain what a nonce compound is, as defined in the text. How does this differ from conventional compounds like ''teenager'' or ''schoolboy''?\n- **Part B**: Analyze the structure of the nonce compound and its function in the sentence. Why might such a compound be used to modify a noun like "TV-celebrity-author"?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly define nonce compounds and demonstrate an understanding of their grammatical role in sentence construction.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Use of Unusual Verbs in Narrative Writing**\n\nWrite a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that incorporates an unusual verb from the text. The verb should be used in a context that implies a comment or meaning beyond its literal sense.\n- **Part A**: Identify the unusual verb you''ve chosen and explain why it is considered unusual based on the text''s examples.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of this verb contributes to the overall tone or theme of your paragraph.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must showcase an understanding of how unusual verbs can convey deeper meaning in writing.'

- prompt: |-
    The cops squealed with excitement. Howard Fast

    ..and then the hideous mannequins galumphed with squeaky
    sBoeStage. Nancy Mitford

    Each of those verbs carries adverse connotations. "Prattle"
    suggests childishness; "squealed," a piglike quality; "gal-
    umph," comic awkwardness. And each enriches its passage,
    implying considerably more than it literally states.

    Unusual Adjectives

    Many other striking collocations involve a modifier (typically
    an adjective) and its headword, as in Dylan Thomas's "the
    crackling sea." One variety of such adjectives is known as a
    transferred eporketassomarily applied to a partic-

    ular noun or class of nouns which is used instead to modify
    something associated with that noun, as in "a boiling kettle."
    Here is a more original example:

    He would sit upstairs in his angry overalls, too angry to come down
    tduncheon. Harold Nicholson

    Oxymoron and Rhetorical Paradox

    When the oddity of a collocation becomes seemingly contra-
    dictory, it is called an oxymoron. A famous instance is John
    Milton's description of hell as "darkness visible." In an ox-
    ymoron the modifier appears to contradict its headword:

    A rhetorical paradox is an oxymoron writ large. (An oxy-
    moron, in fact, has been defined as a "condensed paradox.")
    It too expresses an apparent contradiction, and differs only in
    being longer and in not condensing the contradiction into a
    headword and modifier:

    His soul will never starve for exploits or excitement who is wise
    enough to be made a fool of. c. K. Chesterton

    Oxymoron and rhetorical paradox must not be confused
    with the logical paradox, which asserts that something is si-
    multaneously both true and not true, thus violating what lo-
    gicians call the law of noncontradiction. A classic example is:

    "All Cretans are liars," said a Cretan.

    A rhetorical paradox, on the other hand, does not contain a
    true contradiction. It may seem to. Chesterton appears to be
    saying something that is logically pasakboxical—can
    consist of being made a fool of? But the appearance vanishes
    when we understand that Chesterton is using "wise" and
    "fool" in special, though not unique, senses. By "wise" he
    means simple and pure in spirit, unworldly and good. By
    "fool," he means a trusting innocent, rather than a self-
    deluded egotist, the word's usual sense.

    Another kind of rhetorical paradox is less an apparent self-
    contradiction than an actual contradiction of a commonly ac-
    cepted belief:

    Baseball is an interminable game played by overgrown boys who
    have nothing better to do for the amusement of loafers who have
    nothing to do at all.

    That unlikely sentence contains no inner contradiction, ap-
    parent or real, but it violently disagrees with conventional
    attitudes.

    Paradoxes of this sort may take the form of standing a cli-
    che or popular maxim on its head. Someone remarked, for
    instance, that the German General Staff "has a genius for
    snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." Oscar Wilde
    mocked Victorian morality by reversing the smug judgment
    that "drink is the curse of the working class"; he put it that

    Accumulation, or Piling Up

    Accumulation, as we use it here, means stringing together a
    number of words, all the same part of speech and grammatically parallel, that is, connected to the same thing. Most commonly the words are a series of verbs serving the same subject or of adjectives attached to the same headword:

    and posed. Beverley Nichols"

    The unusualness of such diction lies not in unconventional or
    paradoxical combinations but in sheer quantity, and of
    course, in quality.

    Mixed Levels of Usage

    Level of usage means the degree of formality or of informality
    associated with a word. Some words have a limited range of
    appropriateness. They are suitable, say, for formal but not
    informal occasions (pedagogue). Contrarily, another word is
    at home in a colloquial atmosphere but not in a formal one
    (prof). But of course most words are always acceptable
    (teacher), and are not limited by usage restrictions.

    It is possible to achieve unusual diction by mixing words
    from different usage levels so that learned literary terms rub
    elbows with colloquialisms and slang:

    Rolo's language is generally literary (that is, belonging to formal, written prose): "moral fabric," "antithetical motifs," "transgressors," "philosophies of power," "intermittently," "priest-hero," "psychoanalyst." At the same time he works in colloquialisms: "he-man," "tough guy," "terrific sock on the jaw," "hankering." The diction is unpredictable. It sur-
    prises and thereby pleases us.

    But the mix achieves surprise and novelty without sacrificing exactness or economy. Indeed both the literary and the colloquial terms are justifiable for their precision. "Priest-
    hero," for example, sets the detective story into the wider framework of literature and folktale. "He-man" nicely suits the flavor of the tough private-eye fiction Rolo is discussing.

    It is possible to play off formal and colloquial language even more strikingly. In the following passage the journalist A. J. Liebling is describing fight fans, specifically those rooting for the other guy:

    Such people may take it upon themselves to disparage the principal
    you are advising. This disparagement is less generally addressed to
    the man himself (as /@idvélanjthan to hisbapwd}

    nent, whom they have wrongheadedly picked to win.

    Liebling comically contrasts the deliberately inflated diction
    describing the fans' behavior ("disparage the principal you are
    advising") and the language they actually use ("Gavilan, you're a bum!"').

    Improving Your Vocabulary:
    Dictionaries

    Vocabulary is best extended by reading and writing. Memorizing lists of words has dubious value. The words are abstracted from any context, so that while you may learn the
    denotation you acquire little feeling for connotation and level of usage. Vocabulary should not be a forced plant but should grow naturally with learning and experience.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Formal and Colloquial Language in Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the excerpt from Rolo''s text, where he uses terms like ''priest-hero'' and ''he-man'' to describe literary figures. How do these unconventional word choices enhance the reader''s understanding of the narrative?\n- **Step 1**: Define ''priest-hero'' and ''he-man'' using the text''s context.\n- **Step 2**: Compare these terms with more traditional descriptors (e.g., ''detective'', ''private-eye'') to highlight their unique contributions to characterization.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this linguistic strategy reflects Rolo''s broader approach to literary analysis, as hinted in the text''s discussion of ''antithetical motifs'' and ''moral fabric''.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly connect the unconventional terms to their literary functions and demonstrate an understanding of Rolo''s stylistic philosophy.'

    Back matter, too, varies from book to book. Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, for instance, discusses punctuation in its back matter and includes lists of famous persons, of important places, and of colleges in the United States and Canada. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language does not cover punctuation but includes people and places in the general word list.

    Although the front and the back matter contain much important information, the chief part of a dictionary is its word list. To use the word list efficiently you need to understand how entries are organized and the kind of information they give. We'll look at two typical entries in some detail. But first a caution: while a dictionary is an authority, its authority is of a special and limited nature. It does not tell you how a word should be spelled or spoken or used; it simply tells you how it is spelled or spoken or used. The forms and meanings of words depend on the speakers and writers of English. Acting in unconscious collectivity, we, all of us— constitute the "authority." Lexicographers collect hundreds, even thousands, of citations for each word they list. From these they determine how the word is actually pronounced and spelled, what meanings it is given, and any regional, social or occupational facts affecting its use. If a lexicographer has personal feelings about spelling, pronunciation, or definition, he or she does not substitute these for what the citations reveal.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Dictionary Structure**\n\nUsing the information provided in the text, explain how both front matter and back matter contribute to a dictionary''s overall utility.\n- **Step 1**: Define what front matter and back matter are based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Provide an example of each type from the text (e.g., punctuation in Webster''s dictionary as front matter, famous persons in American Heritage as back matter).\n- **Step 3**: Justify how both types of material complement the word list to enhance a user''s understanding of English.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must include at least two specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of their roles within the dictionary structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Lexicographical Authority**\n\nThe text emphasizes that dictionaries do not dictate how words should be used, but instead report on how they are actually used. Using this concept, evaluate the claim: "Dictionaries are authorities because they list the correct spellings and definitions."\n- **Step 1**: Explain why the text argues against this claim.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a counterexample from the text that demonstrates dictionaries do not enforce spelling or usage norms.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how the collaborative nature of lexicography reflects the collective authority of English speakers.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate direct quotes or paraphrased ideas from the text and clearly articulate the distinction between dictionary authority and prescriptive rules.'

    The exact arrangement of information in a typical entry will vary a bit among dictionaries. But they all list words according to a principle of alphabetization explained in the front matter, and they all indicate spelling (along with any variations), stress, syllabication, pronunciation, grammatical function (verb, noun, adjective, and so on), the different senses in which the word is used (the order of these may be historical or it may be according to frequency), and usually information about the word's etymology (that is, its origin and history).

    Here are two sample entries, each with explanations. The first is from Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary:

    The second example comes from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (see pages 340-345).

    Unabridged Dictionaries

    Occasionally you will come across a word not in your desk dictionary. Turn then to an unabridged work. The standard for American English is Webster's Third New International Dictionary (G. & C. Merriam Company). This is the volume you find in most libraries, usually on its own stand and open somewhere near the middle. (It should be left that way to protect the binding.)

    Webster's Third New International lists more than 450,000 words, including many older expressions and technical terms omitted from abridgments. In addition to the customary explanations, its front matter contains extensive discussions of spelling, punctuation, plural forms, the use of italics, and the handling of compound words. Accompanying the word list are thousands of illustrations (a few in the form of color plates) and numerous tables (the chemical elements, for instance, the Indo-European language family, radio frequencies, time zones, and so on).

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Dictionary Entry Structure**\n\nBased on the information provided in the text about dictionary entries and their organization, explain how a dictionary entry for the word ''unabridged'' would be structured.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary definition of ''unabridged'' as it relates to dictionaries.\n- **Step 2**: List two additional pieces of information that would typically appear in a dictionary entry for this word, based on the text''s description of dictionary conventions.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your reasoning by referencing the text''s explanation of how dictionaries list words according to a principle of alphabetization and include details about spelling, stress, syllabication, and grammatical function.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of dictionary structure and incorporate at least two specific elements mentioned in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Dictionary Etymology and Usage**\n\nThe text mentions that dictionaries often include information about a word''s etymology. Considering this, construct a dictionary entry for the word ''dictionary'' based on the following criteria:\n- **Part A**: Provide the primary definition of ''dictionary'' as it relates to the concept of a reference work.\n- **Part B**: Include an etymological note that traces the origin of the word to its Latin roots, using the text''s explanation of how dictionaries indicate word origins.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the word ''dictionary'' is used in different senses (as per the text''s mention of multiple senses in dictionary entries).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your entry must integrate the information about etymology and multiple meanings provided in the text, with clear examples for each part.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Dictionary Principles to a New Word**\n\nThe text describes how dictionaries handle compound words and technical terms. Imagine you are adding a new word to your personal dictionary: ''smartphone''.\n- **Part A**: Explain how this word would be organized in a dictionary according to the principle of alphabetization, citing specific details from the text about spelling and syllabication.\n- **Part B**: Identify two additional pieces of information that would typically accompany this entry, based on the text''s discussion of dictionary conventions.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the structure of a dictionary entry for ''smartphone'' reflects the text''s emphasis on consistency in spelling and pronunciation guidelines.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of dictionary organization and incorporate at least two specific elements mentioned in the text.'

It lists older words than the Third New International and arranges definitions in historical order, illustrating each sense by dated quotations (totaling about 1,800,000). These begin with the earliest known use of a word in a particular sense and include, if possible, at least one instance for every century thereafter until the present (or until the last known example in the case of obsolete words or meanings). The dated citations make the OED indispensable for scholars studying the history of words or ideas.

    On the other hand, the OED is less useful for American English. For example, someone curious about the meaning of Chicago pool or the origin of OK will have to consult Webster's Third New International. Both unabridged dictionaries are necessary to a serious writer.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Dictionary Definitions**\n\nUsing the provided definitions for ''habit'' and related terms (habitude, practice, usage), create a coherent paragraph that illustrates how these concepts interrelate in everyday life. Your paragraph must include at least three distinct examples from different contexts (e.g., personal behavior, professional settings, cultural practices).\n- **Example 1**: Describe a personal habit (e.g., morning routine) and explain how it reflects ''habit'' as defined in the text.\n- **Example 2**: Explain a professional practice (e.g., business etiquette) and connect it to the concept of ''usage'' or ''custom''.\n- **Example 3**: Discuss a cultural tradition (e.g., holiday customs) and relate it to ''habitude'' or ''practice''.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference at least three definitions from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how these terms differentiate yet overlap in meaning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Dictionary Entries**\n\nCompare and contrast the definitions of ''habit'' (as presented in the text) with those of ''custom'', ''usage'', and ''practice''. Construct a table that clearly distinguishes their meanings based on the following criteria:\n- **Scope**: Is the term referring to individual behavior, group norms, or broader societal patterns?\n- **Formation**: Does the term imply learned behavior through repetition, cultural transmission, or inherent traits?\n- **Function**: Does it reflect personal character, social expectations, or systematic occurrences?\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Fill in the table with clear distinctions for each term.\n- **Part B**: Provide a real-world example that best fits each category and explain why it aligns with the definitions given.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your table must be logically consistent with the text''s definitions, and your examples must demonstrate a deep understanding of the terms'' nuances.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Terminology**\n\nUsing the definitions provided for ''habit'', ''habitude'', ''practice'', ''usage'', and ''custom'', invent a short narrative (200-250 words) that showcases how these concepts evolve over time in a fictional setting. Your story must include:\n- **A character''s personal habit** that changes due to external influence\n- **A cultural custom** that is preserved despite external pressures\n- **A professional practice** that adapts to new circumstances\n\n**Answer Requirement**: The narrative must explicitly reference at least three of the defined terms and demonstrate an understanding of how these concepts interact in a dynamic social context.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Homographs and Syllabication**\n\nConsider the homograph ''dress'' as defined in the text, which can mean both a piece of clothing and a verb meaning to put on clothing. Using the syllabication rule provided (breaking words only at dots), split the word ''dresses'' into its correct syllables and explain how this relates to the different meanings of ''dress''.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the correct syllabication for ''dresses'' based on the text''s instruction.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the homograph ''dress'' demonstrates the concept of words with the same spelling and sound but used in different senses.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how the syllabication rule (breaking only at dots) influences the pronunciation and potential confusion between homographs.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s definitions of homographs and syllabication, demonstrating an understanding of their relationship to language structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Pronunciation and Etymology**\n\nUsing the information provided in the text about pronunciation (phonetic symbols) and etymology (language origins), explain the origin and pronunciation of the word ''habit''.\n- **Part A**: Based on the etymological notation provided (e.g., ME = Middle English, L = Latin), trace the historical development of the word ''habit'' from its earliest known form to its current usage.\n- **Part B**: Using phonetic symbols as described in the text, determine the correct pronunciation of ''habit'' and explain how it relates to its etymological roots.\n- **Part C**: Compare the pronunciation of ''habit'' with another word that has a similar etymology (e.g., ''habitat'') and discuss how the syllabication rules affect their distinct meanings.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions of pronunciation, etymology, and syllabication to provide a comprehensive analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Language Usage**\n\nThe text distinguishes between ''wont'', ''habitude'', ''practice'', ''usage'', and ''custom'' as ways of acting or states of mind. Consider the following scenarios:\n- **Part A**: Explain why a person might be described as having a ''wont'' to procrastinate, while another might have a ''habit'' of reading extensively. Use definitions from the text to clarify the subtle differences between these terms.\n- **Part B**: Create a scenario where ''usage'' and ''custom'' would apply differently in a specific cultural context. Describe how these terms reflect social norms versus individual behavior.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how ''practice'' differs from ''usage'' in the context of learning a new skill, such as playing a musical instrument. Use examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the distinct meanings and applications of each term as defined in the text, with clear examples that show their unique roles in language and behavior.'

    The superscript ‘ indicates that this is the first of at least two homographs, different words with the same spelling and pronunciation but different senses.

    Pronunciation

    This is enclosed within parentheses and uses symbols and marks set out in a table at the beginning of the word list.

    Part of speech

    v. = verb (intr. - intransitive and fr. = transitive); n. = noun.

    Inflected forms

    For verbs these are the principal parts. (For nouns they would be the singular and plural, for modifiers the comparative and superlative forms.) As listed in this dictionary the principal parts, set in boldface, include the past preterite (woke), the past participle (waked), the present participle (waking), and the third person singular active indicative present (wakes). Alternate forms are given for the past and past participle, with the less common following the more common and labeled as rare or chiefly British & regional (that is, confined to the speakers of a particular geographical area rather than common to all users of English).

    Definitions

    These are divided into the senses of the verb and of the noun. The former, in turn, are distinguished for both the intransitive and transitive uses of the verb. Within each category the various meanings are ordered, in this dictionary, beginning with the most common or central. Different senses are marked by arabic numerals in boldface; subdivisions within a particular sense by lowercase letters in boldface. Where useful, brief examples of a sense are given in italics.

    Etymology

    The etymology, set within brackets, traces the origin of the modern word. Foreign terms are italicized, and their meanings are in italics without quotation marks. "Unattested" means that no actual record of a form exists, though the form

    Usage: The verbs wake, waken, awake, and awaken are all synonyms.

    The words "awake" and "awaken" are alike in meaning but differentiated in usage. Each has transitive and intransitive senses, but "awake" is used largely intransitively and "waken" transitively. In the passive voice, "awaken" and "waken" are the more frequent: "He was awakened (or wakened) by his call." In figurative usage, "awake" and "awaken" are the more prevalent: "He awoke to the danger; his suspicions were awakened." "Wake" is frequently used with "up"; the others do not take a preposition. The preferred past participle of "wake" is "waked," not "woke" or "woken": "When I had waked him, I discovered that the danger was past." The past participle of "awake" is "awaked," not "awoke": "He had awaked several times earlier in the night."

    "wake" (wak) n. 1. The visible track of turbulence left by something moving through the water: the wake of a ship. 2. The track or course left behind anything that has passed: "The dictionary law has naturally left in its wake defection, resentment, and counterrevolutionary sentiment. The wake of."

    Synonyms are words in the same language having much the same
    meaning. True, or identical, synonyms have exactly the same definition and usually are simply alternative names for the same object. In sailboats, for instance, "sail" and "guy" signify the same sail and are true synonyms. Most synonyms, however, are less than exact. For "pal" and "friend", they differ to a considerable degree, but are not exactly coextensive: any pal is a friend, but not any friend is a pal. In listing synonyms in a thesaurus necessarily obscures this distinction
    between exact and near synonyms. To distinguish all shades
    of meaning would result in a vast work of many volumes, too
    expensive to buy and too cumbersome to use.

    one Roget under the category seclusion/exclusion are solitude,
    isolation, loneliness, and aloofness. They are merely listed as
    alternates with no distinctions drawn, but, except in a very
    loose sense, these words are not synonymous and may not be
    interchanged indiscriminately. Solitude means physical apart-
    ness, out of the sight and sound of others, a condition not
    necessarily undesirable; in fact, solitude may be used with
    positive connotations, as in "She enjoys solitude." Loneliness,
    on the other hand, has a more subjective significance, relating
    to the feeling of being apart; it does not necessarily imply
    physical seapaatlonebyomea crowd of Christ-

    mas sthepplitsreuardbe given a positive sense.

    Isolation stresses physical separation, out of connection and
    communication with others, and is often used when that sep-
    aration is not desired. Aloofness, finally, is self-chosen sepa-
    ration, a deliberate withdrawal from others, which may sug-
    gest a sense of superiority, though it does not have to.

    considerably more about them than a thesaurus is likely to
    tell you. With many wotlds—eshosple, for in-

    Looks, sounds, tastes. Mostly it is about visual experience, but
    description also deals with other kinds of perception. The fol-
    lowing passage, for example, uses sounds to describe the be-
    ginning of an act of revolutionary violence in China:

    Five shots went off in a nearby street: three together, another, still
    another. . . . The silence returned, but it no longer seemed to be the
    same. Suddenly it was filled by the clatter of horses' hoofs, hurried,
    coming nearer and nearer. And, like the vertical laceration of light-
    ning after a prolonged thunder, while they still saw nothing, a tu-
    mult suddenly filled the street, composed of mingled cries, shots,
    furious whinnyings, the falling of bodies; then, as the subsiding
    clamor was heavily choking under the indestructible silence, there
    rose a cry as of a dog howling lugubriously, cut short: a man with
    his throat slashed. André Malraux

    Whatever sense it appeals to, descriptive writing is of two
    broad kinds: objective and subjective. In objective description
    the writer sets aside those aspects of the perception unique to
    himself and concentrates on describing the percept (that is,
    what is perceived) in itself. In subjective (also called impres-
    sionistic) description a writer projects his or her feelings into
    the percept. Objective description says, "This is how the
    thing is"; subjective, "This is how the thing seems to one
    particular consciousness."

    Neither kind of description is more "honest." Both are (or
    can be) true, but they are true in different ways. The truth of
    objective description lies in its relationship to fact; that of
    subjective in relationship to feeling or evaluation. The first
    kind of truth is more easily checked. We can generally decide
    which of two passages more accurately describes, say, a
    downtown office building. Subjective description, on the
    other hand, is "true" because it presents a valuable response,
    not because it makes an accurate report. If we do not agree
    with how a writer feels about something, we cannot say that
    the description is false. We can say only that it is not true for
    us; that we do not share his or her feelings.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Descriptive Writing Types**\n\nClassify the following passage as either objective or subjective description, and explain your reasoning based on the definitions provided in the text:\n\n''Five shots went off in a nearby street: three together, another, still another. . . . The silence returned, but it no longer seemed to be the same. Suddenly it was filled by the clatter of horses'' hoofs, hurried, coming nearer and nearer. And, like the vertical laceration of lightning after a prolonged thunder, while they still saw nothing, a tumult suddenly filled the street, composed of mingled cries, shots, furious whinnyings, the falling of bodies; then, as the subsiding clamor was heavily choking under the indestructible silence, there rose a cry as of a dog howling lugubriously, cut short: a man with his throat slashed.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must be supported by specific textual evidence and an explanation of whether the description focuses on the percept itself or includes the writer''s feelings. You must reference at least two examples from the text that define objective vs. subjective description.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Description Types to Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze how the passage from André Malraux demonstrates the difference between objective and subjective description, using the definitions provided in the text:\n- **Part A**: Identify two instances where the writer describes the percept (objective) and two instances where the writer projects feelings into the percept (subjective).\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of metaphors like ''vertical laceration of lightning'' contributes to the subjective aspect of the description. Use a direct quote from the text to support your answer.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of the text''s assertion that ''neither kind of description is more '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Description Types**\n\nThe text states that subjective description is ''true'' because it presents a valuable response, not because it makes an accurate report. Use this idea to construct an argument for or against the claim: ''All subjective descriptions are inherently biased.''\n- **Part A**: Define ''subjective description'' using the text''s definition.\n- **Part B**: Argue whether all subjective descriptions are inherently biased, providing a specific example from the text that supports your position.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s distinction between objective and subjective description relates to the concept of truth in literature. Use the quote ''Neither kind of description is more '

    Nor are these two approaches hard-and-fast categories into
    which any piece of descriptive writing must fall. Most de-
    scriptions involve both, in varying degrees. Generally, how-
    ever, one mode will dominate and fix the focus. In scientific
    and legal writing, for instance, objectivity is desirable. In per-
    sonal writing subjectivity is more likely.

    But in both kinds, success hinges on three things: (1) details
    that are sharply defined images, appealing to one or another
    of the senses; (2) details that are selected according to a guid-
    ing principle; (3) details that are clearly organized.

    Objective Description
    Selection of Detail

    In objective description the principle which guides selection
    is the thing itself. The writer must ask: Which details are es-
    sential to seeing and understanding this object, event, person,
    experience? Which are accidental and of lesser importance?
    Essential details should make up the bulk of the description,
    those of secondary importance being included as the writer
    has space.

    The following description of a freshwater fish by an eigh-
    teenth-century naturalist exemplifies the selection of essential
    detail:

    The loach, in its general aspect, has a pellucid appearance: its back
    is mottled with irregular collections of small black dots, not reach-
    ing much below the /ategalis, as are the back and tail fins: a
    black line runs from each eye down to the nose; its belly is of a
    silvery white; the upper jaw projects beyond the lower, and is sur-
    rounded with six feelers, three on each side; its pectoral fins are
    large, its ventral much smaller; the fin behind its anus small; its
    dorsal fin large, containing eight spines; its tail, where it joins the
    tail-fin, remarkably broad, without any typam*esshe char-

    acteristic of this genus; the tail-fin is broad, and square at the end.
    From the breadth and muscular strength of the tail, it appears to be
    an active nimble fish. Gilbert White

    White focuses on those features that enable us to recognize a
    loach: size and shape of tail and fins, number of feelers on
    each side of the jaw, and so on. Scientific description like this
    is a kind of definition, differentiating an entity from others
    similar to it.

- prompt: "Objective description, especially the visual kind, often begins  \nwith a brief comprehensive view. It then analyzes this image  \nand presents each part in detail, following an organization  \ninherent in the object. Here, for instance, is a description of  \na lake in Maine:\n\nThe lake resembles a gently curving S, its long axis lying  \nalmost due north-south. The shoreline is ringed by rocks of all sizes,  \nfrom huge boulders to tiny particles—glacial debris from the Ice Age.\n\nBeyond the rocks the forest comes almost to the water's edge.  \nMostly pine and hemlock, it contains a few hardwoods—maple,  \noak, birch. Here and there an old pine, its roots washed nearly  \nclean of support, leans crazily over the water, seeming about to  \ntopple at any instant. But it never does; trees fall this way for years.\n\n354 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION\n\nFirst we view the lake in its entirety, as a hawk might see it.  \nThen we focus down and move progressively closer to shore.  \nWe see the rocks immediately at the water's edge, then the  \nforest, then the various kinds of trees, and finally the old pine  \nleaning over the water. The description, in short, is organized:  \nit moves from general to particular, and it divides the visual  \nexperience of the lake into three parts—the whole,  \n\nthe shoreline, and the forest around.\n\nTo effect these changes in viewpoint, the writer does not  \nwaste time directing us. He does not say, \"As we leave the  \nbird's-eye view and come down for a closer look, we observe  \nthat the shoreline is ringed with rocks.\" It is awkward and  \nwordy to turn tour guide. It is better to move about the object  \nimplicitly without holding the reader by the hand. Doing this  \nusually requires an impersonal and omniscient point of view:  \nimpersonal in the sense that the writer does not refer to him-  \nself or herself; omniscient in that nothing is hidden, and he  \nor she can range with complete freedom—above,  \naround the object, inside and out. Readers will follow if the  \nwriter has clearly organized what they are supposed to see.\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Descriptive Organization**\n\nUsing the principles of description and narration outlined in the text, create a concise paragraph that describes a ''camping trip'' in the mountains. Your paragraph must follow the same organizational structure as the lake description: start with an overall view, then move to specific details (e.g., shoreline → forest → individual elements), and conclude with a final observation.\n- **Step 1**: Begin by describing the entire scene from a high vantage point.\n- **Step 2**: Progressively focus on the immediate surroundings—campsite features, wildlife, or natural elements.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with an observation that ties back to the broader environment.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must demonstrate clear progression from general to specific and use an impersonal, omniscient tone as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Narrative Perspective**\n\nExplain why the author''s choice of an ''impersonal and omniscient point of view'' is effective for describing a landscape. In your response:\n- **Part A**: Compare this perspective to a first-person or second-person narrative.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how the author moves implicitly between different viewpoints without explicitly stating so.\n- **Part C**: Justify why a tour guide style (e.g., "We observe...") would be less effective in this context, based on the text''s argument against such a direct approach.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate specific details from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how narrative perspective influences reader engagement.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Description Techniques**\n\nDesign a description for a ''sunset over the ocean'' that follows the same structure as the lake example. Your description must include at least three distinct elements, progressing from general to specific, and incorporate the following elements:\n- A high-level overview of the scene\n- Details about immediate surroundings (e.g., waves, sand, or distant islands)\n- A final observation that reflects on the broader experience\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must use an impersonal tone and demonstrate an understanding of how to organically transition between viewpoints without direct instruction.'

    But he or she must organize. Writers of good description do not just "see." They analyze what they see and give it a pattern. Taking a perception apart in order to put it together can be seen in the following sentence by Joseph Conrad, which describes a coastal view. The angle of vision does not change as it did in the description of the lake, but there is a principle of organization:

    Beyond the sea wall there curves for miles in a vast and regular sweep the barren beach of shingle, with the village of Brenzett standing out darkly across the water, a spire in a clump of trees; and still further out the perpendicular column of a lighthouse, looking in the distance no bigger than a lead pencil, marks the vanishing point of the land.

    Our view shifts from near to distant. Our eyes move outward through a series of receding planes: the sea wall, the beach,
    Description 355

    the village with its spire and trees across the water, and the lighthouse in the offing.

    Diction in Objective Description

    In objective description words are chosen for exactness of denotation, not for forcefulness of connotation. Factual precision is what is most desired. Gilbert White (page 254) says "six feelers, three on each side," not "several feelers." He carefully differentiates fins by concise technical names: "pectoral," "ventral," "dorsal."

    Scientific description like this is not easy to write. Given enough time to observe and the training to know what to look for, anyone can compose a reasonably accurate description of a fiaht. It requires more care to compose a description that is accurate and at the same time forceful, interesting prose. It is worth studying White's paragraph to observe how he or ganizes it and gives it vitality and movement by the short, direct clauses, constructed with just enough variety to avoid monotony.

    Subjective Description

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Objective Description Techniques**\n\nAnalyze the excerpt from Gilbert White''s description of a fish, focusing on his use of diction and organization.\n- **Part A**: Identify three specific words or phrases that demonstrate the precision of objective description. Explain how each contributes to factual accuracy.\n- **Part B**: Describe the structure of the paragraph as it moves through different planes of observation (e.g., from near to distant). How does this spatial progression enhance clarity in scientific writing?\n- **Part C**: Compare White''s approach to description with the example provided by Conrad in the text. What is the primary difference between objective and subjective description in terms of purpose and language choice?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s examples and demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinctions between objective and subjective writing styles.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Description Organization Principles**\n\nUsing the principles from the text, write a description of a coastal landscape that follows the spatial progression described in Conrad''s example.\n- **Part A**: Begin with the immediate foreground (e.g., sea wall), then move outward through receding planes to the distant lighthouse.\n- **Part B**: Use precise diction to describe each element without connotative language (e.g., avoid words that imply emotion or opinion).\n- **Part C**: Organize your description using short, direct clauses with enough variety to maintain readability.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your written response must mirror the structure and techniques discussed in the text, demonstrating a clear understanding of how spatial progression and diction contribute to effective objective description.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Description Styles**\n\nCompare and contrast the two types of description presented in the text: objective and subjective.\n- **Part A**: Define each type based on the text''s examples (e.g., White''s fish description vs. Conrad''s coastal view).\n- **Part B**: Explain how the purpose of description influences the choice of language (e.g., factual precision in objective writing vs. expressive language in subjective writing).\n- **Part C**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates the difference between the two styles and explain why it is classified as either objective or subjective.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the examples provided in the text and demonstrate a thorough understanding of the principles governing each description style.'

    When describing objectively, the writer is a kind of camera, recording precisely and impersonally. When writing subjectively, he or she is no longer an impartial observer, but rather enters into what is perceived. Point of view—in cases—becomes personal; and words have overtones of value and feeling that color the perception.

    These evaluations and feelings are as much a part of the description as the object itself. In fact, more: they determine selection and organization. Sometimes writers state impressions directly, as in this paragraph about an Englishwoman's reactions to the citizens of Moscow:

    { wandered about in the morning and looked at the streets and people. All my visit looked and looked at the people. They seem neither happier nor sadder than in the West, and neither more nor less worried than any town dweller. (People in towns are always preoccupied. "Have missed the bus? Have forgotten the potatoes? Can get across the road?") But they appear stupid, what the French call abruti. What do they think? Perhaps they don't think very much, and yet they read enormously. I have never seen such a country of seditherson pespdiees, in the metro, etc., all read books (magazines seem not to exist); on the trains they have lending libraries. They are hideously ugly. Except for a few young officers, I have never seen a handsome man; there seem to be no beautiful women. They have putty faces, like Malenkov. It is nonsense to speak of Asiatics, Mongol Hordes and so prettytltietle Tartar guards at Lenin's tomb were the only people saw with non-European feadtias. Nancy Mitford

    Fixing the Impression in Images

    While subjective description often states an impression directly, it cannot rest on abstract statement. Feeling must be fixed in images, in details appealing to the senses. Only details, emotionally charged, make the impression real.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Subjective and Objective Description**\n\nCompare and contrast the subjective description in the passage with an objectively descriptive paragraph about a similar experience. Use the text''s definition of point of view to explain how the writer''s perspective influences the selection of details and the emotional tone of the description.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two key elements from the subjective description (e.g., ''stupid'', ''abruti'').\n- **Step 2**: Contrast these with objective descriptions that would omit such value-laden terms.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the text''s emphasis on point of view as a personal entry into perception supports this difference in tone and detail selection.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between subjective and objective perspectives, using specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Sensory Detail Fixing**\n\nWrite a paragraph describing a scene from your own experience that includes at least three sensory details (sight, sound, touch). Use the text''s concept of ''fixing the impression in images'' to explain how these details make the impression real.\n- **Part A**: Describe the scene with three distinct sensory elements.\n- **Part B**: Explain how each detail contributes to the overall impression, referencing the text''s assertion that ''feeling must be fixed in images, in details appealing to the senses.''\n- **Part C**: Compare your paragraph to the subjective description in the text, highlighting how both use emotionally charged details to convey perception.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s theory of sensory detail and demonstrate an understanding of how it shapes impression formation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Literary Perception**\n\nThe passage discusses how subjective description cannot rest on abstract statements but must fix feeling in images. Using this principle, evaluate the following claim: ''All descriptive writing must be emotionally charged to be effective.''\n- **Part A**: Define ''emotionally charged'' based on the text''s explanation of subjective description.\n- **Part B**: Argue whether all descriptive writing requires emotional charge by referencing the text''s distinction between objective and subjective perspectives.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example from the text or your own experience that illustrates when emotional charge is necessary versus when it may be omitted.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s theory on perception and its implications for descriptive writing.'

    No more dreary spectacle can be found on this earth than the whole of the "awful East," with its Whitechapel, Hoxton, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green, and Wapping to the East India Docks. The colour of life is grey and drab. Everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved, and dirty. Bath tubs are a thing totally unknown, as mythical as the ambrosia of the gods. The people themselves are dirty, while any attempt at cleanliness becomes howling farce, when it is not pitiful and tragic. Strange, vagrant odours come drifting along the greasy wind, and the rain, when it falls, is more like grease than water from heaven. The very cobblestones are scummed with grease.

    Jack London

    London, writing in b6@ijs by telling us what impression the slums of London's east end make on him: "no more dreary spectacle"; "the colour of life is grey and drab"; "everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved, and dirty." But we don't experience the impression until he renders it in images:

    DESCRIPTION 357

    "vagrant odours," "greasy wind," "rain... like grease," "cobblestones ... scummed with grease."

    You can see that details work differently in impressionistic description than in objective. Connotations are more important, and diction is charged with emotion. The writer wants to arouse in readers a response like his own. But he must do more than merely tell us how he feels. He must re-create the scene in a algafatanalyner, including this detail and omitting that, exaggerating one image and underplaying another, and calling up compelling similes and metaphors.

    In short, the perception must be refracted through the writer's consciousness. It may emerge idealized, like a landscape by a romantic painter. It may be distorted and made ugly, like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. Idealization and distortion are perfectly legitimate. The writer of subjective description signs no contract to deliver literal truth. "Here," he or she says, "is how I see it." Yet the description may reveal a deeper truth than mere objective accuracy, and, like an artist's caricature, make plain a subtle reality.

    To convey subjective truth, then, a writer must embody responses in the details of the scene. Often, in fact, he or she relies exclusively upon such embodiment, making little or no statement of feeling and, instead, forcing the perception to speak for itself. A simple case is catalogue description, in which the writer lists detail after detail, each contributing to a dominant impression. The following paragraph is a good example (it describes an outdoor market on Decatur Street in New Orleans):

    The booths are Sicilian, hung with red peppers, draped with garlic, piled with fruit, wet vegetables, fresh and dried herbs. A huge man, fat as Silenus, daintily binds bunches for soup, while his wife quarters cabbages, ties smaller bundles of thyme, parsley, green onions, small hot peppers and sweet pimentos to season gumbo. Another Italian with white mustache, smiling fiercely from a tanned face, offers jars of green file powder, unground all-spice, pickled onions in vinegar. Carts and trucks flank the sidewalk; one walks through crates of curled parsley, scallions piled with ice,

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Subjective Perception in Descriptive Writing**\n\nAnalyze the excerpt from *The New Oxford Guide to Writing* that describes an outdoor market on Decatur Street in New Orleans. How does the author use specific, sensory details to convey a subjective impression of the scene?\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least three distinct sensory details (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) and explain their role in shaping the reader''s perception.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the repetition of adjectives (e.g., ''huge man'', ''Italian with white mustache'') contributes to the subjective atmosphere of the market.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate whether the passage evokes a sense of order or chaos, and justify your conclusion based on the details provided.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must reflect an understanding of how subjective truth is conveyed through detailed description without explicit emotional statements.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Embodiment of Feeling in Catalogue Description**\n\nCompare the described outdoor market to a ''catalogue description'' as defined in the text. What elements of this passage qualify it as an example of catalogue description?\n- **Step 1**: List at least three specific details that align with the definition of catalogue description (e.g., detailed listing, emphasis on characteristics).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the author''s use of precise adjectives and nouns contributes to the overall impression without expressing personal opinion.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on how this passage might be used in a different context (e.g., advertising, tourism) and how the same details would be interpreted differently.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how catalogue description functions as a means of conveying subjective truth through objective detail.'

    Not only the individual details, but their very profusion convey vitality and abundance far more effectively than would any plain statement. It is not possible to overestimate the importance of specificity to good description. Look back at how carefully Bishop names colors.

    While details in catalogues are chosen according to an underlying feeling or evaluation, the selection is less rigorous than in some other kinds of subjective description. Thus Bishop includes the "mangy cat" and the "crushed oranges," even though these jar slightly with the attractiveness of the scene. More often the writer "edits" the perception, using fewer details and only those conducive to the impression. The novelist Thomas Wolfe, for example, draws this picture of an idealized, if modest, home:

    On the outskirts of a little town upon a rise of land that swept back from the railway there was a tidy little cottage of white boards, trimmed vividly with green blinds. To one side of the house there was a garden neatly patterned with plots of growing vegetables, and an arbor for the grapes which ripened late in August. Before the house there were three mighty oaks which sheltered it in their clean and massive shade in summer, and to the other side there was a border of gay flowers. The whole place had an air of tidiness, thrift, and modest comfort.

    DESCRIPTION 359

    The final sentence sums up the scene and states the impression directly, as to the modifiers "neatly," "clean," "gay," but on the whole the images create the sense of middle-class fulfillment. Any ugliness is excluded. If the lawn were disfigured by crabgrass, if weeds leered among the flowers, the facts are discreetly omitted.

    Very different are the tessellations—and = impression—in account of the homes of miners in the north of England:

    I found great variation in the houses visited. Some were as decent as one could possibly expect in the circumstances, some were so appalling that have no hope of describing them adequately. To begin with, the smell, the dominant and essential thing, is indescribable. But the squalor and the confusion! A tub full of filthy water here, a basin full of unwashed crocks there, more crocks piled in any odd corner, torn newspaper littered everywhere, and in the middle always the same dreadful table covered with sticky oilcloth and crowded with cooking pots and irons and half-darned stockings and pieces of stale bread and bits of cheese wrapped round with greasy newspaper! And the congestion in a tiny room where getting from one side to the other is a complicated voyage between pieces of furniture, with a line of damp washing getting you in the face every time you move and the children as thick uoddeianl sis George Orwell

    Sometimes a writer concentrates on one or two images which symbolize the impression. In the following passage Al-fred Kazin projects into two key symbols his childhood despair at being forced to attend a special school because of his stuttering:

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Symbolism in Literary Description**\n\nIn the passage describing the miners'' homes, George Orwell uses vivid imagery to convey a sense of squalor and poverty. Identify two symbolic elements from the text that represent the harsh living conditions of the miners. Explain how these symbols contribute to the overall impression of despair and neglect.\n- **Symbol 1**: The ''dreadful table covered with sticky oilcloth''\n- **Symbol 2**: The ''line of damp washing getting you in the face every time you move''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly link each symbol to its meaning and demonstrate an understanding of how symbolic imagery creates a literary impression without direct description.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Contrast in Literary Portrayal**\n\nCompare and contrast the two descriptions provided in the text: the tidy cottage with ''neatly patterned'' gardens and ''tidiness, thrift, and modest comfort,'' versus the miners'' homes described as ''appalling'' and ''squalid.''\n- **Analysis 1**: The cottage''s orderly appearance contrasts with the miners'' homes'' disorder.\n- **Analysis 2**: The cottage''s ''middle-class fulfillment'' stands in stark opposition to the miners'' ''congestion'' and ''damp washing.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must highlight the literary techniques used to create these contrasting impressions and explain how they reflect broader social or economic themes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Imagery and Emotional Impact**\n\nIn Al-fred Kazin''s passage, two symbols—''the schoolhouse with its cracked windows'' and ''the boy''s own voice''—project his childhood despair. Explain how these symbols work together to convey a sense of isolation and hopelessness.\n- **Symbol 1**: The ''schoolhouse with its cracked windows'' represents the harsh environment of the special school.\n- **Symbol 2**: The ''boy''s own voice'' symbolizes his internal struggle and inability to communicate.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how symbolic imagery can evoke emotional responses without direct narrative explanation, as seen in both passages.'

    In Kazin's description selection is extremely important.
    The passage focuses onto the images of THE HUMAN FAC-
    TORY and the two pieces of salami. Kazin tells us what his
    feelings were (he is quite explicit). But he communicates the
    despair of an alienated child in the salami with its "odd thread
    of hair ... turning black and grimy in the dust," and the in-
    human little robots endlessly shoveling food into a body that
    DESCRIPTION 361

    has become a machine. In a world symbolized by such images
    there is little room for humane values, for love and compas-
    sion and tender understanding.

    Kazin's paragraph shows the importance of the "crystalliz-
    ing image," the detail that precipitates the scene in the reader's
    mind. The writer must make readers see (or hear or taste or
    touch). He or she cannot achieve this merely by relentlessly
    listing every detail that falls within the perceptual field. Even
    in catalogue descriptions like that by John Peale Bishop, we
    are shown only a portion of what exists to be seen. The writer
    must select relatively few details but render these so vividly
    that a reader sees them in his mind's eye. These will then
    crystalize the perception, making it solid and true. It is rather
    like developing a photograph. The writer begins the process,
    carefully choosing details and expressing them in compelling
    images; readers, developing these images in the fluid of their
    own experience, complete the picture for themselves.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Imagery and Symbolism**\n\nIn Kazin''s description of THE HUMAN FACTORY, what symbolic significance does the ''odd thread of hair ... turning black and grimy in the dust'' hold? How does this image contribute to the broader theme of alienation and industrialization as presented in the passage?\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the specific imagery of the thread of hair and its transformation.\n- **Step 2**: Relate this image to the overall metaphor of the factory and the human body as a machine.\n- **Step 3**: Connect the symbolic meaning to the theme of alienation, referencing Kazin''s assertion that ''there is little room for humane values'' in such a world.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s analysis of imagery with its thematic concerns, demonstrating an understanding of how specific details convey broader ideas.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Crystallizing Image Concepts**\n\nKazin emphasizes the importance of ''crystallizing image'' in writing. Using the example from the passage, explain how Kazin''s selection of the ''odd thread of hair ... turning black and grimy in the dust'' creates a vivid mental image for the reader.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the sensory details that make this image memorable.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the writer''s choice to focus on this single detail rather than a list of many elements enhances the reader''s experience.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this approach to ''catalogue descriptions'' mentioned in the text, using specific examples from the passage.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of Kazin''s theory of crystallizing images and apply it to the provided example, showing how it differs from other descriptive techniques.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Thematic Analysis**\n\nIn the passage, Kazin contrasts the ''human factory'' with the ''two pieces of salami.'' How does this contrast serve to highlight the theme of alienation and dehumanization?\n- **Part A**: Analyze the symbolic meaning of both the factory and the salami.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the juxtaposition of these two images reinforces the idea that human life is reduced to mechanical processes.\n- **Part C**: Use Kazin''s assertion about ''little robots'' endlessly shoveling food into a body that has become a machine to construct an argument for why such a world lacks humane values.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate thematic analysis with the text''s specific examples, showing how the contrast between factory and salami supports the central theme of alienation.'

    The point to remember is this: select only the details essential to the impression you want to convey; describe them precisely and concretely; then readers will perceive them.

    Metaphor and Simile in Subjective Description

    In addition to selecting and arranging details, the writer of description may also introduce comparisons, often in the form of metaphors or similes. In Bishop's paragraph about the Decatur Street Market, for instance, the proprietor is "fat as Silenus" (an ancient god of wine), the leeks "sea-green" with roots "like witches' hair," and the squashes "long and curled like the trumpets of Jericho."

    Metaphor is even more central in the following passage about the Great Wall of China. The Wall assumes a monstrous power as it marches over and dominates the lands:

    There in the mist, enormous, majestic, silent and terrible, stood the Great Wall of China. Solitarily, with the indifference of nature herself, it crept up the mountain side and slipped down to the depth
    of the valley. Menacingly, the grim watch towers, stark and four square, at due intervals stood at their posts. Ruthlessly, for it was built at the cost of a million lives and each one of those great grey stones has been stained with the bloody tears of the captive and the outcast, it forged its dark way through a sea of rugged moun-
    tains. Fearlessly, it went on its endless journey, league upon league to the furthermost regions of Asia, in utter solitude, mysterious like the great empire it guarded. There in the mist, enormous, majestic, silent, and terrible, stood the Great Wall of China.

    Exaggerating Details

    An impression may be embodied in distorted and exaggerated
    details. Mark Twain, an adept at the art of hyperbole, or ex-
    aggeration, tells of a trip he took in an overland stage in the
    1860s. The passengers have spent the night at a way station,
    and Twain describes the facilities for cleaning up before
    breakfast the next morning:

    By the door, inside, was fastened a small old-fashioned looking-glass frame, with two little fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it. This arrangement afforded a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you when you looked into it, with one half of your head set up a couple of inches above the other half. From the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a string—but had to describe that patriarch or die, believe would order some sample coffins. It had come down from Esau and Samson, and had been accumulating hair ever since.

    We are not supposed to take this literally, of course. Twain is exercising the satirist's right of legitimate exaggeration, legitimate because it leads us to see a truth about this frontier hostel.

    Process Description

    A process is a directed activity in which something undergoes progressive change. The process may be natural, like the growth of a tree; or it may be humanly directed, like an automobile taking shape on an assembly line. But always something is happening—something being formed, an end of some kind being achieved.

    To describe a process you must analyze its stages. The analysis will determine how you organize the description. In a simple case, such as baking a cake, the process has obvious, prescribed steps; the writer needs only to observe and record them accurately. On the other hand, complicated and abstract processes—such as the formation of a law comes into being as an act of invention.

    Here is a simple example of a process, a natural one—a small frog being eaten by a giant water bug:

    He didn't jump; crept closer. At last he fell on the island's winterkilled grass, lost, dumbstruck, staring at the frog in the creek just four feet away. He was a very small frog with wide, dull eyes. And just as looked at him, he slowly crumpled and began to sag. The spirit vanished from his eyes as if snuffed. His skin emptied and drooped; his very skull seemed to collapse and settle like a kicked tent. He was shrinking before my eyes like a deflating football. I watched the taut, glistening skin on his shoulders ruck, and rumple, and fall. Soon, part of his skin, formless as a pricked balloon, lay in floating folds like bright scum on top of the water: it was a monstrous and terrifying thing. Shaped bewildered, appalled. An oval shadow hung in the water behind the drained frog; then the shadow glided away. The frog skin bag began to sink. Annie Dillard

    At the beginning of the description the frog is whole and alive, sitting in the creek; by the end it has been reduced to a bag of skin. This change is the process Dillard describes. It is continuous rather than divided into clearly defined steps. Yet it is analyzed. Verbs, the key words in the analysis, create sharp images of alteration: "crumpled," "collapse," "shrinking," "deflating," "ruck," "rumple," "fall." The similes and metaphors translate an unusual visual experience into more familiar ones: "like a deflating football," "formless as a pricked balloon."

    At the mascara merry-go-round a tiny tube is placed in each steel
    cup—cul pk. circle—ca-chong, ca-chong, ca-chong—till
    they pass under two metal udders. There the cups jerk up—ping—
    and the tubes are filled with mascara that flows from the vats up-
    stairs in manufacturing. The cups continue their circle till they pass
    under a €appetedpkapped tubes circle some more
    till they reach two vacuum nozzles, then—fwap—sucked
    around and down onto a betving

    All along the belt women in blue smocks, sitting on high stools,
    pick up each mascara tube as it goes past. They insert brushes, tamp
    on labels, encase the tubes in plastic and then cardboard for the
    drugstore displays.

    At the Brush-On Peel-Off Mask line, a filler picks an empty bottle
    off the belt with her right hand, presses a pedal with her foot, fills
    the bottle with a bldxbpe goop, changes hands, and puts the
    filled bottle back on the line with her left hand, as she picks up
    another empty bottle with her right hand. The bottles go past at
    thirty-three a minute. Barbara Carson

    Garson's description provides a &mample of how analysis
    determines paragraphing. Three products are involved—
    cream, mascara, and the "Brush-On Peel-Off Mask'—and
    each is treated in a separate paragraph. For the mascara two
    are used, marking the two-stage process of the tubes' being
    fisted and then packaged.

    The sentences are also determined by the analysis. Thus the
    three sentences of the first paragraph distinguish (1) the
    covers on the conveyor belt, (2) the iron arms placing sealers
    on the pots, and (3) the fixing of the lids onto the jars. Notice,
    too, the long sentence in the fourth paragraph; it uses parallel
    verbs to analyze the filler's movements.

    Process description may be either objective or subjective.
    Both the foregoing examples are relatively objective, though
    each suggests responses. Even though Dillard's subject is hor-
    rifying and she actually expresses her reaction ("it was a mon-
    strous and terrifying thing"), her images are objective. Dillard
    concentrates on rendering the visual experience in and of itself
    (which in a case like this perhaps best communicates the
    horror).

    Despite its objective surface, Garson's description also im-
    plies a reaction. Her thetwonrdsespricaalhy

    CHAPTER

    Narration

    A narrative is a meaningful sequence of events told in words.
    It is sequential in that the events are ordered, not merely ran-
    dom. Sequence always involves an arrangement in time (and
    usually other arrangements as well). A straightforward move-
    ment from the &rsnt to the last constitutes the simplest
    chronology. However, chronology is sometimes complicated
    by presenting the events in another order: for example, a story

    A narrative has meaning in that it conveys an evaluation of
    some kind. The writer reacts to the story he or she tells, and
    states or implies that reaction. This is the "meaning," some-
    times called the "theme," of a story. Meaning must always be
    rendered. The writer has to do more than tell us the truth he
    sees in the story; he must manifest that truth in the characters
    and the action.

    Characters and action are the essential elements of any
    story. Also important, but not as essential, is the setting, the
    place where the action occurs. Characters are usually people—
    sometimes actual people, as in history books or newspaper
    stories, sometimes imaginary ones, as in novels. Occasionally
    characters are animals (as in an Aesop fable), and sometimes

    The action is what the characters say and do and anything that happens to them, even if it arises from a nonhuman source, instance, or a fire. Action is often presented in the form of a plot. Action is, so to speak, the raw material; plot, the finished product, the fitting together of the bits and pieces of action into a coherent pattern. Usually, though not invariably, plot takes the form of a cause-and-effect chain: event A produces event B; B leads to C; C to D; and so on until the final episode, X. In a well-constructed plot of this kind we can work back from X to A and see the connections that made the end of the story likely and perhaps inevitable.

    Stories can be very long and complicated, with many characters, elaborate plots, and subtle interpenetration of character, action, and setting. In writing that is primarily expository, however, narratives are shorter and simpler. Most often they are factual rather than imaginary, as when an historian describes an event. And often in exposition an illustration may involve a simple narrative. Being able to tell a story, then, while not the primary concern of the expository writer, is a skill which he or she will now and again be called upon to use.

    Organizing a Narrative

    As with so much in composition, the first step in narration is to analyze the story in your own mind. In the actual telling, the analysis provides the organization. The simplest kind of narrative is the episode, a single event unified by time and place. But even an episode must be organized. The writer must break it down into parts and present these in a meaningful order.

    In the following case the episode is the brief landing of a passenger ship at the Mediterranean island of Malta. After describing the setting in the first paragraph, the writer divides his story into two parts: the problems of getting ashore (paragraphs 2 and 3), and the difficulties of returning to the ship (4).

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Narrative Structure Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the narrative structure of the provided passage about the Maltese passenger ship landing.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main event (the brief landing at Malta).\n- **Step 2**: Determine the organizational framework used by the writer (episode, sequence of events, etc.).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the writer uses time and place to unify the episode.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must demonstrate an understanding of narrative organization as discussed in the text, including the role of setting and sequence in storytelling.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Expository Narratives**\n\nThe passage discusses how narratives are often used in expository writing. Consider the example of a historical event described in a textbook.\n- **Part A**: Explain why a simple narrative might be more effective than a purely factual description in conveying information.\n- **Part B**: Create your own short narrative (2-3 sentences) that explains a scientific process or historical event, using a cause-and-effect structure as demonstrated in the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the use of narrative in fiction versus expository writing based on the passage''s discussion of storytelling skills.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts from the text about narratives in expository writing and demonstrate an understanding of how storytelling enhances clarity.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Narrative Construction**\n\nUsing the principles of narrative organization from the text, construct a short story (5-7 sentences) that follows a clear cause-and-effect chain.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a simple event or problem (e.g., a storm, a lost item, a decision).\n- **Step 2**: Organize your story into parts based on time and place (e.g., arrival at the scene, development of the situation, resolution).\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that your narrative has a beginning, middle, and end with logical transitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your story must demonstrate an understanding of narrative structure as discussed in the text, including the use of setting and sequence to create coherence.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Narrative Structure**\n\nDe Monfreid''s narrative structure begins with a generalization and then supports it with a specific instance. Identify the generalization in the first paragraph and the specific instance that follows it. Explain how this structure contributes to the overall effectiveness of the story, using examples from the text (e.g., the description of the boatmen''s battle or the portrayal of the missionary).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference both elements of the narrative structure and demonstrate an understanding of their role in character development and thematic emphasis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Interpretation of Symbolism in Narrative**\n\nThe text describes Malta as a ''curious town where there is nothing but churches'' and mentions ''the ringing of church bells'' as the only sound of life. Interpret the symbolism of this imagery in the context of de Monfreid''s narrative. How does this description reflect the themes of order, chaos, or human nature? Support your interpretation with specific details from the text (e.g., the boatmen''s battle or the missionary''s mocking demeanor).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate symbolic analysis with textual evidence and demonstrate an understanding of how imagery influences narrative tone and theme.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Narrative Techniques**\n\nThe story employs vivid descriptions and concise character portrayals. Synthesize how de Monfreid uses these techniques to convey the themes of human greed and social hierarchy. Specifically, analyze the contrast between the ''tumbled passenger'' described as ''like a marionette unhinged'' and the ''mocking missionary.'' How do these contrasting images highlight the narrative''s central ideas?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to synthesize literary techniques with thematic analysis and provide clear examples from the text to support your interpretation.'

    Their nightmare quality, which is the dominant note of the setting, unifies these details. But their causal connections are relatively unimportant. For example, the sailors do not toss their boatman into the water because of what other boatmen did earlier to the unfortunate passenger. The two events relate not as cause and effect but more generally in showing the greediness of the Maltese.

    In more complicated stories, however, events may well be linked in a plot of cause and effect. A brief example of such a plot appears in this account of a murder in New York occasioned by the Great Depression of the 1930s:

    Peter Romano comes from a little town in Sicily. For years he kept a large and prosperous fruit store under the Second Avenue elevated at the corner of Twenty-ninth Street. A few years ago, however, he got something the matter with his chest and wasn't able to work anymore. He sold his business and put the money into Bidet.

    When the Wall Street crash came, Peter Romano &hstost everything. And by the time that Mrs. Romano had had a baby five months ago and had afterwards come down with pneumonia, he found he had only a few dollars left.

    By June, he owed his landlord two months' rent, $52. The land-
    lord, Antonio Copace, lived only a few blocks away on Lexington
    Avenue, in a house with a brownstone front and coarse white-lace
    curtains in the windows. The Romanos lived above the fruit store,
    on the same floor with a cheap dentist's office, in a little flat to
    which they had access up a dirty oilcloth-covered staircase and
    through a door with dirty-margined panes. The Romanos regarded
    Mr. Copace as a very rich man, but he, too, no doubt, had been
    having his losses.

    At any rate, he was insistent about the rent. Peter Romano had
    a married daughter, and her husband offered to help him out. He
    went to Mr. Copace with §2f#th‘enent. But the old man
    refused it with fury and said that unless he got the whole sum right
    away, he would have the Romanos evicted. On June hé,came
    himself to the Romanos and demanded the money again. He threat-

    370 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION

    When she came back empty-handed, she found a lot of people
    outside the house and, upstairs, the police in her flat. Peter had
    shot Mr. Copace and killed him, and was just being taken off to
    jail. Edmund Wilson

    Chronology is the bony structure of Wilson's little story:
    "For years he Kefaw.years ago... When the Wall

    Street crash came ... By June ... On June 11 When Mrs.
    Romano came back...." This temporal skeleton supports a
    cause-and-effect plot. The basic elements of such a plot are
    the exposition, the conflict, the climax, and the denouement.

    The term exposition has a special meaning with reference
    to narration. The exposition is that part of the plot which
    gives us the background information about the characters,
    telling us what we need to know in order to understand why
    they act as they do in what is about to unfold. Exposition is
    usually, but not always, concentrated at or very near the be-
    ginning of a story. Wilson's exposition occupies the fhurste
    paragraphs, which locate Peter Romano in time and place and
    tell us necessary facts about his history.

    Exposition gives way to teeflastond part of a plot.

    Conflict involves two or more forces working at cross purposes. (Sometimes this takes place between a character and a physical obstacle such as a mountain or the sea; or it may be internalized, involving diverse psychological aspects of the same person.) In this story the conflict, obviously, occurs between tenant and landlord. The third part of a plot, the climax, resolves the conflict: here, the shooting. Finally the plot ends with the denouement, the closing events of the narrative: Peter Romano's being carried off to jail.

    In the simple and often partial stories you are likely to tell in expository writing, it is not always necessary (or even desirable) that you develop all these elements of a plot in detail. You may need to spend your time on exposition and treat the climax and denouement very briefly. Or you may wish to slight the exposition and concentrate on the climax. But in any case you must be clear in your own mind about the structure of your plot and know how much of each element your readers need in order to understand your narrative.

    In organizing a story, then, you should ask these questions. (1) What is the plot? Specify: What is the climax? What events leading to the climax constitute the conflict? What should be included in the exposition? What events following the climax (the denouement) should be told? (2) What are the salient qualities of the characters and how can these best be revealed in speech and action? (3) What details of setting will help readers understand the characters?

    Meaning in Narrative

    How you answer those questions depends on what you want the story to mean. Meaning in narrative is a complex matter. Broadly there are three kinds: allegorical, realistic, and symbolic. In allegories the meaning is an abstract "truth" —moral, political, cosmic— which and setting are contrived to express. Often what happens in an allegory is not realistic or credible in terms of everyday experience. What it all means must be looked for on the abstract level of ideas.

    A Queen named Superba drawn in a allegory by a painter might symbolize the ideal of power or virtue. The setting, such as a castle or a throne room, is designed to reflect the themes of the story. The characters and events are chosen to reinforce the symbolic meaning rather than to depict a realistic scenario.

    In realistic narratives, the meaning is derived from the depiction of real life and human experiences. The setting, characters, and events are true to life, and the story aims to reflect authentic situations and emotions. The meaning is often found in the characters' actions, relationships, and the overall atmosphere of the story.

    Symbolic narratives use symbols, metaphors, and other literary devices to convey deeper meanings. The meaning is not always immediately apparent and often requires the reader to interpret the symbols and their significance within the context of the story.

    In summary, the meaning of a narrative depends on its genre and purpose. Whether allegorical, realistic, or symbolic, the story's meaning is shaped by its elements and the way they are presented. Understanding these aspects helps in crafting a narrative that communicates its intended message effectively to the reader.

    six strangely assorted beasts begins to make sense only when
    we realize that Superba stands for the mortal sin of Pride and
    that the animals represent the other six deadly sins. We have
    to think theologically in terms of sin and damnation to un-
    derstand what the poet Edmund Spenser was saying.

    In realism, on the other hand, meaning exists in the surface
    events. We don't interpret characters or plot as emblems of
    thought or feeling. De Mominsid's the landing at
    Malta is an example. It has a meaning, or meanings: Maltese
    boatmen are greedy; their greed is punished; young priests are
    naive. But these are generalizations drawn from what literally
    happens.

    In symbolic stories meaning is neither purely allegorical
    nor purely realistic. It is both at once. Such stories are realistic
    in that characters and events correspond to life as we know
    it, and we can generalize from them to real people. At the
    same time the shamethehikevallegories—point

    of significance, more abstract and more inclusive. Edmund
    Wilson's tale, for instance, conveys both a particular (realistic)
    and a more abstract (allegorical) meaning. Read literally, the
    natrative is the tragedy of two men made desperate by eco-
    nomic frustration, and we may fairly apply it to similar men
    in similar circumstances. At the same time the story can be
    seen in Marxist terms as revealing the impersonal forces of
    the exploiting bourgeoisie and the dispossessed urban prole-
    tariat, each the victim of a capitalist economy, each the vic-
    timizer of the other.

    In practice, many stories operate, so to speak, at interme-
    diate points of meaning. The meaning of one narrative is re-
    alistic tending toward the symbolic; of another, symbolic
    tending toward the allegorical.

- prompt: "And now entreat that you all will join me in prayer to that Great  \nGod of Heaven whom have so grievously offended, being a  \nman full of all vanity, who has lived a sinful life in such callings  \nas have been most inducing to it; for have been a soldier, a  \nsailor, and a courtier, which are courses of wickedness and vice;  \nthat His Almighty goodness will forgive me; that He will cast  \naway my sins from me, and that He will receive me into ever-  \nlasting life; so take my leave of you all, making my peace with  \nGod.\n\nThere followed the famous moment in which Raleigh asked to  \nsee the axe. The headsman was reluctant to show it. \"I prithee, let  \nme see it,\" said Raleigh, and he asked, \"Dost thou think that am  \nafraid of it?\" Running his finger along the edge he mused, \"This is  \nsharp medicine, but it is a sound cure for all diseases.\" There was  \nsome fussing about the way he should have his head on the block.  \nSomebody insisted that it should be towards the east. Changing his  \nposition, Raleigh uttered a last superb plataseheWhat  \nthe head lie, so the heart be right?\" He prayed briefly, gave the  \nsignal to the headsman, and died.\n\nThe headsman needed two strokes to sever the head. After hold-  \ning it up for the crowd to see, he put it in a red leather bag, covered  \nit with Raleigh's wrought velvet gown, and despatched it in a  \nmourning coach sent by Lady Raleigh. Finally both head and body  \nwere buried by her in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster.\n\nC. P. V. Akrigg\n\n374 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION\n\nAkrigg states his point in the opening paragraph: Raleigh died  \nheroically. In the story itself Raleigh's own words and actions  \ncarry that theme. The writer wisely lets them speak for them-  \nselves. In effective narrative you must render scenes as you  \nwant readers to see them and not labor overlong on telling  \nthem why your story is significant. If you create real char-  \nacters and action, readers will gather the meaning.\n\nThe text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Narrative Technique**\n\nAnalyze how Akrigg employs effective narrative techniques in the passage to convey Raleigh''s heroic death.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two specific narrative strategies used by the author (e.g., direct characterization, dialogue, description).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how each strategy contributes to the overall theme of heroism.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this approach with the advice given in the text about effective narrative writing: "If you create real characters and action, readers will gather the meaning."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the author''s techniques to the theme of heroism and demonstrate an understanding of the guidance provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Symbolism and Meaning**\n\nExamine the symbolic significance of the axe and the red leather bag in the passage.\n- **Part A**: Interpret what the axe represents in the context of Raleigh''s death.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the red leather bag contributes to the narrative''s portrayal of Raleigh''s legacy.\n- **Part C**: Relate these symbols to the broader theme of heroism discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate symbolic analysis with the themes presented and demonstrate a clear understanding of the passage''s literary devices.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Narrative Writing Principles**\n\nUsing the guidance from the text about effective narrative writing, create a short scene (2-3 sentences) that conveys the theme of sacrifice.\n- **Step 1**: Develop a real character and action that naturally leads to the theme.\n- **Step 2**: Use descriptive language to evoke the emotions and atmosphere of the scene.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that the reader infers the meaning without explicit explanation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate mastery of narrative writing principles and effectively convey the theme of sacrifice through character and action.'

- prompt: |-
    It is not even necessary to state the point at the beginning or end of the story (though sometimes, as in the example by Akrigg, it is desirable). Edmund Wilson, for instance, does not tell us what the story of Peter Romano and Mr. Copace means: it is clear enough. Similarly the following brief narrative by Ernest Hemingway, which we saw earlier as an example of understatement, leaves its meaning for readers to infer:

    They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him down stairs and out into the rain. They tried to hihdup against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

    Hemingway's story exemplifies realistic meaning. For while one can read philosophical significance into the horrifying episode, there is no evidence that Hemingway intends us to jump to any philosophy. This, he implies, is simply the way things are; the story is its own meaning.

    The narrative also exemplifies "objective" presentation. It concentrates on the surface of events, on what can be seen and heard. Such objectivity is not a refusal to see and convey meaning, as inexperienced readers sometimes suppose. It is rather a special way of communicating meaning.

    NARRATION 375

    It can be a very powerful way. Hemingway does not fell us that war makes men cruel. He shows us; he forces us to endure the cruelty. The meaning of his brief story is more than an idea we comprehend intellectually. It becomes a part of our axpkaepnaed-aboding a part, probably, as if we had actually been there, but nonetheless a reality experienced.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Hemingway''s Narrative Style**\n\nExamine the passage from Hemingway''s story and identify three specific details that contribute to its ''realistic meaning.'' Explain how each detail serves to convey the narrative''s theme without explicit commentary.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference at least three concrete elements from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how they reflect the author''s intent to present reality without philosophical interpretation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Objective Presentation in Literature**\n\nCompare Hemingway''s narrative technique with the description of the hospital courtyard in the passage. How does the focus on observable details (e.g., ''pools of water,'' ''wet dead leaves'') serve the purpose of objective presentation?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly connect the textual evidence to the concept of objectivity and explain how this approach communicates meaning without subjective interpretation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Inference of Narrative Meaning**\n\nBased on the passage, infer the implicit message of Hemingway''s story. Support your conclusion with at least two pieces of textual evidence that demonstrate the author''s intention to present reality through concrete details rather than abstract ideas.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a clear inference about the story''s meaning and directly reference two specific elements from the text to substantiate your interpretation.'

- prompt: |-
    This is what the writer of narrative does at his or her best:
    re-create events in an intense and significant manner and thus
    deepen and extend the reader's experience of the world. Of
    course, in narrative of this rich and powerful kind we are
    entering the realm of creative literature and leaving behind
    the simpler world of exposition. Still, all narrative, whether
    literary or serving the needs of exposition, must have mean-
    ing, and that meaning must be rendered in character, action,
    and setting.

    Point of View and Tone in Narrative

    Writers are always in the stories they tell, whether that pres-
    ence is apparent or hidden. It is apparent in the first-person
    point of view told by an "I." The "I" may

    be the central character to whom things are happening. Or
    "I" may be an observer standing on the edge of the action
    and watching what happens to others, as de Monfort observes and reports the events at Malta but does not participate
    in them.

    Even though a writer narrates a personal experience, however, the "I" who tells the tale is not truly identical with the
    author who writes it. The narrative "I" is a persona, more or
    less distinct from the author. Thus "I" may be made delib-
    erately and comically ironic. Heanorous writers like
    James Thurber often exaggerate the "I" to be smarter
    and braver than the author actually is. And in literary narra-
    tive "I" is likely to be even more remote from the writer,
    often a character in his own right like Huck Finn in Twain's
    great novel.

    376 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION

    The other point of view avoids the "I." This is the third-
    person story, told in terms of "he," "she," "they." Here the
    writer seems to disappear, hidden completely behind his char-
    acters. We know an author exists because a story implies a
    storyteller. But that presence must be guessed; one never ac-
    tually observes it.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Point of View and Narrative Presence**\n\nCompare and contrast the first-person narrative perspective used in ''The I'' (as described in the text) with the third-person limited point of view.\n- **Step 1**: Define each perspective using examples from the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the presence of the narrator differs between the two perspectives.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your analysis by referencing specific textual evidence (e.g., ''The '

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Narrative Structure**\n\nThe text discusses how narrative presence can be ''hidden completely behind his characters'' in third-person storytelling. Using this idea, create a narrative scenario where the author''s presence is entirely obscured.\n- **Task**:\n  - **Part A**: Write a brief narrative (100–150 words) that demonstrates the complete absence of the narrator''s voice.\n  - **Part B**: Analyze how this scenario reflects the text''s assertion that ''we know an author exists because a story implies a storyteller.''\n  - **Part C**: Reflect on how the concept of narrative presence relates to the broader purpose of storytelling as described in the text (i.e., ''re-create events in an intense and significant manner'').\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s ideas about narrative presence and demonstrate a clear understanding of how storytelling serves to re-create events through character and setting.'

    Nonetheless the presence is there. Even if not explicitly
    seen as an "I," the writer exists as a voice, heard in the tone
    of the story. His words and sentence patterns imply a wide
    range of tones: irony, amusement, anger, horror, shock, dis-
    gust, delight, objective detachment.

    Tone is essential to the meaning of a story. The tone of
    Hemingway's paragraph, for example, seems objective, de-
    tached, reportorial on the surface. He avoids suggesting emo-
    tion or jlidy theintfetyotderrible," "cruel,"

    "tragic." Instead, his diction denotes the simple physical re-
    alities of the scene: "wet dead leaves," "paving," "rain,"
    "shutters," "wall," "puddle," "water," "head," "knees."

    The absence of emotive words actually intensifies the hor-
    ror of the scene. But the objectivity of Hemingway's style is
    more than rhetorical itriderstatement—though that—the
    trick of increasing emotion by seeming to deny it. The tone
    also presents a moral stance: a tough-minded discipline in the
    face of anguish. Men die and men kill one another, and we
    must feel the horror, feel it deeply; but we must also accept
    its inevitability and stand up to it and not be overwhelmed
    by it.

    Now all this is implied in Hemingway's styla—that
    the tone of his prose. It is obviously a very important part of
    what he is saying. Thus style is not merely a way of conveying
    the meaning of a story; it is a part of meaning, sometimes the
    vital part.

    Punctuation

    Introduction

    The Purpose of Punctuation

    All punctuation exists, basically, to help readers understand
    what you wish to say. Mostly marks of punctuation do this
    by signaling the grammatical or logical structure of a sentence
    (usually these are the same):

    In the long history of the world men have given many reasons for
    killing each other in war: envy of another people's good bottom
    land or of their herds, ambition of chiefs and kings, different reli-
    gious beliefs, high spirits, revenge. Ruth Benedict

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Tone and Style in Literary Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the tone and style of Hemingway''s passage as described in the text:\n- **Step 1**: Identify three specific words or phrases from the text that exemplify the objective, detached tone.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the absence of emotive language contributes to the overall effect of the scene.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how Hemingway''s style functions as a ''vital part of meaning'' according to the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference at least two specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between tone, style, and thematic content.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Punctuation Principles**\n\nExplain how punctuation serves both grammatical and logical functions in the quote from Ruth Benedict:\n- **Part A**: Identify three types of punctuation marks used in the quote and describe their primary function in the sentence structure.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the use of colons and commas in the quote contributes to the reader''s understanding of the reasons for war.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the role of punctuation in Hemingway''s prose versus the quote from Benedict. How does each author use punctuation to convey meaning?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of punctuation rules as described in the text and show how these elements are used to enhance meaning in different contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Literary Elements**\n\nThe text discusses how tone is essential to the meaning of a story. Consider the claim: ''A writer''s style must always reflect their personal emotions to be effective.''\n- **Part A**: Use examples from Hemingway''s passage to argue against this claim. Explain how his objective style can still convey deep emotional themes.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the idea that all effective writing must be emotionally expressive. Your example should reference at least two literary elements (e.g., tone, punctuation) from the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on style as ''a vital part of meaning'' challenges traditional views of storytelling. How does this perspective change your understanding of effective writing?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate concepts from both the Hemingway passage and the Benedict quote, demonstrating a comprehensive grasp of literary analysis techniques.'

- prompt: |-
    The colon divides this sentence into its two principal parts:
    the introductory generalization and the list of specific rea-
    sons. The commas within the list mark each single reason. The
    period closes the total statement.

    Less often punctuation marks stress an important word or
    phrase:

    In 1291, with the capture of the last great stronghold, Acre, the
    Moslems had regained all their possessions, and the great crusades
    ended, in failure. Moris Bishop

    380 PUNCTUATION

    Bishop does not need the comma before the closing phrase
    to clarify the grammar or logic of the sentence. Its purpose is
    emphasize and to stress the phrase. (The other
    commas in the sentence, however, function in the more usual
    way, indicating grammatical and logical structure.)

    Finally, punctuation may mark rhythm. Listen to this sen-
    tence closing an essay on General Robert E. Lee:

    For he gave himself to his army, and to his country, and to his God.
    W. K. Fleming

    The commas separating the coordinated phrases have no
    grammatical necessity. In such coordinated series, commas
    are not usually employed with and. Here, however, the re-
    quirements of a closing phrase are that it be regular

    in its they come to argue the greatestify

    Of course, these three functions of punctuation often over-
    lap. Sometimes a comma or dash both signals grammatical
    structure and establishes emphasis. And anytime you put a
    comma into a sentence to help readers follow its grammar,
    you automatically affect emphasis and rhythm.

    Still, keep in mind that these different reasons for punctu-
    ation exist. Asking yourself an unspecified question like "Is
    a comma needed here?" is not very helpful. Rather you must
    ask: "Is a comma needed here to clarify the grammar (or to
    establish a particular rhythm or stress)?" About Bishop's sen-
    tence we can answer that the comma before "in failure" is not
    required by grammar but is necessary for emphasis.

    "Rules" of Punctuation

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Punctuation Functions**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: "For he gave himself to his army, and to his country, and to his God." from W. K. Fleming''s essay on General Robert E. Lee.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Determine whether the commas before ''and'' are necessary for grammar or if they serve another purpose (e.g., rhythm, emphasis).\n- **Step 3**: Justify your conclusion based on the text''s explanation that punctuation may mark rhythm and that commas in coordinated series are not usually employed with ''and''.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s explanation of punctuation functions and demonstrate an understanding of when commas are used for rhythm versus grammar.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Emphasis vs. Grammar in Punctuation**\n\nExamine Moris Bishop''s sentence: "In 1291, with the capture of the last great stronghold, Acre, the Moslems had regained all their possessions, and the great crusades ended, in failure."\n- **Part A**: Explain why the comma before ''in failure'' is not required for grammar but serves to emphasize the conclusion.\n- **Part B**: Compare this use of punctuation with the sentence from Fleming''s essay. Discuss how both sentences demonstrate that commas can function to stress a key phrase, even when they are not grammatically necessary.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanation of punctuation''s role in emphasizing important phrases and illustrate how this applies to both examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Rhythm and Punctuation in Writing**\n\nConsider the sentence: "For he gave himself to his army, and to his country, and to his God." from W. K. Fleming''s essay on General Robert E. Lee.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the commas in this sentence contribute to rhythm rather than grammatical structure.\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar sentence using three coordinated phrases, ensuring that commas are not used before ''and'' and that the punctuation is chosen based on the text''s explanation of rhythm and emphasis.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how punctuation can affect rhythm in writing and show your ability to apply this principle creatively.'

- prompt: |-
    It would be nice if punctuation could be reduced to a set of clear, simple directions: always use a comma here, a semicolon there, a dash in such-and-such a place. But it cannot. Much depends, as we have just seen, on what you want to do. In fact, punctuation is a mixed bag of absolute rules, general conventions, and individual options.

    INTRODUCTION 381

    For example, a declarative sentence is closed by a period: that is an inflexible rule. On the other hand, placing a comma between coordinated independent clauses ("The sun had already set, and the air was growing chilly") is a convention and not a rule, and the convention is sometimes ignored, especially if the clauses are short and uncomplicated. And occasionally a comma or other mark is used unconventionally because a writer wants to establish an unusual stress or rhythm (like the commas in the sentences by Bishop and Fleming).

    But while punctuation as actually practiced by good writers may seem a melange of rule, convention, and idiosyncrasy, it does not follow that anything goes. To punctuate effectively you must learn when rules are absolute; when conventions allow you options (and, of course, what the options are); and when you may indulge in individuality without misleading the reader. Moreover, you must keep the reader in mind. Younger, less experienced readers, for instance, need more help from punctuation than older, sophisticated ones.

    In the discussions of the various punctuation marks that follow, we shall say—as is distinguishactual—to among rules, conventions, and unconventional but possible uses. At times the distinctions may seem a bit confusing. It is no good, however, making up easy rules about how to handle punctuation. Such directions may be clear, but they do not describe what really happens. Instead, we must look at what skillful writers actually do. To diminish some of the confusion, just remember that clarity of communication is the one simple "rule" underlying all effective punctuation.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Differentiating Absolute Rules and Conventions in Punctuation**\n\nIdentify which of the following statements are examples of absolute rules, conventions, or unconventional uses in punctuation, based on the text provided:\n- "A declarative sentence must end with a period."\n- "Commas should be used between coordinated independent clauses when they are short and uncomplicated."\n- "Using commas to emphasize rhythm or stress, as seen in the poetry of Bishop and Fleming, is an unconventional but acceptable practice."\n\n**Task**: For each statement, clearly label it as absolute, conventional, or unconventional. Provide a brief explanation for your classification, referencing specific details from the text (e.g., "The text states that..."), and explain how this relates to the writer''s intent in using punctuation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must correctly categorize each statement and demonstrate an understanding of the distinctions made in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Punctuation for Clarity and Reader Engagement**\n\nConsider the sentence: "The sun had already set, and the air was growing chilly."\n- **Part A**: According to the text, is a comma required between the two independent clauses? Explain your reasoning using definitions from the text.\n- **Part B**: Suppose the writer decides to omit the comma. How would this affect the sentence''s clarity for different reader groups (e.g., younger readers vs. more sophisticated ones)? Justify your answer with examples from the text, such as how punctuation helps "less experienced" readers.\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative punctuation mark that could be used to achieve a different emphasis or rhythm in the sentence, while maintaining clarity. Explain how this choice reflects the writer''s intent and the text''s discussion on individuality in punctuation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must address all three parts of the task and demonstrate comprehension of both conventions and the role of punctuation in reader engagement.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Punctuation Principles for Effective Communication**\n\nUsing the principles from the text, compose a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) that demonstrates effective use of punctuation. Your paragraph must include at least three different punctuation marks and clearly show how each is used to convey meaning, clarity, or stylistic choice.\n- **Example**: "The meeting was scheduled for 3 p.m., but the weather forecast predicted rain. We decided to reschedule it for tomorrow; however, the new time would require a longer commute. In any case, we will proceed with the original plan."\n\n**Task**: Write your paragraph and then explain how each punctuation mark serves its purpose according to the text (e.g., "The comma separates two independent clauses...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be grammatically correct, use appropriate punctuation, and clearly demonstrate an understanding of the text''s principles regarding clarity, conventions, and individuality in punctuation.'

    Remember, too, that punctuation is not something you im-
    pose upon a sentence after you have written it out. Commas,
    semicolons, and the other marks are an intimate part of gram-
    mar and style. Often mistakes in punctuation do not simply
    mean that a writer broke an arbitrary rule; rather they signify
    his or her confusion about how to construct a sentence. To
    write well, you must punctuate well; but to punctuate well,
    you must also write well.
    382 PUNCTUATION

    The Two Categories of Punctuation

    It is convenient to divide punctuation into two broad cate-
    gories: the stops and the other marks. Stops take their name
    from the fact that they correspond (though only loosely) to
    pauses and intonations in speech, vocal signals which help
    listeners follow what we say. Stops include the period, the
    question mark, the exclamation point, the colon, the semi-
    colon, the comma, and the dash. We look at these first.

    Then we look at the other marks. These more purely visual
    signals do not mark pauses (though on occasion some of them
    signal voice intonations). They include the apostrophe, the
    quotation mark, the hyphen, the parenthesis and bracket, the
    ellipsis, and diacritics (marks placed with a letter to indicate
    a special pronunciation). Along with these marks we consider
    capitalization and underlining (or use of italics), though, in a
    strict sense, these are not matters of punctuation.

    CHAPTER

    Stops

    The Period

    The period is called an "end stop" because it is used at the
    end of a sentence. More exactly, it closes declarative
    sentences, perception, idea, belief,
    statement, an imperative sentence, or com-

    mand (though these are often punctuated with an exclamation
    point).

    Abbreviations

    The period is used after many abbreviations: Mr., Mrs., Ms.,
    Dr. When such an abbreviation occurs at the end of a sen-
    tence, the period does double duty, closing the sentence as
    well as marking the abbreviation.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Punctuation Categories**\n\nClassify each of the following marks into one of the two categories: stops or other marks, based on their function in written communication:\n- **Comma**\n- **Apostrophe**\n- **Colon**\n- **Quotation mark**\n- **Hyphen**\n- **Ellipsis**\n- **Semicolon**\n- **Parenthesis**\n- **Dash**\n- **Period**\n- **Exclamation point**\n- **Question mark**\n- **Bracket**\n- **Diacritic**\n- **Underlining**\n\n**Task**: For each mark, provide a brief explanation of why it is classified in that category. Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between stops (pauses and intonations) and other marks (visual signals).\n**Answer Requirement**: You must correctly categorize all 15 items and justify your classification using definitions from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Period Function in Writing**\n\nExplain how the period functions as both an "end stop" and a marker for abbreviations, as described in the text. Provide examples for each use case:\n- **Part A**: Use a sentence that ends with a period to demonstrate its role as an end stop.\n- **Part B**: Construct a sentence where the period serves dual purpose by following an abbreviation (e.g., "Dr.").\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the primary function of the period in each case, highlighting how the text describes its versatility in written communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s definition of the period and illustrate both uses with clear examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Punctuation Marks**\n\nThe text discusses two main categories of punctuation: stops and other marks. Consider the following scenario:\n- **Part A**: A student is writing a research paper and needs to separate two independent clauses without using a period. Which punctuation mark should they use, and why?\n- **Part B**: Another student is attempting to indicate a pause in a complex sentence but finds that the dash does not suffice. What alternative stop could they use, and how would it function differently from the dash?\n- **Part C**: Explain how the use of an ellipsis (a series of three dots) differs from the use of a dash in terms of their intended meaning and punctuation category.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions of stops and other marks, and demonstrate understanding of how different punctuation marks serve specific functions in written communication.'

- prompt: |-
    Some abbreviations do not take periods: government agencies, for instance, such as the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or the GPO (Government Printing Office). If you are uncertain about whether a particular abbreviation requires a period, consult a dictionary or an appropriate manual of style.

    Not all abbreviations, incidentally, are allowable in composition. Some are perfectly acceptable: SEC, GPO, or Mr.,

    Mrs., Ms., Dr. (Most professors, though, do not like Prof.)
    Others are not universally accepted. For example, many teachers prefer that instead of &, i.e., etc., and e.g., you write out and, that is, and so on, for example. Colloquial, slangy abbreviations are not acceptable at all: econ and polysci are legitimate enough in conversation, but you should use the full words in composition.

    The Question Mark
    Direct Questions

    The question mark (also known as the "query" and the "interrogation point") is used after direct questions. A direct question is always marked by one or some combination of three signals: a rising intonation of the voice, an auxiliary verb inverted to a position before the subject, or an interrogative pronoun or adverb (who, what, why, when, how, and so on).
    "Qizsstoris (those answered by "yes," "no," or
    some variety of "maybe") are always signaled by a rising in-
    tonation, which may or may not be accompanied by the in-
    version of the auxiliary:

    You're going downtown?
    Are you going downtown?

    In speech the intonation alone (without the inverted verb) is

    Indirect Questions

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Abbreviation Guidelines**\n\nCompose a paragraph that discusses the difference between acceptable and unacceptable abbreviations in formal writing, using examples from the text. Your response must include:\n- A definition of what constitutes an ''acceptable'' abbreviation (e.g., SEC, GPO) according to the text.\n- An explanation of why certain abbreviations like & or econ are not acceptable in composition.\n- A clear distinction between formal and informal usage of abbreviations, with examples from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be logically structured and demonstrate an understanding of both the rules and exceptions outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Question Mark Usage**\n\nIdentify and explain three different ways that a question mark can be used to signal a direct question, based on the signals provided in the text. For each example, provide an original sentence that demonstrates the usage. Your response must include:\n- A direct question marked by rising intonation (e.g., "Are you going downtown?").\n- A direct question with inverted auxiliary verb (e.g., "Are you going downtown?").\n- An informational question containing an interrogative word (e.g., "Who is going downtown?")\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly reference the three signals described in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of how each signal functions in formal writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Abbreviations and Punctuation**\n\nEvaluate the following two sentences for correctness according to the guidelines provided in the text. For each sentence, explain why it is correct or incorrect, referencing specific rules about abbreviations and punctuation:\n1. "The SEC has issued a new regulation regarding stock trading."\n2. "Econ students often find the course challenging."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly reference the text''s guidelines on acceptable abbreviations in formal writing and demonstrate an understanding of when to use or avoid certain abbreviations.'

    Indirect questions do not close with a question mark but with a period. Like direct questions they demand a response, but they are expressed as declarations without the formal characteristics of a question. That is, they have no inversion, no interrogative words, and no special intonation. We can imagine, for example, a situation in which one person asks another, "Are you going downtown?" (a direct question). The person addressed does not hear and a bystander says, "He asked if you were going downtown." That is an indirect question. It requires an answer, but it is expressed as a statement and so is closed by a period, not a query.

    Rhetorical Questions

    A rhetorical question is a variety of direct question and must be closed by a question mark, no matter whether the writer intends to answer or not. (The notion that a rhetorical question does not require an answer is inaccurate. Rhetorical questions are often asked precisely so that the writer can compose the answer. And even when the writer does not state the answer, he or she expects the reader to supply it.)

    Question Marks Within the Sentence

    While question marks are primarily end stops, within the sentence they may signal doubt or uncertainty concerning a particular fact, idea, or feeling:

    It was the Lord who knew of the impossibility every parent in that room faced: how to prepare the child for the day when the child would be despised and how to create within—by an antidote to this poison than one had found for oneself. James Baldwin

    386 PUNCTUATION

    Occasionally a question mark in parentheses appears within a sentence after a word to indicate that the writer is uncertain either of the spelling of the word or of the accuracy of the idea. One does this only when no reasonable way exists of checking the spelling or the information. It is abusing a privilege to write: "In 1492 (?) when Columbus discovered America...." Anyone not sure of that date can fairly be expected to look it up.

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: What is the primary function of a question mark within a sentence according to the text and how does its usage differ when placed at the end of a sentence versus within the sentence?
  finalExamQuestion2: How does the text explain the appropriate use of parentheses with a question mark and what is the consequence of misusing this punctuation in writing?
  finalExamQuestion3: The text mentions that rhetorical questions often expect an answer from the reader. Provide an example of a rhetorical question from literature or everyday speech and explain why it would be considered effective as a rhetorical device.

    In both these sentences the first portion expresses a general
    idea (Hitler's "first principle"; "suburban housing for middle
    income families"). The second portion, introduced by a co-
    lon, particularizes the idea.

    Sometimes the specification takes the form of a list or series:

    388 PUNCTUATION

    There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.

    Benjamin Disraeli

    Occasionally the usual order is reversed, and the sentence be-
    gins with the specific word or phrase, which is followed by a
    colon:

    Centering: that act which precedes all others on the potter's wheel.
    Mary Caroline Richards

    But usually the specific follows the general. Such construc-
    tions are emphatic. The kpgcpfutation—the — point—is
    at the end of the sentence. The effect of the colon, which
    represents a relatively long pause, is to prepare us for some-
    thing momentous. The emphasis is seen very clearly in these
    cases:

    A once-defeated demagogue trying for a comeback, he tried what
    other demagogues abroad had found a useful instrument: terror.
    Wallace Stegner

    Finally, last point about the man: he is in trouble.
    Benjamin DeMott

    What distinguishes a black hole from a planet or an ordinary star
    is that anything falling into it cannot come out of it again. If light
    cannot escape, nothing else can and it is a perfect trap: a turnstile
    to oblivion. Nigel Calder

    Notice in all these examples that it is not necessary that the
    construction following the colon be a complete clause. It can
    be a phrase or even a single word.

    Colons are also used to introduce quotations (really a kind
    of specification), especially long, written ones:

    A master expositor, KV.Clifford, said of an acquaintance: "He is
    writing a book on metaphysics, and is really cut out for it; the
    clearness with which he thinks he understands things and his total

    389

    inability to express what little he knows will make his fortune as a
    philosopher." Brand Blanshard

    And sometimes rhetorical questions are introduced by a
    general statement followed by a colon:

    The question is: How and to what purpose? magawine

    In such a construction it is common practice (but not an absolute rule) to begin the question with a capital letter.

    COLON

    I. Introduces specifications, often, though not always, in the form of a list or series
    II. Introduces quotations, particularly extended written ones
    III. Occasionally introduces rhetorical questions

    The Semicolon

    The semicolon has two functions: to separate independent clauses and, under certain conditions, to distinguish the items in a list or series. The first function is by far the more common.

    Semicolon Between Independent Clauses
    Independent clauses may be joined either by coordination or by parataxis. In the first case they are linked by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, for, or, nor, yet, either...nor, neither...nor, etc.) which is usually preceded by a comma. In the second they are simply run together with no conjunctive word but are separated by a stop, conventionally a semicolon:

    Sentimentality and repression have a natural affinity; they're the two sides of one counterfeit coin. Pauline Kael

    390 PUNCTUATION

    Paratactic compound sentences punctuated with semicolons are especially common when the second clause repeats the first:

    The New Deal was a new beginning; it was a new era of American government. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.

    Wendell Willkie was publicly and privately the same man; he was himself. Roscoe Drummond

    All of these [esvoontersentd athk- white—toiled gree of thfyeadompound servants for greater or lesser terms. Oscar Handlin

    Using and in such sentences would be subtly misleading, implying a change of thought where none in fact exists.

    Parataxis is also effective between clauses expressing a sharp contrast of idea:

    Languages are not invented; they grow with our need for expression. Susanne K. Langer

    He [President Calvin Coolidge] knew precisely what the law was; he did not concern himself with what the law ought to be. Irving Stone

    The text is from The New Oxford Guide to Writing by Thomas S. Kane.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Punctuation Functions**\n\nCompare and contrast the two primary functions of a semicolon as outlined in the text: separating independent clauses and distinguishing items in a list or series. Provide examples from the text to illustrate each function, ensuring that your explanation clearly differentiates between the two purposes.\n- **Example 1**: Use the sentence ''Sentimentality and repression have a natural affinity; they''re the two sides of one counterfeit coin.''

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Paratactic Structures with Semicolons**\n\nExamine the sentence ''The New Deal was a new beginning; it was a new era of American government.'' According to the text, this is an example of paratactic compound sentences punctuated with semicolons.\n- **Part A**: Explain why using a comma instead of a semicolon would alter the meaning or tone of the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the effect of using a semicolon in this context, referencing the text''s explanation about how semicolons are used to avoid implying a change of thought where none exists.\n- **Part C**: Construct a similar paratactic sentence using a different topic (e.g., technology or education) and explain why the semicolon is appropriate in this case.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of parataxis, the role of punctuation, and your ability to apply these concepts to original examples.'

    Groups are capable of being as moral and intelligent as the indi-
    viduals who form them; a crowd is chaotic, has no purpose of its
    own and is capable of anything except intelligent action and real-
    istic thinking. Aldous Huxley

    Clauses like these could be joined by a comma and but. Omit-
    ting the conjunction and using a semicolon, however, makes
    a stronger statement, forcing readers to see the contrast for
    themselves.

    Occasionally even coordinated clauses are separated by a
    semicolon. This is done at the discretion of the writer and is
    more common when the clauses are relatively long and com-
    plicated, containing commas within themselves. In that case
    a semicolon more clearly signals the break between them. The
    following sentence is an example (the Duke of Wellington is
    commenting with pleasant cynicism upon the capacity of
    young ladies to endure the absence of lovers gone to war):

    They contrive, in some manner, to live, and look tolerably well,
    notwithstanding their despair and the continued absence of their
    lover; and some have even been known to recover so far as to be
    inclined to take another lover, if the absence of the first has lasted
    too long.

    Even when the coordinated clauses are not very long, a
    semicolon may still replace the more conventional comma if
    the writer wants a pigrsfigéanemphasis or rhythm:

    Children played about her; and she sang as she worked.
    Rupert Brooke

    So the silence appeared like Death; and now she had death in her
    heart. Ford Madox Ford

    Run-on Sentences

    A run-on sentence occurs when a semicolon has been omitted
    between uncoordinated independent clauses. Sometimes a
    comma is used instead (when it is, the error is often called a
    "comma fault"):

    INCORRECT It was late, we went home.'

    And sometimes the clauses are simply run together with no
    stop of any kind:

    INCORRECT It was late we went home.

    The most frequent cause of run-on sentences is mistaking
    the function of conjunctive adbrekbas+euchver,

    1. Commas are sometimes effective in such cases, the so-called comma link.
    Comma links are discussed on pages 286-87.

    hand, for example. These adverbs do not join clauses grammatically; they only show a relationship between the ideas in the clauses. In this they differ from coordinating conjunctions, which traditionally designate both a grammatical and a logical connection.

    The difference may seem arbitrary. The coordinating conjunction but and the conjunctive adverb however, for instance, can be used almost interchangeably between appropriate clauses. Even so, the first is a conjunction and needs only a comma (or maybe even no stop at all); the second is an adverb and, when it is unaccompanied by a conjunction, requires a semicolon:

    It was not late, but we went home.
    It was not late; however, we went home.

    It would result in a run-on sentence to punctuate it like this:
    INCORRECT It was late, however, we went home.

    Run-on sentences may be corrected in several ways, though for any given case one way will probably be best. The simplest solution is to put a semicolon in the proper place. Or the clauses may be joined by an appropriate coordinating conjunction accompanied by a comma (though this stop may be omitted if the clauses are short and simple). Or the two clauses may be recast as two sentences. Finally, the clauses may be kept as parts of the same sentence with one being subordinated to the other, in which case a comma may or may not be needed between them. Thus the run-on sentence "The search was fruitless, the men were discouraged" can be corrected:

    The search was fruitless; the men discouraged.
    The search was fruitless; and the men were discouraged.
    The search was fruitless. The men were discouraged.
    Because the search was fruitless the men were discouraged.

    Semicolons in Lists and Series

    Semicolons are conventionally used to separate all the items in a list or series when any of the items contains a comma. This is done because the presence of a comma within one or more items requires a stronger stop to signal the distinction between one unit in the series and another. Look at this sentence about the rise of the Ku Klux Klan:

    There were other factors too: the deadly tedium of small-town life, where any change was a relief; the nature of current Protestant theology, rooted in Fundamentalism and hot with bigotry; and, not least, a native American moralistic blood lust that is half historical determinism, and half Freud. Robert Coughlan

    Even when a comma occurs in only one item, consistency requires that semicolons be used between all the elements of the series:

    He [Huey Long] damned and insulted Bigness in all its Louisiana manifestations: Standard Oil, the state's dominant and frequently domineering industry; the big corporations; the corporation lawyers. Hodding Carter

    Semicolon with Subordinate Clause

    Now and then a semicolon separates a main clause and a subordinate one, a job conventionally assigned to the comma. The stronger semicolon is helpful when the clauses contain internal commas; it more clearly signals the break between the clauses and helps the reader to follow the grammar:

    He [the white policeman) moves through Harlem, therefore, like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes. James Baldwin

    SEMICOLON

    |.Between independent clauses
    A. Paratactic: semicolon is the conventional stop
    B. Coordinated: comma is conventional
    semicolon is optional for clarity or emphasis
    Il. In lists and series
    Semicolon between all items when any item contains a comma

    The Comma

    The comma is the most frequent and the most complicated of all marks of punctuation. It is least reducible to rule and most subject to variation, depending on the need to be clear or emphatic, the preferences of individual writers, and even fashion.

    [> Coordinated Independent Clauses

    Coordinated elements are grammatically identical constructions in the same sentence joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, for, or, nor, and the correlatives either... neither, both ... and, not but). Any part of a

    sentence may be coordinated: two subjects, two verbs, two objects, two adjectivals, two adverbials, two independent clauses.

    - **Part A**: Analyze the use of semicolons and commas in this sentence. Explain why the semicolon is used between the two clauses instead of a comma.\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar sentence where a semicolon would be appropriate to separate a main clause from a subordinate clause, following the example given in the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the role of punctuation in clarifying complex sentences. How do semicolons and commas serve different functions in separating clauses and items in a list?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between semicolons and commas in both lists and clause separation, as outlined in the text.

    As a very general rule, two coordinated independent clauses are punctuated with a comma; lesser elements, such as words, phrases, and dependent clauses, are not so punctuated. But exceptions occur, depending on the length and complexity of the constructions. Let's look at several examples.

    Two coordinated independent clauses are usually separated by a comma, placed immediately before the conjunction:

    STOPS 395

    It [history] is a story that cannot be told in dry lines, and its meaning cannot be conveyed in a species of geometry. Herbert Butterfield

    When such coordinated clauses are complicated and contain internal commas, the stronger semicolon may be used to separate them, as we saw on page 282. On the other hand when they are short, obviously related, and contain no internal commas, the comma between them may be omitted:

    They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. Emest Hemingway

    The Comma Link

    A comma link is a comma used between independent clauses that are paratactically joined by one of the coordinating conjunctions but simply run together. The semicolon is the conventional mark in such a construction (see pages 282-83), and employing a comma is generally regarded as a fault. Under certain circumstances, however, a comma may be used between paratactic clauses (though it is never obligatory). The clauses must be short and simple and contain no internal stops; the relationship of ideas should be immediately clear; and the sentences should move rapidly with only light pauses:

    A memoir is history, it is based on evidence. E. M. Forster

    The crisis was past, the prospects were favorable. Samuel Hopkins Adams

    When three or more such short, obviously related independent clauses are joined paratactically, comma links are even more frequent:

    Some of the people said that the elephant had gone in one direction, some said that he had gone in another, some professed not even to have heard of any elephant. George Orwell

    He becomes more callous, the population becomes more hostile,
    the situation grows more tense, and the police force is increased.
    James Baldwin

    The last sentence (about racial tensions in Harlem between
    white policemen and black residents) illustrates the particular
    advantage of comma links. By allowing rapid movement from
    clause to clause, the punctuation reinforces our sense of the
    inevitability of social cause and effect.

    Easy rules about when a comma link is effective and when
    it is a comma fault do not exist. Certainly long, complicated
    paratactic independent clauses (especially those containing
    commas) ought to be punctuated by semicolons, not commas.
    And even when the clauses are not particularly long and con-
    tain no commas within themselves, the relationships among
    ideas may not be sufficiently close and obvious to allow a
    comma link. In this sentence, for instance, a semicolon would
    be clearer:

    INCORRECT We are overloaded with garbage, in fact we have so
    much excess garbage that it is being used to make hills to ski on.

    For the inexperienced writer the safest course is to use a semi-
    colon between uncoordinated independent clauses unless he
    or she is very sure that a comma will help the rhythm of the
    sentence and will not confuse the reader.

    As the foregoing discussion suggests, the punctuation of
    independent clauses is not easily explained in a simple rule.
    Current practice is summed up in the following table:

    However, commas may be helpful in the members
    of such coordinated pairs when the first is long or when the
    writer wants a pause for emphasis. Thus in the following sen-
    tence the comma helps the reader to distinguish the two long
    predicates that follow the subject ("the twentieth century"):

    place, and demands something more mystic. George Bemard Shaw

    nated verbs (while not necessary because of their length) gives

    [> The Comma with Lists and Series

    A list or series consists of three or more grammatically parallel
    words or constructions such as three of four subjects of the
    same verb, say, or three verbs of the same subject, or four or
    five adjectives modifying the same noun.

    The items in a list, or series, may be joined by coordinating
    conjunctions ("She bought bread and eggs and cheese") or
    by parataxis ("She bought bread, eggs, cheese"). The most
    common method is to combine parataxis and coordination,
    linking the last two items with and, or, or but not, and joining
    the others paratactically: "She bought bread, eggs, and
    cheese."

    When a list or series is completely paratactic, commas are
    used between the items:

    Oriental luxury goods, jade, silk, gold, spices, vermilion, jewels,
    had formerly come overland by way of the Caspian Sea. . ..
    Robert Craves

    When it is completely coordinated, the commas are usually
    omitted:

    She was crying now because she remembered that her life had been
    a long succession of humiliations and mistakes and pains and ri-
    diculous efforts. Rrys jean

    In the combined method (the most frequent practice), a
    comma goes between each pair of paratactic elements and is

    His plan was to clinch his teeth, shut his eyes, whirl the club round
    his head and bring it down with sickening violence in the general
    direction of the sphere. p. G. Wodehouse

    But whether you choose to place a comma between the
    final coordinated items or to leave it out, you should follow
    the same practice consistently in any piece of writing.

    Finally about lists and series, remember that semicolons are
    conventionally used between all items when any item contains
    a comma within itself.

    400 PUNCTUATION

    Single-Word Adjectives

    Most single-word adjectives are reset inteatthat

    to the meaning of the nouns they modify. A restrictive adjec-
    tive is placed after the noun marker, if there is one (a, an the,
    some, this, any, and so on), and is not punctuated (italics
    added in the following examples):

    The angry man sat down abruptly.

    However, adjectives are often used in a rather different
    sense, being either placed before the noun marker (when one
    is present) and followed by a comma, or after the noun and
    set off by commas:

    Angry, the man sat down.
    The man, angry, sat down.

    They may even be pushed to the end of the clause and pre-
    ceded by a comma:

    The man sat down, angry.

    In such patterns (especially common with participles acting
    as adjectives), the word really functions more like an adverb.
    It tells us something about the action (in this case, how or
    why the man sat down) rather than about the noun (the man
    himself). Such "adjectives" are punctuated.

    Finally about single-word adjectives: when two or more are
    used together they are not usually punctuated if they are co-
    ordinated. However, should emphasis require it, the second
    of a pair of coordinated adjectives may be set off by commas:

    It [England] always had a peculiar, and a fond, relationship with
    the papacy. Paul Johnson

    STOPS 401

    When two or more adjectives are run together without con-
    junctions, they must be punctuated for clarity:

    A novel is in its broadest definition a personal, a direct impression
    of life... . Henry James

    Participial Adjectival Phrases
    Used restrictively, participial phrases follow the noun and are
    not preceded by a comma:

    A man leading a horse was walking inland from the sea.
    W. S. Merwin

    Often, however, participial phrases function nonrestric-
    tively. They supply pertinent information about the noun
    they modify, but not information essential to understanding
    its meaning in the sentence. Nonrestrictive participles are al-
    ways punctuated. They may precede their noun; follow it,
    introduced between it and the verb or remainder of the clause;
    or be postponed to the end of the clause. In any case they
    must be followed, set off, or preceded by commas:

    Born to lowly circumstances, he came up the easy way.
    Samuel Hopkins Adams

    Words, being but symbols by which a man expresses his ideas, are
    an accurate measure of the range of his thought at any given time.

    An adverbial is any word or construction used as an adverb.
    Adverbials are more flexible in their positioning than adjec-
    tives, modify more kinds of words, and convey a wider range
    of meanings. Consequently their punctuation is especially
    variable. In the discussion that follows, advice about using
    commas with adverbials must be understood as loose gener-
    alizations, which skillful writers frequently ignore or adapt to
    their particular need to be emphatic or clear or rhythmic.

    Single-Word Adverbs
    When simple adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other ad-
    verbs, they are not usually punctuated (italics are added in the
    following examples):

    He wept quietly.
    The people were extremely happy.
    Everyone was very deeply concerned.

    Sentence adverbs (those that modify an entire clause rather
    than any single word) are more frequently punctuated. In
    composition, sentence adverbs often take the form of con-
    nectives, qualifiers, and what may be called "attitudinals"
    (words like fortunately or unhappily that express a writer's
    attitude toward the statement he or she is making). Mostly
    such words are punctuated, whether in the opening, inter-
    rupting, or closing position (italics added):

    Further, Hamlet's world is a world of riddles. Maynard Mack

    Unhappily, the gibe has point. Brand Blanshard

    In spite of all these dissimilarities, however, the points of resem-
    blance were quite as profound. Bertrand Russell

    404 PUNCTUATION

    There is, however, considerable variation in punctuating
    such sentence adverbs. Some (However, for example) are al-
    ways punctuated. With others (therefore, luckily, fortunately)
    the punctuation is used than not—
    may be omitted if the writer does not like the pause and feels
    that clarity does not require it.

    When the coordinating conjunctions and, but, for, or are
    used to introduce a sentence, they are not punctuated, even
    though they are acting, for all intents and purposes, as con-
    junctive adverbs:

    Adverbial Prepositional Phrases

    In the first position, when they open a sentence, adverbial
    prepositional phrases may or may not be punctuated. Much
    depends on the conventions regarding ppeaskes, on the
    writer's own preference, and on the need for clarity or em-
    phasis. Some idiomatic phrases are usually followed by com-
    mas; this is especially the case with those acting as sentence
    adverbs signaling logical relationship or attitude (for example,
    on the other hand, of course):

    For example, in ft#té was produced in Great Britain seven
    billion yards of cotton cloth for export alone. Carl Becker

    Less formulaic phrases are often punctuated or not, ac-
    cording to the writer's sense of rhythm:

    lm crude way, Mickey Spillane is something of an innovator.
    Charles J. Rolo

    Of Pushkin's shorter stories The Queen of Spades is perhaps the
    most entertaining. Rosemary Edmonds

    However, if there is any chance that an initial phrase may
    be misconnected, a comma should always be used. These two
    sentences, for instance, would be clearer with commas:

    STOPS 405
    In writing these signals must be replaced by punctuation.

    In business machines are built to become obsolete within a few
    years.

    In each case the object of the preposition can be misread as
    grammatically tied to the following word, as if the writers
    were talking about "writing these signals" and "business
    machines."

    Within a sentence adverbial phrases are punctuated with
    great variability. What the phrase mbelifisjs placed,
    what rhythm or emphasis the writer wants are all important.
    A key consideration is whether or not the phrase is felt as an
    inteasupterdithanto the normal grammatical
    flow of the sentence. If it is, set off the phrase by commas.
    Interrupting phrases often come between subject and verb:

    Jerusalem, of course, contains more than ghosts and architectural
    monstrosities. Aldous Huxley

    Barrett Wendell, in his admirable book on writing, points out that
    clearness and vividness often turn on mere specificity.
    Brand Blanshard

    and would then probably not need commas. But placed where
    they are, they do require punctuation.

    At the close of a sentence or clause, adverbial phrases are
    not generally punctuated:

    The party adjourned to the kitchen.... Herbert Asbury

    He was quiet and in-dwelling from early boyhood on.
    John Lardner

    Final adverbial phrases may be isolated for emphasis,
    though the technique quickly loses value if overworked:

    When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer.
    George Orwell

    A writer has the option of omitting the comma afthort
    initial adverbial clause if clarity will not suffer. (British writers
    seem to exercise that choice more often than do Americans):

    When he describes the pastthe historian has to recapture the rich-
    ness of the moments, ... Herbert Butterfield

    However, the comma should never be left out if there is any
    possibility that readers will see an unintended grammatical
    connection between the last word of the adverbial clause and
    STOPS 407

    On occasion, if no operations were scheduled for the next day, he
    would be up early and out on an all-day hunt after getting only one
    or two hours of sleep. Ralph K. Andrist

    Adverbial clauses in the dosing position may or may not be
    punctuated. The primary considerations are clarity and
    rhythm. A comma generally helps readers follow the gram-
    mar, especially before clauses expressing a concession or qual-
    ification:

    The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, although the judges
    could not agree on any one opinion. Roger Fisher

    Now seldom cuss, although at first was quick to open fire at
    everything that tried my patience. Richard E. Byrd

    On the other hand, some writers prefer to omit the comma
    when the main and the adverbial clauses are both short and
    unpunctuated within themselves. The comma is often omitted
    before because if the pause might seem overly emphatic:

    Locke thought traditional theology worthless because it was not
    primarily concerned with — truth. Paul Johnson

    408 PUNCTUATION

    On one occasion, however, a following because-clause
    should be preceded by a comma. This is when it comes after
    a negative statement and is intended as a straightforward ex-
    planation of that statement:

    They did not elect him, because they distrusted him.

    Without the comma such a sentence may be read as an ironic
    assertion that "they did elect him and certainly did not dis-
    trust him."

    > Comma with the Main Elements of the
    Sentence

    The main elements of a sentence are the subject and object, separated by commas except under unusual conditions. Very occasionally when the subject is not a single word but a long construction, such as a noun clause, a comma may be put at its end to signal the verb (italics are added in the following examples):

    What makes the generation of the ‘60s different, is that it is largely
    inner-directed and uncontrolled by adult-doyens. magadinge

    In such a sentence the comma between the subject and the
    verb may help readers to follow the grammar.

    Commas may also be used with the main elements in the
    case of inversion, where subject, verb, and object
    are arranged in something other than their usual order. Some-
    times the pattern is object, subject, verb; if the object is a long
    construction, a comma may be set between it and the subject:

    What he actually meant by it, cannot imagine. Aldous Huxley

    The lectures, / understand, are given and may even be taken.
    Stephen Leacock

    Lenin, on the contrary, might, / think, have seemed to me at once
    a narrow-minded fanatic and a cheap cynic. Bertrand Russell

    In this type of sentence the main subject/verb is the "I think,"
    "IT understand." The rest (which contains the key idea) is a
    contact clause acting as the direct object, telling us what is
    understood or thought. If the sentence were in straightfor-
    ward order, no comma would be necessary between the main
    elements:

    lunderstand the lectures are given.. ..
    {think Lenin might have seemed....

    But when the "I understand" or "I think" is intruded within
    the noun clause, the subject/verb must be treated as an inter-
    rupting construction and set off by commas.

    > Comma with Appositives

    An appositive is a word or construction which refers to the
    same thing as another and is (usually) set immediately after
    it. When appositives are restrictive, they are not punctuated:

    The argument that the corporations create new psychological needs
    in order to sell their wares is equally flimsy. Ellen Willis

    In that sentence the clause is in restrictive apposition to the
    subject "argument"; it Spegifraent," and the noun
    would be relatively meaningless without it. Notice that the
    clause is not set off by commas. (Sometimes, however, a
    comma is placed after such a olause—though — before—to
    mark its end and signal a new construction.)

    Often appositives are nonrestrictive. In that case they must
    be punctuated. Usually such appositives follow the noun and

    STOPS 4ll

    should be preceded by a comma (and followed by one if they
    do not close the sentence):

    Appositives occasionally open a clause or sentence, thus
    preceding the word to which they are in apposition. Then
    they must be followed by a comma, as in this example where
    a series of three appositives precedes the subject ("Bishop An-
    drewes''):

    An absolute is a construction that is included within a sen-

    serves as a kind of loose clausal modifier.

    Nominative absolutes, the most common kind in compo-
    sition, may precede, follow, or be intruded into the main
    clause. In all cases they are punctuated (the absolutes are ital-
    icized in the following examples):

    The savings of the nation having been absorbed by Wall Street, the
    people were persuaded to borrow money on their farms, factories,
    homes, machinery, and every other tangible asset that they might

    A suspended construction occurs when two or more units are hooked grammatically to the same thing. It is really a form of parallelism, but an unusual or emphatic form, which readers may find difficult. Hence such constructions are often (though not invariably) punctuated:

    Many people believed, and still do, that he was taking Nazi money to run his machine. Wallace Stegner

    Prescott and Parkman were willing, and Motley reluctant, to concede that the sixteenth-century Spaniard's desire to convert American Indians had not been hypocritical. David Levin

    When the idiomatic phrase more or less is treated as a suspended construction, it always requires commas to distinguish it from its more common meaning. Usually more or less signifies a qualified affirmation, and then is not punctuated:

    He was more or less interested. = He was mildly interested.

    STOPS 413

    But when more or less is used in a strict disjunctive sense— that is, to mean either more or less, but not both — it is set off by commas:

    It is hard to say whether the payment for votes has become more, less, important. Ronald P. Dore

    > Comma with Dates and Place-names

    In American usage, dates are conventionally punctuated like this:

    April 14, 1926
    April 1926

    In European usage the day precedes the month, in which case a comma is unnecessary:

    14 April 1926

    In those place-names that consist of both a local and larger designation (state, region, province, nation), a comma is placed between the two:

    London, Ontario
    Kittery Point, Maine

    The Dash

    The dash ought not to be confused with the hyphen. It is a longer mark, and on a typewriter is made either by two hyphens (—) or by a single hyphen with a space on either side (-).

    The dash has no function that is uniquely its own. Instead it acts as a strong comma and as a less formal equivalent to the semicolon, the colon, and the parenthesis. As a substitute for the comma, the dash signals a stronger, more significant

    > The Dash Isolating Final Constructions

    Dashes force an emphatic pause before the last word or phrase
    of a sentence:

    Our time is one of disillusion in our species and a resulting lack of
    selfecbnfence!+éasons. Barbara Tuchman

    [> The Dash Around Interrupting Phrases
    and Dependent Clauses

    Dashes may set off dependent interrupting constructions such
    as nonrestrictive adjective clauses, adverbial phrases and
    clauses, appositives, and suspended constructions. In such a
    use, they create emphasis.

    Notice, in the last example, that dashes are clearer signals
    of the grammar than commas would be, since the interrupting
    series contains commas.

    As we saw with the comma (page 288), coordinated elements
    are sometimes punctuated for emphasis. Stronger stress can
    be attained by using dashes:

    Coordinated independent clauses are occasionally separated by a dash instead of the usual comma, but it is worth
    repeating that the dash is not the conventional stop for such
    a case and should be employed only when emphasis is nec-
    essary:

    He was a sad, embittered young melh-heaandght be.

    Even uncoordinated independent clauses may be punctu-
    ated by a dash instead of the conventional semicolon:

    [> The Dash Introducing a List

    The colon conventionally introduces a series of specifics. The
    dash, however, is employed for the same purpose. The only
    difference is that the dash is less formal:

    moted with all the devices of the gtjsagandist—atrocity
    over-simplification, lies, inflammatory speeches. Mons Bishop

    [> The Dash Around Intrusive Sentence
    Absolutes

    An intrusive sentence absolute is a completely independent
    second sentence which is stuck into the middle of a containing
    statement without being syntactically tied to it in any way.
    Such a construction must be clearly marked, but it cannot be
    set off by commas, semicolons, or colons, since these stops
    would imply a grammatical connection between it and the
    containing sentence which does not exist. Parentheses could
    be used and sometimes are; but they are a little formal for this
    kind of construction, which is colloquial in tone. Here, then,
    is the one function which belongs primarily to the dash:

    The Quotation Mark

    Quotation marks are used with (1) direct quotations, (2) cer-
    tain titles, and (3) words given a special sense. Quote marks
    have two forms: double '().and single ('...'). Most
    American writers prefer double quotes, switching to single
    should they need to mark a quote within a quote. British
    writers are more likely to begin with single quotes, switching,
    if necessary, to double. Whether single or double, the quote
    at the beginning is called an opening quotation mark; the one
    at the end, a closing.

    placement depends on whether the stop applies only to the
    quotation, only to the sentence containing the quotation, or
    to both. When the quotation is a question (or exclamation)
    and the enclosing sentence is a declarative statement, the
    query (or exclamation point) comes inside the final quote
    mark:

    She asked, "Are we going?"

    When the quotation is a statement and the enclosing sen-
    tence a question, the query is placed outside:

    Did she say, "We are going"?

    When, finally, both quotation and sentence are questions,
    the query is inside the quote mark, where it does double duty:

    Did she ask, "Are we going?"

    Notice that whether it goes inside or outside the closing
    quotation, the query (or exclamation point) serves as the end
    stop; no period is necessary.

    > Quotation Marks with Titles

    Some titles of literary works are italicized (in typescript, un-
    derlined), others are placed in quote marks. The basic consid-
    eration is whether the work was published or presented
    separately or rather as part of something larger (for example,
    a magazine or collection). In the first case the title is italicized;

    in the second, set within quotes. In practical terms, this means
    that the titles of books, plays, and long poems, such as the
    Tale are italicized, while the titles of short stories, short po-
    ems, essays, articles in magazines or other periodicals, and the
    titles of chapters or sections within a book are quoted:

    Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms has been made into a
    movie.

    A Winter's Tale is one of Shakespeare's so-called problem
    comedies.

    "A Rose for Emily" by William Faulkner is a shocking short story.
    In Vanity Fair, Thackeray calls one chapter "How to Live on Nothing
    a Year."

    The finest carpe diem poem in English is Andrew Marvell's "To His
    Coy Mistress."

    Slang and Colloquialisms

    It is not necessary to place quotation marks around slang or colloquial expressions, apologizing for them, so to speak. If the term says exactly what you want to say, no apology is needed; if it does not, no apology will help.

    The Hyphen

    The hyphen has two principal functions. It marks the syllabic division of a word between lines, and it also separates the elements of some compound words.

    [> The Hyphen to Indicate Division of a Word

    When separating a word between lines, you should always place the hyphen at the end of the upper line, never at the beginning of the new line. The word supper, for example, must be divided:

    sup- NOT sup
    per -per

    Words can be divided only between syllables. Most of us have only a hazy idea of the syllabication of many words, and it is best to consult a dictionary when you must split a word.

    [> The Hyphen with Compounds

    In certain compounds (two or more words treated as one) the hyphen separates the individual words. English does not treat compounds with much consistency. Some are printed as separate words (contact lens, drawing room, milk shake); some as single terms (famtikbatynidships); and still others are hyphenated (gun-shy, photo-offset). Some compounds are treated differently by different writers; you cannot tell how any particular compound is conventionally written without consulting a dictionary or observing how publishers print it.

    The examples we just saw are all conventional compound words. Another kind exists called the nonce compound. This is a construction, usually a modifier, made up for a specific occasion and not existing as a standard idiom. In the following sentence, the first compound is conventional; the other two are nonce expressions:

    Old-fashioned, wracetiga-lifetime, till-death-do-us-part
    Lesliédge Westoff

    Nonce compounds are always hyphenated.

    Hyphens, finally, have several special applications. When a word is spelled out in composition, the pauses which in speech would separate the letters are signaled by hyphens:

    Affect is spelled a-t-f-e-c-t.

    If it is necessary to cite inflectional endings or prefixes, they are preceded (or followed) by a hyphen. No space is left between the hyphen and the first or last letter of the cited term:

    The regular sign of the plural in English is -s.
    Amti are common prefixes, while -ence is a frequent suffix.

    When several different words are understood to be commonly combined with the same final element to form compound words, hyphens are placed after each of the initial elements:

    Parentheses

    > To Enclose Parenthetical Matter

    Parenthetical matter is a word or construction (which may or may not be grammatically related to the rest of the sentence) sufficiently remote in relevance to require a stronger pause than a comma would supply:

    Even for those who can do their work in bed (like journalists), still more for those whose work cannot be done in bed (as, for example, the professional harpooner of whales), it is obvious that the indulgence must be very Occasional. G. K. Chesterton

    Parenthetical remarks of this nary—abshidle
    punctuated with Ueshessusemof interest and va-
    riety as well as of necessary information. Moreover, such in-
    trusions loosen the rhythm of a sentence, suggesting more
    interesting patterns of speech. The effectiveness of parenthet-
    ical remarks, however, depends on their scarcity. Using one
    in every other sentence costs you whatever advantage the de-
    vice had, and overused parentheses become an irritating
    mannerism.

    When a parenthetical remark comes inside a sentence, any
    stop that follows it must be set outside the closing parenthesis:

    can be differences on this point), Hamlet accepts his world and we

    [>> Parentheses to Enclose Numbers or Letters

    the text:

    We must do three things: $t0dy the route thoroughly, (2) pur-
    chase supplies and equipment, and (8) hire a reliable guide.

    Brackets

    Brackets (which look like this: [ ]) are used in composition to
    enclose within a quotation any words that are not a part of
    it. Sometimes a writer needs to explain or comment on some-
    thing in the quotation. The sample sentence by Gilbert Seldes
    in the section on parentheses contains such editorial addition
    set within brackets. In the following passage the writer adds
    a comment within the words spoken by a guide conducting
    tourists around Jerusalem:

    "This area," he would say as he showed us one of the Victorian
    monstrosities, "this area [it was one of his favorite words] is very
    rich in antiquity." Aldous Huxley

    Sometimes, too, it is necessary to alter a quotation slightly
    to fit into its grammatical an eontkatysadding
    or an ending, for instance. Any such addition to the actual
    quotation must be enclosed in brackets:

    Johnson writes that "monkeys ... [are] held in great esteem by the
    tribe."

- prompt: |-
    The ellipsis is a series of three dots, or, under certain condi-
    tions, four. It is never five or six or any other number. In
    composition the principal function of the ellipsis is to mark
    the omission of material from a quotation.

    If the deleted matter occurs within the quoted sentence,
    three dots are used:

    Dante, someone has remarked, is "the lagteat Catholic poet."

    Notice the spacing: spaces are left between the preceding
    word and the first dot, between each dot and the next, and
    between the last dot and the following word.

    If the omitted material includes the end of the sentence and/
    or the beginning of the next one, four dots are used:

    Dante, someone has noted, is "the last great Catholic poet... ."

    With four dots the spacing is a little different. The first dot,
    which represents the period of the original statement, is not
    separated from the word it follows, but the spacing between
    dots remains. Notice too that the ellipsis is placed inside the
    quote mark.

    If the original sentence from which the final words were
    dropped was closed by a query or exclamation point, the ap-
    propriate stop is placed immediately after the final word and
    is followed by a standard three-dot ellipsis:

    lhas been asked, "Was Dante the last great Catholic poet?. . ."

    THE OTHER MARKS 431

    It is considered simple honesty to use an ellipsis to ac-
    knowledge that you have omitted something from a passage
    you are quoting. Of course, the omission must not change
    the substance of what the other writer said, and if you do
    alter his or her meaning, the use of an ellipsis will not save
    you from a charge of dishonesty. The same caution applies to
    adding explanatory matter within brackets: it must not sub-
    stantially alter the original meaning.

    The ellipsis is also used in dialogue to indicate doubt, in-
    decision, weariness, and so on. In the following sentence, for
    example, the ellipsis signals not an omission of any words but
    the trailing off of the voice, suggesting the speaker's uncer-
    tainty:

    She sighed and answered, "I really don't know...."

    Sometimes too a writer will use an ellipsis to imply a con-
    clusion which readers are expected to infer for themselves:

    And we certainly know what that remark means... .

    Diacritics
    A diacritic is a mark placed above, below, or through a letter
    in order to indicate a special pronunciation. Diacritics are em-
    ployed because the number of letters in any language is usu-
    ally fewer than the number of sigferfeoansdynds.
    Diacritical marks thus supplement the alphabet, enabling a
    single letter to do the work of two. English, while it certainly
    has more sounds than letters, has dispensed with diacritical
    marks except for the diaeresis occasionally seen in words like
    natveooperate (meaning that the vowel is to be pro-
    nounced as a separate syllable).

    But diacritical marks are common in some other lan-
    guageds—diee and acute and the cedilla of French,
    (the, mlaut of German or the(ilde of Spanish ().
    When you use a foreign word not yet assimilated into English,
    432 PUNCTUATION

    reproduce the diacritics that the word has. (If you are typing,
    it is easiest to put these in with pencil afterwards.)

    Underlining

    Underlining is the compositional equivalent to italic type.
    There are several reasons for underlining a word or phrase.

    > Underline Titles

    The titles of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals,
    books, plays, films, paintings, and long poems are underlined.
    Titles of works which were not published separately, but
    rather as part of something else, are placed in quotation marks
    (these include magazine and journal articles, short stories,
    short poems, and also radio and television programs). With
    newspapers the title is what appears on the masthead, except
    that it is now customary not to italicize an initial article: the
    New York Times.

    Names of ships are also italicized, as are the titles of long
    musical works (symphonies, tone poems, operas; songs and
    shorter compositions are referred to in quotes).

    [> Underline Foreignisms

    Any foreign expression that has not been fully assimilated
    into English should be italicized:

    de trop (French: "unwanted, in the way")
    datae (Italian: "life that is sweet, easy, enjoyable")
    Schadenfreude (German: "malicious joy at the misfortunes of
    others")

(They are in the preceding sentence be-  \ncause they are citation terms, not because they are foreign.)  \nBut in between such fully accepted terms and plainly alien  \nones like Schadenfreude, many words that have become re-  \ncently popular in English still have a faintly foreign air: bou-  \ntique, for instance, or detente.

    [>Capitalize Titles

    The first and last words of a literary title should be capitalized,
    as should all words in-between except articles &, the),
    short prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions:

    The City of Women
    The Call of the Wild

    However, when an article follows a stop in the title (such as
    a colon or comma), it is usually treated as a second "first"
    word and capitalized:

    Charles Dickens, The Last of the Great Men

    Remember that the titles of works published or presented
    separately (books, magazines, plays, long poems, films) are
    italicized (underlined), while those published as part of some-
    thing larger are set in quotes (articles, short stories, most po-
    ems, and also television and radio programs).

    > Capitalize the First Word of a Quotation

    The opening word of quoted speech is capitalized, whether it
    begins a sentence or not. However, when a quotation is bro-
    ken, the first word of the continuation is not capitalized un-
    less it is a proper noun or adjective or begins a new sentence:

    He said, "We liked the movie very much."
    "We," he said, "liked the movie very much."

    With written quotations capitalization of the first word de-
    pends on whether the quotation is introduced after a stop or
    is worked into the sentence as a noun clause following that.
    In the first example which follows, the quotation begins with
    a capital; in the second, it does not, even though it may have
    done so in the original:

    G. K. Chesterton writes: "This is the veddar optimism of
    Dickens... ."
    G. K. Chesterton writes that "this is the wedjar optimism of
    Dickens. ..."

    [> Capitalize Proper Names and Adjectives

    A proper name is the designation of a particular person, place,
    structure, and so on. A proper adjective is a modifier derived
    from such a name.

    Specific People
    Harry Jones, Mary Winter, C. S. Lewis

    When the name includes a particle, the particle should be
    spaced and capitalized (or lowercased) according to accepted
    usage for that name:

    Gabriele D'Annunzio
    Charles de Gaulle

    Nouns, verbs, and modifiers derived from proper names
    are not capitalized when used in a sense generalized from their
    origin:

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Quotation Capitalization**\n\nConsider the following two sentences: \n1. "He said, ''We liked the movie very much.''" \n2. "''We,'' he said, ''liked the movie very much.''"\n- **Part A**: Explain why the first sentence has a capitalized ''We'' while the second does not, based on the rules for quoted speech.\n- **Part B**: Compare this with the example given in the text: \n   G. K. Chesterton writes: "This is the veddar optimism of Dickens... ." \n   G. K. Chesterton writes that "this is the wedjar optimism of Dickens. ..."\n   Explain why the second quotation does not have a capitalized ''this'' even though it begins with a lowercase letter.\n- **Part C**: Apply this understanding to another example: \n   "G. K. Chesterton writes that ''this is the veddar optimism of Dickens.''"\n   Explain how the capitalization changes when the quoted speech is integrated into the sentence as a noun clause.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate accurate application of quotation capitalization rules to all examples, including the distinction between direct and indirect quotations.'

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Terminology and Usage Levels**\n\nDiscuss how the text defines ''usage'' as levels (as per page 252) and how this concept relates to the definition of ''tautologia'' (repetition) on page 218.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize the text''s explanation of ''usage'' in terms of levels.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how ''tautologia'' is defined and its potential impact on usage at different levels.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from the text where tautologia is used to demonstrate a specific level of usage.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate both concepts and show how they interact within the framework of writing practices.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Terminology and Structure**\n\nThe text mentions ''triadic sentence'' (167) and ''tricolon'' (167 n). Analyze how these structures contribute to the overall effectiveness of a narrative.\n- **Part A**: Define both terms based on the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how their use might influence the tone toward the subject, as defined in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example sentence that incorporates both structures and analyze its impact on reader comprehension.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of both terms and their functional roles in narrative writing.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Number Classifications**\n\nConsider the number $ \sqrt{25} $. Using the definitions provided in the text, classify this number into all applicable sets (natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, or irrational numbers). Justify each classification using properties and definitions from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Determine if $ \sqrt{25} $ is a perfect square.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why this number belongs to the set of rational numbers based on its definition.\n- **Step 3**: Justify that it also belongs to the set of integers and whole numbers by referencing their definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference at least three distinct sets and demonstrate a clear understanding of their definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Exponent Properties**\n\nSimplify the expression $ (x^3)^{2/3} $ using the rational exponent definitions from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Apply the power rule for exponents: $ (a^m)^n = a^{mn} $.\n- **Step 2**: Simplify the resulting exponent using integer arithmetic.\n- **Step 3**: Justify each step by referencing the specific property or definition from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final answer must be simplified to its lowest terms and explicitly connect each step to a defined property in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Number Sets**\n\nThe text defines natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. Consider the number $ \sqrt{16} $.\n- **Part A**: Determine which sets (natural, whole, integer, rational, or irrational) this number belongs to. Justify your answer using definitions from the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why $ \sqrt{16} $ is not classified as an irrational number, despite involving a square root. Use logical reasoning based on the distinction between rational and irrational numbers provided in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All numbers with exponents are irrational." Your example must reference at least two sets from the text (e.g., integers, rationals) and clarify how they relate to exponentiation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the hierarchy of real number classifications and demonstrate an understanding of why certain numbers fall into specific categories.'
