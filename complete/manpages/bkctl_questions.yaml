All books in\n\t      Books.plist must exist as book files/directories. All books in\n\t      the Books directory must have an entry in Books.plist. All book\n\t      files must be named <assetID>.{epub,ibooks,pdf}. This command\n\t      ensures that those requirements are maintained. This can be used\n\t      to recover lost books.\n\n     import paths ...\n\t      Imports one or more book files into the book library. The paths\n\t      may point to individual books files, or to directories\n\t      containing book files, which will be recursively scanned for\n\t      {.epub,.ibooks,.pdf} files."
