The Disk Mount\n       Conditioner is a kernel provided service that can degrade the disk I/O\n       being issued to specific mount points, providing the illusion that the\n       I/O is executing on a slower device. It can also cause the conditioned\n       mount point to advertise itself as a different device type, e.g. the\n       disk type of an SSD could be set to an HDD. This behavior consequently\n       changes various parameters such as read-ahead settings, disk I/O\n       throttling, etc., which normally have different behavior depending on\n       the underlying device type.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       Common command parameters:\n\n       •   mount - the mount point to be used in the command\n\n       •   profile-name - the name of a profile as shown in dmc list\n\n       •   profile-index - the index of a profile as shown in dmc list"

The type determines how various system\n\t   behaviors like disk I/O throttling and read-ahead algorithms affect\n\t   the issued I/O.

For SSD\n\t   types this latency is applied exactly as specified to all I/O. For\n\t   HDD types, the latency scales based on a simulated seek time (thus\n\t   making the access-time the maximum latency or seek penalty).\n\n       •   read-throughput - integer specifying megabytes-per-second maximum\n\t   throughput for disk reads\n\n       •   write-throughput - integer specifying megabytes-per-second maxmimu\n\t   throughput for disk writes\n\n       •   ioqueue-depth - maximum number of commands that a device can accept\n\n       •   maxreadcnt - maximum byte count per read\n\n       •   maxwritecnt - maximum byte count per write\n\n       •   segreadcnt - maximum physically disjoint segments processed per\n\t   read\n\n       •   segwritecnt - maximum physically disjoint segments processed per\n\t   write"

It can only degrade\n       (or ´condition´) the I/O such that a faster disk device behaves like a\n       slower device, not vice-versa. For example, a 5400 RPM hard drive\n       cannot be conditioned to act like a SSD that is capable of a higher\n       throughput than the theoretical limitations of the hard disk.\n\n       In addition to running dmc stop, rebooting is also a sufficient way to\n       clear any existing settings and disable Disk Mount Conditioner on all\n       mount points (unless started with -boot)."
