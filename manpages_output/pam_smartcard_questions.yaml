In\n     terms of the function-class parameter, this is “auth.”\n\n   The Smartcard Authentication Module\n     This module permits or denies users based on smartcard authentication\n     support in the Open Directory database, and the presence of an\n     appropriate smartcard in the reader attached to the local machine. When a\n     card is locked, the user is asked to unlock it with his PIN.\n\n   The following options may be passed to this account management module:\n     no_check_shell\n\t     Continues evaluation even if user's shell is not valid. Normally,\n\t     users with a shell like /usr/bin/false are considered as\n\t     disabled.\n\n     no_ignore\n\t     Return failure when an appropriate smartcard is not present."
