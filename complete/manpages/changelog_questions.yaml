It returns a\n\t      data structure describing the contents of this ChangeLog.\n\n\t      This data structure is a list where each element describes one\n\t      entry in the ChangeLog. Each element/entry is then a list of\n\t      three elements describing the date of the entry, its author, and\n\t      the comments made, in this order. The last item in each\n\t      element/entry, the comments, is a list of sections. Each section\n\t      is described by a list containing two elements, a list of file\n\t      names, and a string containing the true comment associated with\n\t      the files of the section."
