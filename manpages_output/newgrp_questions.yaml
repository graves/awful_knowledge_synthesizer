The environment and umask are set to what\n\t     would be expected if the user actually logged in again.\n\n     If the group operand is present, a new shell is started with the\n     specified effective and real group IDs.  The user will be prompted for a\n     password if they are not a member of the specified group.\n\n     Otherwise, the real, effective and supplementary group IDs are restored\n     to those from the current user's password database entry.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The newgrp utility attempts to start the shell regardless of whether\n     group IDs were successfully changed.\n\n     If an error occurs and the shell cannot be started, newgrp exits >0.\n     Otherwise, the exit status of newgrp is the exit status of the shell."
