The perlbug@perl.org address no\n       longer automatically opens tickets. You can use this tool to compose\n       your report and save it to a file which you can then submit to the\n       issue tracker.\n\n       In extreme cases, perlbug may not work well enough on your system to\n       guide you through composing a bug report. In those cases, you may be\n       able to use perlbug -d or perl -V to get system configuration\n       information to include in your issue report.\n\n       When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:\n\n       What version of Perl you are running?\n\t   Type \"perl -v\" at the command line to find out.\n\n       Are you running the latest released version of perl?\n\t   Look at <http://www.perl.org/> to find out.\tIf you are not using\n\t   the latest released version, please try to replicate your bug on\n\t   the latest stable release.\n\n\t   Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl, especially\n\t   those which indicate you haven't also tested the current stable\n\t   release of Perl, are likely to receive less attention from the\n\t   volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in\n\t   the current release.\n\n       Are you sure what you have is a bug?\n\t   A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be\n\t   documented features in Perl.  Make sure the issue you've run into\n\t   isn't intentional by glancing through the documentation that comes\n\t   with the Perl distribution.\n\n\t   Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a trivial\n\t   undertaking, but if you can point to documentation that suggests\n\t   the behaviour you're seeing is wrong, your issue is likely to\n\t   receive more attention. You may want to start with perldoc perltrap\n\t   for pointers to common traps that new (and experienced) Perl\n\t   programmers run into.\n\n\t   If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message you've run\n\t   across, perldoc perldiag for an explanation.  If the message isn't\n\t   in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl.  You may have\n\t   luck consulting your operating system documentation instead.\n\n\t   If you are on a non-UNIX platform perldoc perlport, as some\n\t   features may be unimplemented or work differently.\n\n\t   You may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the Perl\n\t   debugger.  For information about how to use the debugger perldoc\n\t   perldebug.\n\n       Do you have a proper test case?\n\t   The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be\n\t   fixed -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably won't be\n\t   addressed.\n\n\t   A good test case has most of these attributes: short, simple code;\n\t   few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; no\n\t   platform-dependent code (unless it's a platform-specific bug);\n\t   clear, simple documentation.\n\n\t   A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be included\n\t   in Perl's test suite.  If you have the time, consider writing your\n\t   test case so that it can be easily included into the standard test\n\t   suite.\n\n       Have you included all relevant information?\n\t   Be sure to include the exact error messages, if any.  \"Perl gave an\n\t   error\" is not an exact error message.\n\n\t   If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger\n\t   (dbx, gdb, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the bug\n\t   report.\n\n\t   NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info (often\n\t   -g), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use because\n\t   it will most probably contain only the function names and not their\n\t   arguments.  If possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and\n\t   reproduce the crash and the stack trace.\n\n       Can you describe the bug in plain English?\n\t   The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely\n\t   it will be fixed.  Any insight you can provide into the problem\n\t   will help a great deal.  In other words, try to analyze the problem\n\t   (to the extent you can) and report your discoveries.\n\n       Can you fix the bug yourself?\n\t   If so, that's great news; bug reports with patches are likely to\n\t   receive significantly more attention and interest than those\n\t   without patches.  Please submit your patch via the GitHub Pull\n\t   Request workflow as described in perldoc perlhack.  You may also\n\t   send patches to perl5-porters@perl.org.  When sending a patch,\n\t   create it using \"git format-patch\" if possible, though a unified\n\t   diff created with \"diff -pu\" will do nearly as well.\n\n\t   Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or requests\n\t   for more detailed explanations about your fix.\n\n\t   Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:\n\n\t   Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument to diff is\n\t   typically the original file, the second argument your changed\n\t   file).  Make sure you test your patch by applying it with \"git am\"\n\t   or the \"patch\" program before you send it on its way.  Try to\n\t   follow the same style as the code you are trying to patch.  Make\n\t   sure your patch really does work (\"make test\", if the thing you're\n\t   patching is covered by Perl's test suite).\n\n       Can you use \"perlbug\" to submit a thank-you note?\n\t   Yes, you can do this by either using the \"-T\" option, or by\n\t   invoking the program as \"perlthanks\". Thank-you notes are good. It\n\t   makes people smile.\n\n       Please make your issue title informative.  \"a bug\" is not informative.\n       Neither is \"perl crashes\" nor is \"HELP!!!\".  These don't help.  A\n       compact description of what's wrong is fine.\n\n       Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the bug is\n       in your code, or possibly to get no reply at all.  The volunteers who\n       maintain Perl are busy folks, so if your problem is an obvious bug in\n       your own code, is difficult to understand or is a duplicate of an\n       existing report, you may not receive a personal reply.\n\n       If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor the issue\n       tracker (you will be subscribed to notifications for issues you submit\n       or comment on) and the commit logs to development versions of Perl, and\n       encourage the maintainers with kind words or offers of frosty\n       beverages.  (Please do be kind to the maintainers.  Harassing or\n       flaming them is likely to have the opposite effect of the one you\n       want.)\n\n       Feel free to update the ticket about your bug on\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues> if a new version of Perl is\n       released and your bug is still present.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a      Address to send the report to instead of saving to a file.\n\n       -b      Body of the report.  If not included on the command line, or in\n\t       a file with -f, you will get a chance to edit the report.\n\n       -C      Don't send copy to administrator when sending report by mail.\n\n       -c      Address to send copy of report to when sending report by mail.\n\t       Defaults to the address of the local perl administrator\n\t       (recorded when perl was built).\n\n       -d      Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe output).\tThis\n\t       prints out your configuration data, without saving or mailing\n\t       anything.

Forces and supplies values for -s and -b. Only\n\t       prompts for a return address if it cannot guess it (for use\n\t       with make). Honors return address specified with -r.  You can\n\t       use this with -v to get more complete data.   Only makes a\n\t       report if this system is less than 60 days old.\n\n       -okay   As -ok except it will report on older systems.\n\n       -nok    Report unsuccessful build on this system.  Forces -C.  Forces\n\t       and supplies a value for -s, then requires you to edit the\n\t       report and say what went wrong.\tAlternatively, a prepared\n\t       report may be supplied using -f.  Only prompts for a return\n\t       address if it cannot guess it (for use with make). Honors\n\t       return address specified with -r.
