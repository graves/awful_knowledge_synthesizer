OS X support is provided through the functions getpwent(3),\n     getgrent(3), getfsent(3), getnetgrent(3), gethostent(3), getnetent(3),\n     getrpcent(3), getprotoent(3), getservent(3), ethers(3) and other related\n     functions.  Queries to NIS servers are sent by the opendirectoryd daemon.\n     The configuration of NIS clients is further described in the\n     opendirectoryd(8) manual page.\n\n     The YP subsystem is started automatically by launchd(8) if an NIS domain\n     is specified in the /etc/defaultdomain configuration file, and if the\n     directory /var/yp exists (which it does in the default distribution).\n\n     NIS is an RPC-based client/server system that allows a group of machines\n     within an NIS domain to share a common set of configuration files.  This\n     permits a system administrator to set up NIS client systems with only\n     minimal configuration data and add, remove or modify configuration data\n     from a single location."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `yp`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe canonical copies of all NIS information are stored on a single\n     machine called the NIS master server.  The databases used to store the\n     information are called NIS maps.  A single NIS server can support several\n     domains at once, therefore it is possible to have several such\n     directories, one for each supported domain.  Each domain will have its\n     own independent set of maps.\n\n     Client NIS systems receive all NIS data in ASCII form.\n\n     There are three main types of NIS systems:\n\n     1.   NIS clients, which query NIS servers for information.\n\n     2.   NIS master servers, which maintain the canonical copies of all NIS\n\t  maps.\n\n     3.   NIS slave servers, which maintain backup copies of NIS maps that are\n\t  periodically updated by the master.\n\n     OS X systems may be configured as NIS clients, but not as master or slave\n     servers.\n\n     A NIS client establishes what is called a binding to a particular NIS\n     server using the ypbind(8) daemon.  The ypbind(8) utility checks the\n     system's default domain (as set by the domainname(1) command) and begins\n     broadcasting RPC requests on the local network.  These requests specify\n     the name of the domain for which ypbind(8) is attempting to establish a\n     binding.  If a server that has been configured to serve the requested\n     domain receives one of the broadcasts, it will respond to ypbind(8),\n     which will record the server's address.  If there are several servers\n     available (a master and several slaves, for example), ypbind(8) will use\n     the address of the first one to respond.  From that point on, the client\n     system will direct all of its NIS requests to that server.  The ypbind(8)\n     utility will occasionally “ping” the server to make sure it is still up\n     and running.  If it fails to receive a reply to one of its pings within a\n     reasonable amount of time, ypbind(8) will mark the domain as unbound and\n     begin broadcasting again in the hopes of locating another server."
