This value returned is a byte offset that can be passed to\n       seek in order to set the channel to a particular position.  Note that\n       this value is in terms of bytes, not characters like read.  The value\n       returned is -1 for channels that do not support seeking.\n\n       ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such as a Tcl\n       standard channel (stdin, stdout, or stderr), the return value from an\n       invocation of open or socket, or the result of a channel creation\n       command provided by a Tcl extension.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       Read a line from a file channel only if it starts with foobar:\n\t      # Save the offset in case we need to undo the read...\n\t      set offset [tell $chan]\n\t      if {[read $chan 6] eq \"foobar\"} {\n\t\t  gets $chan line\n\t      } else {\n\t\t  set line {}\n\t\t  # Undo the read...\n\t\t  seek $chan $offset\n\t      }"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the tell command in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the tell command to determine the current byte offset of a file channel before reading data from it?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the tell command in conjunction with seek to undo a partial read from a file channel?
