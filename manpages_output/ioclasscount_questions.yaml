For example, if IONetworkController is\n     not directly instantiated, but its direct subclass IOEthernetController\n     has any instances, then IONetworkController's instance count will be at\n     least 1; if another direct subclass such as IOFWController has any\n     instances, then IONetworkController's instance count will be at least 2;\n     and so on.  (This modification of instance counts prevents unloading of\n     kexts defining superclasses that have no instances, but whose subclasses\n     in other kexts have instances.)"
