PPP can be used with other network protocols\n       besides IP, but such use is becoming increasingly rare.\n\nFREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS\n       ttyname\n\t      Use the serial port called ttyname to communicate with the peer.\n\t      The string \"/dev/\" is prepended to ttyname to form the name of\n\t      the device to open.  If no device name is given, or if the name\n\t      of the terminal connected to the standard input is given, pppd\n\t      will use that terminal, and will not fork to put itself in the\n\t      background.  A value for this option from a privileged source\n\t      cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user."

           PPP access to a server machine can be provided to legitimate users
           without fear of compromising the security of the server or the network
           it's on.  This control is provided through restrictions on which IP
           addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated identity (if
           any), and through restrictions on which options a non-privileged user
           may use.  Several of pppd's options are privileged, in particular those

    The default behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer to
           use a given IP address only if the system does not already have a route
           to that IP address.  For example, a system with a permanent connection
           to the wider internet will normally have a default route, and thus all
           peers will have to authenticate themselves in order to set up a
           connection.  On such a system, the auth option is the default.  On the
           other hand, a system where the PPP link is the only connection to the
           internet will not normally have a default route, so the peer will be
           able to use almost any IP address without authenticating itself.

           As indicated above, some security-sensitive options are privileged,
           which means that they may not be used by an ordinary non-privileged
           user running a setuid-root pppd, either on the command line, in the
           user's ~/.ppprc file, or in an options file read using the file option.

    When opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking user's user ID
           or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was
           specified by the user or the system administrator.  If the device name
           comes from a privileged source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an options
           file read using the call option, pppd uses full root privileges when
           opening the device.  Thus, by creating an appropriate file under
           /etc/ppp/peers, the system administrator can allow users to establish a
           ppp connection via a device which they would not normally have
           permission to access.  Otherwise pppd uses the invoking user's real UID
           when opening the device.

    AUTHENTICATION
           Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the other of
           its identity.  This involves the first peer sending its name to the
           other, together with some kind of secret information which could only
           come from the genuine authorized user of that name.  In such an
           exchange, we will call the first peer the "client" and the other the
           "server".  The client has a name by which it identifies itself to the
           server, and the server also has a name by which it identifies itself to
           the client.  Generally the genuine client shares some secret (or
           password) with the server, and authenticates itself by proving that it
           knows that secret.  Very often, the names used for authentication
           correspond to the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is not
           essential.

    Manpage text:

    At present, pppd supports three authentication protocols: the Password
           Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication
           Protocol (CHAP), and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  PAP
           involves the client sending its name and a cleartext password to the
           server to authenticate itself.  In contrast, the server initiates the
           CHAP authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client (the
           challenge packet includes the server's name).  The client must respond
           with a response which includes its name plus a hash value derived from
           the shared secret and the challenge, in order to prove that it knows
           the secret.

           The PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require the
           other to authenticate itself.  In that case, two separate and
           independent authentication exchanges will occur.  The two exchanges
           could use different authentication protocols, and in principle,
           different names could be used in the two exchanges.

When selecting a secret, pppd takes the\n       best match, i.e.  the match with the fewest wildcards.\n\n       Any following words on the same line are taken to be a list of\n       acceptable IP addresses for that client.  If there are only 3 words on\n       the line, or if the first word is \"-\", then all IP addresses are\n       disallowed.  To allow any address, use \"*\".  A word starting with \"!\"\n       indicates that the specified address is not acceptable.\tAn address may\n       be followed by \"/\" and a number n, to indicate a whole subnet, i.e. all\n       addresses which have the same value in the most significant n bits.  In\n       this form, the address may be followed by a plus sign (\"+\") to indicate\n       that one address from the subnet is authorized, based on the ppp\n       network interface unit number in use.  In this case, the host part of\n       the address will be set to the unit number plus one."

This default can be overridden with the\n       name option, except when the usehostname option is used.\n\n       When pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to the\n       peer, it first determines what name it is going to use to identify\n       itself to the peer.  This name can be specified by the user with the\n       user option.  If this option is not used, the name defaults to the name\n       of the local system, determined as described in the previous paragraph.\n       Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in the first field and the\n       peer's name in the second field.  Pppd will know the name of the peer\n       if CHAP or EAP authentication is being used, because the peer will have\n       sent it in the challenge packet.  However, if PAP is being used, pppd\n       will have to determine the peer's name from the options specified by\n       the user.  The user can specify the peer's name directly with the\n       remotename option.  Otherwise, if the remote IP address was specified\n       by a name (rather than in numeric form), that name will be used as the\n       peer's name.  Failing that, pppd will use the null string as the peer's\n       name."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pppd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nROUTING\n       When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the\n       kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for the ppp interface.\n       This is sufficient to create a host route to the remote end of the\n       link, which will enable the peers to exchange IP packets.\n       Communication with other machines generally requires further\n       modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)\n       tables.\tIn most cases the defaultroute and/or proxyarp options are\n       sufficient for this, but in some cases further intervention is\n       required.  The /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be used for this.\n\n       Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through the remote\n       host, as in the case of a machine whose only connection to the Internet\n       is through the ppp interface.  The defaultroute option causes pppd to\n       create such a default route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the\n       link is terminated.\n\n       In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a server\n       machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to\n       communicate with the remote host.  The proxyarp option causes pppd to\n       look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote host (an\n       interface supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a point-to-\n       point or loopback interface).  If found, pppd creates a permanent,\n       published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host and the\n       hardware address of the network interface found.\n\n       When the demand option is used, the interface IP addresses have already\n       been set at the point when IPCP comes up.  If pppd has not been able to\n       negotiate the same addresses that it used to configure the interface\n       (for example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic IP address\n       assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP addresses to the\n       negotiated addresses.  This may disrupt existing connections, and the\n       use of demand dialing with peers that do dynamic IP address assignment\n       is not recommended.\n\nMULTILINK\n       Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links\n       between a pair of machines into a single `bundle', which appears as a\n       single virtual PPP link which has the combined bandwidth of the\n       individual links.  Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under\n       Linux.\n\n       Pppd detects that the link it is controlling is connected to the same\n       peer as another link using the peer's endpoint discriminator and the\n       authenticated identity of the peer (if it authenticates itself).  The\n       endpoint discriminator is a block of data which is hopefully unique for\n       each peer.  Several types of data can be used, including locally-\n       assigned strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC addresses, randomly\n       strings of bytes, or E-164 phone numbers.  The endpoint discriminator\n       sent to the peer by pppd can be set using the endpoint option.\n\n       In circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or a non-\n       unique value.  The optional bundle option adds an extra string which is\n       added to the peer's endpoint discriminator and authenticated identity\n       when matching up links to be joined together in a bundle.  The bundle\n       option can also be used to allow the establishment of multiple bundles\n       between the local system and the peer.  Pppd uses a TDB database in\n       /var/run/pppd.tdb to match up links.\n\n       Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to negotiate\n       multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first link to the\n       peer, it will detect that no other link is connected to the peer and\n       create a new bundle, that is, another ppp network interface unit.  When\n       another pppd is invoked to bring up another link to the peer, it will\n       detect the existing bundle and join its link to it.  Currently, if the\n       first pppd terminates (for example, because of a hangup or a received\n       signal) the bundle is destroyed.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       The following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains\n       the auth option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file in the ppp\n       distribution).\n\n       Probably the most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP.  This\n       can be done with a command such as\n\n\t      pppd call isp\n\n       where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the system administrator\n       to contain something like this:\n\n\t      ttyS0 19200 crtscts\n\t      connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp'\n\t      noauth\n\n       In this example, we are using chat to dial the ISP's modem and go\n       through any logon sequence required.  The /etc/ppp/chat-isp file\n       contains the script used by chat; it could for example contain\n       something like this:\n\n\t      ABORT \"NO CARRIER\"\n\t      ABORT \"NO DIALTONE\"\n\t      ABORT \"ERROR\"\n\t      ABORT \"NO ANSWER\"\n\t      ABORT \"BUSY\"\n\t      ABORT \"Username/Password Incorrect\"\n\t      \"\" \"at\"\n\t      OK \"at&d0&c1\"\n\t      OK \"atdt2468135\"\n\t      \"name:\" \"^Umyuserid\"\n\t      \"word:\" \"\\qmypassword\"\n\t      \"ispts\" \"\\q^Uppp\"\n\t      \"~-^Uppp-~\"\n\n       See the chat(8) man page for details of chat scripts.\n\n       Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users.  If\n       the users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the\n       ppp service is to let the users log in to their accounts and run pppd\n       (installed setuid-root) with a command such as\n\n\t      pppd proxyarp\n\n       To allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an IP\n       address for that user's machine and create an entry in /etc/ppp/pap-\n       secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets (depending on which authentication\n       method the PPP implementation on the user's machine supports), so that\n       the user's machine can authenticate itself.  For example, if Joe has a\n       machine called \"joespc\" which is to be allowed to dial in to the\n       machine called \"server\" and use the IP address joespc.my.net, you would\n       add an entry like this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-\n       secrets:\n\n\t      joespc\tserver\t  \"joe's secret\" joespc.my.net\n\n       Alternatively, you can create a username called (for example) \"ppp\",\n       whose login shell is pppd and whose home directory is /etc/ppp.\n       Options to be used when pppd is run this way can be put in\n       /etc/ppp/.ppprc.\n\n       If your serial connection is any more complicated than a piece of wire,\n       you may need to arrange for some control characters to be escaped.  In\n       particular, it is often useful to escape XON (^Q) and XOFF (^S), using\n       asyncmap a0000.\tIf the path includes a telnet, you probably should\n       escape ^] as well (asyncmap 200a0000).  If the path includes an rlogin,\n       you will need to use the escape ff option on the end which is running\n       the rlogin client, since many rlogin implementations are not\n       transparent; they will remove the sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73,\n       followed by any 8 bytes] from the stream.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility LOG_RAS.  (This\n       can be overriden by recompiling pppd with the macro LOG_PPP defined as\n       the desired facility.)  See the syslog(8) documentation for details of\n       where the syslog daemon will write the messages.  On most systems, the\n       syslog daemon uses the /etc/syslog.conf file to specify the\n       destination(s) for syslog messages.  You may need to edit that file to\n       suit.\n\n       The debug option causes the contents of all control packets sent or\n       received to be logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP, EAP or IPCP\n       packets.  This can be useful if the PPP negotiation does not succeed or\n       if authentication fails.  If debugging is enabled at compile time, the\n       debug option also causes other debugging messages to be logged.\n\n       Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 signal\n       to the pppd process.  This signal acts as a toggle.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n       The exit status of pppd is set to indicate whether any error was\n       detected, or the reason for the link being terminated.  The values used\n       are:\n\n       0      Pppd has detached, or otherwise the connection was successfully\n\t      established and terminated at the peer's request.\n\n       1      An immediately fatal error of some kind occurred, such as an\n\t      essential system call failing, or running out of virtual memory.\n\n       2      An error was detected in processing the options given, such as\n\t      two mutually exclusive options being used.\n\n       3      Pppd is not setuid-root and the invoking user is not root.\n\n       4      The kernel does not support PPP, for example, the PPP kernel\n\t      driver is not included or cannot be loaded.\n\n       5      Pppd terminated because it was sent a SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP\n\t      signal.\n\n       6      The serial port could not be locked.\n\n       7      The serial port could not be opened.\n\n       8      The connect script failed (returned a non-zero exit status).\n\n       9      The command specified as the argument to the pty option could\n\t      not be run.\n\n       10     The PPP negotiation failed, that is, it didn't reach the point\n\t      where at least one network protocol (e.g. IP) was running.\n\n       11     The peer system failed (or refused) to authenticate itself.\n\n       12     The link was established successfully and terminated because it\n\t      was idle.\n\n       13     The link was established successfully and terminated because the\n\t      connect time limit was reached.\n\n       14     Callback was negotiated and an incoming call should arrive\n\t      shortly.\n\n       15     The link was terminated because the peer is not responding to\n\t      echo requests.\n\n       16     The link was terminated by the modem hanging up.\n\n       17     The PPP negotiation failed because serial loopback was detected.\n\n       18     The init script failed (returned a non-zero exit status).\n\n       19     We failed to authenticate ourselves to the peer.\n\nSCRIPTS\n       Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can be\n       used to perform site-specific ancillary processing.  These scripts are\n       usually shell scripts, but could be executable code files instead.\n       Pppd does not wait for the scripts to finish.  The scripts are executed\n       as root (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), so that they\n       can do things such as update routing tables or run privileged daemons.\n       Be careful that the contents of these scripts do not compromise your\n       system's security.  Pppd runs the scripts with standard input, output\n       and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an environment that is\n       empty except for some environment variables that give information about\n       the link.  The environment variables that pppd sets are:\n\n       DEVICE The name of the serial tty device being used.\n\n       IFNAME The name of the network interface being used.\n\n       IPLOCAL\n\t      The IP address for the local end of the link.  This is only set\n\t      when IPCP has come up.\n\n       IPREMOTE\n\t      The IP address for the remote end of the link.  This is only set\n\t      when IPCP has come up.\n\n       PEERNAME\n\t      The authenticated name of the peer.  This is only set if the\n\t      peer authenticates itself.\n\n       SPEED  The baud rate of the tty device.\n\n       ORIG_UID\n\t      The real user-id of the user who invoked pppd.\n\n       PPPLOGNAME\n\t      The username of the real user-id that invoked pppd. This is\n\t      always set.\n\n       For the ip-down and auth-down scripts, pppd also sets the following\n       variables giving statistics for the connection:\n\n       CONNECT_TIME\n\t      The number of seconds from when the PPP negotiation started\n\t      until the connection was terminated.\n\n       BYTES_SENT\n\t      The number of bytes sent (at the level of the serial port)\n\t      during the connection.\n\n       BYTES_RCVD\n\t      The number of bytes received (at the level of the serial port)\n\t      during the connection.\n\n       LINKNAME\n\t      The logical name of the link, set with the linkname option.\n\n       DNS1   If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this variable is set\n\t      to the first DNS server address supplied.\n\n       DNS2   If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this variable is set\n\t      to the second DNS server address supplied.\n\n       Pppd invokes the following scripts, if they exist.  It is not an error\n       if they don't exist.\n\n       /etc/ppp/auth-up\n\t      A program or script which is executed after the remote system\n\t      successfully authenticates itself.  It is executed with the\n\t      parameters\n\n\t      interface-name peer-name user-name tty-device speed\n\n\t      Note that this script is not executed if the peer doesn't\n\t      authenticate itself, for example when the noauth option is used.\n\n       /etc/ppp/auth-down\n\t      A program or script which is executed when the link goes down,\n\t      if /etc/ppp/auth-up was previously executed.

IP Version 6 over PPP December 1998.\n\nNOTES\n       Some limited degree of control can be exercised over a running pppd\n       process by sending it a signal from the list below.\n\n       SIGINT, SIGTERM\n\t      These signals cause pppd to terminate the link (by closing LCP),\n\t      restore the serial device settings, and exit.\n\n       SIGHUP This signal causes pppd to terminate the link, restore the\n\t      serial device settings, and close the serial device.  If the\n\t      persist or demand option has been specified, pppd will try to\n\t      reopen the serial device and start another connection (after the\n\t      holdoff period).\tOtherwise pppd will exit.  If this signal is\n\t      received during the holdoff period, it causes pppd to end the\n\t      holdoff period immediately.\n\n       SIGUSR1\n\t      This signal toggles the state of the debug option.\n\n       SIGUSR2\n\t      This signal causes pppd to renegotiate compression.  This can be\n\t      useful to re-enable compression after it has been disabled as a\n\t      result of a fatal decompression error.  (Fatal decompression\n\t      errors generally indicate a bug in one or other implementation.)"
