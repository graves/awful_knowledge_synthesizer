Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `manpath`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nMANPATH(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t    MANPATH(1)\n\nNAME\n     manpath â€“ display search path for manual pages\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     manpath [-Ldq]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The manpath utility determines the user's manual search path from the\n     user's PATH, and local configuration files.  This result is echoed to the\n     standard output.\n\n     -L     Output manual locales list instead of the manual path.\n\n     -d     Print extra debugging information.\n\n     -q     Suppresses warning messages.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION NOTES\n     The manpath utility constructs the manual path from two sources:\n     1.   From each component of the user's PATH for the first of:\n\t  -   pathname/man\n\t  -   pathname/MAN\n\t  -   If pathname ends with /bin: pathname/../share/man and\n\t      pathname/../man\n     2.   The configuration files listed in the FILES section for MANPATH\n\t  entries.\n     The information from these locations is then concatenated together.\n\n     If the -L flag is set, the manpath utility will search the configuration\n     files listed in the FILES section for MANLOCALE entries."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use manpath to display the manual search path without any warning messages?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how to use the -L flag with manpath to list the manual locales available on the system?
