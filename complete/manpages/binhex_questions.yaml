All invocations support the three verbs encode, decode,\n     and probe.\n\n     If multiple files are passed to probe, the exit status will be non-zero\n     only if all files contain data in the specified encoding.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -f, --force\n\t      perform the operation even if the output file already exists\n\n     -h, --help\n\t      display version and usage, then quit\n\n     -v, --verbose\n\t      be verbose\n\n     -V, --version\n\t      display version, then quit"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the applesingle, binhex, and macbinary tools?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the binhex tool to encode a file into a binary hex format with verbose output and force overwrite of existing files?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the applesingle tool to encode a file with a custom suffix and verbose output?

For\n\t      encode, write encoded data to the standard output.

For\n\t      encode, the appropriate suffix will be added to name.  -o\n\t      implies only one file to be encoded or decoded.\n\n     -s, --suffix .suf\n\t      override the default suffix for the given encoding\n\n     -R, --no-runlength-encoding\n\t      don't use BinHex runlength compression when encoding\n\n     -t, --type 1-3\n\t      Specify MacBinary encoding type.\tType 1 is undesirable because\n\t      it has neither a checksum nor a signature and is thus difficult\n\t      to recognize.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n     In general, the tool returns a non-zero exit status if it fails.\n\nDarwin\t\t\t       14 November 2005 \t\t\tDarwin"

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use binhex to encode a file named 'input.bin' into a BinHex format and save it as 'output.hqx'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using binhex to decode a BinHex file 'input.hqx' into plain data and write it to 'output.bin'?
