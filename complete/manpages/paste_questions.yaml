The\n\t\t characters in list are used circularly, i.e., when list is\n\t\t exhausted the first character from list is reused.  This\n\t\t continues until a line from the last input file (in default\n\t\t operation) or the last line in each file (using the -s\n\t\t option) is displayed, at which time paste begins selecting\n\t\t characters from the beginning of list again."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the paste command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use paste to merge lines from multiple files, using a custom delimiter such as '|||' instead of the default tab?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using paste with the -s option to concatenate all lines from a single file, using a custom delimiter like '---'?
