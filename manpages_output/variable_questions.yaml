Each variable name is\n       initialized with value.\tThe value for the last variable is optional.\n\n       If a variable name does not exist, it is created.  In this case, if\n       value is specified, it is assigned to the newly created variable.  If\n       no value is specified, the new variable is left undefined.  If the\n       variable already exists, it is set to value if value is specified or\n       left unchanged if no value is given.  Normally, name is unqualified\n       (does not include the names of any containing namespaces), and the\n       variable is created in the current namespace.  If name includes any\n       namespace qualifiers, the variable is created in the specified\n       namespace.  If the variable is not defined, it will be visible to the\n       namespace which command, but not to the info exists command.\n\n       If the variable command is executed inside a Tcl procedure, it creates\n       local variables linked to the corresponding namespace variables (and\n       therefore these variables are listed by info vars.)  In this way the\n       variable command resembles the global command, although the global\n       command only links to variables in the global namespace.  If any values\n       are given, they are used to modify the values of the associated\n       namespace variables.  If a namespace variable does not exist, it is\n       created and optionally initialized.\n\n       A name argument cannot reference an element within an array.  Instead,\n       name should reference the entire array, and the initialization value\n       should be left off.  After the variable has been declared, elements\n       within the array can be set using ordinary set or array commands.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Create a variable in a namespace:\n\t      namespace eval foo {\n\t\t  variable bar 12345\n\t      }\n\n       Create an array in a namespace:\n\t      namespace eval someNS {\n\t\t  variable someAry\n\t\t  array set someAry {\n\t\t      someName\tsomeValue\n\t\t      otherName otherValue\n\t\t  }\n\t      }\n\n       Access variables in namespaces from a procedure:\n\t      namespace eval foo {\n\t\t  proc spong {} {\n\t\t      # Variable in this namespace\n\t\t      variable bar\n\t\t      puts \"bar is $bar\"\n\n\t\t      # Variable in another namespace\n\t\t      variable ::someNS::someAry\n\t\t      parray someAry\n\t\t  }\n\t      }"
