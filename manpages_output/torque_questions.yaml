This\n     is achieved by launching one or more child processes performing a series\n     of operations (usually high bandwidth) and after completion reporting the\n     bandwidth achieved by each operation during a period where all operation\n     streams were executing simultaneously in their steady-state behavior.\n     Note that torque only measures its own processes and does not measure\n     bandwidth of any other executing process.\n\n     This tool is currently in use for measuring system bandwidth, testing for\n     interactions between different sub-systems, reproducing problems, power\n     analysis, thermal analysis, signal sensitivity analysis, and more.\n     torque contains a number of simple tests that are used together in any\n     combination to exercise memory, video, and/or any component that supports\n     a file system.  Each separate test is run in its own process, and each\n     action listed above specifies one or more tests to execute\n     simultaneously.  Common processor memory access patterns such as bcopy,\n     bzero, load, and store are supported as well as different ways to access\n     the file system.  All test runtime parameters can be entered using a\n     configuration file or as a command line parameter."

    Manpage text:

    torque -n 256 -i 1 -V 6

         to make sure there are exactly 256 transactions (-n 256) issued once.
         The local parameters "-n 256 -i 1" only apply to the video read test and
         not to any other test.  If the user wishes to execute a stream of memory
         reads while performing the video read test an example command line is:

         torque -p 1 -n 8 -i 20 -MB 4 -load -n 256 -V 6

         In this case the load test has a working-set size of 4 x 8 = 32 MBytes
         (-n 8 -MB 4) that is executed twenty times (-i 20).  The video test still
         uses the same parameters mentioned above but is executed ten times
         (default) since "-i 1" was not entered on the command line.  Note that
         the "-i 20" does not apply to the video test in this example.

         Global parameters can be entered anywhere on the command line and control
         functions that affect all of the tests.  For example

         torque -n 256 -i 1 -V 6 -nh

    Manpage text:

    During testing there is no information printed to the terminal as a
         printf/cout is very system intensive and may change the measured results.
         This means that during testing there is no feedback to let the user know
         that everything is progressing properly.  When planning to perform long
         tests, run shorter versions first to make sure the test is progressing
         properly before starting a long test.  Measuring Multiple Simultaneous
         Tests on page 28 of the torque documentation (a pointer to the
         documentation is located in the SEE ALSO section below) details how
         testing is performed to make sure that all tests are executing
         simultaneously during the measurement interval.  Of course if a user
         tries to run more tests than the machine has resources to support, such
         as two memory tests on a single processor as performed above, torque does
         nothing to prevent it.

         The last step of execution is to report the results of testing.  This is
         done in three sections:  individual test information, table of
         bandwidths, and summary/totals.  Each group of tests, one group for every
         action, details statistics on items like transfer size, number of
         transactions, etc.  Appended at the end is the portion of the command
         line that was relevant to the group of tests described.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `torque`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe table of bandwidths has a number of columns:\n\n       proc:  Process/test number\n       Start:  Start time of measurement in milliseconds\n       Finish:\tFinish time of measurement in milliseconds\n       Diff:  Measurement duration in milliseconds (Finish - Start)\n       Xfers:  Number of transfers during measurement interval\n       BW(MB/s):  Measured bandwidth in MBytes/second\n       TS(KB):\tTransfer size of each transfer\n       IO/sec:\tIOmeter like reporting (best to ignore).\n       Test:  Test Type.  This may also include a number such as Display\n     number for the video tests or file accessed for the hard drive tests\n       File:  File name if applicable\n       PID:  Process Id for the testing process\n\n     Though this is a great way to catalog the results for one execution, it\n     can be very hard to combine into a table of multiple executions.  There\n     are also caveats such as a bcopy performing 1 MByte/sec of bcopy, but\n     actually resulting in 2 MBytes/second of system bandwidth.  A comma\n     separated list of individual system bandwidths for each test is included\n     to make it easy to combine multiple executions of torque in a single\n     spreadsheet.  Only the tests names that are executed are included in the\n     comma separated list to keep the list from getting too long.  Lastly\n     torque reports the total system bandwidth consumed.  An easy way to\n     extract just the comma separated bandwidths is to redirect multiple test\n     outputs to a file and then use grep to grab the bandwidth results line.\n     You may have to add a \"-a\" to grep since some commands like \"date\"\n     sometimes use output that makes grep think the output file is binary."
