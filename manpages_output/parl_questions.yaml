Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `parl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPARL(1) \t      User Contributed Perl Documentation\t       PARL(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       parl - Binary PAR Loader\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       (Please see pp for convenient ways to make self-contained executables,\n       scripts or PAR archives from perl programs.)\n\n       To make a PAR distribution from a CPAN module distribution:\n\n\t   % parl -p\t\t     # make a PAR dist under the current path\n\t   % parl -p Foo-0.01\t     # assume unpacked CPAN dist in Foo-0.01/\n\n       To manipulate a PAR distribution:\n\n\t   % parl -i Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # install\n\t   % parl -i http://foo.com/Foo-0.01\t       # auto-appends archname + perlver\n\t   % parl -i cpan://AUTRIJUS/PAR-0.74\t       # uses CPAN author directory\n\t   % parl -u Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # uninstall\n\t   % parl -s Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # sign\n\t   % parl -v Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # verify\n\n       To use Hello.pm from ./foo.par:\n\n\t   % parl -A./foo.par -MHello\n\t   % parl -A./foo -MHello      # the .par part is optional\n\n       Same thing, but search foo.par in the @INC;\n\n\t   % parl -Ifoo.par -MHello\n\t   % parl -Ifoo -MHello        # ditto\n\n       Run test.pl or script/test.pl from foo.par:\n\n\t   % parl foo.par test.pl      # looks for 'main.pl' by default,\n\t\t\t\t       # otherwise run 'test.pl'\n\n       To make a self-containing executable containing a PAR file :\n\n\t   % parl -O./foo foo.par\n\t   % ./foo test.pl\t       # same as above\n\n       To embed the necessary non-core modules and shared objects for PAR's\n       execution (like \"Zlib\", \"IO\", \"Cwd\", etc), use the -b flag:\n\n\t   % parl -b -O./foo foo.par\n\t   % ./foo test.pl\t       # runs anywhere with core modules installed\n\n       If you also wish to embed core modules along, use the -B flag instead:\n\n\t   % parl -B -O./foo foo.par\n\t   % ./foo test.pl\t       # runs anywhere with the perl interpreter\n\n       This is particularly useful when making stand-alone binary executables;\n       see pp for details.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This stand-alone command offers roughly the same feature as \"perl\n       -MPAR\", except that it takes the pre-loaded .par files via \"-Afoo.par\"\n       instead of \"-MPAR=foo.par\".\n\n       Additionally, it lets you convert a CPAN distribution to a PAR\n       distribution, as well as manipulate such distributions.\tFor more\n       information about PAR distributions, see PAR::Dist.\n\n       You can use it to run .par files:\n\n\t   # runs script/run.pl in archive, uses its lib/* as libraries\n\t   % parl myapp.par run.pl     # runs run.pl or script/run.pl in myapp.par\n\t   % parl otherapp.pl\t       # also runs normal perl scripts\n\n       However, if the .par archive contains either main.pl or script/main.pl,\n       it is used instead:\n\n\t   % parl myapp.par run.pl     # runs main.pl, with 'run.pl' as @ARGV\n\n       Finally, the \"-O\" option makes a stand-alone binary executable from a\n       PAR file:\n\n\t   % parl -B -Omyapp myapp.par\n\t   % ./myapp\t\t       # run it anywhere without perl binaries\n\n       With the \"--par-options\" flag, generated binaries can act as \"parl\" to\n       pack new binaries:\n\n\t   % ./myapp --par-options -Omyap2 myapp.par   # identical to ./myapp\n\t   % ./myapp --par-options -Omyap3 myap3.par   # now with different PAR\n\n       For an explanation of stand-alone executable format, please see par.pl.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       PAR, PAR::Dist, par.pl, pp\n\nAUTHORS\n       Audrey Tang <cpan@audreyt.org>\n\n       You can write to the mailing list at <par@perl.org>, or send an empty\n       mail to <par-subscribe@perl.org> to participate in the discussion.\n\n       Please submit bug reports to <bug-par-packer@rt.cpan.org>.\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright 2002-2009 by Audrey Tang <cpan@audreyt.org>.\n\n       Neither this program nor the associated pp program impose any licensing\n       restrictions on files generated by their execution, in accordance with\n       the 8th article of the Artistic License:\n\n\t   \"Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is\n\t   always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded;\n\t   that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's\n\t   interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.\n\t   Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\"\n\n       Therefore, you are absolutely free to place any license on the\n       resulting executable, as long as the packed 3rd-party libraries are\n       also available under the Artistic License.\n\n       This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n       under the same terms as Perl itself.\n\n       See LICENSE.\n\nperl v5.34.0\t\t\t  2020-03-08\t\t\t       PARL(1)"
