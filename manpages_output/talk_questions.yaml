    Manpage text:

    talk  your_name@your_machine

         It does not matter from which machine the recipient replies, as long as
         his login-name is the same.  Once communication is established, the two
         parties may type simultaneously, with their output appearing in separate
         windows.  Typing control-L ‘^L’ will cause the screen to be reprinted.
         Typing control-D ‘^D’ will clear both parts of your screen to be cleared,
         while the control-D character will be sent to the remote side (and just
         displayed by this talk client).  Your erase, kill, and word kill
         characters will behave normally.  To exit, just type your interrupt
         character; talk then moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and
         restores the terminal to its previous state.

         Permission to talk may be denied or granted by use of the mesg(1)
         command.  At the outset talking is allowed.

    CONFIGURATION
         The talk utility relies on the talkd system daemon.  See talkd(8) for
         information about enabling talkd.
