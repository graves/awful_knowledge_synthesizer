This command will return a new list\n       consisting of elements first through last, inclusive.  The index values │\n       first and last are interpreted the same as index values for the command │\n       string index, supporting simple index arithmetic and indices relative   │\n       to the end of the list.\tIf first is less than zero, it is treated as\n       if it were zero.  If last is greater than or equal to the number of\n       elements in the list, then it is treated as if it were end.  If first\n       is greater than last then an empty string is returned.  Note: “lrange\n       list first first” does not always produce the same result as “lindex\n       list first” (although it often does for simple fields that are not\n       enclosed in braces); it does, however, produce exactly the same results\n       as “list [lindex list first]”\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Selecting the first two elements:\n\t      % lrange {a b c d e} 0 1\n\t      a b\n\n       Selecting the last three elements:\n\t      % lrange {a b c d e} end-2 end\n\t      c d e\n\n       Selecting everything except the first and last element:\n\t      % lrange {a b c d e} 1 end-1\n\t      b c d\n\n       Selecting a single element with lrange is not the same as doing so with\n       lindex:\n\t      % set var {some {elements to} select}\n\t      some {elements to} select\n\t      % lindex $var 1\n\t      elements to\n\t      % lrange $var 1 1\n\t      {elements to}"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lrange command in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the lrange command to extract the last three elements from a list like {a b c d e}?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the lrange command to retrieve a single element from a list, and explain why it differs from using lindex?
