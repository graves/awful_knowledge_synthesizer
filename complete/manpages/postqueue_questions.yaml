It implements operations that are traditionally\n       available via the sendmail(1) command.  See the postsuper(1) command\n       for queue operations that require super-user privileges such as\n       deleting a message from the queue or changing the status of a message.\n\n       The following options are recognized:\n\n       -c config_dir\n\t      The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead\n\t      of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      environment setting below.\n\n       -f     Flush the queue: attempt to deliver all queued mail.\n\n\t      This option implements the traditional \"sendmail -q\" command, by\n\t      contacting the Postfix qmgr(8) daemon.\n\n\t      Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will result in\n\t      poor delivery performance of all other mail.\n\n       -i queue_id\n\t      Schedule immediate delivery of deferred mail with the specified\n\t      queue ID.\n\n\t      This option implements the traditional sendmail -qI command, by\n\t      contacting the flush(8) server.\n\n\t      This feature is available with Postfix version 2.4 and later.\n\n       -j     Produce a queue listing in JSON format, based on output from the\n\t      showq(8) daemon.\tThe result is a stream of zero or more JSON\n\t      objects, one per queue file.  Each object is followed by a\n\t      newline character to support simple streaming parsers. See \"JSON\n\t      OBJECT FORMAT\" below for details.\n\n\t      This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.\n\n       -p     Produce a traditional sendmail-style queue listing.  This option\n\t      implements the traditional mailq command, by contacting the\n\t      Postfix showq(8) daemon.\n\n\t      Each queue entry shows the queue file ID, message size, arrival\n\t      time, sender, and the recipients that still need to be\n\t      delivered.  If mail could not be delivered upon the last\n\t      attempt, the reason for failure is shown. The queue ID string is\n\t      followed by an optional status character:\n\n\t      *      The message is in the active queue, i.e. the message is\n\t\t     selected for delivery.\n\n\t      !      The message is in the hold queue, i.e. no further\n\t\t     delivery attempt will be made until the mail is taken off\n\t\t     hold.\n\n       -s site\n\t      Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued for the\n\t      named site. A numerical site must be specified as a valid RFC\n\t      5321 address literal enclosed in [], just like in email\n\t      addresses.  The site must be eligible for the \"fast flush\"\n\t      service.\tSee flush(8) for more information about the \"fast\n\t      flush\" service.\n\n\t      This option implements the traditional \"sendmail -qRsite\"\n\t      command, by contacting the Postfix flush(8) daemon.\n\n       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v\n\t      options make the software increasingly verbose. As of Postfix\n\t      2.3, this option is available for the super-user only.\n\nJSON OBJECT FORMAT\n       Each JSON object represents one queue file; it is emitted as a single\n       text line followed by a newline character.\n\n       Object members have string values unless indicated otherwise.  Programs\n       should ignore object members that are not listed here; the list of\n       members is expected to grow over time.\n\n       queue_name\n\t      The name of the queue where the message was found.  Note that\n\t      the contents of the mail queue may change while it is being\n\t      listed; some messages may appear more than once, and some\n\t      messages may be missed.\n\n       queue_id\n\t      The queue file name. The queue_id may be reused within a Postfix\n\t      instance unless \"enable_long_queue_ids = true\" and time is\n\t      monotonic.  Even then, the queue_id is not expected to be unique\n\t      between different Postfix instances.  Management tools that\n\t      require a unique name should combine the queue_id with the\n\t      myhostname setting of the Postfix instance.\n\n       arrival_time\n\t      The number of seconds since the start of the UNIX epoch.\n\n       message_size\n\t      The number of bytes in the message header and body. This number\n\t      does not include message envelope information. It is\n\t      approximately equal to the number of bytes that would be\n\t      transmitted via SMTP including the <CR><LF> line endings.\n\n       sender The envelope sender address.\n\n       recipients\n\t      An array containing zero or more objects with members:\n\n\t      address\n\t\t     One recipient address.\n\n\t      delay_reason\n\t\t     If present, the reason for delayed delivery.  Delayed\n\t\t     recipients may have no delay reason, for example, while\n\t\t     delivery is in progress, or after the system was stopped\n\t\t     before it could record the reason.\n\nSECURITY\n       This program is designed to run with set-group ID privileges, so that\n       it can connect to Postfix daemon processes.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 7159 (JSON notation)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems are logged to syslogd(8) and to the standard error stream.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\n       MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      Directory with the main.cf file. In order to avoid exploitation\n\t      of set-group ID privileges, a non-standard directory is allowed\n\t      only if:\n\n\t      •      The name is listed in the standard main.cf file with the\n\t\t     alternate_config_directories configuration parameter.\n\n\t      •      The command is invoked by the super-user.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this\n       program.
