It uses the snprobe command to scan\n       the existing cluster as seen from the host it is run on and generates\n       an initial nss_cctl.xml file.  The output is a permissive version of\n       the control file with all features enabled.  This can be used as a\n       basis for a version which restricts the type of access allowed for\n       different clients.  The output needs to be placed in\n       /usr/cvfs/config/nss_cctl.xml on the cluster name server hosts.\tOutput\n       defaults to stdout unless a file name is specified.\n\n       By default the cluster is scanned from the local host, this can be\n       overridden using the --host option.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       nss_cctl(8)"
