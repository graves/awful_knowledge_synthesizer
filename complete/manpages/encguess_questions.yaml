Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `encguess`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nENCGUESS(1)\t       Perl Programmers Reference Guide \t   ENCGUESS(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       encguess - guess character encodings of files\n\nVERSION\n       $Id: encguess,v 0.3 2020/12/02 01:28:17 dankogai Exp dankogai $\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\t encguess [switches] filename...\n\n   SWITCHES\n       -h\n\t show this message and exit.\n\n       -s\n\t specify a list of \"suspect encoding types\" to test, separated by\n\t either \":\" or \",\"\n\n       -S\n\t output a list of all acceptable encoding types that can be used with\n\t the -s param\n\n       -u\n\t suppress display of unidentified types\n\n   EXAMPLES:\n       • Guess encoding of a file named \"test.txt\", using only the default\n\t suspect types.\n\n\t    encguess test.txt\n\n       • Guess the encoding type of a file named \"test.txt\", using the suspect\n\t types \"euc-jp,shiftjis,7bit-jis\".\n\n\t    encguess -s euc-jp,shiftjis,7bit-jis test.txt\n\t    encguess -s euc-jp:shiftjis:7bit-jis test.txt\n\n       • Guess the encoding type of several files, do not display results for\n\t unidentified files.\n\n\t    encguess -us euc-jp,shiftjis,7bit-jis test*.txt\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The encoding identification is done by checking one encoding type at a\n       time until all but the right type are eliminated. The set of encoding\n       types to try is defined by the -s parameter and defaults to ascii, utf8\n       and UTF-16/32 with BOM. This can be overridden by passing one or more\n       encoding types via the -s parameter. If you need to pass in multiple\n       suspect encoding types, use a quoted string with the a space separating\n       each value.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Encode::Guess, Encode::Detect\n\nLICENSE AND COPYRIGHT\n       Copyright 2015 Michael LaGrasta and Dan Kogai.\n\n       This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n       under the terms of the the Artistic License (2.0).

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the encguess tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use encguess to determine the encoding of a file named 'data.txt' while restricting the suspect encoding types to 'utf-8,shift_jis,euc-jp'?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to guess the encoding of multiple files (e.g., 'files1.txt', 'files2.txt') and suppress output for unidentified encoding types?
