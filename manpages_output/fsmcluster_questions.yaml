It is a\n       list of keywords with values.\n\nOVERVIEW\n       Traditionally, Xsan volumes have been grouped into clusters which share\n       a common name service providing visibility to clients. The clients\n       would typically be able to mount these volumes using either direct SAN\n       connections to the data LUNs or proxy access using the distributed LAN\n       client connection to a Xsan gateway server. If a set of clients require\n       access to a volume in a different cluster, an fsforeignservers(4) may\n       be configured.\n\n       The Xsan cluster and administrative domain feature allows more flexible\n       configurations where sharing access between clusters is desired.\n       Conversely, this feature may also be used to separate large clusters\n       into multiple smaller clusters where sets of volumes may be grouped\n       with clients that access only those volumes."

If not\n\t      specified, it will default to _cluster0.\n\n       default_addom admin_domain\n\t      Specify the default administrative domain name for this machine.\n\t      An administrative domain is a group of named clusters.  If not\n\t      specified, it will default to _addom0.\n\n       Lines that contain white space only or that contain the comment token\n       as the first non-white space character are ignored.\n\n       The default administrative domain name and default cluster names are\n       used when an fsm name is specified without a cluster name or\n       administrative domain name, such as when mounting a Xsan Volume\n\nChanging the Cluster or Administrative Domain Name\n       Changing the cluster name on an MDC node affects the location of the\n       file systems running on that node. Changing the cluster name on a\n       coordinator node affects the services that are being advertised by that\n       coordinator. All clients must unmount the file systems that are to be\n       affected by the change.\tServices must be stopped on the MDC and\n       coordinator nodes, including both primary and secondary nodes of an HA\n       pair.  The fsmcluster file may then be updated on all affected nodes\n       including both nodes of an HA pair.  Start the services on the\n       coordinator nodes first if these nodes are different than the MDC\n       nodes.  Start the services on the MDC nodes next.  The file systems are\n       now available for client mounts at their new cluster location."
