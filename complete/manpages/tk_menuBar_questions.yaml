In\n       Tk 4.0 and later releases they are no longer needed.  Stubs for these\n       procedures have been retained for backward compatibility, but they have\n       no effect.  You should remove calls to these procedures from your code,\n       since eventually the procedures will go away.\n\n       From Tk 8.0 onwards, you should instead construct your menubar as a\n       normal menu and then attach it to the toplevel of your choice using the\n       -menu option of that widget."
