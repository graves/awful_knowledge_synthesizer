(The value of\n\t NAME_MAX depends on the underlying file system.)\n\n     •\t Contains a directory component that is not searchable.\n\n     It is not considered an error if a pathname argument contains a\n     nonexistent component as long as a component by that name could be\n     created.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -p      Perform portability checks on the specified pathname arguments.\n\t     Diagnostic messages will be written for each argument that:\n\n\t     •\t Is longer than _POSIX_PATH_MAX (255) bytes.\n\n\t     •\t Contains a component longer than _POSIX_NAME_MAX (14) bytes."
