The similarity to the title of the major\n       Perl book (which came later) is not completely accidental:\n\n       Programming Pearls\n\t    by Jon Bentley\n\t    ISBN 978-0-201-65788-3 [2 edition, October 1999]\n\n       More Programming Pearls\n\t    by Jon Bentley\n\t    ISBN 0-201-11889-0 [January 1988]\n\n   A note on freshness\n       Each version of Perl comes with the documentation that was current at\n       the time of release. This poses a problem for content such as book\n       lists. There are probably very nice books published after this list was\n       included in your Perl release, and you can check the latest released\n       version at <https://perldoc.perl.org/perlbook.html> .\n\n       Some of the books we've listed appear almost ancient in internet scale,\n       but we've included those books because they still describe the current\n       way of doing things. Not everything in Perl changes every day.  Many of\n       the beginner-level books, too, go over basic features and techniques\n       that are still valid today. In general though, we try to limit this\n       list to books published in the past five years.\n\n   Get your book listed\n       If your Perl book isn't listed and you think it should be, let us know.\n       <mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org>\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t\t   PERLBOOK(1)"
