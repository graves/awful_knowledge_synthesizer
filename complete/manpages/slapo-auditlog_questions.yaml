Changes are logged as\n       standard LDIF, with an additional comment header giving the timestamp\n       of the change and the identity of the user making the change.\n\n       For Add and Modify operations the identity comes from the modifiersName\n       associated with the operation. This is usually the same as the\n       requestor's identity, but may be set by other overlays to reflect other\n       values.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       This slapd.conf option applies to the Audit Logging overlay.  It should\n       appear after the overlay directive.\n\n       auditlog <filename>\n\t      Specify the fully qualified path for the log file.\n\n       olcAuditlogFile <filename>\n\t      For use with cn=config"
