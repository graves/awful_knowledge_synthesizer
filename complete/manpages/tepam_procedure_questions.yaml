There is a lot of benefit to declare a\n       procedure with TEPAM rather than with the Tcl standard command proc:\n       TEPAM allows specifying inside the procedure declaration in a natural\n       syntax all information that is required to generate comprehensive\n       documentations and help support.  The information is also used by an\n       automatically invoked argument checker that is validating the provided\n       procedure arguments before the procedure body is executed. Finally, a\n       procedure can be called interactively which will open a form into which\n       the arguments can be entered interactively."

TEPAM\n\t      uses by default the named arguments first, unnamed arguments\n\t      later style (Tcl). This default behavior can globally be changed\n\t      by setting the variable tepam::named_arguments_first to 0.

This flag exists only for completion reason,\n\t\t     since an argument is anyway mandatory by default.\n\n\t      -multiple\n\t\t     Arguments that have the -multiple attribute can be\n\t\t     defined multiple times during a procedure call. The data\n\t\t     that are provided during a procedure call for such an\n\t\t     argument are stored in a list. This is even the case if\n\t\t     such an argument is only defined once during a procedure\n\t\t     call.\n\n\t\t     The -multiple attribute can be attributed to unnamed\n\t\t     arguments and to named arguments. The pair of argument\n\t\t     name/argument data has to be repeated for each provided\n\t\t     data value in case of a named argument.  In case the\n\t\t     argument with the -multiple attribute is an unnamed\n\t\t     argument, this one has to be the absolute last one of all\n\t\t     unnamed arguments.\n\n\t      -choices list\n\t\t     A possible set of valid argument values can be attributed\n\t\t     to an argument via the -choices attribute. The argument\n\t\t     data provided during a procedure call will be checked\n\t\t     against the provided choice values.\n\n\t      -choicelabels list\n\t\t     An evanutal short description can be attributed to each\n\t\t     choice option with the -choicelabels attribute. These\n\t\t     descriptions will be used in the generated help texts and\n\t\t     as radio and check box labels for the interactive calls.\n\n\t\t     The -choicelabels attribute is optional, but if it is\n\t\t     defined, its list needs to have the identical size as the\n\t\t     -choices argument list.\n\n\t      -range {double double}\n\t\t     Another argument constraint can be defined with the\n\t\t     -range attribute. The valid range is defined with a list\n\t\t     containing the minimum valid value and a maximum valid\n\t\t     value. The -range attribute has to be used only for\n\t\t     numerical arguments, like integers and doubles.\n\n\t      -validatecommand script\n\t\t     Eventual more complex argument data validations can be\n\t\t     performed via specific validation commands that are\n\t\t     assigned to the validatecommand attribute. The provided\n\t\t     validation command can be a complete script in which the\n\t\t     pattern %P is replaced by the argument data that has to\n\t\t     be validated.  An example of a validation command\n\t\t     declaration is:\n\t\t     tepam::procedure {display_message} {\n\t\t\t-args {\n\t\t\t   {text -type string -description \"Message text\" \\\n\t\t\t\t -validatecommand \"IllegalWordDetector %P\"}\n\t\t     } {\n\t\t     }\n\n\t      -auxargs list\n\t\t     In case a procedure is called interactively, additional\n\t\t     argument attributes can be provided to the interactive\n\t\t     argument definition form via the -auxargs attribute that\n\t\t     is itself a list of attribute name/attribute data pairs:\n\t\t     -auxargs {-<arg_attr_name_1a> <arg_attr_data_1a> \\\n\t\t\t       -<arg_attr_name_1b> <arg_attr_data_1b>\n\t\t\t       ...\n\t\t     }\n\t\t     For example, if a procedure takes as argument a file name\n\t\t     it may be beneficial to specify the required file type\n\t\t     for the interactive argument definition form. This\n\t\t     information can be provided via the -auxargs attribute to\n\t\t     the argument definition form:\n\t\t     tepam::procedure LoadPicture {\n\t\t\t-args {\n\t\t\t   {FileName -type existingfile -description \"Picture file\" \\\n\t\t\t\t      -auxargs {-filetypes {{\"GIF\" {*.gif}} {\"JPG\" {*.jpg}} }}}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t     } {\n\t\t     }\n\n\t      -auxargs_commands script\n\t\t     If the auxiliary argument attributes are not static but\n\t\t     have to be dynamically adaptable, the -auxargs_commands\n\t\t     allows defining them via commands that are executed\n\t\t     during a procedure call. A list of pairs of auxiliary\n\t\t     attribute names and commands have to be provided to the\n\t\t     -auxargs_commands attribute. The provided commands are\n\t\t     executed in the context of the calling procedure.\n\t\t     -auxargs_commands {-<arg_attr_name_1a> <arg_attr_command_1a> \\\n\t\t\t\t\t-<arg_attr_name_1b> <arg_attr_command_1b>\n\t\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t     }\n\nVARIABLES\n       Several variables defined inside the ::tepam namespace are impacting\n       the procedures and the way how they have to be called.\n\n       named_arguments_first\n\t      This variable defines the general calling style of the\n\t      procedures. It is by default set to 1 which selects the named\n\t      arguments first, unnamed arguments later style (Tcl).\n\n\t      By setting this variable to 0, the named arguments first,\n\t      unnamed arguments later style (Tk) is globally selected:\n\t      set tepam::named_arguments_first 0\n\n\t      While this variable defines globally the calling style, the\n\t      procedure attribute -named_arguments_first can adapt this style\n\t      individually for each procedure.\n\n       auto_argument_name_completion\n\t      This variable controls globally the automatic argument name\n\t      matching mode. By default it is set to 1, meaning that the\n\t      called procedures are trying to match eventually abbreviated\n\t      argument names with the declared argument names.\n\n\t      By setting this variable to 0 the automatic argument name\n\t      matching mode is disabled:\n\t      set tepam::auto_argument_name_completion 0\n\n\t      While this variable defines globally the matching mode, the\n\t      procedure attribute -auto_argument_name_completion can adapt\n\t      this mode individually for each procedure.\n\n       interactive_display_format\n\t      A procedure declared via the TEPAM procedure command can always\n\t      be called with the -interactive switch. By doing so, a graphical\n\t      form will be generated that allows entering interactively all\n\t      procedure arguments.\n\n\t      There are two display modes for these interactive forms. The\n\t      extended mode which is the default mode is more adapted for\n\t      small procedure argument sets, while the short form is more\n\t      adequate for huge procedure argument sets:\n\t      set tepam::interactive_display_format \"short\"\n\n\t      The choice to use short or extended forms can globally be\n\t      configured via this variable interactive_display_format.\tThis\n\t      global setting can be changed individually for a procedure with\n\t      the procedure attribute -interactive_display_format.\n\n       help_line_length\n\t      The maximum line length used by the procedure help text\n\t      generator can be specified with this variable. The default\n\t      length which is set to 80 (characters) can easily be adapted to\n\t      the need of an application:\n\t      set tepam::help_line_length 120\n\t      Since this variable is applied directly during the help text\n\t      generation, its value can continuously be adapted to the current\n\t      need.\n\nARGUMENT TYPES\n       Many argument types are predefined by TEPAM that can be used in the\n       procedure argument definition section as argument type. In case a\n       special application specific type is missing, it is easy to add the\n       necessary support for such a type.\n\n   PREDEFINED ARGUMENT TYPES\n       To remember, a type can be assigned to each specified procedure\n       argument:\n       tepam::procedure {warning} {\n\t  -args {\n\t     {-font -type font -default {Arial 10 italic}}\n\t     {-severity_level -type integer -optional -range {1 10}}\n\t     {-fg -type color -optional -description \"Message color\"}\n\t     {text -type string -multiple -description \"Multiple text lines to display\"}\n\t  }\n       } {\n\t  ...\n       }\n       There are some special purpose types that are building the first\n       category of predefined argument types:\n\n       •      none\n\n\t      Flags, also called switches, are defined by specifying a named\n\t      argument with the type none. Flags are always optional and the\n\t      default value of the assigned variable is set to 0. In contrast\n\t      to the (normal) named arguments no argument data has to be\n\t      provided to a flag.\n\t      tepam::procedure flag_test {\n\t\t -args {\n\t\t    {-flag -type none -description \"This is a flag\"}\n\t\t }\n\t      } {\n\t\t puts $flag\n\t      }\n\n\t      flag_test\n\t      -> 0\n\n\t      flag_test -flag\n\t      -> 1\n\n\t      Since no argument data has to be provided to a flag, also no\n\t      data checks are performed for this argument type.\n\n       •      string\n\n\t      String is a generic argument data type. Any data string can be\n\t      provided to a string type argument and no data type checks are\n\t      therefore performed.\n\n       •      {}\n\n\t      A blank argument type signifies an undefined argument type. This\n\t      is the default argument type that is used when no type has been\n\t      explicitly specified. An argument that has a blank type behaves\n\t      identically than an argument that has a string type, e.g. no\n\t      argument data checks are performed. The only difference is that\n\t      the data type string is mentioned in the generated help\n\t      documentation, while this is not the case for blank type.\n\n       Several numerical types are defined by TEPAM. The type validation\n       procedures are not using only the string is <type> commands to check\n       the validity of the provided arguments, but they assure also that no\n       empty strings are provided as argument data (the string is <type>\n       commands are considering an empty string as a valid numerical\n       parameter). The common type validation expression is therefore:\n       expr [string length <argument_data>]>0 && [string is <type_to_check> <argument_data>]\n\n       •      boolean"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tepam_procedure`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n•      integer\n\n\n       •      double\n\n\n       The verification of all alpha numeric types is directly performed with\n       the standard Tcl string type verification command:\n       string is <type_to_check> <argument_data>\n       The following types are verified in this way:\n\n       •      alnum\n\n\n       •      alpha\n\n\n       •      ascii\n\n\n       •      control\n\n\n       •      digit\n\n\n       •      graph\n\n\n       •      lower\n\n\n       •      print\n\n\n       •      punct\n\n\n       •      space\n\n\n       •      upper\n\n\n       •      wordchar\n\n\n       •      xdigit\n\n\n       In addition to the data types checked with the string is <type>\n       commands, TEPAM specifies some other useful data types:\n\n       •      char\n\n\t      Each string that has a length of 1 character meets the character\n\t      type. The type check is made with the following expression:\n\t      expr [string length <argument_data>]==1\n\n       •      color\n\n\t      Any character strings that are accepted by Tk as a color are\n\t      considered as valid color argument. Please note that the Tk\n\t      package has to be loaded to use the color type. TEPAM is using\n\t      the following command to validate the color type:\n\t      expr ![catch {winfo rgb . <argument_data>}]\n\n       •      font\n\n\t      Any character strings that are accepted by Tk as a font are\n\t      considered as valid font argument. Please note that the Tk\n\t      package uas to be loaded to use the font type. TEPAM is using\n\t      the following command to validate the color type:\n\t      expr ![catch {font measure <argument_data> \"\"}]\n\n       •      file\n\n\t      Any strings that are not containing one of the following\n\t      characters are considered as valid file name: * ? \" < >. It is\n\t      not necessary that the file or its containing directory is\n\t      existing. Zero-length strings are not considered as valid file\n\t      names.\n\n\t      The following expression is used to validate the file names:\n\t      expr [string length <argument_data>]>0 && ![regexp {[\\\"*?<>:]} <argument_data>]\n\n       •      existingfile\n\n\t      The argument is valid if it matches with an existing file. The\n\t      following check is performed to validate the arguments of this\n\t      type:\n\t      file exists <argument_data>\n\n       •      directory\n\n\t      The directory argument is validated exactly in the same way as\n\t      the file arguments.\n\n       •      existingdirectory\n\n\t      The argument is valid if it matches with an existing directory.\n\t      The following check is performed to validate the arguments of\n\t      this type:\n\t      file isdirectory <argument_data>\n\n   DEFINING APPLICATION SPECIFIC ARGUMENT TYPES\n       Nothing is easier than adding support for a new application specific\n       argument type. It is just necessary to add into the namespace tepam a\n       validation function Validation(<type>) that has one argument and that\n       returns 1 if the provided argument matches with the relevant data type.\n       The function has to return otherwise 0.\n\n       The validation command section of the \"tepam.tcl\" package provides\n       sufficient examples of validation functions, since it implements the\n       ones for the standard TEPAM types.\n\n       The following additional code snippet shows the validation function for\n       a custom argument type that has to correspond to a character string\n       with a length of 2:\n       proc tepam::Validate(two_char) {v} {expr [string length $v]==2}\n\nPROCEDURE CALLS\n   HELP\n       Each procedure can be called with the -help flag. The procedure will\n       then print a generated help text to stdout and will then return without\n       performing any additional actions.\n\n       Taking the first procedure declared in PROCEDURE CALLS, the help\n       request and the printed help text would be:\n       display message -help\n       ->\n       NAME\n\t     display message - Displays a simple message box\n       SYNOPSIS\n\t     display message\n\t\t   [-mtype <mtype>]\n\t\t      Message type, default: \"Warning\", choices: {Info, Warning, Error}\n\t\t   <text>\n\t\t      Multiple text lines to display, type: string\n       DESCRIPTION\n\t     This procedure allows displaying a configurable message box. The default\n\t     message type that is created is a warning, but also errors and info can\n\t     be generated.\n\t     The procedure accepts multiple text lines.\n       EXAMPLE\n\t     display message -mtype Warning \"Save first your job\"\n       The argument manager is checking if the last provided argument is -help\n       and generates the requested help message if this is the case. So, also\n       the following example will print the help message:\n       display message -mtype Info \"It is 7:00\" -help\n       On the other hand, the following call will result in an error:\n       display message -help -mtype Info \"It is 7:00\"\n       ->\n       display message: Argument '-help' not known\n\n   INTERACTIVE PROCEDURE CALL\n       Calling a procedure with the -interactive flag will open a graphical\n       form that allows specifying interactively all procedure arguments. The\n       Tk library has to be loaded to use the interactive call. The following\n       example assures that the Tk library is loaded and shows the command\n       line to call interactively the procedure declared in PROCEDURE CALLS:\n       package require Tk\n       display message -interactive\n       Also the -interactive flag has to be placed at the last argument\n       position as this is also required for the -help flag. Arguments defined\n       before the -interactive flag will be ignored. The following example is\n       therefore also a valid interactive procedure call:\n       display message -mtype Info \"It is 7:00\" -interactive\n\n   UNNAMED ARGUMENTS\n       Unnamed arguments are typically provided to the called procedure as\n       simple parameters. This procedure calling form requires that the\n       provided arguments are strictly following the order of the specified\n       arguments. Several parameters can be assigned to the last argument if\n       this one has the -multiple attribute. So, the following declared\n       procedure ...\n       tepam::procedure {display_message} {\n\t  -args {\n\t     {mtype -choices {Info Warning Error}}\n\t     {text -type string -multiple}\n\t  }\n       } {\n\t  puts \"$mtype: [join $text]\"\n       }\n       display_message Info \"It is PM 7:00.\"\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00.\n\n       display_message Info \"It is PM 7:00.\" \"You should go home.\"\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00. You should go home.\n       The nice thing is that unnamed arguments can also be called as named\n       arguments, which can be handy, for example if the exact specified\n       argument order is not known to a user:\n       display_message -mtype Info -text \"It is PM 7:00.\"\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00.\n\n       display_message -text \"It is PM 7:00.\" -mtype Info\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00.\n\n       display_message -mtype Info -text \"It is PM 7:00.\" -text \"You should go home.\"\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00. You should go home.\n\n       display_message -text \"It is PM 7:00.\" -text \"You should go home.\" -mtype Info\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00. You should go home.\n\n   NAMED ARGUMENTS\n       Named arguments have to be provided to a procedure in form of a\n       parameter pairs composed by the argument names and the argument data.\n       The order how they are provided during a procedure call is irrelevant\n       and has not to match with the argument specification order.\n\n       The following declared procedure ...\n       tepam::procedure {display_message} {\n\t  -args {\n\t     {-mtype -choices {Info Warning Error}}\n\t     {-text -type string -multiple}\n\t  }\n       } {\n\t  puts \"$mtype: [join $text]\"\n       }\n       display_message -mtype Info -text \"It is PM 7:00.\"\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00.\n\n       display_message -text \"It is PM 7:00.\" -mtype Info\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00.\n\n       display_message -mtype Info -text \"It is PM 7:00.\" -text \"You should go home.\"\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00. You should go home.\n\n       display_message -text \"It is PM 7:00.\" -text \"You should go home.\" -mtype Info\n       -> Info: It is PM 7:00. You should go home.\n       Also named arguments that have not the -multiple attribute can be\n       provided multiple times. Only the last provided argument will be\n       retained in such a case:\n       display_message -mtype Info -text \"It is PM 7:00.\" -mtype Warning\n       -> Warning: It is PM 7:00.\n\n   UNNAMED ARGUMENTS FIRST, NAMED ARGUMENTS LATER (TK STYLE)\n       A procedure that has been defined while the variable\n       tepam::named_arguments_first was set to 1, or with the procedure\n       attribute -named_arguments_first set to 1 has to be called in the Tcl\n       style. The following procedure declaration will be used in this section\n       to illustrate the meaning of this calling style:\n       set tepam::named_arguments_first 1\n       tepam::procedure my_proc {\n\t  -args {\n\t     {-n1 -default \"\"}\n\t     {-n2 -default \"\"}\n\t     {u1 -default \"\"}\n\t     {u2 -default \"\"}\n\t  }\n       } {\n\t  puts \"n1:'$n1', n2:'$n2', u1:'$u1', u2:'$u2'\"\n       }\n       The unnamed arguments are placed at the end of procedure call, after\n       the named arguments:\n       my_proc -n1 N1 -n2 N2 U1 U2\n       -> n1:'N1', n2:'N2', u1:'U1', u2:'U2'\n       The argument parser considers the first argument that doesn't start\n       with the '-' character as well as all following arguments as unnamed\n       argument:\n       my_proc U1 U2\n       -> n1:'', n2:'', u1:'U1', u2:'U2'\n       Named arguments can be defined multiple times. If the named argument\n       has the -multiply attribute, all argument data will be collected in a\n       list. Otherwise, only the last provided attribute data will be\n       retained:\n       my_proc -n1 N1 -n2 N2 -n1 M1 U1 U2\n       -> n1:'M1', n2:'N2', u1:'U1', u2:'U2'\n       The name of the first unnamed argument has therefore not to start with\n       the '-' character. The unnamed argument is otherwise considered as name\n       of another named argument. This is especially important if the first\n       unnamed argument is given by a variable that can contain any character\n       strings:\n       my_proc -n1 N1 -n2 N2 \"->\" \"<-\"\n       -> my_proc: Argument '->' not known\n\n       set U1 \"->\"\n       my_proc -n1 N1 -n2 N2 $U1 U2}]\n       my_proc: Argument '->' not known\n       The '--' flag allows separating unambiguously the unnamed arguments\n       from the named arguments. All data after the '--' flag will be\n       considered as unnamed argument:\n       my_proc -n1 N1 -n2 N2 -- \"->\" \"<-\"\n       -> n1:'N1', n2:'N2', u1:'->', u2:'<-'\n\n       set U1 \"->\"\n       my_proc -n1 N1 -n2 N2 -- $U1 U2\n       -> n1:'N1', n2:'N2', u1:'->', u2:'<-'\n\n   NAMED ARGUMENTS FIRST, UNNAMED ARGUMENTS LATER (TCL STYLE)\n       The Tk calling style is selected when a procedure is defined while the\n       variable tepam::named_arguments_first is set to 0, or when the\n       procedure attribute -named_arguments_first has been set to 0. The\n       following procedure will be used in this section to illustrate this\n       calling style:\n       set tepam::named_arguments_first 0\n       tepam::procedure my_proc {\n\t  -args {\n\t     {-n1 -default \"\"}\n\t     {-n2 -default \"\"}\n\t     {u1}\n\t     {u2 -default \"\" -multiple}\n\t  }\n       } {\n\t  puts \"n1:'$n1', n2:'$n2', u1:'$u1', u2:'$u2'\"\n       }\n       The unnamed arguments have to be provided first in this case. The named\n       arguments are provided afterwards:\n       my_proc U1 U2 -n1 N1 -n2 N2\n       -> n1:'N1', n1:'N1', u1:'U1', u2:'U2'\n       The argument parser will assign to each defined unnamed argument an\n       argument data before it switches to read the named arguments. This\n       default behavior changes a bit if there are unnamed arguments that are\n       optional or that can take multiple values.\n\n       An argument data will only be assigned to an unnamed argument that is\n       optional (that has either the -optional attribute or that has a default\n       value), when the data is not beginning with the '-' character or when\n       no named arguments are defined. The data that starts with '-' is\n       otherwise considered as the name of a named argument.\n\n       Argument data are assigned to an argument that has the -multiple\n       attribute as long as the parameter value doesn't starts with the '-'\n       character.\n\n       This constraint that parameter values that start with the '-' character\n       cannot be assigned to optional unnamed arguments makes the Tcl\n       procedure calling style not suitable for all situations. The Tk style\n       may be preferable in some cases, since it allows separating\n       unambiguously the named arguments from the unnamed ones with the '--'\n       flag.\n\n       Let's explore in a bit less theoretically the ways how the previously\n       defined procedure can be called: The first example calls the procedure\n       without any parameters, which leads to an error since u1 is a mandatory\n       argument:\n       my_proc\n       -> my_proc: Required argument is missing: u1\n       The procedure call is valid if one parameter is provided for u1:\n       my_proc U1\n       -> n1:'', n2:'', u1:'U1', u2:''\n       When more parameters are provided that are not starting with the '-'\n       character, then they will be attributed to the unnamed arguments. U2\n       will receive 3 of these parameters, since it accepts multiple values:\n       my_proc U1 U2 U3 U4\n       -> n1:'', n2:'', u1:'U1', u2:'U2 U3 U4'\n       As soon as one parameter starts with '-' and all unnamed arguments have\n       been served, the argument manager tries to interpret the parameter as\n       name of a named argument. The procedure call will fail if the intend\n       was to attribute the parameter beginning with '-' to an unnamed\n       argument:\n       my_proc U1 U2 U3 U4 -U5\n       -> my_proc: Argument '-U5' not known\n       The attribution of a parameter to a named argument will fail if there\n       are undefined unnamed (non optional) arguments. The name specification\n       will in this case simply be considered as a parameter value that is\n       attributed to the next unnamed argument. This was certainly not the\n       intention in the following example:\n       my_proc -n1 N1\n       -> n1:'', n2:'', u1:'-n1', u2:'N1'\n       The situation is completely different if values have already been\n       attributed to all mandatory unnamed arguments. A parameter beginning\n       with the '-' character will in this case be considered as a name\n       identifier for a named argument:\n       my_proc U1 -n1 N1\n       -> n1:'N1', n2:'', u1:'U1', u2:''\n       No unnamed arguments are allowed behind the named arguments:\n       my_proc U1 -n1 N1 U2\n       -> my_proc: Argument 'U2' is not an option\n       The '--' flag has no special meaning if not all mandatory arguments\n       have got assigned a value. This flag will simply be attributed to one\n       of the unnamed arguments:\n       my_proc -- -n1 N1\n       -> n1:'N1', n2:'', u1:'--', u2:''\n       But the '--' flag is simply ignored if the argument parser has started\n       to handle the named arguments:\n       my_proc U1 -- -n1 N1\n       -> n1:'N1', n2:'', u1:'U1', u2:''\n\n       my_proc U1 -n1 N1 -- -n2 N2\n       -> n1:'N1', n2:'N2', u1:'U1', u2:''\n\n   RAW ARGUMENT LIST\n       It may be necessary sometimes that the procedure body is able to access\n       the entire list of arguments provided during a procedure call. This can\n       happen via the args variable that contains always to unprocessed\n       argument list:\n       tepam::procedure {display_message} {\n\t  -args {\n\t     {-mtype -choices {Warning Error} -default Warning}\n\t     {text -type string -multiple}\n\n\t  }\n       } {\n\t  puts \"args: $args\"\n       }\n       display_message -mtype Warning \"It is 7:00\"\n       -> args: -mtype Warning {It is 7:00}\n\nSEE ALSO\n       tepam_introduction(n), tepam_procedure(n)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       argument integrity, argument validation, arguments, procedure,\n       subcommand\n\nCATEGORY\n       Procedures, arguments, parameters, options\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2009/2010, Andreas Drollinger"
