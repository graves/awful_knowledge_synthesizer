       New Unicode properties "Identifier_Status" and "Identifier_Type" supported
           Unicode has revised its regular expression requirements:
           <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/tr18-21.html>.  As part of that
           they are wanting more properties to be exposed, ones that aren't part
           of the strict UCD (Unicode character database). These two are used for
           examining inputs for security purposes. Details on their usage is at
           <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/>.

       It is now possible to write "qr/\p{Name=...}/", or
           "qr!\p{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING) FACE/}!"
           The Unicode Name property is now accessible in regular expression
           patterns, as an alternative to "\N{...}".  A comparison of the two
           methods is given in "Comparison of \N{...} and \p{name=...}" in

       Additional Note
           An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to any of the
           above flaws if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the
           attacker.  Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to
           be dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect
           against denial of service attacks in this usage scenario.

    Incompatible Changes
       Certain pattern matching features are now prohibited in compiling Unicode
           property value wildcard subpatterns
           These few features are either inappropriate or interfere with the
           algorithm used to accomplish this task. The complete list is in
           "Wildcards in Property Values" in perlunicode.

       Unused functions "POSIX::mbstowcs" and "POSIX::wcstombs" are removed
           These functions could never have worked due to a defective interface
           specification. There is clearly no demand for them, given that no one
           has ever complained in the many years the functions were claimed to be
           available, hence so-called "support" for them is now dropped.

    Manpage text:

    A bug fix for "(?[...])" may have caused some patterns to no longer compile
           See "Selected Bug Fixes". The heuristics previously used may have let
           some constructs compile (perhaps not with the programmer's intended
           effect) that should have been errors. None are known, but it is
           possible that some erroneous constructs no longer compile.

       "\p{user-defined}" properties now always override official Unicode ones
           Previously, if and only if a user-defined property was declared prior
           to the compilation of the regular expression pattern that contains it,
           its definition was used instead of any official Unicode property with
           the same name. Now, it always overrides the official property. This
           change could break existing code that relied (likely unwittingly) on
           the previous behavior. Without this fix, if Unicode released a new
           version with a new property that happens to have the same name as the
           one you had long been using, your program would break when you upgraded
           to a perl that used that new Unicode version. See "User-Defined
           Character Properties" in perlunicode. [GH #17205

    "Sys::Hostname::hostname()" does not accept arguments
           This usage was deprecated in perl 5.28.0 and is now fatal.

       Plain "0" string now treated as a number for range operator
           Previously a range "0" .. "-1" would produce a range of numeric strings
           from "0" through "99"; this now produces an empty list, just as "0 ..
           -1" does. This also means that "0" .. "9" now produces a list of
           integers, where previously it would produce a list of strings.

           This was due to a special case that treated strings starting with "0"
           as strings so ranges like "00" .. "03" produced "00", "01", "02", "03",

    Acknowledgements
           Perl 5.32.0 represents approximately 13 months of development since
           Perl 5.30.0 and contains approximately 220,000 lines of changes across
           1,800 files from 89 authors.

           Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
           were approximately 140,000 lines of changes to 880 .pm, .t, .c and .h
           files.

    Manpage text:

    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
           generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
           include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
           reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

           Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
           modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
           community for helping Perl to flourish.

           For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
           please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
           database at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. There may also be
           information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. Be sure to trim your bug down
           to a tiny but sufficient test case.
