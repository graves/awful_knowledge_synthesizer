Responsiveness measures the quality\n     of your network by the number of roundtrips completed per minute (RPM)\n     under working conditions. See https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212313\n\n     Other aspects of the connection that affect the quality of experience.\n\n     NOTE: This tool will connect to the Internet to perform its tests. This\n     will use data on your Internet service plan.\n\n     For more details about the RPM score and the methodology around the\n     testing, see\n     https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness/\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -b       Show Bonjour advertised networkQuality servers\n\n     -B Bonjour name\n\t      Run against specified Bonjour instance\n\n     -C configuration URL/path\n\t      Use custom configuration URL or path (with scheme file://).

It will display the URL of the config-file that\n\t      can be passed on to a client-instance with option -C. Note that\n\t      the certificate is self-signed and thus option -k needs to be\n\t      used on the client-instance.\n\n     -c [filename]\n\t      Produce computer-readable output (JSON). filename is optional,\n\t      will default to STDOUT.\n\n     -d       Do not run a download test (implies -s)\n\n     -h       Show help\n\n     -k       Disable verification of the server identity via TLS.\n\n     -p       Use iCloud Private Relay.\n\n     -s       Run tests sequentially instead of parallel upload/download.\n\n     -u       Do not run an upload test (implies -s)\n\n     -v       Verbose output.\n\nCOMPUTER OUTPUT FIELD DESCRIPTION\n     The -c option will produce JSON output with the following fields,\n     depending on the options used and the result of the run.\n\n     base_rtt\t\t\t The calculated idle latency of the test run\n\t\t\t\t (in milliseconds).\n\n     dl_flows\t\t\t Number of download flows initiated.\n\n     dl_responsiveness\t\t The downlink responsiveness score (in RPM)\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     dl_throughput\t\t The measured downlink throughput (in bytes\n\t\t\t\t per second).\n\n     end_date\t\t\t Time when test run was completed (in local\n\t\t\t\t time).\n\n     il_h2_req_resp\t\t The idle-latency Request/Response times for\n\t\t\t\t HTTP/2 (in milliseconds).\n\n     il_tcp_handshake_443\t The idle-latency TCP-handshake times (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n     il_tls_handshake\t\t The idle-latency TLS-handshake times (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n     interface_name\t\t Interface name in which the test ran against.\n\n     lud_foreign_dl_h2_req_resp  Download latency-under-load request/response\n\t\t\t\t times for HTTP/2 (in milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_dl_tcp_handshake_443\n\t\t\t\t Download latency-under-load for for TCP-\n\t\t\t\t handshake times (in milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_dl_tls_handshake\n\t\t\t\t Download latency-under-load for for TLS-\n\t\t\t\t handshake times (in milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_h2_req_resp\t Combined upload/download latency-under-load\n\t\t\t\t request/response times for HTTP/2 (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is not specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_tcp_handshake_443\n\t\t\t\t Combined upload/download latency-under-load\n\t\t\t\t for for TCP-handshake times (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is not specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_tls_handshake\t Combined foreign upload/download latency-\n\t\t\t\t under-load for for TLS-handshake times (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is not specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_ul_h2_req_resp  Foreign upload latency-under-load\n\t\t\t\t request/response times for HTTP/2 (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_ul_tcp_handshake_443\n\t\t\t\t Foreign upload latency-under-load for for\n\t\t\t\t TCP-handshake times (in milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     lud_foreign_ul_tls_handshake\n\t\t\t\t Upload latency-under-load for for TLS-\n\t\t\t\t handshake times (in milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     lud_self_dl_h2_req_resp\t Self download latency-under-load\n\t\t\t\t request/response times for HTTP/2 (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     lud_self_h2_req_resp\t Combined self upload/download latency-under-\n\t\t\t\t load request/response times for HTTP/2 (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is not specified).\n\n     lud_self_ul_h2_req_resp\t Self upload latency-under-load\n\t\t\t\t request/response times for HTTP/2 (in\n\t\t\t\t milliseconds).\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     os_version \t\t The version of the OS the test was run on.\n\n     responsiveness\t\t The responsiveness score (in RPM)\n\n\t\t\t\t (the combined value if -c is not specified).\n\n     start_date \t\t Time when test run was started (in local\n\t\t\t\t time).\n\n     ul_flows\t\t\t Number of upload flows created.\n\n     ul_responsiveness\t\t The uplink responsiveness score (in RPM)\n\n\t\t\t\t (only available when -s is specified).\n\n     ul_throughput\t\t The measured uplink throughput (in bytes per\n\t\t\t\t second).\n\n     error_code \t\t Error domain specific error code\n\n\t\t\t\t (only displayed if could not complete its\n\t\t\t\t test).\n\n     error_domain\t\t Error domain in which an error occurred in\n\n\t\t\t\t (only displayed if networkQuality could not\n\t\t\t\t complete its test).\n\n     NOTE: This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of fields."
