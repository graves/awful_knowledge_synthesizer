    Why does using $&, $`, or $' slow my program down?
           (contributed by Anno Siegel)

           Once Perl sees that you need one of these variables anywhere in the
           program, it provides them on each and every pattern match. That means
           that on every pattern match the entire string will be copied, part of
           it to $`, part to $&, and part to $'. Thus the penalty is most severe
           with long strings and patterns that match often. Avoid $&, $', and $`
           if you can, but if you can't, once you've used them at all, use them at
           will because you've already paid the price. Remember that some
           algorithms really appreciate them. As of the 5.005 release, the $&
           variable is no longer "expensive" the way the other two are.

           Since Perl 5.6.1 the special variables @- and @+ can functionally
           replace $`, $& and $'. These arrays contain pointers to the beginning
           and end of each match (see perlvar for the full story), so they give
           you essentially the same information, but without the risk of excessive
           string copying.

    Perl 5.10 added three specials, "${^MATCH}", "${^PREMATCH}", and
           "${^POSTMATCH}" to do the same job but without the global performance
           penalty. Perl 5.10 only sets these variables if you compile or execute
           the regular expression with the "/p" modifier.

       What good is "\G" in a regular expression?
           You use the "\G" anchor to start the next match on the same string
           where the last match left off. The regular expression engine cannot
           skip over any characters to find the next match with this anchor, so
           "\G" is similar to the beginning of string anchor, "^". The "\G" anchor
           is typically used with the "g" modifier. It uses the value of "pos()"
           as the position to start the next match. As the match operator makes
           successive matches, it updates "pos()" with the position of the next
           character past the last match (or the first character of the next
           match, depending on how you like to look at it). Each string has its
           own "pos()" value.

The regular expression cannot match there since it does not\n       find a digit, so the next match fails and the match operator returns\n       the pairs it already found.\n\n\t   $_ = \"1122a44\";\n\t   my @pairs = m/\\G(\\d\\d)/g; # qw( 11 22 )\n\n       You can also use the \"\\G\" anchor in scalar context.

    Manpage text:

    For each line, the "PARSER" loop first tries to match a series of
           digits followed by a word boundary. This match has to start at the
           place the last match left off (or the beginning of the string on the
           first match). Since "m/ \G( \d+\b )/gcx" uses the "c" modifier, if the
           string does not match that regular expression, perl does not reset
           pos() and the next match starts at the same position to try a different
           pattern.

       Are Perl regexes DFAs or NFAs? Are they POSIX compliant?
           While it's true that Perl's regular expressions resemble the DFAs
           (deterministic finite automata) of the egrep(1) program, they are in
           fact implemented as NFAs (non-deterministic finite automata) to allow
           backtracking and backreferencing. And they aren't POSIX-style either,
           because those guarantee worst-case behavior for all cases. (It seems
           that some people prefer guarantees of consistency, even when what's
           guaranteed is slowness.) See the book "Mastering Regular Expressions"
           (from O'Reilly) by Jeffrey Friedl for all the details you could ever
           hope to know on these matters (a full citation appears in perlfaq2).

    What's wrong with using grep in a void context?
           The problem is that grep builds a return list, regardless of the
           context.  This means you're making Perl go to the trouble of building a
           list that you then just throw away. If the list is large, you waste
           both time and space.  If your intent is to iterate over the list, then
           use a for loop for this purpose.

           In perls older than 5.8.1, map suffers from this problem as well.  But
           since 5.8.1, this has been fixed, and map is context aware - in void
           context, no lists are constructed.

       How can I match strings with multibyte characters?
           Starting from Perl 5.6 Perl has had some level of multibyte character
           support. Perl 5.8 or later is recommended. Supported multibyte
           character repertoires include Unicode, and legacy encodings through the
           Encode module. See perluniintro, perlunicode, and Encode.

           If you are stuck with older Perls, you can do Unicode with the
           Unicode::String module, and character conversions using the
           Unicode::Map8 and Unicode::Map modules. If you are using Japanese
           encodings, you might try using the jperl 5.005_03.

    Finally, the following set of approaches was offered by Jeffrey Friedl,
           whose article in issue #5 of The Perl Journal talks about this very
           matter.

           Let's suppose you have some weird Martian encoding where pairs of ASCII
           uppercase letters encode single Martian letters (i.e. the two bytes
           "CV" make a single Martian letter, as do the two bytes "SG", "VS",
           "XX", etc.). Other bytes represent single characters, just like ASCII.

           So, the string of Martian "I am CVSGXX!" uses 12 bytes to encode the
           nine characters 'I', ' ', 'a', 'm', ' ', 'CV', 'SG', 'XX', '!'.

           Now, say you want to search for the single character "/GX/". Perl
           doesn't know about Martian, so it'll find the two bytes "GX" in the "I
           am CVSGXX!" string, even though that character isn't there: it just
           looks like it is because "SG" is next to "XX", but there's no real
           "GX". This is a big problem.

           Here are a few ways, all painful, to deal with it:
