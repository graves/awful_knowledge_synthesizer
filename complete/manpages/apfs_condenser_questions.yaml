The filesystem_slice parameter is\n     1-based and the device_path parameter is the path of the device\n     representing the container.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -s snap_name\t   If compaction succeeds, the snapshot will be\n\t\t\t   deleted.  Usually used in the OTA environment.\n\n     -v \t\t   Increase verbosity of the output.\n\n     -w timeout \t   Force the compaction to abort after the supplied\n\t\t\t   timeout in seconds."
