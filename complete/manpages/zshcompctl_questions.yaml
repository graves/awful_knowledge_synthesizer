New users of the shell may prefer to use the newer\n       and more powerful system based on shell functions; this is described in\n       zshcompsys(1), and the basic shell mechanisms which support it are\n       described in zshcompwid(1).  This manual entry describes the older\n       compctl command.\n\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options [ command ... ]\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options [ -x pattern options - ... -- ]\n\t       [ + options [ -x ... -- ] ... [+] ] [ command ... ]\n       compctl -M match-specs ...\n       compctl -L [ -CDTM ] [ command ... ]\n       compctl + command ...\n\n       Control the editor's completion behavior according to the supplied set\n       of options.  Various editing commands, notably expand-or-complete-word,\n       usually bound to tab, will attempt to complete a word typed by the\n       user, while others, notably delete-char-or-list, usually bound to ^D in\n       EMACS editing mode, list the possibilities; compctl controls what those\n       possibilities are.  They may for example be filenames (the most common\n       case, and hence the default), shell variables, or words from a\n       user-specified list."

These correspond\n       to the following flags and arguments, all of which (except for -L) may\n       be combined with any combination of the options described subsequently\n       in the section `Option Flags':\n\n       command ...\n\t      controls completion for the named commands, which must be listed\n\t      last on the command line.  If completion is attempted for a\n\t      command with a pathname containing slashes and no completion\n\t      definition is found, the search is retried with the last\n\t      pathname component. If the command starts with a =, completion\n\t      is tried with the pathname of the command.\n\n\t      Any of the command strings may be patterns of the form normally\n\t      used for filename generation.  These should be quoted to protect\n\t      them from immediate expansion; for example the command string\n\t      'foo*' arranges for completion of the words of any command\n\t      beginning with foo.  When completion is attempted, all pattern\n\t      completions are tried in the reverse order of their definition\n\t      until one matches.  By default, completion then proceeds as\n\t      normal, i.e. the shell will try to generate more matches for the\n\t      specific command on the command line; this can be overridden by\n\t      including -tn in the flags for the pattern completion."

The resulting\n\t      filenames are taken as the possible completions.\tUse `*(/)'\n\t      instead of `*/' for directories.\tThe fignore special parameter\n\t      is not applied to the resulting files.  More than one pattern\n\t      may be given separated by blanks. (Note that brace expansion is\n\t      not part of globbing.  Use the syntax `(either|or)' to match\n\t      alternatives.)\n\n       -s subststring\n\t      The subststring is split into words and these words are than\n\t      expanded using all shell expansion mechanisms (see zshexpn(1)).\n\t      The resulting words are taken as possible completions.  The\n\t      fignore special parameter is not applied to the resulting files.\n\t      Note that -g is faster for filenames.\n\n       -K function\n\t      Call the given function to get the completions.  Unless the name\n\t      starts with an underscore, the function is passed two arguments:\n\t      the prefix and the suffix of the word on which completion is to\n\t      be attempted, in other words those characters before the cursor\n\t      position, and those from the cursor position onwards.  The whole\n\t      command line can be accessed with the -c and -l flags of the\n\t      read builtin. The function should set the variable reply to an\n\t      array containing the completions (one completion per element);\n\t      note that reply should not be made local to the function.  From\n\t      such a function the command line can be accessed with the -c and\n\t      -l flags to the read builtin.  For example,\n\n\t\t     function whoson { reply=(`users`); }\n\t\t     compctl -K whoson talk\n\n\t      completes only logged-on users after `talk'.  Note that `whoson'\n\t      must return an array, so `reply=`users`' would be incorrect.\n\n       -H num pattern\n\t      The possible completions are taken from the last num history\n\t      lines.  Only words matching pattern are taken.  If num is zero\n\t      or negative the whole history is searched and if pattern is the\n\t      empty string all words are taken (as with `*').  A typical use\n\t      is\n\n\t\t     compctl -D -f + -H 0 ''\n\n\t      which forces completion to look back in the history list for a\n\t      word if no filename matches.\n\n   Control Flags\n       These do not directly specify types of name to be completed, but\n       manipulate the options that do:\n\n       -Q     This instructs the shell not to quote any metacharacters in the\n\t      possible completions.  Normally the results of a completion are\n\t      inserted into the command line with any metacharacters quoted so\n\t      that they are interpreted as normal characters.  This is\n\t      appropriate for filenames and ordinary strings.  However, for\n\t      special effects, such as inserting a backquoted expression from\n\t      a completion array (-k) so that the expression will not be\n\t      evaluated until the complete line is executed, this option must\n\t      be used.\n\n       -P prefix\n\t      The prefix is inserted just before the completed string; any\n\t      initial part already typed will be completed and the whole\n\t      prefix ignored for completion purposes.  For example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -j -P \"%\" kill\n\n\t      inserts a `%' after the kill command and then completes job\n\t      names.\n\n       -S suffix\n\t      When a completion is found the suffix is inserted after the\n\t      completed string.  In the case of menu completion the suffix is\n\t      inserted immediately, but it is still possible to cycle through\n\t      the list of completions by repeatedly hitting the same key.\n\n       -W file-prefix\n\t      With directory file-prefix:  for command, file, directory and\n\t      globbing completion (options -c, -f, -/, -g), the file prefix is\n\t      implicitly added in front of the completion.  For example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -/ -W ~/Mail maildirs\n\n\t      completes any subdirectories to any depth beneath the directory\n\t      ~/Mail, although that prefix does not appear on the command\n\t      line.  The file-prefix may also be of the form accepted by the\n\t      -k flag, i.e. the name of an array or a literal list in\n\t      parenthesis. In this case all the directories in the list will\n\t      be searched for possible completions.\n\n       -q     If used with a suffix as specified by the -S option, this causes\n\t      the suffix to be removed if the next character typed is a blank\n\t      or does not insert anything or if the suffix consists of only\n\t      one character and the next character typed is the same\n\t      character; this the same rule used for the AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH\n\t      option.  The option is most useful for list separators (comma,\n\t      colon, etc.).\n\n       -l cmd This option restricts the range of command line words that are\n\t      considered to be arguments.  If combined with one of the\n\t      extended completion patterns `p[...]', `r[...]', or `R[...]'\n\t      (see the section `Extended Completion' below) the range is\n\t      restricted to the range of arguments specified in the brackets.\n\t      Completion is then performed as if these had been given as\n\t      arguments to the cmd supplied with the option. If the cmd string\n\t      is empty the first word in the range is instead taken as the\n\t      command name, and command name completion performed on the first\n\t      word in the range.  For example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -x 'r[-exec,;]' -l '' -- find\n\n\t      completes arguments between `-exec' and the following `;' (or\n\t      the end of the command line if there is no such string) as if\n\t      they were a separate command line.\n\n       -h cmd Normally zsh completes quoted strings as a whole. With this\n\t      option, completion can be done separately on different parts of\n\t      such strings. It works like the -l option but makes the\n\t      completion code work on the parts of the current word that are\n\t      separated by spaces. These parts are completed as if they were\n\t      arguments to the given cmd. If cmd is the empty string, the\n\t      first part is completed as a command name, as with -l.\n\n       -U     Use the whole list of possible completions, whether or not they\n\t      actually match the word on the command line.  The word typed so\n\t      far will be deleted.  This is most useful with a function (given\n\t      by the -K option) which can examine the word components passed\n\t      to it (or via the read builtin's -c and -l flags) and use its\n\t      own criteria to decide what matches.  If there is no completion,\n\t      the original word is retained.  Since the produced possible\n\t      completions seldom have interesting common prefixes and\n\t      suffixes, menu completion is started immediately if AUTO_MENU is\n\t      set and this flag is used.\n\n       -y func-or-var\n\t      The list provided by func-or-var is displayed instead of the\n\t      list of completions whenever a listing is required; the actual\n\t      completions to be inserted are not affected.  It can be provided\n\t      in two ways. Firstly, if func-or-var begins with a $ it defines\n\t      a variable, or if it begins with a left parenthesis a literal\n\t      array, which contains the list.  A variable may have been set by\n\t      a call to a function using the -K option.  Otherwise it contains\n\t      the name of a function which will be executed to create the\n\t      list.  The function will be passed as an argument list all\n\t      matching completions, including prefixes and suffixes expanded\n\t      in full, and should set the array reply to the result.  In both\n\t      cases, the display list will only be retrieved after a complete\n\t      list of matches has been created.\n\n\t      Note that the returned list does not have to correspond, even in\n\t      length, to the original set of matches, and may be passed as a\n\t      scalar instead of an array.  No special formatting of characters\n\t      is performed on the output in this case; in particular, newlines\n\t      are printed literally and if they appear output in columns is\n\t      suppressed.\n\n       -X explanation\n\t      Print explanation when trying completion on the current set of\n\t      options. A `%n' in this string is replaced by the number of\n\t      matches that were added for this explanation string.  The\n\t      explanation only appears if completion was tried and there was\n\t      no unique match, or when listing completions. Explanation\n\t      strings will be listed together with the matches of the group\n\t      specified together with the -X option (using the -J or -V\n\t      option). If the same explanation string is given to multiple -X\n\t      options, the string appears only once (for each group) and the\n\t      number of matches shown for the `%n' is the total number of all\n\t      matches for each of these uses. In any case, the explanation\n\t      string will only be shown if there was at least one match added\n\t      for the explanation string.\n\n\t      The sequences %B, %b, %S, %s, %U, and %u specify output\n\t      attributes (bold, standout, and underline), %F, %f, %K, %k\n\t      specify foreground and background colours, and %{...%} can be\n\t      used to include literal escape sequences as in prompts.\n\n       -Y explanation\n\t      Identical to -X, except that the explanation first undergoes\n\t      expansion following the usual rules for strings in double\n\t      quotes.  The expansion will be carried out after any functions\n\t      are called for the -K or -y options, allowing them to set\n\t      variables.\n\n       -t continue\n\t      The continue-string contains a character that specifies which\n\t      set of completion flags should be used next.  It is useful:\n\n\t      (i) With -T, or when trying a list of pattern completions, when\n\t      compctl would usually continue with ordinary processing after\n\t      finding matches; this can be suppressed with `-tn'.\n\n\t      (ii) With a list of alternatives separated by +, when compctl\n\t      would normally stop when one of the alternatives generates\n\t      matches.\tIt can be forced to consider the next set of\n\t      completions by adding `-t+' to the flags of the alternative\n\t      before the `+'.\n\n\t      (iii) In an extended completion list (see below), when compctl\n\t      would normally continue until a set of conditions succeeded,\n\t      then use only the immediately following flags.  With `-t-',\n\t      compctl will continue trying extended completions after the next\n\t      `-'; with `-tx' it will attempt completion with the default\n\t      flags, in other words those before the `-x'.\n\n       -J name\n\t      This gives the name of the group the matches should be placed\n\t      in. Groups are listed and sorted separately; likewise, menu\n\t      completion will offer the matches in the groups in the order in\n\t      which the groups were defined. If no group name is explicitly\n\t      given, the matches are stored in a group named default. The\n\t      first time a group name is encountered, a group with that name\n\t      is created. After that all matches with the same group name are\n\t      stored in that group.\n\n\t      This can be useful with non-exclusive alternative completions.\n\t      For example, in\n\n\t\t     compctl -f -J files -t+ + -v -J variables foo\n\n\t      both files and variables are possible completions, as the -t+\n\t      forces both sets of alternatives before and after the + to be\n\t      considered at once.  Because of the -J options, however, all\n\t      files are listed before all variables.\n\n       -V name\n\t      Like -J, but matches within the group will not be sorted in\n\t      listings nor in menu completion. These unsorted groups are in a\n\t      different name space from the sorted ones, so groups defined as\n\t      -J files and -V files are distinct.\n\n       -1     If given together with the -V option, makes only consecutive\n\t      duplicates in the group be removed. Note that groups with and\n\t      without this flag are in different name spaces.\n\n       -2     If given together with the -J or -V option, makes all duplicates\n\t      be kept. Again, groups with and without this flag are in\n\t      different name spaces.\n\n       -M match-spec\n\t      This defines additional matching control specifications that\n\t      should be used only when testing words for the list of flags\n\t      this flag appears in. The format of the match-spec string is\n\t      described in zshcompwid.\n\nALTERNATIVE COMPLETION\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options + options [ + ... ] [ + ] command ...\n\n       The form with `+' specifies alternative options. Completion is tried\n       with the options before the first `+'. If this produces no matches\n       completion is tried with the flags after the `+' and so on. If there\n       are no flags after the last `+' and a match has not been found up to\n       that point, default completion is tried.  If the list of flags contains\n       a -t with a + character, the next list of flags is used even if the\n       current list produced matches.\n\n       Additional options are available that restrict completion to some part\n       of the command line; this is referred to as `extended completion'.\n\nEXTENDED COMPLETION\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options -x pattern options - ... --\n\t       [ command ... ]\n       compctl [ -CDT ] options [ -x pattern options - ... -- ]\n\t       [ + options [ -x ... -- ] ... [+] ] [ command ... ]\n\n       The form with `-x' specifies extended completion for the commands\n       given; as shown, it may be combined with alternative completion using\n       `+'.  Each pattern is examined in turn; when a match is found, the\n       corresponding options, as described in the section `Option Flags'\n       above, are used to generate possible completions.  If no pattern\n       matches, the options given before the -x are used.\n\n       Note that each pattern should be supplied as a single argument and\n       should be quoted to prevent expansion of metacharacters by the shell.\n\n       A pattern is built of sub-patterns separated by commas; it matches if\n       at least one of these sub-patterns matches (they are `or'ed). These\n       sub-patterns are in turn composed of other sub-patterns separated by\n       white spaces which match if all of the sub-patterns match (they are\n       `and'ed).  An element of the sub-patterns is of the form `c[...][...]',\n       where the pairs of brackets may be repeated as often as necessary, and\n       matches if any of the sets of brackets match (an `or').\tThe example\n       below makes this clearer.\n\n       The elements may be any of the following:\n\n       s[string]...\n\t      Matches if the current word on the command line starts with one\n\t      of the strings given in brackets.  The string is not removed and\n\t      is not part of the completion.\n\n       S[string]...\n\t      Like s[string] except that the string is part of the completion.\n\n       p[from,to]...\n\t      Matches if the number of the current word is between one of the\n\t      from and to pairs inclusive. The comma and to are optional; to\n\t      defaults to the same value as from.  The numbers may be\n\t      negative: -n refers to the n'th last word on the line.\n\n       c[offset,string]...\n\t      Matches if the string matches the word offset by offset from the\n\t      current word position.  Usually offset will be negative.\n\n       C[offset,pattern]...\n\t      Like c but using pattern matching instead.\n\n       w[index,string]...\n\t      Matches if the word in position index is equal to the\n\t      corresponding string.  Note that the word count is made after\n\t      any alias expansion.\n\n       W[index,pattern]...\n\t      Like w but using pattern matching instead.\n\n       n[index,string]...\n\t      Matches if the current word contains string.  Anything up to and\n\t      including the indexth occurrence of this string will not be\n\t      considered part of the completion, but the rest will.  index may\n\t      be negative to count from the end: in most cases, index will be\n\t      1 or -1.\tFor example,\n\n\t\t     compctl -s '`users`' -x 'n[1,@]' -k hosts -- talk\n\n\t      will usually complete usernames, but if you insert an @ after\n\t      the name, names from the array hosts (assumed to contain\n\t      hostnames, though you must make the array yourself) will be\n\t      completed.  Other commands such as rcp can be handled similarly.\n\n       N[index,string]...\n\t      Like n except that the string will be taken as a character\n\t      class.  Anything up to and including the indexth occurrence of\n\t      any of the characters in string will not be considered part of\n\t      the completion.\n\n       m[min,max]...\n\t      Matches if the total number of words lies between min and max\n\t      inclusive.\n\n       r[str1,str2]...\n\t      Matches if the cursor is after a word with prefix str1.  If\n\t      there is also a word with prefix str2 on the command line after\n\t      the one matched by str1 it matches only if the cursor is before\n\t      this word. If the comma and str2 are omitted, it matches if the\n\t      cursor is after a word with prefix str1.\n\n       R[str1,str2]...\n\t      Like r but using pattern matching instead.\n\n       q[str]...\n\t      Matches the word currently being completed is in single quotes\n\t      and the str begins with the letter `s', or if completion is done\n\t      in double quotes and str starts with the letter `d', or if\n\t      completion is done in backticks and str starts with a `b'.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\t      compctl -u -x 's[+] c[-1,-f],s[-f+]' \\\n\t\t-g '~/Mail/*(:t)' - 's[-f],c[-1,-f]' -f -- mail\n\n       This is to be interpreted as follows:\n\n       If the current command is mail, then"
