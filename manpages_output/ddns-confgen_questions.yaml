The resulting keys can be used,\n       for example, to secure dynamic DNS updates to a zone or for the rndc\n       command channel.\n\n       When run as tsig-keygen, a domain name can be specified on the command\n       line which will be used as the name of the generated key. If no name is\n       specified, the default is tsig-key.\n\n       When run as ddns-confgen, the generated key is accompanied by\n       configuration text and instructions that can be used with nsupdate and\n       named when setting up dynamic DNS, including an example update-policy\n       statement. (This usage similar to the rndc-confgen command for setting\n       up command channel security.)"

Available choices\n\t   are: hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha224, hmac-sha256, hmac-sha384 and\n\t   hmac-sha512. The default is hmac-sha256.
