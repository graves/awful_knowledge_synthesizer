After the\n     utility finishes, time writes to the standard error stream, (in seconds):\n     the total time elapsed, the time used to execute the utility process and\n     the time consumed by system overhead.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -a      If the -o flag is used, append to the specified file rather than\n\t     overwriting it.  Otherwise, this option has no effect.\n\n     -h      Print times in a human friendly format.  Times are printed in\n\t     minutes, hours, etc. as appropriate.\n\n     -l      The contents of the rusage structure are printed as well.\n\n     -o file\n\t     Write the output to file instead of stderr.  If file exists and\n\t     the -a flag is not specified, the file will be overwritten.\n\n     -p      Makes time output POSIX.2 compliant (each time is printed on its\n\t     own line)."

Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\n     If time receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal,\n     the current time the given command is running will be written to the\n     standard output.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The PATH environment variable is used to locate the requested utility if\n     the name contains no ‘/’ characters.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     If utility could be timed successfully, its exit status is returned.  If\n     utility terminated abnormally, a warning message is output to stderr.  If\n     the utility was found but could not be run, the exit status is 126.  If\n     no utility could be found at all, the exit status is 127.\tIf time\n     encounters any other error, the exit status is between 1 and 125\n     included.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Time the execution of ls(1) on an empty directory:\n\n\t   $ /usr/bin/time ls\n\t\t   0.00 real\t     0.00 user\t       0.00 sys\n\n     Time the execution of the cp(1) command and store the result in the\n     times.txt file.  Then execute the command again to make a new copy and\n     add the result to the same file:"
