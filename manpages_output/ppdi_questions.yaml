This program is deprecated and will be removed in a\n       future release of CUPS.\n\nOPTIONS\n       ppdi supports the following options:\n\n       -I include-directory\n\t    Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can\n\t    be supplied to add additional directories.\n\n       -o source-file\n\t    Specifies the PPD source file to update.  If the source file does\n\t    not exist, a new source file is created.  Otherwise the existing\n\t    file is merged with the new PPD file(s) on the command-line.  If\n\t    no source file is specified, the filename ppdi.drv is used."
