This\n       program is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of CUPS.\n\nOPTIONS\n       ppdc supports the following options:\n\n       -D name[=value]\n\t    Sets the named variable for use in the source file.  It is\n\t    equivalent to using the #define directive in the source file.\n\n       -I include-directory\n\t    Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can\n\t    be supplied to add additional directories.\n\n       -c message-catalog\n\t    Specifies a single message catalog file in GNU gettext\n\t    (filename.po) or Apple strings (filename.strings) format to be\n\t    used for localization."
