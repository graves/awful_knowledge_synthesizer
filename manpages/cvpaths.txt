NAME
       cvpaths - Xsan File System Disk Discovery Filter

SYNOPSIS
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/cvpaths

DESCRIPTION
       The Xsan File System cvpaths file is an optional configuration file
       used to control and/or override the normal behavior of scanning system
       standard directory locations during the disk discovery phase that
       occurs during a cvlabel run, or from the fsmpm at boot/initialization
       time.

       Normally, the directories and device name patterns scanned look like
       /dev/rdisk2, for example.

       If a cvpaths file exists in /Library/Preferences/Xsan, then the
       contents of the cvpaths file will explicitly control which devices
       and/or directories will be evaluated during disk discovery.  If the
       cvpaths file is executable, then it will be executed expecting it to be
       a shell script that will produce the cvpaths syntax on standard output,
       otherwise it will simply be read as input.

SYNTAX
       The format rules for a line in the cvpaths file is:


	  Any line beginning with "#" is considered a comment line.

	  Any token beginning with "#" is considered to be a comment up to the
	  end of the line.

	  Blank/empty lines are ignored.

	  A keyword=value syntax is used.

	  Groups of related keyword phrases can span multiple lines.

       Note, the parser capability is limited, and does not allow for any
       white space around the equal ("=") operator, although white space, and
       commas, are tolerated in all other places.

       There are several keywords:

		  directory=
		  device=
		  usage=
		  hba=
		  lun=
		  capacity=
		  geometry=
		  verify=

       The directory=path directives do not require any of the other keywords.

       The directory specified by the directory=path directive will be
       traversed in a manner similar to the default disk discovery scan
       mechanism.

       A device=path directive begins a group of keywords related to the
       device located at path.

       For example:

	  device=/dev/rdisk2

       would describe exactly one disk/raid device to be scanned during disk
       discovery.

       The device path is the name of the "special file".

       NOTE!  Enumerating specific device paths presumes that the same
	      disk/raid will always appear in the host system's
	      hardware/device graph with the same exact name.

	      In most cases, this can only be accomplished by utilizing
	      persistent binding methods related to the specific disk driver
	      package.

       A verify=labelname keyword may be used to verify that the device
       located at path contains the Xsan label labelname, for example:

		  device=/dev/mapper/mapthg verify=CvfsDisk9

       The device named must refer to a device path that describes the entire
       disk.  For example, you should use /dev/rdisk3 rather than
       /dev/rdisk3s4.


       Normally, Xsan determines from the raid controller whether a path
       should be considered Active or Passive.

       The usage=[Active|Passive] keyword may be used to override the normal
       determination of Active or Passive path usage.  The default mode is
       Active.

       The capacity=sectors keyword may be used to override the normal
       determination of the number of sectors supported by the device.

       The geometry=cyl/tpc/spt/bps keyword may be used to override the normal
       determination of the physical geometry of the device where:

	   cyl	 is the total # of cylinders
	   tpc	 is the # of tracks per cylinder
	   spt	 is the # of sectors per track
	   bps	 is the # of bytes per sector

       Certain device drivers use non-conventional names, or do not support
       standard methods of HBA & LUN identification.

       If the device driver name does not follow the host system's convention
       of providing HBA & LUN information, then the hba=# and lun=# keywords
       may be used to provide that information.

       For example:

	  device=/dev/emcpower3 verify=CvfsDisk_30 usage=Active hba=6 lun=2

       would configure a disk path externalized as /dev/emcpower3, assigning
       the HBA id of 6, and LUN # 2.

       This line could also be written as:

	  device=/dev/emcpower3, verify=CvfsDisk_30, usage=Active, hba=6, lun=2

	  -or-

	  device=/dev/emcpower3
	      verify=CvfsDisk_30,
	      usage=Active,
	      hba=6,
	      lun=2

       The HBA id is used by the multi-path code to collect devices together
       according to which host HBA is used for access.

       The actual value of the number is not critical, what is important is
       that all disks/raids configured through a specific host HBA should be
       assigned a consistent number that is unique to that host HBA path.

       The LUN number is important if the raid controller is one of the
       controllers recognized by Xsan as capable of Automatic Volume Transfer,
       and Active/Passive path declaration.  The LUN # is used to index into
       specific raid controller mode pages.
