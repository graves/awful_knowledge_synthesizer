    Manpage text:

    On most Unix platforms, the "CHLD" (sometimes also known as "CLD")
           signal has special behavior with respect to a value of "IGNORE".
           Setting $SIG{CHLD} to "IGNORE" on such a platform has the effect of not
           creating zombie processes when the parent process fails to "wait()" on
           its child processes (i.e., child processes are automatically reaped).
           Calling "wait()" with $SIG{CHLD} set to "IGNORE" usually returns "-1"
           on such platforms.

           Some signals can be neither trapped nor ignored, such as the KILL and
           STOP (but not the TSTP) signals. Note that ignoring signals makes them
           disappear.  If you only want them blocked temporarily without them
           getting lost you'll have to use the "POSIX" module's sigprocmask.

           Sending a signal to a negative process ID means that you send the
           signal to the entire Unix process group.  This code sends a hang-up
           signal to all processes in the current process group, and also sets
           $SIG{HUP} to "IGNORE" so it doesn't kill itself:

    Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)
           Before Perl 5.8.0, installing Perl code to deal with signals exposed
           you to danger from two things.  First, few system library functions are
           re-entrant.  If the signal interrupts while Perl is executing one
           function (like malloc(3) or printf(3)), and your signal handler then
           calls the same function again, you could get unpredictable
           behavior--often, a core dump.  Second, Perl isn't itself re-entrant at
           the lowest levels.  If the signal interrupts Perl while Perl is
           changing its own internal data structures, similarly unpredictable
           behavior may result.

           There were two things you could do, knowing this: be paranoid or be
           pragmatic.  The paranoid approach was to do as little as possible in
           your signal handler.  Set an existing integer variable that already has
           a value, and return.  This doesn't help you if you're in a slow system
           call, which will just restart.  That means you have to "die" to
           longjmp(3) out of the handler.  Even this is a little cavalier for the
           true paranoiac, who avoids "die" in a handler because the system is out
           to get you.  The pragmatic approach was to say "I know the risks, but
           prefer the convenience", and to do anything you wanted in your signal
           handler, and be prepared to clean up core dumps now and again.

That\n       is, when the signal is delivered to the process by the system (to the C\n       code that implements Perl) a flag is set, and the handler returns\n       immediately.  Then at strategic \"safe\" points in the Perl interpreter\n       (e.g. when it is about to execute a new opcode) the flags are checked\n       and the Perl level handler from %SIG is executed. The \"deferred\" scheme\n       allows much more flexibility in the coding of signal handlers as we\n       know the Perl interpreter is in a safe state, and that we are not in a\n       system library function when the handler is called.  However the\n       implementation does differ from previous Perls in the following ways:\n\n       Long-running opcodes\n\t   As the Perl interpreter looks at signal flags only when it is about\n\t   to execute a new opcode, a signal that arrives during a long-\n\t   running opcode (e.g. a regular expression operation on a very large\n\t   string) will not be seen until the current opcode completes."

Furthermore, if your system's signal\n\t   queue gets flooded to the point that there are signals that have\n\t   been raised but not yet caught (and thus not deferred) at the time\n\t   an opcode completes, those signals may well be caught and deferred\n\t   during subsequent opcodes, with sometimes surprising results.  For\n\t   example, you may see alarms delivered even after calling alarm(0)\n\t   as the latter stops the raising of alarms but does not cancel the\n\t   delivery of alarms raised but not yet caught.  Do not depend on the\n\t   behaviors described in this paragraph as they are side effects of\n\t   the current implementation and may change in future versions of\n\t   Perl.\n\n       Interrupting IO\n\t   When a signal is delivered (e.g., SIGINT from a control-C) the\n\t   operating system breaks into IO operations like read(2), which is\n\t   used to implement Perl's readline() function, the \"<>\" operator. On\n\t   older Perls the handler was called immediately (and as \"read\" is\n\t   not \"unsafe\", this worked well).

       Safe Pipe Opens
           Another interesting approach to IPC is making your single program go
           multiprocess and communicate between--or even amongst--yourselves.  The
           two-argument form of the open() function will accept a file argument of
           either "-|" or "|-" to do a very interesting thing: it forks a child
           connected to the filehandle you've opened.  The child is running the
           same program as the parent.  This is useful for safely opening a file
           when running under an assumed UID or GID, for example.  If you open a
           pipe to minus, you can write to the filehandle you opened and your kid
           will find it in his STDIN.  If you open a pipe from minus, you can read
           from the filehandle you opened whatever your kid writes to his STDOUT.

The most obvious approach doesn't\n       work:\n\n\t   # THIS DOES NOT WORK!!\n\t   open(my $prog_for_reading_and_writing, \"| some program |\")\n\n       If you forget to \"use warnings\", you'll miss out entirely on the\n       helpful diagnostic message:\n\n\t   Can't do bidirectional pipe at -e line 1.\n\n       If you really want to, you can use the standard open2() from the\n       IPC::Open2 module to catch both ends.  There's also an open3() in\n       IPC::Open3 for tridirectional I/O so you can also catch your child's\n       STDERR, but doing so would then require an awkward select() loop and\n       wouldn't allow you to use normal Perl input operations.\n\n       If you look at its source, you'll see that open2() uses low-level\n       primitives like the pipe() and exec() syscalls to create all the\n       connections.  Although it might have been more efficient by using\n       socketpair(), this would have been even less portable than it already\n       is. The open2() and open3() functions are unlikely to work anywhere\n       except on a Unix system, or at least one purporting POSIX compliance.\n\n       Here's an example of using open2():\n\n\t   use IPC::Open2;\n\t   my $pid = open2(my $reader, my $writer, \"cat -un\");\n\t   print $writer \"stuff\\n\";\n\t   my $got = <$reader>;\n\t   waitpid $pid, 0;\n\n       The problem with this is that buffering is really going to ruin your\n       day.  Even though your $writer filehandle is auto-flushed so the\n       process on the other end gets your data in a timely manner, you can't\n       usually do anything to force that process to give its data to you in a\n       similarly quick fashion.  In this special case, we could actually so,\n       because we gave cat a -u flag to make it unbuffered.  But very few\n       commands are designed to operate over pipes, so this seldom works\n       unless you yourself wrote the program on the other end of the double-\n       ended pipe.\n\n       A solution to this is to use a library which uses pseudottys to make\n       your program behave more reasonably.  This way you don't have to have\n       control over the source code of the program you're using.  The \"Expect\"\n       module from CPAN also addresses this kind of thing.  This module\n       requires two other modules from CPAN, \"IO::Pty\" and \"IO::Stty\".\tIt\n       sets up a pseudo terminal to interact with programs that insist on\n       talking to the terminal device driver.  If your system is supported,\n       this may be your best bet.\n\n   Bidirectional Communication with Yourself\n       If you want, you may make low-level pipe() and fork() syscalls to\n       stitch this together by hand.  This example only talks to itself, but\n       you could reopen the appropriate handles to STDIN and STDOUT and call\n       other processes.  (The following example lacks proper error checking.)\n\n\t#!/usr/bin/perl\n\t# pipe1 - bidirectional communication using two pipe pairs\n\t#\t  designed for the socketpair-challenged\n\tuse strict;\n\tuse warnings;\n\tuse IO::Handle;  # enable autoflush method before Perl 5.14\n\tpipe(my $parent_rdr, my $child_wtr);  # XXX: check failure?\n\tpipe(my $child_rdr,  my $parent_wtr); # XXX: check failure?\n\t$child_wtr->autoflush(1);\n\t$parent_wtr->autoflush(1);\n\n\tif ($pid = fork()) {\n\t    close $parent_rdr;\n\t    close $parent_wtr;\n\t    print $child_wtr \"Parent Pid $$ is sending this\\n\";\n\t    chomp(my $line = <$child_rdr>);\n\t    print \"Parent Pid $$ just read this: '$line'\\n\";\n\t    close $child_rdr; close $child_wtr;\n\t    waitpid($pid, 0);\n\t} else {\n\t    die \"cannot fork: $!\" unless defined $pid;\n\t    close $child_rdr;\n\t    close $child_wtr;\n\t    chomp(my $line = <$parent_rdr>);\n\t    print \"Child Pid $$ just read this: '$line'\\n\";\n\t    print $parent_wtr \"Child Pid $$ is sending this\\n\";\n\t    close $parent_rdr;\n\t    close $parent_wtr;\n\t    exit(0);\n\t}\n\n       But you don't actually have to make two pipe calls.  If you have the\n       socketpair() system call, it will do this all for you.\n\n\t#!/usr/bin/perl\n\t# pipe2 - bidirectional communication using socketpair\n\t#   \"the best ones always go both ways\"\n\n\tuse strict;\n\tuse warnings;\n\tuse Socket;\n\tuse IO::Handle;  # enable autoflush method before Perl 5.14\n\n\t# We say AF_UNIX because although *_LOCAL is the\n\t# POSIX 1003.1g form of the constant, many machines\n\t# still don't have it.\n\tsocketpair(my $child, my $parent, AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, PF_UNSPEC)\n\t\t\t\t    ||\tdie \"socketpair: $!\";\n\n\t$child->autoflush(1);\n\t$parent->autoflush(1);\n\n\tif ($pid = fork()) {\n\t    close $parent;\n\t    print $child \"Parent Pid $$ is sending this\\n\";\n\t    chomp(my $line = <$child>);\n\t    print \"Parent Pid $$ just read this: '$line'\\n\";\n\t    close $child;\n\t    waitpid($pid, 0);\n\t} else {\n\t    die \"cannot fork: $!\" unless defined $pid;\n\t    close $child;\n\t    chomp(my $line = <$parent>);\n\t    print \"Child Pid $$ just read this: '$line'\\n\";\n\t    print $parent \"Child Pid $$ is sending this\\n\";\n\t    close $parent;\n\t    exit(0);\n\t}\n\nSockets: Client/Server Communication\n       While not entirely limited to Unix-derived operating systems (e.g.,\n       WinSock on PCs provides socket support, as do some VMS libraries), you\n       might not have sockets on your system, in which case this section\n       probably isn't going to do you much good.  With sockets, you can do\n       both virtual circuits like TCP streams and datagrams like UDP packets.\n       You may be able to do even more depending on your system.\n\n       The Perl functions for dealing with sockets have the same names as the\n       corresponding system calls in C, but their arguments tend to differ for\n       two reasons.  First, Perl filehandles work differently than C file\n       descriptors.  Second, Perl already knows the length of its strings, so\n       you don't need to pass that information.\n\n       One of the major problems with ancient, antemillennial socket code in\n       Perl was that it used hard-coded values for some of the constants,\n       which severely hurt portability.  If you ever see code that does\n       anything like explicitly setting \"$AF_INET = 2\", you know you're in for\n       big trouble.  An immeasurably superior approach is to use the Socket\n       module, which more reliably grants access to the various constants and\n       functions you'll need.\n\n       If you're not writing a server/client for an existing protocol like\n       NNTP or SMTP, you should give some thought to how your server will know\n       when the client has finished talking, and vice-versa.  Most protocols\n       are based on one-line messages and responses (so one party knows the\n       other has finished when a \"\\n\" is received) or multi-line messages and\n       responses that end with a period on an empty line (\"\\n.\\n\" terminates a\n       message/response).\n\n   Internet Line Terminators\n       The Internet line terminator is \"\\015\\012\".  Under ASCII variants of\n       Unix, that could usually be written as \"\\r\\n\", but under other systems,\n       \"\\r\\n\" might at times be \"\\015\\015\\012\", \"\\012\\012\\015\", or something\n       completely different.  The standards specify writing \"\\015\\012\" to be\n       conformant (be strict in what you provide), but they also recommend\n       accepting a lone \"\\012\" on input (be lenient in what you require).  We\n       haven't always been very good about that in the code in this manpage,\n       but unless you're on a Mac from way back in its pre-Unix dark ages,\n       you'll probably be ok.\n\n   Internet TCP Clients and Servers\n       Use Internet-domain sockets when you want to do client-server\n       communication that might extend to machines outside of your own system.\n\n       Here's a sample TCP client using Internet-domain sockets:\n\n\t   #!/usr/bin/perl\n\t   use strict;\n\t   use warnings;\n\t   use Socket;\n\n\t   my $remote  = shift || \"localhost\";\n\t   my $port    = shift || 2345;  # random port\n\t   if ($port =~ /\\D/) { $port = getservbyname($port, \"tcp\") }\n\t   die \"No port\" unless $port;\n\t   my $iaddr   = inet_aton($remote)\t  || die \"no host: $remote\";\n\t   my $paddr   = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);\n\n\t   my $proto   = getprotobyname(\"tcp\");\n\t   socket(my $sock, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)  || die \"socket: $!\";\n\t   connect($sock, $paddr)\t       || die \"connect: $!\";\n\t   while (my $line = <$sock>) {\n\t       print $line;\n\t   }\n\n\t   close ($sock)\t\t\t|| die \"close: $!\";\n\t   exit(0);\n\n       And here's a corresponding server to go along with it.  We'll leave the\n       address as \"INADDR_ANY\" so that the kernel can choose the appropriate\n       interface on multihomed hosts.  If you want sit on a particular\n       interface (like the external side of a gateway or firewall machine),\n       fill this in with your real address instead.\n\n\t#!/usr/bin/perl -T\n\tuse strict;\n\tuse warnings;\n\tBEGIN { $ENV{PATH} = \"/usr/bin:/bin\" }\n\tuse Socket;\n\tuse Carp;\n\tmy $EOL = \"\\015\\012\";\n\n\tsub logmsg { print \"$0 $$: @_ at \", scalar localtime(), \"\\n\" }\n\n\tmy $port  = shift || 2345;\n\tdie \"invalid port\" unless $port =~ /^ \\d+ $/x;\n\n\tmy $proto = getprotobyname(\"tcp\");\n\n\tsocket(my $server, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto) || die \"socket: $!\";\n\tsetsockopt($server, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, pack(\"l\", 1))\n\t\t\t\t\t\t      || die \"setsockopt: $!\";\n\tbind($server, sockaddr_in($port, INADDR_ANY)) || die \"bind: $!\";\n\tlisten($server, SOMAXCONN)\t\t      || die \"listen: $!\";\n\n\tlogmsg \"server started on port $port\";\n\n\tfor (my $paddr; $paddr = accept(my $client, $server); close $client) {\n\t    my($port, $iaddr) = sockaddr_in($paddr);\n\t    my $name = gethostbyaddr($iaddr, AF_INET);\n\n\t    logmsg \"connection from $name [\",\n\t\t    inet_ntoa($iaddr), \"]\n\t\t    at port $port\";\n\n\t    print $client \"Hello there, $name, it's now \",\n\t\t\t    scalar localtime(), $EOL;\n\t}\n\n       And here's a multitasking version.

That way it can handle many requests at\n       once, which you might not always want.  Even if you don't fork(), the\n       listen() will allow that many pending connections.  Forking servers\n       have to be particularly careful about cleaning up their dead children\n       (called \"zombies\" in Unix parlance), because otherwise you'll quickly\n       fill up your process table.  The REAPER subroutine is used here to call\n       waitpid() for any child processes that have finished, thereby ensuring\n       that they terminate cleanly and don't join the ranks of the living\n       dead.\n\n       Within the while loop we call accept() and check to see if it returns a\n       false value.  This would normally indicate a system error needs to be\n       reported.  However, the introduction of safe signals (see \"Deferred\n       Signals (Safe Signals)\" above) in Perl 5.8.0 means that accept() might\n       also be interrupted when the process receives a signal.\tThis typically\n       happens when one of the forked subprocesses exits and notifies the\n       parent process with a CHLD signal.\n\n       If accept() is interrupted by a signal, $! will be set to EINTR. If\n       this happens, we can safely continue to the next iteration of the loop\n       and another call to accept().  It is important that your signal\n       handling code not modify the value of $!, or else this test will likely\n       fail.  In the REAPER subroutine we create a local version of $! before\n       calling waitpid().  When waitpid() sets $! to ECHILD as it inevitably\n       does when it has no more children waiting, it updates the local copy\n       and leaves the original unchanged.\n\n       You should use the -T flag to enable taint checking (see perlsec) even\n       if we aren't running setuid or setgid.  This is always a good idea for\n       servers or any program run on behalf of someone else (like CGI\n       scripts), because it lessens the chances that people from the outside\n       will be able to compromise your system.\n\n       Let's look at another TCP client.  This one connects to the TCP \"time\"\n       service on a number of different machines and shows how far their\n       clocks differ from the system on which it's being run:\n\n\t   #!/usr/bin/perl\n\t   use strict;\n\t   use warnings;\n\t   use Socket;\n\n\t   my $SECS_OF_70_YEARS = 2208988800;\n\t   sub ctime { scalar localtime(shift() || time()) }\n\n\t   my $iaddr = gethostbyname(\"localhost\");\n\t   my $proto = getprotobyname(\"tcp\");\n\t   my $port = getservbyname(\"time\", \"tcp\");\n\t   my $paddr = sockaddr_in(0, $iaddr);\n\n\t   $| = 1;\n\t   printf \"%-24s %8s %s\\n\", \"localhost\", 0, ctime();\n\n\t   foreach my $host (@ARGV) {\n\t       printf \"%-24s \", $host;\n\t       my $hisiaddr = inet_aton($host)\t   || die \"unknown host\";\n\t       my $hispaddr = sockaddr_in($port, $hisiaddr);\n\t       socket(my $socket, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   || die \"socket: $!\";\n\t       connect($socket, $hispaddr)\t   || die \"connect: $!\";\n\t       my $rtime = pack(\"C4\", ());\n\t       read($socket, $rtime, 4);\n\t       close($socket);\n\t       my $histime = unpack(\"N\", $rtime) - $SECS_OF_70_YEARS;\n\t       printf \"%8d %s\\n\", $histime - time(), ctime($histime);\n\t   }\n\n   Unix-Domain TCP Clients and Servers\n       That's fine for Internet-domain clients and servers, but what about\n       local communications?  While you can use the same setup, sometimes you\n       don't want to.  Unix-domain sockets are local to the current host, and\n       are often used internally to implement pipes.  Unlike Internet domain\n       sockets, Unix domain sockets can show up in the file system with an\n       ls(1) listing.\n\n\t   % ls -l /dev/log\n\t   srw-rw-rw-  1 root\t\t 0 Oct 31 07:23 /dev/log\n\n       You can test for these with Perl's -S file test:\n\n\t   unless (-S \"/dev/log\") {\n\t       die \"something's wicked with the log system\";\n\t   }\n\n       Here's a sample Unix-domain client:\n\n\t   #!/usr/bin/perl\n\t   use Socket;\n\t   use strict;\n\t   use warnings;\n\n\t   my $rendezvous = shift || \"catsock\";\n\t   socket(my $sock, PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0) || die \"socket: $!\";\n\t   connect($sock, sockaddr_un($rendezvous))  || die \"connect: $!\";\n\t   while (defined(my $line = <$sock>)) {\n\t       print $line;\n\t   }\n\t   exit(0);\n\n       And here's a corresponding server.

    Manpage text:

    As you see, it's remarkably similar to the Internet domain TCP server,
           so much so, in fact, that we've omitted several duplicate
           functions--spawn(), logmsg(), ctime(), and REAPER()--which are the same
           as in the other server.

           So why would you ever want to use a Unix domain socket instead of a
           simpler named pipe?  Because a named pipe doesn't give you sessions.
           You can't tell one process's data from another's.  With socket
           programming, you get a separate session for each client; that's why
           accept() takes two arguments.

           For example, let's say that you have a long-running database server
           daemon that you want folks to be able to access from the Web, but only
           if they go through a CGI interface.  You'd have a small, simple CGI
           program that does whatever checks and logging you feel like, and then
           acts as a Unix-domain client and connects to your private server.

    TCP Clients with IO::Socket
           For those preferring a higher-level interface to socket programming,
           the IO::Socket module provides an object-oriented approach.  If for
           some reason you lack this module, you can just fetch IO::Socket from
           CPAN, where you'll also find modules providing easy interfaces to the
           following systems: DNS, FTP, Ident (RFC 931), NIS and NISPlus, NNTP,
           Ping, POP3, SMTP, SNMP, SSLeay, Telnet, and Time--to name just a few.

       Interactive Client with IO::Socket
           Well, that's all fine if you want to send one command and get one
           answer, but what about setting up something fully interactive, somewhat
           like the way telnet works?  That way you can type a line, get the
           answer, type a line, get the answer, etc.

           This client is more complicated than the two we've done so far, but if
           you're on a system that supports the powerful "fork" call, the solution
           isn't that rough.  Once you've made the connection to whatever service
           you'd like to chat with, call "fork" to clone your process.  Each of
           these two identical process has a very simple job to do: the parent
           copies everything from the socket to standard output, while the child
           simultaneously copies everything from standard input to the socket.  To
           accomplish the same thing using just one process would be much harder,
           because it's easier to code two processes to do one thing than it is to
           code one process to do two things.  (This keep-it-simple principle a
           cornerstones of the Unix philosophy, and good software engineering as
           well, which is probably why it's spread to other systems.)

    UDP: Message Passing
           Another kind of client-server setup is one that uses not connections,
           but messages.  UDP communications involve much lower overhead but also
           provide less reliability, as there are no promises that messages will
           arrive at all, let alone in order and unmangled.  Still, UDP offers
           some advantages over TCP, including being able to "broadcast" or
           "multicast" to a whole bunch of destination hosts at once (usually on
           your local subnet).  If you find yourself overly concerned about
           reliability and start building checks into your message system, then
           you probably should use just TCP to start with.

           UDP datagrams are not a bytestream and should not be treated as such.
           This makes using I/O mechanisms with internal buffering like stdio
           (i.e.  print() and friends) especially cumbersome. Use syswrite(), or
           better send(), like in the example below.

           Here's a UDP program similar to the sample Internet TCP client given
           earlier.  However, instead of checking one host at a time, the UDP
           version will check many of them asynchronously by simulating a
           multicast and then using select() to do a timed-out wait for I/O.  To
           do something similar with TCP, you'd have to use a different socket
           handle for each host.

The most prominent reason for this is\n       congestion of the queues on the sending host if the number of hosts to\n       contact is sufficiently large.\n\nSysV IPC\n       While System V IPC isn't so widely used as sockets, it still has some\n       interesting uses.  However, you cannot use SysV IPC or Berkeley mmap()\n       to have a variable shared amongst several processes.  That's because\n       Perl would reallocate your string when you weren't wanting it to.  You\n       might look into the \"IPC::Shareable\" or \"threads::shared\" modules for\n       that.\n\n       Here's a small example showing shared memory usage.\n\n\t   use IPC::SysV qw(IPC_PRIVATE IPC_RMID S_IRUSR S_IWUSR);\n\n\t   my $size = 2000;\n\t   my $id = shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, $size, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);\n\t   defined($id) \t\t   || die \"shmget: $!\";\n\t   print \"shm key $id\\n\";\n\n\t   my $message = \"Message #1\";\n\t   shmwrite($id, $message, 0, 60)  || die \"shmwrite: $!\";\n\t   print \"wrote: '$message'\\n\";\n\t   shmread($id, my $buff, 0, 60)      || die \"shmread: $!\";\n\t   print \"read : '$buff'\\n\";"

(Actually, some of the new Socket conversion\n       functions do croak() on bad arguments.)\tIt is therefore essential to\n       check return values from these functions.  Always begin your socket\n       programs this way for optimal success, and don't forget to add the -T\n       taint-checking flag to the \"#!\" line for servers:\n\n\t   #!/usr/bin/perl -T\n\t   use strict;\n\t   use warnings;\n\t   use sigtrap;\n\t   use Socket;\n\nBUGS\n       These routines all create system-specific portability problems.\tAs\n       noted elsewhere, Perl is at the mercy of your C libraries for much of\n       its system behavior.  It's probably safest to assume broken SysV\n       semantics for signals and to stick with simple TCP and UDP socket\n       operations; e.g., don't try to pass open file descriptors over a local\n       UDP datagram socket if you want your code to stand a chance of being\n       portable."
