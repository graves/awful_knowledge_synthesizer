It eliminates\n       the need for \"our $VERSION = ...\" and similar constructs. E.g.\n\n\t     package Foo::Bar 1.23;\n\t     # $Foo::Bar::VERSION == 1.23\n\n       There are several advantages to this:\n\n       •   $VERSION is parsed in exactly the same way as \"use NAME VERSION\"\n\n       •   $VERSION is set at compile time\n\n       •   $VERSION is a version object that provides proper overloading of\n\t   comparison operators so comparing $VERSION to decimal (1.23) or\n\t   dotted-decimal (v1.2.3) version numbers works correctly."

    Pluggable keywords
           Extension modules can now cleanly hook into the Perl parser to define
           new kinds of keyword-headed expression and compound statement. The
           syntax following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension. This
           allows a completely non-Perl sublanguage to be parsed inline, with the
           correct ops cleanly generated.

           See "PL_keyword_plugin" in perlapi for the mechanism. The Perl core
           source distribution also includes a new module XS::APItest::KeywordRPN,
           which implements reverse Polish notation arithmetic via pluggable
           keywords. This module is mainly used for test purposes, and is not
           normally installed, but also serves as an example of how to use the new
           mechanism.

           Perl's developers consider this feature to be experimental. We may
           remove it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.

       APIs for more internals
           The lowest layers of the lexer and parts of the pad system now have C
           APIs available to XS extensions. These are necessary to support proper
           use of pluggable keywords, but have other uses too. The new APIs are
           experimental, and only cover a small proportion of what would be
           necessary to take full advantage of the core's facilities in these
           areas. It is intended that the Perl 5.13 development cycle will see the
           addition of a full range of clean, supported interfaces.

    "\N" experimental regex escape
           Perl now supports "\N", a new regex escape which you can think of as
           the inverse of "\n". It will match any character that is not a newline,
           independently from the presence or absence of the single line match
           modifier "/s". It is not usable within a character class.  "\N{3}"
           means to match 3 non-newlines; "\N{5,}" means to match at least 5.
           "\N{NAME}" still means the character or sequence named "NAME", but
           "NAME" no longer can be things like 3, or "5,".

           This will break a custom charnames translator which allows numbers for
           character names, as "\N{3}" will now mean to match 3 non-newline
           characters, and not the character whose name is 3. (No name defined by
           the Unicode standard is a number, so only custom translators might be
           affected.)

           Perl's developers are somewhat concerned about possible user confusion
           with the existing "\N{...}" construct which matches characters by their
           Unicode name. Consequently, this feature is experimental. We may remove
           it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.

    DTrace support
           Perl now has some support for DTrace. See "DTrace support" in INSTALL.

       Support for "configure_requires" in CPAN module metadata
           Both "CPAN" and "CPANPLUS" now support the "configure_requires" keyword
           in the META.yml metadata file included in most recent CPAN
           distributions.  This allows distribution authors to specify

           AF_UNIX family, slightly abusing it to be able to use arbitrary
           character arrays as addresses: They start with nul byte and are not

           system call.

       32-bit limit on substr arguments removed
           The 32-bit limit on "substr" arguments has now been removed. The full

           the "pos" and "len" arguments.

    Potentially Incompatible Changes
       Deprecations warn by default
           Over the years, Perl's developers have deprecated a number of language
           features for a variety of reasons.  Perl now defaults to issuing a
           warning if a deprecated language feature is used. Many of the
           deprecations Perl now warns you about have been deprecated for many
           years.  You can find a list of what was deprecated in a given release
           of Perl in the "perl5xxdelta.pod" file for that release.

       Version number formats
           Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into "strict"
           and "lax" rules. "package NAME VERSION" takes a strict version number.
           "UNIVERSAL::VERSION" and the version object constructors take lax
           version numbers. Providing an invalid version will result in a fatal
           error. The version argument in "use NAME VERSION" is first parsed as a
           numeric literal or v-string and then passed to "UNIVERSAL::VERSION"
           (and must then pass the "lax" format test).

           These formats are documented fully in the version module. To a first
           approximation, a "strict" version number is a positive decimal number
           (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-
           decimal v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three
           components. A "lax" version number allows v-strings with fewer than
           three components or without a leading 'v'. Under "lax" rules, both
           decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing "alpha"
           component separated by an underscore character after a fractional or
           dotted-decimal component.

    The version module adds "version::is_strict" and "version::is_lax"
           functions to check a scalar against these rules.

       @INC reorganization
           In @INC, "ARCHLIB" and "PRIVLIB" now occur after the current version's
           "site_perl" and "vendor_perl".  Modules installed into "site_perl" and
           "vendor_perl" will now be loaded in preference to those installed in
           "ARCHLIB" and "PRIVLIB".

       REGEXPs are now first class
           Internally, Perl now treats compiled regular expressions (such as those
           created with "qr//") as first class entities. Perl modules which
           serialize, deserialize or otherwise have deep interaction with Perl's
           internal data structures need to be updated for this change.  Most
           affected CPAN modules have already been updated as of this writing.

       Switch statement changes
           The "given"/"when" switch statement handles complex statements better
           than Perl 5.10.0 did (These enhancements are also available in 5.10.1
           and subsequent 5.10 releases.) There are two new cases where "when" now
           interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be

           Perl 5.10.0 and contains over 750,000 lines of changes across over
           3,000 files from over 200 authors and committers.

           Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
           community of users and developers.  The following people are known to

    Manpage text:

    This is woefully incomplete as it's automatically generated from
           version control history.  In particular, it doesn't include the names
           of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues in
           previous versions of Perl that helped make Perl 5.12.0 better. For a
           more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
           the "AUTHORS" file in the Perl 5.12.0 distribution.

           Our "retired" pumpkings Nicholas Clark and Rafael Garcia-Suarez deserve
           special thanks for their brilliant and substantive ongoing
           contributions. Nicholas personally authored over 30% of the patches
           since 5.10.0. Rafael comes in second in patch authorship with 11%, but
           is first by a long shot in committing patches authored by others,
           pushing 44% of the commits since 5.10.0 in this category, often after
           providing considerable coaching to the patch authors. These statistics
           in no way comprise all of their contributions, but express in shorthand
           that we couldn't have done it without them.

    Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
           modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
           community for helping Perl to flourish.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
           recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
           database at <http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/>. There may also be
           information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analyzed by
           the Perl porting team.

           If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
           inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
           send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
           subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
           committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,
           figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
           mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
           supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl
           core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
