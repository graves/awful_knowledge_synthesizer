To recognise that a polynomial definition is\n       indeed a correct definition, it consists of a list of two elements: the\n       keyword \"POLYNOMIAL\" and the list of coefficients in descending order.\n       The latter makes it easier to implement Horner's rule.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
