First, the client calls a procedure to\n       send a data packet to the server.  Upon receipt of the packet, the\n       server calls a dispatch routine to perform the requested service, and\n       then sends back a reply.  Finally, the procedure call returns to the\n       client.\n\n       Routines that are used for Secure RPC (DES authentication) are\n       described in rpc_secure(3N).  Secure RPC can be used only if DES\n       encryption is available.\n\n       #include <rpc/rpc.h>\n\n       void\n       auth_destroy(auth)\n       AUTH *auth;\n\n\t      A macro that destroys the authentication information associated\n\t      with auth.  Destruction usually involves deallocation of private\n\t      data structures. The use of auth is undefined after calling\n\t      auth_destroy()."

It is called when the select system call has\n\t      determined that an RPC request has arrived on some RPC socket(s)\n\t      ; rdfds is the resultant read file descriptor bit mask.

If protocol is non-zero,\n\t      then a mapping of the triple [prognum,versnum,protocol] to\n\t      xprt->xp_port is established with the local portmap service\n\t      (generally protocol is zero, IPPROTO_UDP or IPPROTO_TCP ).  The\n\t      procedure dispatch has the following form:\n\t\t dispatch(request, xprt)\n\t\t struct svc_req *request;\n\t\t SVCXPRT *xprt;\n\n\t      The svc_register() routine returns one if it succeeds, and zero\n\t      otherwise.\n\n       svc_run()\n\n\t      This routine never returns. It waits for RPC requests to arrive,\n\t      and calls the appropriate service procedure using svc_getreq()\n\t      when one arrives.

The parameter xprt is the request's\n\t      associated transport handle; outproc is the XDR routine which is\n\t      used to encode the results; and out is the address of the\n\t      results.\tThis routine returns one if it succeeds, zero\n\t      otherwise.\n\n       void\n       svc_unregister(prognum, versnum)\n       u_long prognum, versnum;\n\n\t      Remove all mapping of the double [prognum,versnum] to dispatch\n\t      routines, and of the triple [prognum,versnum,*] to port number.\n\n       void\n       svcerr_auth(xprt, why)\n       SVCXPRT *xprt;\n       enum auth_stat why;\n\n\t      Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform a\n\t      remote procedure call due to an authentication error.\n\n       void\n       svcerr_decode(xprt)\n       SVCXPRT *xprt;\n\n\t      Called by a service dispatch routine that cannot successfully\n\t      decode its parameters.

Service implementors usually do not need this routine.\n\n       void\n       svcerr_progvers(xprt)\n       SVCXPRT *xprt;\n\n\t      Called when the desired version of a program is not registered\n\t      with the RPC package.

For example, if a\n\t      service can no longer allocate storage, it may call this\n\t      routine.\n\n       void\n       svcerr_weakauth(xprt)\n       SVCXPRT *xprt;\n\n\t      Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform a\n\t      remote procedure call due to insufficient authentication\n\t      parameters.  The routine calls svcerr_auth(xprt, AUTH_TOOWEAK).\n\n       SVCXPRT *\n       svcraw_create()\n\n\t      This routine creates a toy RPC service transport, to which it\n\t      returns a pointer.  The transport is really a buffer within the\n\t      process's address space, so the corresponding RPC client should\n\t      live in the same address space; see clntraw_create().  This\n\t      routine allows simulation of RPC and acquisition of RPC\n\t      overheads (such as round trip times), without any kernel\n\t      interference.  This routine returns NULL if it fails.\n\n       SVCXPRT *\n       svctcp_create(sock, send_buf_size, recv_buf_size)\n       int sock;\n       u_int send_buf_size, recv_buf_size;\n\n\t      This routine creates a TCP/IP-based RPC service transport, to\n\t      which it returns a pointer.  The transport is associated with\n\t      the socket sock, which may be RPC_ANYSOCK, in which case a new\n\t      socket is created.  If the socket is not bound to a local TCP\n\t      port, then this routine binds it to an arbitrary port.  Upon\n\t      completion, xprt->xp_sock is the transport's socket descriptor,\n\t      and xprt->xp_port is the transport's port number.  This routine\n\t      returns NULL if it fails. Since TCP-based RPC uses buffered I/O\n\t      , users may specify the size of buffers; values of zero choose\n\t      suitable defaults.\n\n       SVCXPRT *\n       svcfd_create(fd, sendsize, recvsize)\n       int fd;\n       u_int sendsize;\n       u_int recvsize;\n\n\t      Create a service on top of any open descriptor. Typically, this\n\t      descriptor is a connected socket for a stream protocol such as\n\t      TCP.  sendsize and recvsize indicate sizes for the send and\n\t      receive buffers.\tIf they are zero, a reasonable default is\n\t      chosen.\n\n       SVCXPRT *\n       svcudp_bufcreate(sock, sendsize, recosize)\n       int sock;\n\n\t      This routine creates a UDP/IP-based RPC service transport, to\n\t      which it returns a pointer.  The transport is associated with\n\t      the socket sock, which may be RPC_ANYSOCK , in which case a new\n\t      socket is created.  If the socket is not bound to a local UDP\n\t      port, then this routine binds it to an arbitrary port. Upon\n\t      completion, xprt->xp_sock is the transport's socket descriptor,\n\t      and xprt->xp_port is the transport's port number.  This routine\n\t      returns NULL if it fails.\n\n\t      This allows the user to specify the maximun packet size for\n\t      sending and receiving UDP-based RPC messages.\n\n       xdr_accepted_reply(xdrs, ar)\n       XDR *xdrs;\n       struct accepted_reply *ar;\n\n\t      Used for encoding RPC reply messages.
