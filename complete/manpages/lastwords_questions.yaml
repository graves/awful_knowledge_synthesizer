Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       lastwords command\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This prints the last few system calls for processes matching the given\n       name, when they exit. This makes use of a ring buffer so that the\n       impact on the system is minimised.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Catch last few syscalls for dying netscape processes,\n\t      # lastwords netscape\n\nFIELDS\n       TIME   time of syscall return, ns\n\n       PID    process ID\n\n       EXEC   process name (execname)\n\n       SYSCALL\n\t      system call\n\n       RETURN return value for the system call\n\n       ERR    errno for the system call\n\nBASED ON\n       /usr/demo/dtrace/ring.d\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       DTrace Guide \"Buffers and Buffering\" chapter (docs.sun.com)\n\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       lastwords will sample until a command with that name exits.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dtruss(1M), dtrace(1M)"
