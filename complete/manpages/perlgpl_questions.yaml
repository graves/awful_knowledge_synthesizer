It's here so that\n       modules, programs, etc., that want to declare this as their\n       distribution license can link to it.\n\n       For the Perl Artistic License, see perlartistic.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t\t   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t\t    Version 1, February 1989\n\n\t Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\t\t       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\t02110-1301  USA\n\n\t Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\t of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\t\t\t\t   Preamble\n\n\t  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users\n\tat the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public\n\tLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n\tsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\tThe\n\tGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's\n\tsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\n\tYou can use it for your programs, too.\n\n\t  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n\tprice.\tSpecifically, the General Public License is designed to make\n\tsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\n\tsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\n\tthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\n\tprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n\t  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n\tanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n\tThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n\tdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n\t  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\n\tgratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n\tyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n\tsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n\t  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\n\tand (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to\n\tcopy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\n\t  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n\tthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n\tsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\n\twe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\n\tso that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the\n\toriginal authors' reputations.\n\n\t  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\tmodification follow.\n\n\t\t\t   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n\t  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\n\tcontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\n\tdistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\t\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\n\ton the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the\n\tProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.\n\tEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n\t  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n\tsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n\tconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n\tcopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n\tnotices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of\n\tany warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of\n\tthis General Public License along with the Program.  You may charge a\n\tfee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n\t  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n\tof it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of\n\tParagraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n\t    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n\t    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n\t    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n\t    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\n\t    either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge\n\t    to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License\n\t    (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or\n\t    all third parties, at your option).\n\n\t    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n\t    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n\t    interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or\n\t    display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice\n\t    and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you\n\t    provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\n\t    under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of\n\t    this General Public License.\n\n\t    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n\t    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n\t    exchange for a fee.\n\n\tMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\n\tderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not\n\tbring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n\t  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or\n\tderivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form\n\tunder the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do\n\tone of the following:\n\n\t    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n\t    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n\t    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n\t    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n\t    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n\t    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of\n\t    the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n\t    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n\t    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n\t    corresponding source code may be obtained.\t(This alternative is\n\t    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n\t    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n\tSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n\tmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code\n\tmeans all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a\n\tspecial exception, it need not include source code for modules which\n\tare standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the\n\texecutable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files\n\tthat accompany that operating system.\n\n\t  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\n\tProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\n\tAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or\n\ttransfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your\n\trights to use the Program under this License.  However, parties who\n\thave received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this\n\tGeneral Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long\n\tas such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n\t  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work\n\tbased on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to\n\tdo so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n\t  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n\tProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n\toriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n\tthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n\trestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n\t  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n\tversions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new\n\tversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n\tdiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\tEach version is given a distinguishing version number.\tIf the Program\n\tspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any\n\tlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n\tconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n\tthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a\n\tversion number of the license, you may choose any version ever\n\tpublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\t  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n\tprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n\tauthor to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the\n\tFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n\tsometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the\n\ttwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n\tsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t\t   NO WARRANTY\n\n\t  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n\tWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\tEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n\tOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n\tEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n\tWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\tTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS\n\tWITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n\tALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\t  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n\tWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n\tAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n\tFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n\tCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n\tPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n\tRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n\tFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\n\tSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n\tDAMAGES.\n\n\t\t\t    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t       Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n\t  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\tpossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n\tfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\n\tterms.\n\n\t  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n\tto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n\tconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n\tthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\t    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it\n\t    does.>\n\t    Copyright (C) 19yy\t<name of author>\n\n\t    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n\t    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\n\t    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at\n\t    your option) any later version.\n\n\t    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\t    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\t    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n\t    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n\t    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n\t    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n\t    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA\n\t    02110-1301 USA"
