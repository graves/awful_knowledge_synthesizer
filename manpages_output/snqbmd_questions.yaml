The daemon monitors stornext\n       mount points.  When a mount point is determined to have QoS bandwidth\n       management active on the MDC, this daemon will send updates to the fsm\n       via the <mountpt>/.__snfsqos directory.\n\n       snqbmd logs to /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/snqbmd.log for debugging\n       purposes.\n\n       The file /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/snqbmd.verbose can be used to\n       increase logging for snqbmd.  Place a numerical value between 0 and 4\n       in the file to change the debug verbosity.  The default value is 1.\n       The snqbmd daemon must be restarted to make the change effective.  This\n       can be done using the cvadmin restartd command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       This process runs in the background and is started at boot time as part\n       of the stornext startup process."
