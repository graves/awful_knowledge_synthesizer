One or more object identifiers\n       (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each variable\n       name is given in the format specified in variables(5).\n\nOPTIONS\n       -Cf     If -Cf is not specified, some applications (snmpdelta, snmpget,\n\t       snmpgetnext and snmpstatus) will try to fix errors returned by\n\t       the agent that you were talking to and resend the request.  The\n\t       only time this is really useful is if you specified a OID that\n\t       didn't exist in your request and you're using SNMPv1 which\n\t       requires \"all or nothing\" kinds of requests.\n\n       In addition to this option, snmpget takes the common options described\n       in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.  Note that snmpget REQUIRES an argument\n       specifying the agent to query and at least one OID argument, as\n       described there."

  manpageQuestion3: What is the effect of using the -Cf option with snmpget, and how might it be useful in a practical scenario?

The -c and -v options are defined in the\n       snmpcmd(1) manual page. (Note that system.sysUpTime is an incomplete\n       OID, as it needs the .0 index appended to it):\n\n\t   snmpget -v1 -Cf -c public localhost system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0\n\n       This example will return the following:\n\n\t   Error in packet\n\t   Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.\n\t   This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime"
