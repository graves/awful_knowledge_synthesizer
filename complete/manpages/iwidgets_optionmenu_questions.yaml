An option menu displays a frame containing a\n       label and a button.  A pop-up menu will allow for the value of the\n       button to change.\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::optionmenu command creates a new Tcl command whose name\n       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on\n       the widget.  It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n       Many of the widget commands for an optionmenu take as one argument an\n       indicator of which entry of the option menu to operate on.  These\n       indicators are called indexes and may be specified in any of the\n       following forms:\n\n       number\t   Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the\n\t\t   top-most entry of the option menu, 1 to the entry below it,\n\t\t   and so on.\n\n       end\t   Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu.\tIf there are\n\t\t   no entries in the menu then -1 is returned.\n\n       select\t   Returns the numerical index of the currently selected\n\t\t   option menu entry.  If no entries exist in the menu, then\n\t\t   -1 is returned.\n\n       pattern\t   If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then\n\t\t   this form is used.  Pattern is pattern-matched against the\n\t\t   label of each entry in the option menu, in order from the\n\t\t   top down, until a matching entry is found.  The rules of\n\t\t   Tcl_StringMatch are used.\n\n       The following widget commands are possible for optionmenu widgets:"

Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::optionmenu command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::optionmenu command.\n\n       pathName delete first ?last?\n\t      Delete all of the option menu entries between first and last\n\t      inclusive.  If last is omitted then it defaults to first.\n\n       pathName disable index\n\t      Disable the option menu entry specified by index.  Disabling a\n\t      menu item will prevent the user from being able to select this\n\t      item from the menu.  This only effects the state of the item in\n\t      the menu, in other words, should the item be the currently\n\t      selected item, the programmer is responsible for determining\n\t      this condition and taking appropriate action.\n\n       pathName enable index\n\t      Enable the option menu entry specified by index.\tEnabling a\n\t      menu item allows the user to select this item from the menu.\n\n       pathName get ?first? ?last?\n\t      If no arguments are specified, this operation returns the\n\t      currently selected option menu item.  Otherwise, it returns the\n\t      name of the option at index first, or a range of options between\n\t      first and last.\n\n       pathName index index\n\t      Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.\n\n       pathName insert index string ?string?\n\t      Insert an item, or list of items, into the menu at location\n\t      index.\n\n       pathName select index\n\t      Select an item from the option menu to be displayed as the\n\t      currently selected item.\n\n       pathName sort mode\n\t      Sort the current menu in either ascending, or descending order.\n\t      The values increasing, or decreasing are also accepted."
