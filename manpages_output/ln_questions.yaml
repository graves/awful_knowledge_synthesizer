The target_file will be created with the\n     same file modes as the source_file.  It is useful for maintaining\n     multiple copies of a file in many places at once without using up storage\n     for the “copies”; instead, a link “points” to the original copy.  There\n     are two types of links; hard links and symbolic links.  How a link\n     “points” to a file is one of the differences between a hard and symbolic\n     link.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -F    If the target file already exists and is a directory, then remove\n\t   it so that the link may occur.  The -F option should be used with\n\t   either -f or -i options.  If neither -f nor -i is specified, -f is\n\t   implied.  The -F option is a no-op unless -s is specified."

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ln`.



    Manpage text:

    -s    Create a symbolic link.

         -v    Cause ln to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.

         -w    Warn if the source of a symbolic link does not currently exist.

         By default, ln makes hard links.  A hard link to a file is
         indistinguishable from the original directory entry; any changes to a
         file are effectively independent of the name used to reference the file.
         Directories may not be hardlinked, and hard links may not span file
         systems.

         A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The
         referenced file is used when an open(2) operation is performed on the
         link.  A stat(2) on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an
         lstat(2) must be done to obtain information about the link.  The
         readlink(2) call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.
         Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories.

         Given one or two arguments, ln creates a link to an existing file
         source_file.  If target_file is given, the link has that name;
         target_file may also be a directory in which to place the link; otherwise
         it is placed in the current directory.  If only the directory is
         specified, the link will be made to the last component of source_file.

The links made will have the same name as the files\n     being linked to.\n\n     When the utility is called as link, exactly two arguments must be\n     supplied, neither of which may specify a directory.  No options may be\n     supplied in this simple mode of operation, which performs a link(2)\n     operation using the two passed arguments.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Create a symbolic link named /home/src and point it to /usr/src:\n\n\t   # ln -s /usr/src /home/src\n\n     Hard link /usr/local/bin/fooprog to file /usr/local/bin/fooprog-1.0:\n\n\t   # ln /usr/local/bin/fooprog-1.0 /usr/local/bin/fooprog\n\n     As an exercise, try the following commands:\n\n\t   # ls -i /bin/[\n\t   11553 /bin/[\n\t   # ls -i /bin/test\n\t   11553 /bin/test\n\n     Note that both files have the same inode; that is, /bin/[ is essentially\n     an alias for the test(1) command.\tThis hard link exists so test(1) may\n     be invoked from shell scripts, for example, using the if [ ] construct."
