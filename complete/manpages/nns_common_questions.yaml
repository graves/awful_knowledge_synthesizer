It provides the\n       commands of the name service facility which are shared by the client\n       and server implemented by the packages nameserv::server and nameserv\n       (the client).\n\n       This service is built in top of and for the package comm.  It has\n       nothing to do with the Internet's Domain Name System. If the reader is\n       looking for a package dealing with that please see Tcllib's packages\n       dns and resolv.\n\nAPI\n       The package exports a single command, as specified below:\n\n       ::nameserv::common::port\n\t      The result returned by the command is the id of the default\n\t      TCP/IP port a nameservice server will listen on, and a name\n\t      service client will try to connect to.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category nameserv\n       of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       nameserv::client(n), nameserv::server(n)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       client, name service, server\n\nCATEGORY\n       Networking\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007-2008 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
