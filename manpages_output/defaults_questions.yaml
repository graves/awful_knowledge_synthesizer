    Manpage text:

    Note: Since applications do access the defaults system while they're
         running, you shouldn't modify the defaults of a running application. If
         you change a default in a domain that belongs to a running application,
         the application won't see the change and might even overwrite the
         default.

         User defaults belong to domains, which typically correspond to individual
         applications. Each domain has a dictionary of keys and values
         representing its defaults; for example, "Default Font" = "Helvetica".
         Keys are always strings, but values can be complex data structures
         comprising arrays, dictionaries, strings, and binary data. These data
         structures are stored as XML Property Lists.

         Though all applications, system services, and other programs have their
         own domains, they also share a domain named NSGlobalDomain.  If a default
         isn't specified in the application's domain, but is specified in
         NSGlobalDomain, then the application uses the value in that domain.
