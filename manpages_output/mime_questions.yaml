(-file name | -string value\n       | -part {token1 ... tokenN})\n\t      This command creates a MIME part and returns a token\n\t      representing it.\n\n\t      •      If the -canonical option is present, then the body is in\n\t\t     canonical (raw) form and is found by consulting either\n\t\t     the -file, -string, or -part option.\n\n\t\t     In addition, both the -param and -header options may\n\t\t     occur zero or more times to specify Content-Type\n\t\t     parameters (e.g., charset) and header keyword/values\n\t\t     (e.g., Content-Disposition), respectively.\n\n\t\t     Also, -encoding, if present, specifies the Content-\n\t\t     Transfer-Encoding when copying the body.\n\n\t      •      If the -canonical option is not present, then the MIME\n\t\t     part contained in either the -file or the -string option\n\t\t     is parsed, dynamically generating subordinates as\n\t\t     appropriate.\n\n       ::mime::finalize token ?-subordinates all | dynamic | none?\n\t      This command destroys the MIME part represented by token. It\n\t      returns an empty string.\n\n\t      If the -subordinates option is present, it specifies which\n\t      subordinates should also be destroyed. The default value is\n\t      dynamic, destroying all subordinates which were created by\n\t      ::mime::initialize together with the containing body part.\n\n       ::mime::getproperty token ?property | -names?\n\t      This command returns a string or a list of strings containing\n\t      the properties of a MIME part. If the command is invoked with\n\t      the name of a specific property, then the corresponding value is\n\t      returned; instead, if -names is specified, a list of all\n\t      properties is returned; otherwise, a serialized array of\n\t      properties and values is returned.\n\n\t      The possible properties are:\n\n\t      content\n\t\t     The type/subtype describing the content\n\n\t      encoding\n\t\t     The \"Content-Transfer-Encoding\"\n\n\t      params A list of \"Content-Type\" parameters\n\n\t      parts  A list of tokens for the part's subordinates.  This\n\t\t     property is present only if the MIME part has\n\t\t     subordinates.\n\n\t      size   The approximate size of the content (unencoded)\n\n       ::mime::getheader token ?key | -names?\n\t      This command returns the header of a MIME part, as a list of\n\t      strings.\n\n\t      A header consists of zero or more key/value pairs. Each value is\n\t      a list containing one or more strings.\n\n\t      If this command is invoked with the name of a specific key, then\n\t      a list containing the corresponding value(s) is returned;\n\t      instead, if -names is specified, a list of all keys is returned;\n\t      otherwise, a serialized array of keys and values is returned.\n\t      Note that when a key is specified (e.g., \"Subject\"), the list\n\t      returned usually contains exactly one string; however, some keys\n\t      (e.g., \"Received\") often occur more than once in the header,\n\t      accordingly the list returned usually contains more than one\n\t      string.\n\n       ::mime::setheader token key value ?-mode write | append | delete?\n\t      This command writes, appends to, or deletes the value associated\n\t      with a key in the header. It returns a list of strings\n\t      containing the previous value associated with the key.\n\n\t      The value for -mode is one of:\n\n\t      write  The key/value is either created or overwritten (the\n\t\t     default).\n\n\t      append A new value is appended for the key (creating it as\n\t\t     necessary).\n\n\t      delete All values associated with the key are removed (the value\n\t\t     parameter is ignored).\n\n       ::mime::getbody token ?-decode? ?-command callback ?-blocksize octets??\n\t      This command returns a string containing the body of the leaf\n\t      MIME part represented by token in canonical form.\n\n\t      If the -command option is present, then it is repeatedly invoked\n\t      with a fragment of the body as this:\n\n\t\tuplevel #0 $callback [list \"data\" $fragment]"

This means that it will be in the charset\n\t      specified for the token and not the usual utf-8.\tIf the option\n\t      -decode is present however the command will use the charset\n\t      information associated with the token to convert the string from\n\t      its encoding into utf-8 before returning it.\n\n       ::mime::copymessage token channel\n\t      This command copies the MIME represented by token part to the\n\t      specified channel. The command operates synchronously, and uses\n\t      fileevent to allow asynchronous operations to proceed\n\t      independently. It returns an empty string.\n\n       ::mime::buildmessage token\n\t      This command returns the MIME part represented by token as a\n\t      string.  It is similar to ::mime::copymessage, only it returns\n\t      the data as a return string instead of writing to a channel.\n\n       ::mime::parseaddress string\n\t      This command takes a string containing one or more 822-style\n\t      address specifications and returns a list of serialized arrays,\n\t      one element for each address specified in the argument. If the\n\t      string contains more than one address they will be separated by\n\t      commas.\n\n\t      Each serialized array contains the properties below.

This is only done for encodings whose\n\t      charset types were known.  The remaining encodings return \"\" for\n\t      now.\n\n       ::mime::reversemapencoding charset_type\n\t      This command maps MIME charset types onto tcl encoding names.\n\t      Those that are unknown return \"\".\n\nKNOWN BUGS\n       SourceForge Tcllib Bug #447037\n\t      This problem affects only people which are using Tcl and Mime on\n\t      a 64-bit system. The currently recommended fix for this problem\n\t      is to upgrade to Tcl version 8.4. This version has extended 64\n\t      bit support and the bug does not appear anymore.\n\n\t      The problem could have been generally solved by requiring the\n\t      use of Tcl 8.4 for this package. We decided against this\n\t      solution as it would force a large number of unaffected users to\n\t      upgrade their Tcl interpreter for no reason.\n\n\t      See\n\t      http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=447037&group_id=12883&atid=112883\n\t      for additional information.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category mime of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
