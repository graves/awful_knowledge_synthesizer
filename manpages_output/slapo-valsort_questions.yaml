The\n       sorting occurs whenever the attributes are returned in a search\n       response.\n\n       Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending order, using either\n       numeric or alphanumeric sort methods. Additionally, a \"weighted\" sort\n       can be specified, which uses a numeric weight prepended to the\n       attribute values.  The weighted sort is always performed in ascending\n       order, but may be combined with the other methods for values that all\n       have equal weights. The weight is specified by prepending an integer\n       weight {<weight>} in front of each value of the attribute for which\n       weighted sorting is desired. This weighting factor is stripped off and\n       never returned in search results."

They\n       should appear after the overlay directive.\n\n       valsort-attr <attribute> <baseDN> (<sort-method> | weighted [<sort-\n       method>])\n\t      Configure a sorting method for the specified attribute in the\n\t      subtree rooted at baseDN.  The sort-method may be one of\n\t      alpha-ascend, alpha-descend, numeric-ascend, or numeric-descend.\n\t      If the special weighted method is specified, a secondary\n\t      sort-method may also be specified. It is an error to specify an\n\t      alphanumeric sort-method for an attribute with Integer or\n\t      NumericString syntax, and it is an error to specify a numeric\n\t      sort-method for an attribute with a syntax other than Integer or\n\t      NumericString.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\t    database bdb\n\t    suffix dc=example,dc=com\n\t    ...\n\t    overlay valsort\n\t    valsort-attr member ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com alpha-ascend\n\n\nFILES\n       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf\n\t      default slapd configuration file\n\nSEE ALSO\n       slapd.conf(5), slapd-config(5).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n       This module was written in 2005 by Howard Chu of Symas Corporation.
