As with Alpine, commands are displayed at the\n       bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is provided.  As\n       characters are typed they are immediately inserted into the text.\n\n       Editing commands are entered using control-key combinations.  As a\n       work-around for communications programs that swallow certain control\n       characters, you can emulate a control key by pressing ESCAPE twice,\n       followed by the desired control character, e.g. \"ESC ESC c\" would be\n       equivalent to entering a ctrl-c.  The editor has five basic features:\n       paragraph justification, searching, block cut/paste, a spelling\n       checker, and a file browser.\n\n       Paragraph justification (or filling) takes place in the paragraph that\n       contains the cursor, or, if the cursor is between lines, in the\n       paragraph immediately below.  Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines,\n       or by lines beginning with a space or tab.  Unjustification can be done\n       immediately after justification using the control-U key combination."

    Manpage text:

    String searches are not sensitive to case.  A search begins at the
           current cursor position and wraps around the end of the text.  The most
           recent search string is offered as the default in subsequent searches.

           Blocks of text can be moved, copied or deleted with creative use of the
           command for mark (ctrl-^), delete (ctrl-k) and undelete (ctrl-u).  The
           delete command will remove text between the "mark" and the current
           cursor position, and place it in the "cut" buffer.  The undelete
           command effects a "paste" at the current cursor position.

           The spell checker examines all words in the text.  It then offers, in
           turn, each misspelled word for correction while highlighting it in the
           text.  Spell checking can be cancelled at any time.  Alternatively,
           pico will substitute for the default spell checking routine a routine
           defined by the SPELL environment variable.  The replacement routine
           should read standard input and write standard output.

    Color Support
           If your terminal supports colors, Pico can be configured to color text.
           Users can configure the color of the text, the text in the key menu,
           the titlebar, messages and prompt in the status line. As an added
           feature Pico can also be used to configure the color of up to three
           different levels of quoted text, and the signature of an email message.
           This is useful when Pico is used as a tool (with the -t command line
           switch.)

           Pico can tell you the number of colors that your terminal supports,
           when started with the switch -color_codes. In addition Pico will print
           a table showing the numerical code of every color supported in that
           terminal. In order to configure colors, one must use these numerical
           codes. For example, 0 is for black, so in order to configure a black
           color, one must use its code, the number 0.

           In order to activate colors, one must use the option -ncolors with a
           numerical value indicating the number of colors that your terminal
           supports, for example, -ncolors 256 indicates that the user wishes to
           use a table of 256 colors.
