If one or more DN arguments are provided, entries\n       with those Distinguished Names are deleted.  Each DN should be provided\n       using the LDAPv3 string representation as defined in RFC 4514.  If no\n       DN arguments are provided, a list of DNs is read from standard input\n       (or from file if the -f flag is used)."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use ldapdelete to delete an entry with the DN 'cn=John Doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' without binding to the server?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using ldapdelete with a file containing multiple DNs to delete entries from an LDAP server?
