The\n\t      result is either the root of the tree (for the start\n\t      expression), or a definition node.\n\n       ::page::util::peg::symbolOf tree node\n\t      As ::page::util::peg::symbolNodeOf, but returns the symbol name\n\t      instead of the node.\n\n       ::page::util::peg::updateUndefinedDueRemoval tree\n\t      The removal of nodes in the AST tree can cause symbols to lose\n\t      one or more users.\n\n\t\t   A used by B and C,\n\t\t   B is reachable,\n\t\t   C is not,\n\n\t\t   so A now loses the node in the expression for C calling it,\n\t\t   or rather, not calling it anymore.\n\n\t      This command updates the cross-references and which nonterminals\n\t      are now undefined.\n\n       ::page::util::peg::flatten treequery tree\n\t      This commands flattens nested sequence and choice operators in\n\t      the AST tree, re-using the treeql object treequery to run the\n\t      query determining which nodes to cut.\n\n       ::page::util::peg::getWarnings tree\n\t      This command looks at the attributes of the AST tree for\n\t      problems with the grammar and issues warnings. They do not\n\t      prevent us from writing the grammar, but still represent\n\t      problems with it the user should be made aware of.\n\n\t      The result of the command is a dictionary mapping nonterminal\n\t      names to their associated warnings.\n\n       ::page::util::peg::printWarnings msg\n\t      The argument of the command is a dictionary mapping nonterminal\n\t      names to their associated warnings, as generated by, for\n\t      example, the command ::page::util::peg::getWarnings.\n\n\t      The warnings contained therein are formatted and then printed\n\t      via the log command page_info. This means that this command can\n\t      be used only from within a plugin managed by the package\n\t      page::pluginmgr.\n\n       ::page::util::peg::peOf tree eroot\n\t      This command converts the parsing expression starting at the\n\t      node eroot in the AST tree into a nested list. The exact syntax\n\t      of this list specified by the package grammar::peg.\n\n       ::page::util::peg::printTclExpr pe\n\t      This command converts the parsing expression contained in the\n\t      nested list pe into a Tcl string which can be placed into a Tcl\n\t      script.  See the package grammar::peg for the exact syntax of\n\t      pe.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.\n       Please report such in the category page of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       PEG, page, parser generator, parsing expression grammar, text\n       processing, transformation\n\nCATEGORY\n       Page Parser Generator\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
