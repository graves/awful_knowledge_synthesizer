If the user\n     has opted-in for automatic reporting of diagnostic and usage information,\n     then SubmitDiagInfo collects and sends to Apple any recent diagnostic\n     information which has not yet been sent to Apple.\tSubmitDiagInfo also\n     cleans up any diagnostic and usage information which was created more\n     than one month ago and is no longer needed.\n\n     Sending diagnostic and usage reports to Apple helps us improve the\n     quality and performance of our products and services.  It helps Apple\n     identify common usage trends and issues that enable us to allocate our\n     resources efficiently, and it helps us provide better support services to\n     you and other customers.  All of the diagnostic and usage information is\n     collected anonymously from your computer in a way that does not\n     personally identify you.  Reports may include the following information:"

A user is offered the opportunity\n     to opt-in for automatic collection of additional diagnostic and usage\n     information after the user has manually sent a crash, hang or panic\n     report to Apple.  Users may at any time opt in or out of automatic\n     reporting in the Security & Privacy pane of the System Preferences\n     application under the \"Privacy\" tab.\n\n     All diagnostic and usage information which is eligible for automatic\n     reporting is visible in the Console application under the \"DIAGNOSTIC AND\n     USAGE INFORMATION\" heading in the application's sidebar.  (The\n     information appears here even if a user has not yet opted-in for\n     automatic reporting.)  For security purposes, some system diagnostic\n     information will only be visible to admin users and will only be\n     submitted when an admin user is logged in."
