    NAME
           perlport - Writing portable Perl

    DESCRIPTION
           Perl runs on numerous operating systems.  While most of them share much
           in common, they also have their own unique features.

           This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes
           portable Perl code.  That way once you make a decision to write
           portably, you know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within
           them.

           There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular
           type of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.
           Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the
           common factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller area
           of common ground in which you can operate to accomplish a particular
           task.  Thus, when you begin attacking a problem, it is important to
           consider under which part of the tradeoff curve you want to operate.
           Specifically, you must decide whether it is important that the task
           that you are coding has the full generality of being portable, or
           whether to just get the job done right now.  This is the hardest choice
           to be made.  The rest is easy, because Perl provides many choices,
           whichever way you want to approach your problem.

    Manpage text:

    Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done using a
           whole range of platforms, think about writing portable code.  That way,
           you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation choices you can
           avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give your users lots of
           platform choices.  On the other hand, when you have to take advantage
           of some unique feature of a particular platform, as is often the case
           with systems programming (whether for Unix, Windows, VMS, etc.),
           consider writing platform-specific code.

           When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you may
           need to consider only the differences of those particular systems.  The
           important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be
           deliberate in your decision.

           The material below is separated into three main sections: main issues
           of portability ("ISSUES"), platform-specific issues ("PLATFORMS"), and
           built-in Perl functions that behave differently on various ports
           ("FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS").

    This information should not be considered complete; it includes
           possibly transient information about idiosyncrasies of some of the
           ports, almost all of which are in a state of constant evolution.  Thus,
           this material should be considered a perpetual work in progress ("<IMG
           SRC="yellow_sign.gif" ALT="Under Construction">").

    ISSUES
       Newlines
           In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by newlines.
           Just what is used as a newline may vary from OS to OS.  Unix
           traditionally uses "\012", one type of DOSish I/O uses "\015\012",
           Mac OS uses "\015", and z/OS uses "\025".

           Perl uses "\n" to represent the "logical" newline, where what is
           logical may depend on the platform in use.  In MacPerl, "\n" always
           means "\015".  On EBCDIC platforms, "\n" could be "\025" or "\045".  In
           DOSish perls, "\n" usually means "\012", but when accessing a file in
           "text" mode, perl uses the ":crlf" layer that translates it to (or
           from) "\015\012", depending on whether you're reading or writing. Unix
           does the same thing on ttys in canonical mode.  "\015\012" is commonly
           referred to as CRLF.

    Manpage text:

    To trim trailing newlines from text lines use "chomp".  With default
           settings that function looks for a trailing "\n" character and thus
           trims in a portable way.

           When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be sure
           to explicitly set $/ to the appropriate value for your file format
           before using "chomp".

           Because of the "text" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations
           in using "seek" and "tell" on a file accessed in "text" mode.  Stick to
           "seek"-ing to locations you got from "tell" (and no others), and you
           are usually free to use "seek" and "tell" even in "text" mode.  Using
           "seek" or "tell" or other file operations may be non-portable.  If you
           use "binmode" on a file, however, you can usually "seek" and "tell"
           with arbitrary values safely.

           A common misconception in socket programming is that "\n eq \012"
           everywhere.  When using protocols such as common Internet protocols,
           "\012" and "\015" are called for specifically, and the values of the
           logical "\n" and "\r" (carriage return) are not reliable.

    Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
           Windows, Mac OS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, RISC OS, and probably others.  Unix,
           for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea of a
           single root directory.

           DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with "/" as
           path separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as having
           several root directories and various "unrooted" device files such NIL:
           and LPT:).

           Mac OS 9 and earlier used ":" as a path separator instead of "/".

           The filesystem may support neither hard links ("link") nor symbolic
           links ("symlink", "readlink", "lstat").

           The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change
           timestamp (meaning that about the only portable timestamp is the
           modification timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps
           (e.g. the FAT filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).

           The "inode change timestamp" (the "-C" filetest) may really be the

       System Interaction
           Not all platforms provide a command line.  These are usually platforms
           that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user
           interaction.  A program requiring a command line interface might not
           work everywhere.  This is probably for the user of the program to deal
           with, so don't stay up late worrying about it.

           Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the system,
           this limitation may also apply to changing filesystem metainformation
           like file permissions or owners.  Remember to "close" files when you
           are done with them.  Don't "unlink" or "rename" an open file.  Don't
           "tie" or "open" a file already tied or opened; "untie" or "close" it
           first.

Some, however, unfortunately do\n       not.  Thus the notion of user id, or \"home\" directory, or even the\n       state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many platforms.  If\n       you write programs that are security-conscious, it is usually best to\n       know what type of system you will be running under so that you can\n       write code explicitly for that platform (or class of platforms)."

    CPAN Testers
           Modules uploaded to CPAN are tested by a variety of volunteers on
           different platforms.  These CPAN testers are notified by mail of each
           new upload, and reply to the list with PASS, FAIL, NA (not applicable
           to this platform), or UNKNOWN (unknown), along with any relevant
           notations.

           The purpose of the testing is twofold: one, to help developers fix any
           problems in their code that crop up because of lack of testing on other
           platforms; two, to provide users with information about whether a given
           module works on a given platform.

    PLATFORMS
           Perl is built with a $^O variable that indicates the operating system
           it was built on.  This was implemented to help speed up code that would
           otherwise have to "use Config" and use the value of $Config{osname}.
           Of course, to get more detailed information about the system, looking
           into %Config is certainly recommended.

    Manpage text:

    The DOS FAT filesystem can accommodate only "8.3" style filenames.
           Under the "case-insensitive, but case-preserving" HPFS (OS/2) and NTFS
           (NT) filesystems you may have to be careful about case returned with
           functions like "readdir" or used with functions like "open" or
           "opendir".

           DOS also treats several filenames as special, such as AUX, PRN, NUL,
           CON, COM1, LPT1, LPT2, etc.  Unfortunately, sometimes these filenames
           won't even work if you include an explicit directory prefix.  It is
           best to avoid such filenames, if you want your code to be portable to
           DOS and its derivatives.  It's hard to know what these all are,
           unfortunately.

           Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of scripts
           such as pl2bat.bat to put wrappers around your scripts.

           Newline ("\n") is translated as "\015\012" by the I/O system when
           reading from and writing to files (see "Newlines").
           "binmode($filehandle)" will keep "\n" translated as "\012" for that
           filehandle.  "binmode" should always be used for code that deals with
           binary data.  That's assuming you realize in advance that your data is
           in binary.  General-purpose programs should often assume nothing about
           their data.
