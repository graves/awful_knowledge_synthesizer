    Manpage text:

    The inet_pton() function converts a presentation format address (that is,
         printable form as held in a character string) to network format (usually
         a struct in_addr or some other internal binary representation, in network
         byte order).  It returns 1 if the address was valid for the specified
         address family, or 0 if the address was not parseable in the specified
         address family, or -1 if some system error occurred (in which case errno
         will have been set).  This function is presently valid for AF_INET and
         AF_INET6.

         The inet_aton() routine interprets the specified character string as an
         Internet address, placing the address into the structure provided.  It
         returns 1 if the string was successfully interpreted, or 0 if the string
         is invalid.  The inet_addr() and inet_network() functions return numbers
         suitable for use as Internet addresses and Internet network numbers,
         respectively.

         The function inet_ntop() converts an address *src from network format
         (usually a struct in_addr or some other binary form, in network byte
         order) to presentation format (suitable for external display purposes).
         The size argument specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer *dst.
         INET_ADDRSTRLEN and INET6_ADDRSTRLEN define the maximum size required to
         convert an address of the respective type.  It returns NULL if a system
         error occurs (in which case, errno will have been set), or it returns a
         pointer to the destination string.  This function is presently valid for
         AF_INET and AF_INET6.

    Manpage text:

    When a three part address is specified, the last part is interpreted as a
         16-bit quantity and placed in the right-most two bytes of the network
         address.  This makes the three part address format convenient for
         specifying Class B network addresses as “128.net.host”.

         When a two part address is supplied, the last part is interpreted as a
         24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three bytes of the network
         address.  This makes the two part address format convenient for
         specifying Class A network addresses as “net.host”.

         When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in the network
         address without any byte rearrangement.

         All numbers supplied as “parts” in a ‘.’ notation may be decimal, octal,
         or hexadecimal, as specified in the C language (i.e., a leading 0x or 0X
         implies hexadecimal; otherwise, a leading 0 implies octal; otherwise, the
         number is interpreted as decimal).

    DIAGNOSTICS
         The constant INADDR_NONE is returned by inet_addr() and inet_network()
         for malformed requests.
