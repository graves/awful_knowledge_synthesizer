It allows\n     ruleset and parameter configuration and retrieval of status information\n     from the packet filter.\n\n     Packet filtering restricts the types of packets that pass through network\n     interfaces entering or leaving the host based on filter rules as\n     described in pf.conf(5).  The packet filter can also replace addresses\n     and ports of packets.  Replacing source addresses and ports of outgoing\n     packets is called NAT (Network Address Translation) and is used to\n     connect an internal network (usually reserved address space) to an\n     external one (the Internet) by making all connections to external hosts\n     appear to come from the gateway.  Replacing destination addresses and\n     ports of incoming packets is used to redirect connections to different\n     hosts and/or ports.  A combination of both translations, bidirectional\n     NAT, is also supported.  Translation rules are described in pf.conf(5)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pfctl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe packet filter does not itself forward packets between interfaces.\n     Forwarding can be enabled by setting the sysctl(8) variables\n     net.inet.ip.forwarding and/or net.inet6.ip6.forwarding to 1.  Set them\n     permanently in sysctl.conf(5).\n\n     The pfctl utility provides several commands.  The options are as follows:\n\n     -A      Load only the queue rules present in the rule file.  Other rules\n\t     and options are ignored.\n\n     -a anchor\n\t     Apply flags -f, -F, and -s only to the rules in the specified\n\t     anchor.  In addition to the main ruleset, pfctl can load and\n\t     manipulate additional rulesets by name, called anchors.  The main\n\t     ruleset is the default anchor.\n\n\t     Anchors are referenced by name and may be nested, with the\n\t     various components of the anchor path separated by ‘/’\n\t     characters, similar to how file system hierarchies are laid out.\n\t     The last component of the anchor path is where ruleset operations\n\t     are performed.\n\n\t     Evaluation of anchor rules from the main ruleset is described in\n\t     pf.conf(5)."
