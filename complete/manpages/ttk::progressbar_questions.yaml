[-length length] Specifies the length\n       of the long axis of the progress bar (width if horizontal, height if\n       vertical).  [-mode mode] One of determinate or indeterminate.\n       [-maximum maximum] A floating point number specifying the maximum\n       -value.\tDefaults to 100.  [-value value] The current value of the\n       progress bar.  In determinate mode, this represents the amount of work\n       completed.  In indeterminate mode, it is interpreted modulo -maximum;\n       that is, the progress bar completes one “cycle” when the -value\n       increases by -maximum.  [-variable variable] The name of a Tcl variable\n       which is linked to the -value.  If specified, the -value of the\n       progress bar is automatically set to the value of the variable whenever\n       the latter is modified.\t[-phase phase] Read-only option.  The widget\n       periodically increments the value of this option whenever the -value is\n       greater than 0 and, in determinate mode, less than -maximum.  This\n       option may be used by the current theme to provide additional animation\n       effects."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the ttk::progressbar widget?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you create a horizontal progress bar in determinate mode with a maximum value of 100 and an initial value of 50?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the ttk::progressbar widget to create an indeterminate mode progress bar that is vertically oriented with a length of 200 pixels?
