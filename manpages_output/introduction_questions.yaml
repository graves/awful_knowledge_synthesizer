Markup is represented by Tcl commands.  Beginners\n\t      should start with the doctoc language introduction.  The formal\n\t      specification is split over two documents, one dealing with the\n\t      doctoc language syntax, the other a doctoc language command\n\t      reference.\n\n       [2]    A set of packages for the programmatic manipulation of tables of\n\t      contents in memory, and their conversion between various\n\t      formats, reading and writing. The aforementioned markup language\n\t      is one of the formats which can be both read from and written\n\t      to.\n\n       [3]    The system for the conversion of tables of contents is based on\n\t      a plugin mechanism, for this we have two APIs describing the\n\t      interface between the packages above and the import/export\n\t      plugins.\n\n       Which of the more detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this\n       introduction depends on their role in the documentation process.\n\n       [1]    A writer of documentation has to understand the markup language\n\t      itself. A beginner to doctoc should read the more informally\n\t      written doctoc language introduction first. Having digested this\n\t      the formal doctoc language syntax specification should become\n\t      understandable. A writer experienced with doctoc may only need\n\t      the doctoc language command reference from time to time to\n\t      refresh her memory.\n\n\t      While a document is written the dtp application can be used to\n\t      validate it, and after completion it also performs the\n\t      conversion into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff,\n\t      HTML, plain text, wiki, etc. The simpler dtplite application\n\t      makes internal use of doctoc when handling directories of\n\t      documentation, automatically generating a proper table of\n\t      contents for them.\n\n       [2]    A processor of documentation written in the doctoc markup\n\t      language has to know which tools are available for use.\n\n\t      The main tool is the aforementioned dtp application provided by\n\t      Tcllib. The simpler dtplite does not expose doctoc to the user.\n\t      At the bottom level, common to both applications, however we\n\t      find the three packages providing the basic facilities to handle\n\t      tables of contents, i.e. import from textual formats,\n\t      programmatic manipulation in memory, and export to textual\n\t      formats. These are\n\n\t      doctoools::toc\n\t\t     Programmatic manipulation of tables of contents in\n\t\t     memory.\n\n\t      doctoools::toc::import\n\t\t     Import of tables of contents from various textual\n\t\t     formats. The set of supported formats is extensible\n\t\t     through plugin packages.\n\n\t      doctoools::toc::export\n\t\t     Export of tables of contents to various textual formats.\n\t\t     The set of supported formats is extensible through plugin\n\t\t     packages.\n       See also section Package Overview for an overview of the dependencies\n       between these and other, supporting packages.\n\n       [3]    At last, but not least, plugin writers have to understand the\n\t      interaction between the import and export packages and their\n\t      plugins.\tThese APIs are described in the documentation for the\n\t      two relevant packages, i.e.\n\n\t      •      doctoools::toc::import\n\n\t      •      doctoools::toc::export\n\nRELATED FORMATS\n       The doctoc format does not stand alone, it has two companion formats.\n       These are called docidx and doctools, and they are intended for the\n       markup of keyword indices, and of general documentation, respectively.\n       They are described in their own sets of documents, starting at the\n       DocTools - Keyword Indices and the DocTools - General, respectively.\n\nPACKAGE OVERVIEW\n\n\t\t\t\t\t   ~~~~~~~~~~~ doctools::toc ~~~~~~~~~~~\n\t\t\t\t\t  ~~\t\t       |\t       ~~\n\t\t       doctools::toc::export ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ doctools::toc::import\n\t\t\t       |\t\t\t       |\t\t       |\n\t       +---------------+-------------------------+     |    +------------------+---------------+-----------------------+---------------+\n\t       |\t       |\t\t\t |     |    |\t\t       |\t       |\t\t       |\t       |\n       doctools::config        =\t\t\t |     |    |\t\t       =       doctools::include       doctools::config doctools::paths\n\t\t\t       |\t\t\t |     |    |\t\t       |\n\t\t       doctools::toc::export::<*>\t |     |    |\t       doctools::toc::import::<*>\n\t\t\t       doctoc\t\t\t |     |    |\t\t       doctoc, json\n\t\t\t       json\t\t\t |     |    |\t\t       |\t   \\\\\n\t\t\t       html\t\t\t |     |    |\t       doctools::toc::parse \\\\\n\t\t\t       nroff\t\t\t |     |    |\t\t       |\t     \\\\\n\t\t\t       wiki\t\t\t |     |    |  +---------------+\t      json\n\t\t\t       text\t\t\t |     |    |  |\t       |\n\t\t\t\t\t\t       doctools::toc::structure        |\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       |\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       +-------+---------------+\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       |\t\t       |\n\t\t doctools::html  doctools::html::cssdefaults\t       doctools::tcl::parse    doctools::msgcat\n\t\t       |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       |\n\t\t doctools::text  doctools::nroff::man_macros\t\t\t\t\t       =\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       |\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       doctools::msgcat::toc::<*>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       c, en, de, fr\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       (fr == en for now)\n\t       ~~      Interoperable objects, without actual package dependencies\n\t       --      Package dependency, higher requires lower package\n\t       =       Dynamic dependency through plugin system\n\t       <*>     Multiple packages following the given form of naming."
