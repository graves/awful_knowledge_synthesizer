It is normally used in the script /etc/rc during\n     automatic reboot.\tHere fsck reads the filesystem descriptor table (using\n     getfsent(3)) to determine which filesystems to check.  Only partitions\n     that have ``rw,'' ``rq'' or ``ro'' as options, and that have non-zero\n     pass number are checked.  Filesystems with pass number 1 (normally just\n     the root filesystem) are checked one at a time.  When pass 1 completes,\n     all remaining filesystems are checked, running one process per disk\n     drive.  The disk drive containing each filesystem is inferred from the\n     shortest prefix of the device name that ends in one or more digits; the\n     remaining characters are assumed to be the partition designator.  In\n     preening mode, filesystems that are marked clean are skipped.\n     Filesystems are marked clean when they are unmounted, when they have been\n     mounted read-only, or when fsck runs on them successfully."

    Manpage text:

    It should be noted that fsck is now essentially a wrapper that invokes
         other fsck_XXX utilities as needed.  Currently, fsck can invoke fsck_hfs,
         fsck_apfs, fsck_msdos, fsck_exfat, and fsck_udf.  If this underlying
         process that fsck invokes encounters serious inconsistencies or the
         filesystem type is not one of the above, it exits with an abnormal return
         status and an automatic reboot will then fail.  For each corrected
         inconsistency one or more lines will be printed identifying the
         filesystem on which the correction will take place, and the nature of the
         correction.

         If sent a QUIT signal, fsck will finish the filesystem checks, then exit
         with an abnormal return status that causes an automatic reboot to fail.
         This is useful when you want to finish the filesystem checks during an
         automatic reboot, but do not want the machine to come up multiuser after
         the checks complete.

         Without the -p option, fsck audits and interactively repairs inconsistent
         conditions for filesystems.  It should be noted that some of the
         corrective actions which are not correctable under the -p option will
         result in some loss of data.  The amount and severity of data lost may be
         determined from the diagnostic output.  If the operator does not have
         write permission on the filesystem fsck will default to a -n action.
