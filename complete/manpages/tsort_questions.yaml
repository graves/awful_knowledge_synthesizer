Input is taken from the named file, or from standard\n     input if no file is given.\n\n     There must be an even number of nodes in the input.  Node names specified\n     on the same line should be white space separated.\n\n     Presence of a node in a graph can be represented by an arc from the node\n     to itself.  This is useful when a node is not connected to any other\n     nodes.\n\n     If the graph contains a cycle (and therefore cannot be properly sorted),\n     one of the arcs in the cycle is ignored and the sort continues.  Cycles\n     are reported on standard error.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -d      Turn on debugging.\n\n     -l      Search for and display the longest cycle.\tCan take a very long\n\t     time."

This is\n\t     primarily intended for building libraries, where optimal ordering\n\t     is not critical, and cycles occur often.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Assuming a file named dag with the following contents representing a\n     directed acyclic graph:\n\n\t   A B\n\t   A F\n\t   B C\n\t   B D\n\t   D E\n\n     Sort the nodes of the graph:\n\n\t   $ tsort dag\n\t   A\n\t   F\n\t   B\n\t   D\n\t   C\n\t   E\n\n     White spaces and new line characters are considered equal.  This file for\n     example is considered equal to the one we defined before:\n\n\t   $ cat dga\n\t   A B A F B C B D D E\n\n     Assume we add a new directed arc from D to A creating a cycle:\n\n\t   A B\n\t   A F\n\t   B C\n\t   B D\n\t   D E\n\t   D A\n\n     Ordering the graph detects the cycle:\n\n\t   $ tsort dag\n\t   tsort: cycle in data\n\t   tsort: A\n\t   tsort: B\n\t   tsort: D\n\t   D\n\t   E\n\t   A\n\t   F\n\t   B\n\t   C\n\n     Same as above but silencing the warning about the cycle:\n\n\t   $ tsort -q dag\n\t   D\n\t   E\n\t   A\n\t   F\n\t   B\n\t   C"
