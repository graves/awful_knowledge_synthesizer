    Manpage text:

    This file will be removed if the db_checkpoint utility exits
           gracefully.

         -P
           Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities
           overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
           window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
           command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the
           memory containing the command-line arguments.

         -p
           Checkpoint the database at least every min minutes if there has been
           any activity since the last checkpoint.

         -V
           Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

         -v
           Write the time of each checkpoint attempt to the standard output.

         At least one of the -1, -k, and -p options must be specified.

         The db_checkpoint utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described
         for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
         utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In
         order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
         environment, db_checkpoint should always be given the chance to detach
         from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_checkpoint to
         release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt
         signal (SIGINT).
