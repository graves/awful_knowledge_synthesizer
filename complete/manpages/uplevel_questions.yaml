Uplevel returns the result of that evaluation.\n\n       If level is an integer then it gives a distance (up the procedure\n       calling stack) to move before executing the command.  If level consists\n       of # followed by a number then the number gives an absolute level\n       number.\tIf level is omitted then it defaults to 1.  Level cannot be\n       defaulted if the first command argument starts with a digit or #.\n\n       For example, suppose that procedure a was invoked from top-level, and\n       that it called b, and that b called c.  Suppose that c invokes the\n       uplevel command.  If level is 1 or #2  or omitted, then the command\n       will be executed in the variable context of b.  If level is 2 or #1\n       then the command will be executed in the variable context of a.\tIf\n       level is 3 or #0 then the command will be executed at top-level (only\n       global variables will be visible)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `uplevel`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe uplevel command causes the invoking procedure to disappear from the\n       procedure calling stack while the command is being executed.  In the\n       above example, suppose c invokes the command\n\t      uplevel 1 {set x 43; d}\n       where d is another Tcl procedure.  The set command will modify the\n       variable x in b's context, and d will execute at level 3, as if called\n       from b.\tIf it in turn executes the command\n\t      uplevel {set x 42}\n       then the set command will modify the same variable x in b's context:\n       the procedure c does not appear to be on the call stack when d is\n       executing.  The info level command may be used to obtain the level of\n       the current procedure.\n\n       Uplevel makes it possible to implement new control constructs as Tcl\n       procedures (for example, uplevel could be used to implement the while\n       construct as a Tcl procedure).\n\n       The namespace eval and apply commands offer other ways (besides\n       procedure calls) that the Tcl naming context can change.  They add a\n       call frame to the stack to represent the namespace context.  This means\n       each namespace eval command counts as another call level for uplevel\n       and upvar commands.  For example, info level 1 will return a list\n       describing a command that is either the outermost procedure call or the\n       outermost namespace eval command.  Also, uplevel #0 evaluates a script\n       at top-level in the outermost namespace (the global namespace)."
