The character is\n\t      returned as the result of the command.\n\n       ::page::util::quote::quote'tcl char\n\t      This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and\n\t      converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser,\n\t      will regenerate the character in question and is 7bit ASCII. The\n\t      string is returned as the result of this command.\n\n       ::page::util::quote::quote'tclstr char\n\t      This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and\n\t      converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser\n\t      and will generate a human readable representation of the\n\t      character in question.  The string is returned as the result of\n\t      this command.\n\n\t      The string does not use any unprintable characters. It may use\n\t      backslash-quoting. High UTF characters are quoted to avoid\n\t      problems with the still prevalent ascii terminals. It is assumed\n\t      that the string will be used in a double-quoted environment.\n\n       ::page::util::quote::quote'tclcom char\n\t      This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and\n\t      converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser\n\t      when used within a Tcl comment. The string is returned as the\n\t      result of this command.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.\n       Please report such in the category page of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       page, parser generator, quoting, text processing\n\nCATEGORY\n       Page Parser Generator\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
