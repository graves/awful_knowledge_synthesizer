The compiled format is necessary for use with the\n       library routines in ncurses(3X).\n\n       As described in term(5), the database may be either a directory tree\n       (one file per terminal entry) or a hashed database (one record per\n       entry).\tThe tic command writes only one type of entry, depending on\n       how it was built:\n\n       •   For directory trees, the top-level directory, e.g.,\n\t   /usr/share/terminfo, specifies the location of the database.\n\n       •   For hashed databases, a filename is needed.\tIf the given file is\n\t   not found by that name, but can be found by adding the suffix\n\t   \".db\", then that is used.\n\n\t   The default name for the hashed database is the same as the default\n\t   directory name (only adding a \".db\" suffix)."

The compiled terminal description can be placed\n       in a different terminfo database.  There are two ways to achieve this:\n\n       •   First, you may override the system default either by using the -o\n\t   option, or by setting the variable TERMINFO in your shell\n\t   environment to a valid database location.\n\n       •   Secondly, if tic cannot write in /usr/share/terminfo or the\n\t   location specified using your TERMINFO variable, it looks for the\n\t   directory $HOME/.terminfo (or hashed database $HOME/.terminfo.db);\n\t   if that location exists, the entry is placed there.\n\n       Libraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check in\n       succession\n\n       •   a location specified with the TERMINFO environment variable,"

    COMPATIBILITY
           There is some evidence that historic tic implementations treated
           description fields with no whitespace in them as additional aliases or
           short names.  This tic does not do that, but it does warn when
           description fields may be treated that way and check them for dangerous
           characters.

    EXTENSIONS
           Unlike the SVr4 tic command, this implementation can actually compile
           termcap sources.  In fact, entries in terminfo and termcap syntax can
           be mixed in a single source file.  See terminfo(5) for the list of
           termcap names taken to be equivalent to terminfo names.

           The SVr4 manual pages are not clear on the resolution rules for use
           capabilities.  This implementation of tic will find use targets
           anywhere in the source file, or anywhere in the file tree rooted at
           TERMINFO (if TERMINFO is defined), or in the user's $HOME/.terminfo
           database (if it exists), or (finally) anywhere in the system's file
