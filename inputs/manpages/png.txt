NAME
       png - Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format


DESCRIPTION
       PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for the
       lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images.  PNG
       provides a patent-free replacement for GIF, and can also replace many
       common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are
       supported, plus an optional alpha channel.  Sample depths range from 1
       to 16 bits.
       PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as
       the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive
       display option.	PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity
       checking and fast, simple detection of common transmission errors.
       Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color
       matching on heterogeneous platforms.
