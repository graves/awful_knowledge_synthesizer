With no arguments it\n     transforms stream input into a columnar format convenient for terminal\n     viewing.\n\n     The shape of the input array is deduced from the number of lines and the\n     number of columns on the first line.  If that shape is inconvenient, a\n     more useful one might be obtained by skipping some of the input with the\n     -k option.  Other options control interpretation of the input columns.\n\n     The shape of the output array is influenced by the rows and cols\n     specifications, which should be positive integers.  If only one of them\n     is a positive integer, rs computes a value for the other which will\n     accommodate all of the data.  When necessary, missing data are supplied\n     in a manner specified by the options and surplus data are deleted.  There\n     are options to control presentation of the output columns, including\n     transposition of the rows and columns."

A missing\n\t     x is taken to be `^I'.\n\n     -sx     Like -c, but maximal strings of x are delimiters.\n\n     -Cx     Output columns are delimited by the single character x.
