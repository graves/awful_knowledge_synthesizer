    Manpage text:

    In addition, all IPP "xxx-default" and "pwg-xxx" Printer Description
           attributes are added to the environment.  For example, the
           "IPP_MEDIA_DEFAULT" environment variable will be set to the default
           value for the "media" Job Template attribute.

           Enumerated values are converted to their keyword equivalents.  For
           example, a "print-quality" Job Template attribute with a enum value of
           3 will become the "IPP_PRINT_QUALITY" environment variable with a value
           of "draft".  This string conversion only happens for standard Job
           Template attributes, currently "finishings", "orientation-requested",
           and "print-quality".

           Finally, the "CONTENT_TYPE" environment variable contains the MIME
           media type of the document being printed, the "DEVICE_URI" environment
           variable contains the device URI as specified with the "-D" option, the
           "OUTPUT_FORMAT" environment variable contains the output MIME media
           type, and the "PPD" environment variable contains the PPD filename as
           specified with the "-P" option.
