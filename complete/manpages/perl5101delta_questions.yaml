There are two new cases where \"when\" now\n       interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be\n       used in a smart match:\n\n       flip-flop operators\n\t   The \"..\" and \"...\" flip-flop operators are now evaluated in boolean\n\t   context, following their usual semantics; see \"Range Operators\" in\n\t   perlop.\n\n\t   Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, \"when (1..10)\" will not work to test\n\t   whether a given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should\n\t   use \"when ([1..10])\" instead (note the array reference)."

    Manpage text:

    The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in "Smart
           matching in detail" in perlsyn.

           Smart match and overloading

           According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument type,
           when an object overloading "~~" appears on the right side of the
           operator, the overload routine will always be called (with a 3rd
           argument set to a true value, see overload.) However, when the object
           will appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only when
           the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way distributivity of
           smart match across arrays is not broken, as well as the other
           behaviours with complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus,
           writers of overloading routines for smart match mostly need to worry
           only with comparing against a scalar, and possibly with stringification
           overloading; the other common cases will be automatically handled
           consistently.

           "~~" will now refuse to work on objects that do not overload it (in
           order to avoid relying on the object's underlying structure). (However,
           if the object overloads the stringification or the numification
           operators, and if overload fallback is active, it will be used instead,
           as usual.)

See\n\t   \"Modules and Pragmata\" for more information.\n\n       •   It is now a run-time error to use the smart match operator \"~~\"\n\t   with an object that has no overload defined for it. (This way \"~~\"\n\t   will not break encapsulation by matching against the object's\n\t   internal representation as a reference.)\n\n       •   The version control system used for the development of the perl\n\t   interpreter has been switched from Perforce to git.\tThis is mainly\n\t   an internal issue that only affects people actively working on the\n\t   perl core; but it may have minor external visibility, for example\n\t   in some of details of the output of \"perl -V\".

In general, a module \"Foo::Bar\" whose source\n\t   was stored under ext/Foo/Bar/ is now located under ext/Foo-Bar/.\n\t   Also, some modules have been moved from lib/ to ext/. This is\n\t   purely a source tarball change, and should make no difference to\n\t   the compilation or installation of perl, unless you have a very\n\t   customised build process that explicitly relies on this structure,\n\t   or which hard-codes the \"nonxs_ext\" Configure parameter.\n\t   Specifically, this change does not by default alter the location of\n\t   any files in the final installation."

    Installation and Configuration Improvements
       ext/ reorganisation
           The layout of directories in ext has been revised. Specifically, all
           extensions are now flat, and at the top level, with "/" in pathnames
           replaced by "-", so that ext/Data/Dumper/ is now ext/Data-Dumper/, etc.
           The names of the extensions as specified to Configure, and as reported
           by %Config::Config under the keys "dynamic_ext", "known_extensions",
           "nonxs_ext" and "static_ext" have not changed, and still use "/". Hence
           this change will not have any affect once perl is installed. However,
           "Attribute::Handlers", "Safe" and "mro" have now become extensions in
           their own right, so if you run Configure with options to specify an
           exact list of extensions to build, you will need to change it to
           account for this.

           For 5.10.2, it is planned that many dual-life modules will have been
           moved from lib to ext; again this will have no effect on an installed
           perl, but will matter if you invoke Configure with a pre-canned list of
           extensions to build.

    Manpage text:

    Configuration improvements
           If "vendorlib" and "vendorarch" are the same, then they are only added
           to @INC once.

           $Config{usedevel} and the C-level "PERL_USE_DEVEL" are now defined if
           perl is built with  "-Dusedevel".

           Configure will enable use of "-fstack-protector", to provide protection
           against stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.

           Configure will now determine the correct prototypes for re-entrant
           functions, and for "gconvert", if you are using a C++ compiler rather
           than a C compiler.

           On Unix, if you build from a tree containing a git repository, the
           configuration process will note the commit hash you have checked out,
           for display in the output of "perl -v" and "perl -V". Unpushed local
           commits are automatically added to the list of local patches displayed
           by "perl -V".

       Compilation improvements
           As part of the flattening of ext, all extensions on all platforms are
           built by make_ext.pl. This replaces the Unix-specific
           ext/util/make_ext, VMS-specific make_ext.com and Win32-specific
           win32/buildext.pl.

    Acknowledgements
           Some of the work in this release was funded by a TPF grant.

           Nicholas Clark officially retired from maintenance pumpking duty at the
           end of 2008; however in reality he has put much effort in since then to
           help get 5.10.1 into a fit state to be released, including writing a
           considerable chunk of this perldelta.

           Steffen Mueller and David Golden in particular helped getting CPAN
           modules polished and synchronised with their in-core equivalents.

           Craig Berry was tireless in getting maint to run under VMS, no matter
           how many times we broke it for him.

           The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and applied
           most of the patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed in
           AUTHORS.

           (Sorry to all the people I haven't mentioned by name).

           Finally, thanks to Larry Wall, without whom none of this would be
           necessary.

    Manpage text:

    If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.

           If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
           inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
           send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
           subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
           committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,
           figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
           mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
           supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl
           core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
