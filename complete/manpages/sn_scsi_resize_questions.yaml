The Linux device driver stack does\n       not automatically detect size changes.\n\n       If no devnames are specified, sn_scsi_resize will rescan all multipath\n       devices and their slaves.\n\n       Devnames may be specified as absolute paths like /sys/block/dm-3,\n       /sys/block/dm*, /sys/block/sdg, or shorthand like mpatha, mpathb\n       representing /dev/mapper files.\n\n       sn_scsi_resize will execute a StorNext disk refresh after the SCSI\n       devices have been resized.\n\n\nOPTIONS\n       -?     Display usage and exit.\n\n       -h     Help. Display usage and exit.\n\n       -l     List.  This option will list the device sizes.  No size rescan\n\t      is done.\n\n       -v     Verbose.\tDisplay the sizes of the devices.  Similar to the list\n\t      option but works during resize.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Rescan all multipath devices and their slaves:\n\n\t      sn_scsi_resize\n\n       Rescan the multipath device dm-3 and its slaves:\n\n\t      sn_scsi_resize /sys/block/dm-3\n\n       Rescan the multipath device /dev/mapper/mpatha and /dev/mapper/mpathb\n       and their slaves:\n\n\t      sn_scsi_resize mpatha mpathb\n\n       List the sizes of all device and their slaves:\n\n\t      sn_scsi_resize -l"
