Defaults are set up for the most common cases.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::crc::crc16 ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?\n       message\n\n       ::crc::crc16 ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?\n       -filename file\n\n       ::crc::crc-ccitt ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation\n       procname? message\n\n       ::crc::crc-ccitt ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation\n       procname? -filename file\n\n       ::crc::xmodem ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?\n       message\n\n       ::crc::xmodem ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?\n       -filename file\n\t      The command takes either string data or a file name and returns\n\t      a checksum value calculated using the CRC algorithm. The command\n\t      used sets up the CRC polynomial, initial value and bit ordering\n\t      for the desired standard checksum calculation. The result is\n\t      formatted using the format(n) specifier provided or as an\n\t      unsigned integer (%u) by default.\n\n\t      A number of common polynomials are in use with the CRC algorithm\n\t      and the most commonly used of these are included in this\n\t      package. For convenience each of these has a command alias in\n\t      the crc namespace.\n\n\t      It is possible to implement the CRC-32 checksum using this crc16\n\t      package as the implementation is sufficiently generic to extend\n\t      to 32 bit checksums. As an example this has been done already -\n\t      however this is not the fastest method to implement this\n\t      algorithm in Tcl and a separate crc32 package is available.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -filename name\n\t      Return a checksum for the file contents instead of for parameter\n\t      data.\n\n       -format string\n\t      Return the checksum using an alternative format template.\n\n       -seed value\n\t      Select an alternative seed value for the CRC calculation. The\n\t      default is 0 for the CRC16 calculation and 0xFFFF for the CCITT\n\t      version.\tThis can be useful for calculating the CRC for data\n\t      structures without first converting the whole structure into a\n\t      string. The CRC of the previous member can be used as the seed\n\t      for calculating the CRC of the next member. It is also used for\n\t      accumulating a checksum from fragments of a large message (or\n\t      file)\n\n       -implementation procname\n\t      This hook is provided to allow users to provide their own\n\t      implementation (perhaps a C compiled extension). The procedure\n\t      specfied is called with two parameters. The first is the data to\n\t      be checksummed and the second is the seed value. An integer is\n\t      expected as the result.\n\n\t      The package provides some implementations of standard CRC\n\t      polynomials for the XMODEM, CCITT and the usual CRC-16 checksum.\n\t      For convenience, additional commands have been provided that\n\t      make use of these implementations.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       % crc::crc16 \"Hello, World!\"\n       64077"
