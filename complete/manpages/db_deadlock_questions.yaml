    Manpage text:

    The db_deadlock utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for
         the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility
         was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to
         avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
         db_deadlock should always be given the chance to detach from the
         environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_deadlock to release all
         environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
         (SIGINT).

         The db_deadlock utility does not attempt to create the Berkeley DB shared
         memory regions if they do not already exist. The application which
         creates the region should be started first, and then, once the region is
         created, the db_deadlock utility should be started.

         The DB_ENV->lock_detect method is the underlying method used by the
         db_deadlock utility. See the db_deadlock utility source code for an
         example of using DB_ENV->lock_detect in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX)
         environment.
