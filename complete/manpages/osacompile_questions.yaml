Files may be plain text or other\n     compiled scripts.\tThe options are as follows:\n\n     -l language\n\t   Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain\n\t   text files are compiled as AppleScript.\n\n     -e command\n\t   Enter one line of a script.\tScript commands given via -e are\n\t   prepended to the normal source, if any.  Multiple -e options may be\n\t   given to build up a multi-line script.  Because most scripts use\n\t   characters that are special to many shell programs (e.g.,\n\t   AppleScript uses single and double quote marks, “(”, “)”, and “*”),\n\t   the command will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get it\n\t   past the shell intact."

If this option is not specified, the creator code will not\n\t   be set.\n\n     -c creator\n\t   Set the output file creator to creator, where creator is a four-\n\t   character code.

If the filename ends with “.app”, it creates a bundled applet or\n     droplet.  If the filename ends with “.scptd”, it creates a bundled\n     compiled script.
