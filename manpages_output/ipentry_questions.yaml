True indicates that the entry contains\n\t      a complete IP address, meaning all fields have a value. In some\n\t      cases IPv6 address are valid when fields are missing. You will\n\t      need to do your own validation to detect this.\n\n       pathName get\n\t      Returns the contents of the entry as a list consisting of 4 or 8\n\t      elements.\n\n       pathName insert iplist\n\t      IPv4 Takes a list of 4 elements and inserts one into each quad\n\t      of the entry, in order.  All values in the list must be empty or\n\t      integers. Values outside the range 0 to 255 are modified to be\n\t      within the range.  IPv6 Takes a list of 8 elements and inserts\n\t      one into each quad of the entry, in order.  All values in the\n\t      list must be empty or 1 to 4 hex digits.\n\n       pathName icursor index\n\t      Sets the position of the widgets insertion cursor. Only integer\n\t      values between 0 and 15 are valid for ipentry and 0 to 31 for\n\t      ipentry6.  Setting the icursor will only have an effect if the\n\t      widget already has the input focus.\n\n       pathName configure option value...\n\t      Modifies the configuration of the widget. For options and their\n\t      meaning see the widget options section.\n\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns information about the current configuration of the\n\t      widget, for the specified option. For options and their meaning\n\t      see the widget options section.\n\nWIDGET OPTIONS\n       Command-Line Switch:    -textvariable\n       Database Name:\t       textvariable\n       Database Class:\t       Variable"
