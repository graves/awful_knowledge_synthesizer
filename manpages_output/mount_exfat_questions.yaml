This command is normally\n     invoked by diskarbitrationd(8) as the result of detecting a device with a\n     file system recognized as ExFAT.  It can also be invoked indirectly by\n     executing the mount(8) command with the -t exfat option.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -o options\n\t     Use the specified mount options, as described in mount(8).\n\n     -u uid  Set the owner of the files in the file system to uid.  The\n\t     default owner is the owner of the directory on which the file\n\t     system is being mounted.\n\n     -g gid  Set the group of the files in the file system to gid.  The\n\t     default group is the group of the directory on which the file\n\t     system is being mounted."

(For example, a mask of 755 specifies that, by default,\n\t     the owner should have read, write, and execute permissions for\n\t     files, but others should only have read and execute permissions.\n\t     See chmod(1) for more information about octal file modes.)  Only\n\t     the nine low-order bits of mask are used.\tThe default mask is\n\t     taken from the directory on which the file system is being\n\t     mounted.\n\n     If none of the -u, -g, or -m options are given, the volume will be\n     mounted with the MNT_UNKNOWNPERMISSIONS flag (equivalent to the -o\n     noowners option).\n\n     If the device is internal and not removable, the volume will be mounted\n     with the MNT_ASYNC flag (equivalent to the -o async option) by default.\n     That default can be overridden with the -o noasync option.  When mounted\n     with the -o noasync option, metadata updates are synced to disk\n     frequently (by default, 50ms after the system call that changed the\n     metadata returns to its caller)."
