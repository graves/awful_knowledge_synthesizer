See the\n       postqueue(1) command for unprivileged queue operations such as listing\n       or flushing the mail queue.\n\n       By default, postsuper(1) performs the operations requested with the -s\n       and -p command-line options on all Postfix queue directories - this\n       includes the incoming, active and deferred directories with mail files\n       and the bounce, defer, trace and flush directories with log files.\n\n       Options:\n\n       -c config_dir\n\t      The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead\n\t      of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      environment setting below.\n\n       -d queue_id\n\t      Delete one message with the named queue ID from the named mail\n\t      queue(s) (default: hold, incoming, active and deferred).\n\n\t      To delete multiple files, specify the -d option multiple times,\n\t      or specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard\n\t      input. For example, to delete all mail with exactly one\n\t      recipient user@example.com:\n\n\t      mailq | tail -n +2 | grep -v '^ *(' | awk  'BEGIN { RS = \"\" }\n\t\t  # $7=sender, $8=recipient1, $9=recipient2\n\t\t  { if ($8 == \"user@example.com\" && $9 == \"\")\n\t\t\tprint $1 }\n\t       ' | tr -d '*!' | postsuper -d -\n\n\t      Specify \"-d ALL\" to remove all messages; for example, specify\n\t      \"-d ALL deferred\" to delete all mail in the deferred queue.  As\n\t      a safety measure, the word ALL must be specified in upper case.\n\n\t      Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix <=\n\t      2.8; and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).\n\t      There is a very small possibility that postsuper deletes the\n\t      wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail\n\t      system is delivering mail.\n\n\t      The scenario is as follows:\n\n\t      1)     The Postfix queue manager deletes the message that\n\t\t     postsuper(1) is asked to delete, because Postfix is\n\t\t     finished with the message (it is delivered, or it is\n\t\t     returned to the sender).\n\n\t      2)     New mail arrives, and the new message is given the same\n\t\t     queue ID as the message that postsuper(1) is supposed to\n\t\t     delete.  The probability for reusing a deleted queue ID\n\t\t     is about 1 in 2**15 (the number of different microsecond\n\t\t     values that the system clock can distinguish within a\n\t\t     second).\n\n\t      3)     postsuper(1) deletes the new message, instead of the old\n\t\t     message that it should have deleted.\n\n       -h queue_id\n\t      Put mail \"on hold\" so that no attempt is made to deliver it.\n\t      Move one message with the named queue ID from the named mail\n\t      queue(s) (default: incoming, active and deferred) to the hold\n\t      queue.\n\n\t      To hold multiple files, specify the -h option multiple times, or\n\t      specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard input.\n\n\t      Specify \"-h ALL\" to hold all messages; for example, specify \"-h\n\t      ALL deferred\" to hold all mail in the deferred queue.  As a\n\t      safety measure, the word ALL must be specified in upper case.\n\n\t      Note: while mail is \"on hold\" it will not expire when its time\n\t      in the queue exceeds the maximal_queue_lifetime or\n\t      bounce_queue_lifetime setting. It becomes subject to expiration\n\t      after it is released from \"hold\".\n\n\t      This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.\n\n       -H queue_id\n\t      Release mail that was put \"on hold\".  Move one message with the\n\t      named queue ID from the named mail queue(s) (default: hold) to\n\t      the deferred queue.\n\n\t      To release multiple files, specify the -H option multiple times,\n\t      or specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard\n\t      input.\n\n\t      Note: specify \"postsuper -r\" to release mail that was kept on\n\t      hold for a significant fraction of $maximal_queue_lifetime or\n\t      $bounce_queue_lifetime, or longer.\n\n\t      Specify \"-H ALL\" to release all mail that is \"on hold\".  As a\n\t      safety measure, the word ALL must be specified in upper case.\n\n\t      This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.\n\n       -p     Purge old temporary files that are left over after system or\n\t      software crashes.\n\n       -r queue_id\n\t      Requeue the message with the named queue ID from the named mail\n\t      queue(s) (default: hold, incoming, active and deferred).\n\n\t      To requeue multiple files, specify the -r option multiple times,\n\t      or specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard\n\t      input.\n\n\t      Specify \"-r ALL\" to requeue all messages. As a safety measure,\n\t      the word ALL must be specified in upper case.\n\n\t      A requeued message is moved to the maildrop queue, from where it\n\t      is copied by the pickup(8) and cleanup(8) daemons to a new queue\n\t      file. In many respects its handling differs from that of a new\n\t      local submission.\n\n\t      •      The message is not subjected to the smtpd_milters or\n\t\t     non_smtpd_milters settings.  When mail has passed through\n\t\t     an external content filter, this would produce incorrect\n\t\t     results with Milter applications that depend on original\n\t\t     SMTP connection state information.\n\n\t      •      The message is subjected again to mail address rewriting\n\t\t     and substitution.\tThis is useful when rewriting rules or\n\t\t     virtual mappings have changed.\n\n\t\t     The address rewriting context (local or remote) is the\n\t\t     same as when the message was received.\n\n\t      •      The message is subjected to the same content_filter\n\t\t     settings (if any) as used for new local mail submissions.\n\t\t     This is useful when content_filter settings have changed.\n\n\t      Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix <=\n\t      2.8; and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).\n\t      There is a very small possibility that postsuper(1) requeues the\n\t      wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail\n\t      system is running, but no harm should be done.\n\n\t      This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.\n\n       -s     Structure check and structure repair.  This should be done once\n\t      before Postfix startup.\n\n\t      •      Rename files whose name does not match the message file\n\t\t     inode number. This operation is necessary after restoring\n\t\t     a mail queue from a different machine or from backup,\n\t\t     when queue files were created with Postfix <= 2.8 or with\n\t\t     \"enable_long_queue_ids = no\".\n\n\t      •      Move queue files that are in the wrong place in the file\n\t\t     system hierarchy and remove subdirectories that are no\n\t\t     longer needed.  File position rearrangements are\n\t\t     necessary after a change in the hash_queue_names and/or\n\t\t     hash_queue_depth configuration parameters.\n\n\t      •      Rename queue files created with \"enable_long_queue_ids =\n\t\t     yes\" to short names, for migration to Postfix <= 2.8.\n\t\t     The procedure is as follows:\n\n\t\t     # postfix stop\n\t\t     # postconf enable_long_queue_ids=no\n\t\t     # postsuper\n\n\t\t     Run postsuper(1) repeatedly until it stops reporting file\n\t\t     name changes.\n\n       -S     A redundant version of -s that requires that long file names\n\t      also match the message file inode number. This option exists for\n\t      testing purposes, and is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.\n\n       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v\n\t      options make the software increasingly verbose.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems are reported to the standard error stream and to syslogd(8).\n\n       postsuper(1) reports the number of messages deleted with -d, the number\n       of messages requeued with -r, and the number of messages whose queue\n       file name was fixed with -s. The report is written to the standard\n       error stream and to syslogd(8).\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\n       MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      Directory with the main.cf file.\n\nBUGS\n       Mail that is not sanitized by Postfix (i.e. mail in the maildrop queue)\n       cannot be placed \"on hold\".\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this\n       program.
