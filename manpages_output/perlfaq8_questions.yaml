    NAME
           perlfaq8 - System Interaction

    VERSION
           version 5.20210411

    DESCRIPTION
           This section of the Perl FAQ covers questions involving operating
           system interaction. Topics include interprocess communication (IPC),
           control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing
           devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.

           Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your
           operating system (eg, perlvms, perlplan9, ...). These should contain
           more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.

       How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?
           The $^O variable ($OSNAME if you use "English") contains an indication
           of the name of the operating system (not its release number) that your
           perl binary was built for.

       How come exec() doesn't return?
           (contributed by brian d foy)

           The "exec" function's job is to turn your process into another command
           and never to return. If that's not what you want to do, don't use
           "exec". :)

  manpageQuestion2: How can I determine the operating system my Perl script is running on using perlfaq8?
  manpageQuestion3: Why would the exec() function not return, and how can I avoid this behavior?

    use sigtrap qw(die normal-signals);

           Perl's exception-handling mechanism is its "eval()" operator. You can
           use "eval()" as "setjmp" and "die()" as "longjmp". For details of this,
           see the section on signals, especially the time-out handler for a
           blocking "flock()" in "Signals" in perlipc or the section on "Signals"
           in Programming Perl.

           If exception handling is all you're interested in, use one of the many
           CPAN modules that handle exceptions, such as Try::Tiny.

           If you want the "atexit()" syntax (and an "rmexit()" as well), try the
           "AtExit" module available from CPAN.

       Why doesn't my sockets program work under System V (Solaris)? What does the
           error message "Protocol not supported" mean?
           Some Sys-V based systems, notably Solaris 2.X, redefined some of the
           standard socket constants. Since these were constant across all
           architectures, they were often hardwired into perl code. The proper way
           to deal with this is to "use Socket" to get the correct values.

       How can I call my system's unique C functions from Perl?
           In most cases, you write an external module to do it--see the answer to
           "Where can I learn about linking C with Perl? [h2xs, xsubpp]".
           However, if the function is a system call, and your system supports
           "syscall()", you can use the "syscall" function (documented in
           perlfunc).

           Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution, and
           CPAN as well--someone may already have written a module to do it. On
           Windows, try Win32::API. On Macs, try Mac::Carbon. If no module has an
           interface to the C function, you can inline a bit of C in your Perl
           source with Inline::C.

       Where do I get the include files to do ioctl() or syscall()?
           Historically, these would be generated by the h2ph tool, part of the
           standard perl distribution. This program converts cpp(1) directives in
           C header files to files containing subroutine definitions, like
           "SYS_getitimer()", which you can use as arguments to your functions.
           It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done.
           Simple files like errno.h, syscall.h, and socket.h were fine, but the
           hard ones like ioctl.h nearly always need to be hand-edited.  Here's
           how to install the *.ph files:

    Manpage text:

    The first command sends both standard out and standard error to the
           temporary file. The second command sends only the old standard output
           there, and the old standard error shows up on the old standard out.

       Why doesn't open() return an error when a pipe open fails?
           If the second argument to a piped "open()" contains shell
           metacharacters, perl "fork()"s, then "exec()"s a shell to decode the
           metacharacters and eventually run the desired program. If the program
           couldn't be run, it's the shell that gets the message, not Perl. All
           your Perl program can find out is whether the shell itself could be
           successfully started. You can still capture the shell's STDERR and
           check it for error messages. See "How can I capture STDERR from an
           external command?" elsewhere in this document, or use the IPC::Open3
           module.

           If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument of "open()", Perl
           runs the command directly, without using the shell, and can correctly

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfaq8`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nuse lib $directory;\n\n       The FindBin module, which comes with Perl, might work. It finds the\n       directory of the currently running script and puts it in $Bin, which\n       you can then use to construct the right library path:\n\n\t   use FindBin qw($Bin);\n\n       You can also use local::lib to do much of the same thing. Install\n       modules using local::lib's settings then use the module in your\n       program:\n\n\t    use local::lib; # sets up a local lib at ~/perl5\n\n       See the local::lib documentation for more details.\n\n   How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime?\n       Here are the suggested ways of modifying your include path, including\n       environment variables, run-time switches, and in-code statements:\n\n       the \"PERLLIB\" environment variable\n\t       $ export PERLLIB=/path/to/my/dir\n\t       $ perl program.pl\n\n       the \"PERL5LIB\" environment variable\n\t       $ export PERL5LIB=/path/to/my/dir\n\t       $ perl program.pl\n\n       the \"perl -Idir\" command line flag\n\t       $ perl -I/path/to/my/dir program.pl"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfaq8`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nthe \"lib\" pragma:\n\t       use lib \"$ENV{HOME}/myown_perllib\";\n\n       the local::lib module:\n\t       use local::lib;\n\n\t       use local::lib \"~/myown_perllib\";\n\n   Where are modules installed?\n       Modules are installed on a case-by-case basis (as provided by the\n       methods described in the previous section), and in the operating\n       system. All of these paths are stored in @INC, which you can display\n       with the one-liner\n\n\t   perl -e 'print join(\"\\n\",@INC,\"\")'\n\n       The same information is displayed at the end of the output from the\n       command\n\n\t   perl -V\n\n       To find out where a module's source code is located, use\n\n\t   perldoc -l Encode\n\n       to display the path to the module. In some cases (for example, the\n       \"AutoLoader\" module), this command will show the path to a separate\n       \"pod\" file; the module itself should be in the same directory, with a\n       'pm' file extension.\n\n   What is socket.ph and where do I get it?\n       It's a Perl 4 style file defining values for system networking\n       constants. Sometimes it is built using h2ph when Perl is installed, but\n       other times it is not. Modern programs should use \"use Socket;\"\n       instead."
