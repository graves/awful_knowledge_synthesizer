This\n     command is not intended to be invoked directly.\n\n     Options:\n\n     -d       Report detailed information in /var/log/diskarbitrationd.log.\n\n     The file /etc/fstab is consulted for user-defined mount points, indexed\n     by filesystem, in the mount point determination for a filesystem.\tEach\n     filesystem can be identified by its UUID or by its label, using the\n     constructs ``UUID'' or ``LABEL'', respectively.  For example:\n\n\tUUID=DF000C7E-AE0C-3B15-B730-DFD2EF15CB91 /export ufs\tro\n\tUUID=FAB060E9-79F7-33FF-BE85-E1D3ABD3EDEA none\t  hfs\trw,noauto\n\tLABEL=The\\040Volume\\040Name\\040Is\\040This none\t  msdos ro"
