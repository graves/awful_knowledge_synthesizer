The name of the file system whose config is to be\n\t      validated.\n\n       -f config_file\n\t      Specify the config file to validate.\n\n       -M msg_format\n\t      Specify XML if you want messages to come back in XML format.\n\t      This defaults to ASCII."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the sncfgvalidate tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use sncfgvalidate to check the syntax of a configuration file for a Xsan Volume named 'MyVolume' without comparing it to an existing configuration?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using sncfgvalidate to validate a custom configuration file 'myconfig.xml' for a Xsan Volume called 'StorageVol' and have the validation messages returned in XML format?
