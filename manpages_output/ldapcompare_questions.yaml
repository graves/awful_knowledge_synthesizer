The DN should be a distinguished\n       name in the directory.  Attr should be a known attribute.  If followed\n       by one colon, the assertion value should be provided as a string.  If\n       followed by two colons, the base64 encoding of the value is provided.\n       The result code of the compare is provided as the exit code and, unless\n       ran with -z, the program prints TRUE, FALSE, or UNDEFINED on standard\n       output."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the ldapcompare tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use ldapcompare to verify if the attribute 'userPassword' in the DN 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com' matches the value 'secret123'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using ldapcompare to compare a base64-encoded attribute value against a distinguished name and attribute in an LDAP directory?
