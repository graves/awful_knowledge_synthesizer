For many\n\t      projections, this figure is also the reference meridian of the\n\t      projection.\n\n       phi_0  Latitude of the center of the sheet, in degrees.\tFor the\n\t      azimuthal projections, this figure is also the latitude of the\n\t      center of the projection.\n\n       phi_1  Latitude of the first reference parallel, for projections that\n\t      use reference parallels.\n\n       phi_2  Latitude of the second reference parallel, for projections that\n\t      use reference parallels.\n\n       x      X co-ordinate of a point on the map, in units of Earth radii.\n\n       y      Y co-ordinate of a point on the map, in units of Earth radii.\n\nRESULTS\n       For all of the procedures whose names begin with 'to', the return value\n       is a list comprising an x co-ordinate and a y co-ordinate.  The co-\n       ordinates are relative to the center of the map sheet to be drawn,\n       measured in Earth radii at the reference location on the map.  For all\n       of the functions whose names begin with 'from', the return value is a\n       list comprising the longitude and latitude, in degrees.\n\nCHOOSING A PROJECTION\n       This package offers a great many projections, because no single\n       projection is appropriate to all maps.  This section attempts to\n       provide guidance on how to choose a projection.\n\n       First, consider the type of data that you intend to display on the map.\n       If the data are directional (e.g., winds, ocean currents, or magnetic\n       fields) then you need to use a projection that preserves angles; these\n       are known as conformal projections.  Conformal projections include the\n       Mercator, the Albers azimuthal equal-area, the stereographic, and the\n       Peirce Quincuncial projection.  If the data are thematic, describing\n       properties of land or water, such as temperature, population density,\n       land use, or demographics; then you need a projection that will show\n       these data with the areas on the map proportional to the areas in real\n       life.  These so-called equal area projections include the various\n       cylindrical equal area projections, the sinusoidal projection, the\n       Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection, the Albers equal-area conic\n       projection, and several of the world-map projections (Miller\n       Cylindrical, Mollweide, Eckert IV, Eckert VI, Robinson, and Hammer). If\n       the significant factor in your data is distance from a central point or\n       line (such as air routes), then you will do best with an equidistant\n       projection such as plate carrée, Cassini, azimuthal equidistant, or\n       conic equidistant.  If direction from a central point is a critical\n       factor in your data (for instance, air routes, radio antenna pointing),\n       then you will almost surely want to use one of the azimuthal\n       projections. Appropriate choices are azimuthal equidistant, azimuthal\n       equal-area, stereographic, and perhaps orthographic.\n\n       Next, consider how much of the Earth your map will cover, and the\n       general shape of the area of interest.  For maps of the entire Earth,\n       the cylindrical equal area, Eckert IV and VI, Mollweide, Robinson, and\n       Hammer projections are good overall choices.  The Mercator projection\n       is traditional, but the extreme distortions of area at high latitudes\n       make it a poor choice unless a conformal projection is required. The\n       Peirce projection is a better choice of conformal projection, having\n       less distortion of landforms.  The Miller Cylindrical is a compromise\n       designed to give shapes similar to the traditional Mercator, but with\n       less polar stretching.  The Peirce Quincuncial projection shows all the\n       continents with acceptable distortion if a reference meridian close to\n       +20 degrees is chosen.  The Robinson projection yields attractive maps\n       for things like political divisions, but should be avoided in\n       presenting scientific data, since other projections have moe useful\n       geometric properties.\n\n       If the map will cover a hemisphere, then choose stereographic,\n       azimuthal-equidistant, Hammer, or Mollweide projections; these all\n       project the hemisphere into a circle.\n\n       If the map will cover a large area (at least a few hundred km on a\n       side), but less than a hemisphere, then you have several choices.\n       Azimuthal projections are usually good (choose stereographic, azimuthal\n       equidistant, or Lambert azimuthal equal-area according to whether\n       shapes, distances from a central point, or areas are important).\n       Azimuthal projections (and possibly the Cassini projection) are the\n       only really good choices for mapping the polar regions.\n\n       If the large area is in one of the temperate zones and is round or has\n       a primarily east-west extent, then the conic projections are good\n       choices.  Choose the Lambert conformal conic, the conic equidistant, or\n       the Albers equal-area conic according to whether shape, distance, or\n       area are the most important parameters.\tFor any of these, the\n       reference parallels should be chosen at approximately 1/6 and 5/6 of\n       the range of latitudes to be displayed.\tFor instance, maps of the 48\n       coterminous United States are attractive with reference parallels of\n       28.5 and 45.5 degrees.\n\n       If the large area is equatorial and is round or has a primarily east-\n       west extent, then the Mercator projection is a good choice for a\n       conformal projection; Lambert cylindrical equal-area and sinusoidal\n       projections are good equal-area projections; and the plate carrée is a\n       good equidistant projection.\n\n       Large areas having a primarily North-South aspect, particularly those\n       spanning the Equator, need some other choices.  The Cassini projection\n       is a good choice for an equidistant projection (for instance, a Cassini\n       projection with a central meridian of 80 degrees West produces an\n       attractive map of the Americas). The cylindrical equal-area, Albers\n       equal-area conic, sinusoidal, Mollweide and Hammer projections are\n       possible choices for equal-area projections.  A good conformal\n       projection in this situation is the Transverse Mercator, which alas, is\n       not yet implemented.\n\n       Small areas begin to get into a realm where the ellipticity of the\n       Earth affects the map scale.  This package does not attempt to handle\n       accurate mapping for large-scale topographic maps.  If slight scale\n       errors are acceptable in your application, then any of the projections\n       appropriate to large areas should work for small ones as well.\n\n       There are a few projections that are included for their special\n       properties.  The orthographic projection produces views of the Earth as\n       seen from space.  The gnomonic projection produces a map on which all\n       great circles (the shortest distance between two points on the Earth's\n       surface) are rendered as straight lines.  While this projection is\n       useful for navigational planning, it has extreme distortions of shape\n       and area, and can display only a limited area of the Earth\n       (substantially less than a hemisphere).\n\nKEYWORDS\n       geodesy, map, projection\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007 Kevin B.
