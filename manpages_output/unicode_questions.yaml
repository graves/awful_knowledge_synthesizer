Form form takes one of the\n\t      following values: D (canonical decomposition), C (canonical\n\t      decomposition, followed by canonical composition), KD\n\t      (compatibility decomposition), or KC (compatibility\n\t      decomposition, followed by canonical composition).\n\n       ::unicode::normalizeS form string\n\t      A shortcut to ::unicode::tostring [unicode::normalize \\$form\n\t      [::unicode::fromstring \\$string]].  Normalizes Tcl string and\n\t      returns normalized string.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       % ::unicode::fromstring \"\\u0410\\u0411\\u0412\\u0413\"\n       1040 1041 1042 1043\n       % ::unicode::tostring {49 50 51 52 53}\n       12345\n       %"
