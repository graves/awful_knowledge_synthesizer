If gpu compression is not specified then lossy\n     compression is used.\n\nOPTIONS\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -c \t       Convert to lcr format.\n\n     -f s, --flattened-image\n\t\t       Saves the flattened image as a jpeg to the output path\n\t\t       given by the -o flag.  if the output filename doesn't\n\t\t       end with .jpeg or .jpg then the file extension that was\n\t\t       given will be removed and jpeg will get added. If the\n\t\t       file that gets written out is a JPEG image, the\n\t\t       resulting image will be compressed with the default\n\t\t       compression options."

The\n\t\t       smaller the value, the smaller the compressed file\n\t\t       size. A value of 1.0 creates a lossless image.\n\n     -s n, --scale=v   Used to specify the scale factor used in the generated\n\t\t       lcr file. When used with a PSD file it indicates the\n\t\t       scale factor of the PSD file. When used with an LSR\n\t\t       file indicates which scale factor of images should be\n\t\t       kept.
