    Manpage text:

    The Safe Base allows a master interpreter to create safe, restricted
           interpreters that contain a set of predefined aliases for the source,
           load, file, encoding, and exit commands and are able to use the auto-
           loading and package mechanisms.

           No knowledge of the file system structure is leaked to the safe
           interpreter, because it has access only to a virtualized path
           containing tokens. When the safe interpreter requests to source a file,
           it uses the token in the virtual path as part of the file name to
           source; the master interpreter transparently translates the token into
           a real directory name and executes the requested operation (see the
           section SECURITY below for details).  Different levels of security can
           be selected by using the optional flags of the commands described
           below.

           All commands provided in the master interpreter by the Safe Base reside
           in the safe namespace.

    Manpage text:

    The commands available in a safe interpreter, in addition to the safe
           set as defined in interp manual page, are mediated aliases for source,
           load, exit, and safe subsets of file and encoding. The safe interpreter
           can also auto-load code and it can request that packages be loaded.

           Because some of these commands access the local file system, there is a
           potential for information leakage about its directory structure.  To
           prevent this, commands that take file names as arguments in a safe
           interpreter use tokens instead of the real directory names.  These
           tokens are translated to the real directory name while a request to,
           e.g., source a file is mediated by the master interpreter.  This
           virtual path system is maintained in the master interpreter for each
           safe interpreter created by ::safe::interpCreate or initialized by
           ::safe::interpInit and the path maps tokens accessible in the safe
           interpreter into real path names on the local file system thus
           preventing safe interpreters from gaining knowledge about the structure
           of the file system of the host on which the interpreter is executing.
           The only valid file names arguments for the source and load aliases
           provided to the slave are path in the form of [file join token
           filename] (i.e. when using the native file path formats: token/filename
           on Unix and token\filename on Windows), where token is representing one
           of the directories of the accessPath list and filename is one file in
           that directory (no sub directories access are allowed).

    Manpage text:

    When a token is used in a safe interpreter in a request to source or
           load a file, the token is checked and translated to a real path name
           and the file to be sourced or loaded is located on the file system.
           The safe interpreter never gains knowledge of the actual path name
           under which the file is stored on the file system.

           To further prevent potential information leakage from sensitive files
           that are accidentally included in the set of files that can be sourced
           by a safe interpreter, the source alias restricts access to files
           meeting the following constraints: the file name must fourteen
           characters or shorter, must not contain more than one dot (“.”), must
           end up with the extension (“.tcl”) or be called (“tclIndex”.)

           Each element of the initial access path list will be assigned a token
           that will be set in the slave auto_path and the first element of that
           list will be set as the tcl_library for that slave.

    Manpage text:

    If the access path argument is not given or is the empty list, the
           default behavior is to let the slave access the same packages as the
           master has access to (Or to be more precise: only packages written in
           Tcl (which by definition cannot be dangerous as they run in the slave
           interpreter) and C extensions that provides a _SafeInit entry point).
           For that purpose, the master's auto_path will be used to construct the
           slave access path.  In order that the slave successfully loads the Tcl
           library files (which includes the auto-loading mechanism itself) the
           tcl_library will be added or moved to the first position if necessary,
           in the slave access path, so the slave tcl_library will be the same as
           the master's (its real path will still be invisible to the slave
           though).  In order that auto-loading works the same for the slave and
           the master in this by default case, the first-level sub directories of
           each directory in the master auto_path will also be added (if not
           already included) to the slave access path.  You can always specify a
           more restrictive path for which sub directories will never be searched
