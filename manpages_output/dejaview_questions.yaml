- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dejaview`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDejaView(1)\t\t  BSD General Commands Manual\t\t   DejaView(1)\n\n\n\n\nNAME\n       DejaView -- reconstruct state in a log archive at a given time.\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       dejaview [options] <archive> <config> <date/time>\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       DejaView is a versatile tool used to reconstruct state of an identifier\n       at a given time in a log archive.\n\n       Arguments descriptions:\n\n       archive\n\t    The file path to a log archive. The archive must be a valid log\n\t    archive bundle with the suffix .logarchive.\n\n       config\n\t    The file path to a configuration file with which DejaView will use\n\t    to search the log archive. This is where you will list log lines\n\t    you are interested in viewing. See config file setup below for\n\t    more information.\n\n       date/time\n\t    The time that DejaView should reconstruct state.  The following\n\t    date/time formats are accepted:\n\n\t    ´YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+ffff'\n\t    ´YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'\n\t    ´HH:MM:SS'\n\n\t    Time must have single or double quotes surrounding it.\n\n\nCONFIG FILE SETUP\n       Essentially, the file should contain a section header, which contains\n       keys with values. Sections are led by a [section] header, followed by\n       key/value entries separated by a specific string ('=' or ':'). Key\n       names are not case sensitive. Leading and trailing whitespace are\n       removed from keys and values.\n\n       Lines beginning with '#' or ';' are ignored and may be used to provide\n       comments.\n\n\t[Simple Values]\n\tkey=value\n\tspaces in keys=allowed\n\tspaces around the delimiter = allowed\n\tyou can also use : to delimit keys from values\n\n\t[You can use comments]\n\t# like this\n\t; or this\n\n       KEYS\n\t    Required:\n\n\t    'start'\n\t    When the tool encounters the corresponding log message for this\n\t    key, it will create a new object for data to be aggregated under.\n\t    The object will be named and identified by one of the words in the\n\t    log message.  You must specify which word that will be by\n\t    encapsulating it with double curly brackets '{{ }}' in your\n\t    configuration file. See config file examples below.\n\n\t    'end'\n\t    When the tool encounters the corresponding log message for this\n\t    key, it will delete an object from the list of tracked objects.\n\t    The object deleted from the list will be identified by one of the\n\t    words in the log line.  You must specify which word that will be\n\t    by encapsulating it with double curly brackets '{{ }}' in your\n\t    configuration file. ´start' and 'end' must have matching object\n\t    identifiers to properly remove it from the list of tracked\n\t    objects.\n\n\t    Optional:\n\n\t    'subobject start'\n\t    When the tool ecounters the corresponding log message for this\n\t    key, it will create a new subobject to be aggregated under a main\n\t    object. The subobject will be named and identified by one of the\n\t    words in the log message. You must specify which word that will be\n\t    by encapsulating it with '${ }$' in your configuration file.  See\n\t    config file examples below.\n\n\t    'subobject end'/'subobject end2'\n\t    When the tool encounters the corresponding log message for this\n\t    key, it will delete a subobject from the associated main object.\n\t    The subobject deleted from the list will be identified by one of\n\t    the words in the log line. You must specify which word that will\n\t    be by encapsulating it with '${ }$' in your configuration file.\n\t    ´subobject start' and 'subobject end' must have matching object\n\t    identifiers to properly remove it from the list of tracked\n\t    objects. ´subobject end2' may be used if there are two log lines\n\t    that signal when a subobject should be removed.\n\n\t    'reboot'\n\t    When the tool encounters the corresponding log message for a\n\t    system reboot, it will delete all objects being tracked.\n\n\t    'subsystem'\n\t    Filters log messages based on the specified subsystem (e.g.\n\t    com.apple.runningboard).\n\n\n       VALUES\n\t    Values must match log event messages exactly; the pattern within\n\t    the message text of a log/trace entry. However, text that is\n\t    subject to change within that event message will be replaced with\n\t    format specifiers.\n\n\t      format specifiers:\n\t\tformed by an initial percentage sign '%' indicates a format\n\t\tspecifier, which is used to specify the type and format of the\n\t\tdata to be retrived from the log/trace entry and stored into\n\t\tthe locations of the format specifier.\n\n\t\t%s -- matches at least one character equal to\n\t\t      [a-z][A-Z][0-9][._-]\n\t\t%d -- matches at least one digit equal to\n\t\t      [0-9]\n\n\t      format specifiers encapsulated with double curly brackets '{{\n\t      }}' signifies a special word that will be used as an object\n\t      identifier.\n\n\t      format specifers encapsulated with double veritical lines '||\n\t      ||' signifies a special word that will used as return data\n\t      stored in the corresponding key.\tIf no return data is\n\t      specified, a timestamp for the event message will be returned by\n\t      default.\n\n\t      Values support marcos. This means values can contain format\n\t      strings which refer to other values in the same section.\n\n\t       [Paths]\n\t       home_dir: /Users\n\t       my_dir: %(home_dir)s/Documents\n\t       my_pictures: %(my_dir)s/Pictures\n\n\t      In the example above, %(home_dir)s would resolve to the value of\n\t      home_dir (/Users in this case) and %(my_dir)s would resolve to\n\t      /Users/Documents\n\n\n\nCONFIG FILE EXAMPLES\n       This example is specific to runningboard and encorporates all required\n       and optional key words. It also includes examples of using the vertical\n       bars as return data and using the curly brackets to aggregate data\n       under process names.\n\n\t[runningboard]\n\tstart: Now tracking process [%s<{{%s}}>:%d]\n\trole: [%s<{{%s}}>:%d] Set darwin role to ||%s||\n\tstate: [%s<{{%s}}>:%d] ||%s|| task.\n\tend: [%s<{{%s}}>:%d] Death sentinel fired!\n\treboot: Battlecruiser operational.\n\tsubsystem: com.apple.runningboard\n\n\t[runningboard again]\n\tstart: Now tracking process [%s<{{%s}}>:%d]\n\trole: [%s<{{%s}}>:%d] Set darwin role to ||%s||\n\tstate: [%s<{{%s}}>:%d] ||%s|| task.\n\tend: [%s<{{%s}}>:%d] Death sentinel fired!\n\tsubobject start: Assertion ${%s}$ (%s:%s<{{%s}}>) will be created as\n       ||active||\n\tsubobject end: Invalidating assertion ${%s}$ (%s:%s<{{%s}}>) from\n       originator %d\n\tsubobject end2: Assertion did invalidate due to timeout: ${%s}$\n       (%s:%s<{{%s}}>)\n\treboot: Battlecruiser operational.\n\tsubsystem: com.apple.runningboard\n\n\n\nOUTPUT EXAMPLES\n       Output will only contain information that the DejaView encountered\n       while reading the log archive.
