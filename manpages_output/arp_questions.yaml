If the\n\t     ifscope keyword is specified, the entry specific to the interface\n\t     will be deleted."

The Ethernet address is given as\n\t     six hex bytes separated by colons.  The entry will be permanent\n\t     unless the word temp is given in the command.  If the word pub is\n\t     given, the entry will be “published”; i.e., this system will act\n\t     as an ARP server, responding to requests for hostname even though\n\t     the host address is not its own.  In this case the ether_addr can\n\t     be given as auto in which case the interfaces on this host will\n\t     be examined, and if one of them is found to occupy the same\n\t     subnet, its Ethernet address will be used.  If the only keyword\n\t     is also specified, this will create a “published (proxy only)”\n\t     entry.  This type of entry is created automatically if arp\n\t     detects that a routing table entry for hostname already exists."
