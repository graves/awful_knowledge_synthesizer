    PREFA
    
    THIS EIGHTH EDITION of Trigonometry preserves the popular format and style of
    the previous editions. It is a standard right triangle approach to trigonometry, pro-
    viding a smooth and integrated development of the six trigonometric functions
    from point-on-the-terminal-side, to right triangle, to circular function definitions.
    Nearly every section is written so that it can be discussed in a typical class session.
    
    The focus of the text is on understanding the definitions and principles of
    trigonometry and their applications to problem solving. Exact values of the trig-
    onometric functions are emphasized throughout the text. The clean layout and
    conversational style encourage students to read the text. Historical vignettes are
    placed throughout the text to give students an appreciation for the rich history
    behind trigonometry and the people who contributed to its development.
    
    The text covers all the material usually taught in trigonometry. There is also
    an appendix that provides a review of algebra, geometry, functions, and inverse
    functions. The appendix sections can be used as a review of topics with which
    students may already be familiar, or they can be used to provide instruction for
    students encountering these concepts for the first time.
    
    Numerous calculator notes are placed throughout the text to help students
    calculate values when appropriate. As there are many different models of graph-
    ing calculators, and each model has its own set of commands, we have tried to
    avoid overuse of specific key icons or command names.
    
    NEW TO THIS EDITION
    Content Changes
  - |-
    The following list describes the major content changes you will see in this eighth edition.
    
    = APPENDIX: In response to a number of requests, we have added two new
    appendix sections providing a substantial review of algebra and geometry. The
    content of these appendix sections focuses on the specific concepts and skills
    students will see or need at various points throughout the text.
    
    =m SECTION 1.1: A proof of the Pythagorean Theorem has been moved out of this
    section and placed in the appendix.
    
    m SECTION 7.5: A general formula for the vector component form of a vector is
    now given, based on the magnitude of the vector and the angle it makes with
    the positive x-axis.
    
    NEW EXAMPLES New examples have been added to every chapter to help students
    gain a better understanding of certain concepts.

    x PREFACE
    
    NEW OR REVISED EXERCISES Many of the exercises have been revised, and new
    exercises and application problems have been added in some sections to help stu-
    dents better grasp key concepts, and to help motivate students and stimulate their
    interest in trigonometry. The most significant additions include the following.
    
    m SECTION 4.4: We have added more exercises to this section, giving students the
    opportunity for additional practice identifying the period, range, and horizon-
    tal and vertical translations for the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant
    functions.
    
    m SECTION 6.1: We have increased the number of exercises that require approxi-
    mating solutions and for which the argument of the trigonometric function
    involves a horizontal translation.
    
    =m SECTION 6.3: There are now exercises containing trigonometric functions with
    arguments in the form Bx + C; we have also increased the number of applica-
    tion problems.
    
    EXTENDING THE CONCEPTS More of these problems have been added throughout
    the text to give students additional challenges and the opportunity to explore cer-
    tain topics further.

    CONTINUING FEATURES
    
    THREE DEFINITIONS — All three definitions for the trigonometric functions are contained
    in the text. The point-on-the-terminal-side definition is contained in Section 1.3; the
    right triangle definition in Section 2.1; and circular functions are given in Section 3.3.
    
    THEMES There are a number of themes that run throughout the text, and we have
    clearly marked these themes in the problem sets with appropriate icons. Here is a
    list of the icons and corresponding themes.

    CHAPTER INTRODUCTIONS Each chapter opens with an introduction in which a
    real-world application, historical example, or link between topics is used to stimu-
    late interest in the chapter. Many of these introductions are expanded in the chap-
    ter and then carried through to topics found later in the text. Many sections open
    in a similar fashion.
    
    STUDY SKILLS Study Skills sections, found in the first six chapter openings, help
    students become organized and efficient with their time.
    
    STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES Each section begins with a list of student learn-
    ing objectives, which describe the specific, measurable knowledge and skills that

    students are expected to achieve. Learning objectives help the student identify and
    focus on the important concepts in each section, and increase the likelihood of their
    success by establishing clear goals. For instructors, learning objectives can help in
    organizing class lessons and learning activities, and in creating student assessments.

    to the next example. Instructors may want to use them as in class examples or to
    provide guided practice activities in class. Answers are given in the answers section
    in the back of the text.

    SING TECHNOLOGY Using Technology sections throughout the text show how graphing calculator technology can be used to enhance the topics covered. All graphing calculator material is optional, but even if you are not using graphing calculator technology in your classroom, these segments can provide additional insight into the standard trigonometric procedures and problem solving found in the section.

    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY Each problem set begins with a set of questions that
    
    a.
    
    focus on grasping the main ideas and understanding the vocabulary and terminology
    ology presented in that particular section. Most of these questions are short-answer
    but some also include matching or other formats.
    
    included | in some of the problem sets These S@ GXercises are clearly marked with a
    special icon and can easily be omitted if you are not using this technology in your
    classroom. Some of these exercises are investigative in nature, and help prepare
    
    students for concepts that are introduced in following sections.
    APPLICATIONS Application problems are titled according to subject and indexed for
    
    easy reference. We have found that students are more likely to put effort and effort
    into application problems if they do not have to work an overwhelming number of
    them at one time, and if they work on them every day. For this reason, a few applica-
    tion problems are included toward the end of almost every problem set in the text.
    
    Practice Problems give students an opportunity to explore certain topics further or take on
    a more challenging problem.
  - |-
    “MS Beginning with Chapter 2, each problem set contains a few
    review problems. Where appropriate, the review problems cover material that will
    be needed in the next section; otherwise, they cover material from the previous
    chapter. Continual review will help students retain what they have learned in pre-
    vious chapters and reinforce main ideas.
    
    OBJECTIVES AND ASSESSMENTS Multiple-choice questions are provided at
    the end of every problem set and are designed to be used in or outside of class to
    assess student learning. Each question directly corresponds to one of the student
    learning objectives for that section. Answers to these questions are not avail-
    able to students, but are provided for instructors in the Instructor’s Edition and
    the Instructor’s Solutions Manual. These problems can be especially useful for
    schools and institutions required to provide documentation and data relating to
    assessment of student learning outcomes.
    
    PROJECTS Each chapter concludes with a group project which involves
    some interesting problem or application that relates to or extends the ideas intro-
    duced in the chapter. Many of the projects emphasize the connection of math-
    ematics with other disciplines, or illustrate real-life situations in which trigonometry
    is used. The projects are designed to be used in class with groups of three or four
    students each, but the problems could also be given as individual assignments for
    students wanting an additional challenge.

    **PROJECTS**  
    At least one research project is also offered at the end of each chapter. The research projects ask students to investigate a historical topic or personage that is in some way connected to the material in the chapter, and are intended to promote an appreciation for the rich history behind trigonometry. Students may find the local library or the Internet to be helpful resources in doing their research.
    
    **SECTIONS**  
    Section summaries contain key terms and concepts found in the chapter. The margins in the chapter summaries contain examples that illustrate the topics being reviewed.
    
    **REVIEW PROBLEMS**  
    Every chapter ends with a chapter test that contains a representative of the problems covered in the chapter. The chapter tests were designed to be short enough so that a student may work all the problems in a reasonable amount of time. If you want to reduce the number of problems even farther, you can assign just the odd or the even problems. Answers to both odd and even problems for chapter tests are given in the back of the text.
    
    **CUMULATIVE TESTS**  
    To help students review previous learning and better retain information, three cumulative tests appear in the text. These are similar to the chapter tests, except that the questions pertain to all the sections in the book up to that point. The Cumulative Tests are good resources for students studying for a midterm or final exam. Answers to both odd and even problems for cumulative tests are given in the back of the text.

    A SPECIAL NO
    
    Trigonometry can be a very enjoyable subject to study. You will find that there
    are many interesting and useful problems that trigonometry can be used to solve.
    However, many trigonometry students are apprehensive at first because they are
    worried they will not understand the topics we cover. When we present a new
    topic that they do not grasp completely, they think something is wrong with them
    for not understanding it. On the other hand, some students are excited about the
    course from the beginning. They are not worried about understanding trigonom-
    etry and, in fact, expect to find some topics difficult.
    
    What is the difference between these two types of students?
  - |-
    Those who are excited about the course know from experience (as you do) that a certain amount of confusion is associated with most new topics in mathematics. They don’t worry about it, because they also know that the confusion gives way to understanding in the process of reading the text, working problems, and getting their questions answered. If they find a topic difficult, they work as many problems as necessary to grasp the subject. They don’t wait for the understanding to come to them; they go out and get it by working lots of problems. In contrast, the students who lack confidence tend to give up when they become confused. Instead of working more problems, they sometimes stop working problems altogether — and that, of course, guarantees that they will remain confused.
    
    If you are worried about this course because you lack confidence in your ability to understand trigonometry, and you want to change the way you feel about mathematics, then look forward to the first topic that causes you some confusion. As soon as that topic comes along, make it your goal to master it, in spite of your apprehension. You will see that each and every topic covered in this course is one you can eventually master, even if your initial introduction to it is accompanied by some confusion. As long as you have passed a college-level intermediate algebra course (or its equivalent), you are ready to take this course.
    
    It also helps a great deal if you make a solid commitment to your trigonometry course. If you are not completely committed to a class, then you will tend to give less than your full effort. Consider this quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s *Faust:
  - |-
    Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always
    ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one
    elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid
    plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence
    moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise
    have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising
    in one’s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents, meetings and material
    assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.
    Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius,
    power and magic in it.

    A SPECIAL NOTE TO THE STUDENT
    
    If you are committed to doing well in trigonometry, the following suggestions
    will be important to you.
    
    See your teacher. You are there. Missing class and then expecting to find out what
    went on from someone else is not the same as being there yourself.
    
    Read the textbook. This text was written for you! It is best to read beforehand
    the section that will be covered in class. Reading in advance, even if you do
    not understand everything you read, helps prepare a foundation for what you
    will see in class. Also, your instructor may not have time to discuss everything
    you need to know from a section, so you may need to pick up some things on
    your own.

    Mathematics 15  
    Working problems. The more problems you work, the better  
    you will become at working them. The answers to the odd-numbered problems  
    are given in the back of the book. When you have finished an assignment, be  
    sure to Compare your answers with those in the text. If you have made a mus-  
    
    take, find out what it is, and correct it.
    
    Do it on your own. Don’t be misled into thinking that someone else’s work  
    is your own. Having someone else show you how to work a problem is not the  
    same as working that problem yourself. It is okay to get help when you are  
    stuck, As a matter of fact, it is a good idea. First be sure you do the work your-  
    self, and that you can work the entire problem correctly on your own later on.

    The Six Trigonometric
    
    Functions
    
    Introduction
    
    The history of mathematics is a spiral of knowledge passed down from one gen-
    eration to another. Each person in the history of mathematics is connected to the
    others along this spiral. In Italy, around 500 B.c., the Pythagoreans discovered a
    relationship between the sides of any right triangle. That discovery, known as the
    Pythagorean Theorem, is the foundation on which the Spiral of Roots shown in
    Figure 1 is built. The Spiral of Roots gives us a way to visualize square roots of
    positive integers.
    
    Figure 1
    
    In Problem Set 1.1, you will have a chance to construct the Spiral of Roots
    yourself.

    Study Skills
    
    At the beginning of the first few chapters of this text you will find a Study
    Skills section in which we list the skills that are necessary for success in
    trigonometry. If you have just completed an algebra class successfully, you
    have acquired most of these skills. If it has been some time since you have
    taken a math class, you must pay attention to the sections on study skills.
    Here is a list of things you can do to develop effective study skills.

    EM Put Yourself on a Schedule The general rule is that you spend two hours
    on homework for every hour you are in class. Make a schedule for your-
    self, setting aside at least six hours a week to work on trigonometry. Once
    you make the schedule, stick to it. Don’t just complete your assignments
    and then stop. Use all the time you have set aside. If you complete an
    assignment and have time left over, read the next section in the text and
    work more problems. As the course progresses you may find that six hours
    a week is not enough time for you to master the material in this course. If
    it takes you longer than that to reach your goals for this course, then that’s
    how much time it takes. Trying to get by with less will not work.
    
    Find Your Mistakes and Correct Them There is more to studying
    trigonometry than just working problems. You must always check your
    answers with those in the back of the text. When you have made a mis-
    take, find out what it is and correct it. Making mistakes is part of the
    process of learning mathematics. The key to discovering what you do not
    understand can be found by correcting your mistakes.
    
    FE] Imitate Success Your work should look like the work you see in this
    text and the work your instructor shows. The steps shown in solving
    problems in this text were written by someone who has been successful
    in mathematics. The same is true of your instructor. Your work should
    imitate the work of people who have been successful in mathematics.
    
    23 Memorize Definitions and Identities You may think that memoriza-
    tion is not necessary if you understand a topic you are studying. In trigo-
    nometry, memorization is especially important. In this chapter, you will
    be presented with the definition of the six trigonometric functions that
    you will use throughout your study of trigonometry. We have seen many
    bright students struggle with trigonometry simply because they did not
    memorize the definitions and identities when they were first presented.

    Introduction
    
    Table 1 is taken from the trail map at the Northstar California Ski Resort in Lake
    Tahoe, California. The table gives the length of some of the chair lifts at Northstar,
    along with the change in elevation from the beginning of the lift to the end of the lift.
    
    Right triangles are good mathematical models for chair lifts. In this section
    we review some important items from geometry, including right triangles. Let’s
    begin by looking at some of the terminology associated with angles.
    
    Angles in General
    
    An angle is formed by two rays with the same end point. The common end point is
    called the vertex of the angle, and the rays are called the sides of the angle.
    
    In Figure 1 the vertex of angle 6 (theta) is labeled O, and A and B are points
    on each side of 6. Angle @ can also be denoted by AOB, where the letter associated
    with the vertex is written between the letters associated with the points on each side.
    
    We can think of 6 as having been formed by rotating side OA about the ver-
    tex to side OB. In this case, we call side OA the initial side of 6 and side OB the
    terminal side of @.
    
    When the rotation from the initial side to the terminal side takes place in a
    counterclockwise direction, the angle formed is considered a positive angle. If the
    rotation is in a clockwise direction, the angle formed is a negative angle (Figure 2).

    Degree Measure
    
    Vv
    
    One way to measure the size of an angle is with degree measure. The angle formed
    by rotating a ray through one complete revolution has a measure of 360 degrees,
    written 360° (Figure 3).
    
    One complete One degree (1°), then, is 1/360 of a full rotation. Likewise, 180° is one-half of
    revolution = 360° a full rotation, and 90° is half of that (or a quarter of a rotation). Angles that mea-
    Figure 3 ure 90° are called right angles, while angles that measure 180° are called straight

    angles. Angles that measure between 0° and 90° are called acute angles, while angles
    that measure between 90° and 180° are called obtuse angles (see Figure 4).

    Figure 4
    
    If two angles have a sum of 90°, then they are called complementary angles,
    and we say each is the complement of the other. Two angles with a sum of 180° are
    called supplementary angles.
    
    NOTE To be precise, we should say “two angles, the sum of the measures of
    which is 180°, are called supplementary angles” because there is a difference
    between an angle and its measure. However, in this text, we will not always draw
    the distinction between an angle and its measure. Many times we will refer to
    “angle 0” when we actually mean “the measure of angle 0.”
  - |-
    NOTE The little square by the vertex of the right angle in Figure 4 is used to
    indicate that the angle is a right angle. You will see this symbol often in the text.

    a. The complement of 40° is 50° since 40° + 50° = 90°.
    The supplement of 40° is 140° since 40° + 140° = 180°.
    b. The complement of 110° is —20° since 110° + (—20°) = 90°.
    The supplement of 110° is 70° since 110° + 70° = 180°.
    2 c. The complement of 6 is 90° — 6 since 6 + (90° — 6) = 90°.
    The supplement of @ is 180° — 6 since 6 + (180° — @) = 180°. a
    c a Triangles
    A triangle is a three-sided polygon. Every triangle has three sides and three angles.
    A c We denote the angles (or vertices) with uppercase letters and the lengths of the sides
    b with lowercase letters, as shown in Figure 5. It is standard practice in mathematics to
    Figure 5 label the sides and angles so that a is opposite A, bis opposite B, and c is opposite C.

    There are different types of triangles that are named according to the rela-
    tive lengths of their sides or angles (Figure 6). In an equilateral triangle, all three
    sides are of equal length and all three angles are equal. An isosceles triangle has
    two equal sides and two equal angles. If all the sides and angles are different, the
    triangle is called scalene. In an acute triangle, all three angles are acute. An obtuse
    triangle has exactly one obtuse angle, and a right triangle has one right angle.

    Special Triangles
    
    As we will see throughout this text, right triangles are very important to the study
    of trigonometry. In every right triangle, the longest side is called the hypotenuse,
    and it is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides are called the /egs of
    the right triangle. Because the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180°, the other
    two angles in a right triangle must be complementary, acute angles. The Pythago-
    rean Theorem that we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter gives us the
    relationship that exists among the sides of a right triangle.
    
    Pythagorean Theorem
    
    In any right triangle, the square of the length of the longest side (called the
    hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two
    sides (called legs).
    
    If C = 90°,
    then c² = a² + b².

    There are many ways to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. We offer one proof
    in Appendix A.2. The Group Project at the end of this chapter introduces several
    more of these ways.

    SOLUTION Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives us a quadratic equation
    to solve.
    (x +7 +x? = 137
    x? + 14x + 49 + x7 = 169 Expand (x + 7) and 137
    2x7 + 14x + 49 = 169 Combine similar terms
    2x7 + 14x — 120 = 0 Add —169 to both sides
    x + 7x — 60=0 Divide both sides by 2
    (x — 5)\(x + 12) = 0 Factor the left side
    x—5=0 or x+12=0 Set each factor to 0
    x=5 or x=-12
    Our only solution is x = 5. We cannot use x = —12 because x is the length of a
    side of triangle ABC and therefore cannot be negative. a
    
    NOTE The lengths of the sides of the triangle in Example 2 are 5, 12, and 13.
    Whenever the three sides in a right triangle are natural numbers, those three num-
    bers are called a Pythagorean triple.

    SECTION 1.1 Angles, Degrees, and Special Triangles 7
    
    To find the horizontal distance covered by a person riding the chair lift, we
    use the Pythagorean Theorem:
    
    5,900² = x² + 1,250² Pythagorean Theorem
    34,810,000 = x² + 1,562,500 Simplify squares
    x² = 34,810,000 — 1,562,500 Solve for x²
    x² = 33,247,500 Simplify the right side
    x = √33,247,500
    x = 5,766 ft To the nearest foot
    
    A rider getting on the lift at point A and riding to point B will cover a horizontal
    distance of approximately 5,766 feet. a
    
    Before leaving the Pythagorean Theorem, we should mention something
    about Pythagoras and his followers, the Pythagoreans. They established them-
    selves as a secret society around the year 540 B.C. The Pythagoreans kept no written
    record of their work; everything was handed down by spoken word. Their
    influence was not only in mathematics, but also in religion, science, medicine, and
    music. Among other things, they discovered the correlation between musical notes
    and the reciprocals of counting numbers, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and so on. In their daily lives they
    followed strict dietary and moral rules to achieve a higher rank in future lives. The
    British philosopher Bertrand Russell has referred to Pythagoras as “intellectually
    one of the most important men that ever lived.”
    
    The 30°-60°-90° Triangle
  - |-
    In any right triangle in which the two acute angles are 30° and 60°, the longest side (the hypotenuse) is always twice the shortest side (the side opposite the 30° angle), and the side of medium length (the side opposite the 60° angle) is always √3 times the shortest side (Figure 11).

    To verify the relationship between the sides in this triangle, we draw an equilateral triangle (one in which all three sides are equal) and label half the base with $30^\circ$ $30^\circ$ (Figure 12).
    The altitude $h$ (the colored line) bisects the base. We have two $30^\circ$—$60^\circ$—$90^\circ$ triangles. The longest side in each is $2t$. We find that $h$ is $\sqrt{3}$ by applying the Pythagorean Theorem.
    $$
    \frac{2t}{2} = t \\
    h^2 + t^2 = (2t)^2 \\
    h^2 + t^2 = 4t^2 \\
    h^2 = 3t^2 \\
    h = \sqrt{3}t

    SECTION 1.1 f Angles, Degrees, and Special Triangles
    
    SOLUTION The triangle formed by the ladder, the wall, and the ground is a
    30°— 60°— 90° triangle. If we let x represent the distance from the bottom of the
    ladder to the wall, then the length of the ladder can be represented by 2x. The
    distance from the top of the ladder to the ground is x V3, since it is opposite the
    60° angle (Figure 15). It is also given as 4 feet. Therefore,
    
    xV3=4
    
    xX =

    and denominator by V3.

    The distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, x, is AV’3/3 feet,
    
    so the length of the ladder, 2x, must be 83/3 feet. Note that these lengths are
    given in exact values. If we want a decimal approximation for them, we can
    
    replace V3 with 1.732 to obtain
    4V3 _ 4(1.732)

    The 45°—45°—90° Triangle
    
    If the two acute angles in a right triangle are both 45°, then the two shorter
    
    sides (the legs) are equal and the longest side (the hypotenuse) is V2 times as
    long as the shorter sides. That is, if the shorter sides are of length ¢, then the
    
    longest side has length rV2 (Figure 16).

    To verify this relationship, we simply note that if the two acute angles are  
    equal, then the sides opposite them are also equal. We apply the Pythagorean  
    Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.
    
    hypotenuse = √(7² + f°)

    PROBLEM 6 EXAMPLE 6 A 10-foot rope connects the top of a tent pole to the ground. If  
    Repeat Example 6 if an 8-foot rope is used. (Figure 17)
    
    A  
    
    Figure 17  
    
    SOLUTION Assuming that the tent pole forms an angle of 90° with the ground,  
    45° the triangle formed by the rope, tent pole, and the ground is a 45°—45°—90°  
    triangle (Figure 18).
    
    If we let x represent the length of the tent pole, then the length of the rope,  
    10 in terms of x, is x√2. It is also given as 10 feet. Therefore,  
    x√2 = 10

    The length of the tent pole is 5√2 feet. Again, 5√2 is the exact value of the  
    length of the tent pole. To find a decimal approximation, we replace √2 with  
    1.414 to obtain  
    
    5√2 ~ 5(1.414) = 7.07 ft |

    PROBLEM SET
    
    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY
    
    For Questions 1 through 7, fill in each blank with the appropriate word or number.
    
    1. For a positive angle, the rotation from the initial side to the terminal side takes
    place in a clockwise direction. For a negative angle, the rotation takes place in a
    counterclockwise direction.
    2. Two angles with a sum of 90° are called complementary angles, and when the sum is 180°
    they are called supplementary angles.
    
    3. In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is always 180°.
    
    4. In a right triangle, the longest side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called legs.
    
    5. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the
    sum of the squares of the legs.
    
    6. In a 30°—60°—90° triangle, the hypotenuse is always twice the shortest side, and
    the side opposite the 60° angle is always √3 times the shortest side.
    
    7. In a 45°—45°—90° triangle, the legs are always equal and the hypotenuse is
    always √2 times either leg.
    
    8. Match each term with the appropriate angle measure.
    
    a. Right i, 0° < θ < 90°
    
    b. Straight ii, θ = 90°
    
    c. Acute iii. 90° < θ < 180°

    The book *The Closing of the American Mind* by Allan Bloom was published in 1987 and spent many weeks on the bestseller list. In the book, Mr. Bloom recalls being in a restaurant in France and overhearing a waiter call another waiter a "Cartesian." He goes on to say that French people today define themselves in terms of the philosophy of either René Descartes (1595-1650) or Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Followers of Descartes are sometimes referred to as Cartesians.

    16 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions
    
    As a philosopher, Descartes is responsible for the statement "I think, therefore I
    am." In mathematics, Descartes is credited with, among other things, the invention of the rectangular coordinate system, which we sometimes call the Cartesian coordinate system. Until Descartes invented his coordinate system in 1637, algebra and geometry were treated as separate subjects. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to connect algebra and geometry by associating geometric shapes with algebraic equations. For example, every nonvertical straight line (a geometric concept) can be paired with an equation of the form y = mx + b (an algebraic concept), where m and b are real numbers, and x and y are variables that we associate with the axes of a coordinate system. In this section we will review some of the concepts developed around the rectangular coordinate system and graphing in two dimensions.
  - |-
    Rene Descartes  
    The rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinate system is shown in Figure 1. The  
    axes divide the plane into four quadrants that are numbered I through IV in a  
    counterclockwise direction. Looking at Figure 1, we see that any point in quad-  
    rant I will have both coordinates positive; that is, (+, +). In quadrant II, the form  
    is (—, +). In quadrant III, the form is (—, —), and in quadrant IV it is (+, —).  
    Also, any point on the x-axis will have a y-coordinate of 0 (it has no vertical dis-  
    placement), and any point on the y-axis will have an x-coordinate of 0 (no hori-  
    zontal displacement).

    Graph y = —>%. SOLUTION Because the equation of the line is written in slope-intercept form, we  
    
    see that the slope of the line is 3/2 = 1.5 and the y-intercept is 0. To graph the line,  
    we begin at the origin and use the slope to locate a second point. For every unit we  
    traverse to the right, the line will rise 1.5 units. If we traverse 2 units to the right,  
    the line will rise 3 units, giving us the point (2, 3). Or, if we traverse 3 units to the  
    right, the line will rise 4.5 units, giving us the point (3, 4.5). We can now connect  
    these points with a straight line to graph the line y = 3/2 x.

    Using Technology: Verifying Slope
    
    We can use a graphing calculator to verify that for any point (other than the
    origin) on the graph of the line y = 3x/2, the ratio of the y-coordinate to the
    x-coordinate will always be equivalent to the slope of 3/2, or 1.5 as a decimal.
  - |-
    Define this function as Y = 3x/2. To match the graph shown in Figure 3,  
    set the window variables so that –6 ≤ x ≤ 6 and –6 ≤ y ≤ 6. (By this, we mean  
    that Xmin = –6, Xmax = 6, Ymin = –6, and Ymax = 6. We will assume that the  
    scales for both axes, Xscl and Yscl, are set to 1 unless noted otherwise.) Use the  
    TRACE feature to move the cursor to any point on the line other than the origin  
    itself (Figure 3). The current coordinates are stored in the variables x and y. If  
    we check the ratio y/x, the result should be the slope of 1.5 as shown in Figure 4.  
    Try this for several different points to see that the ratio is always the same.

    Graphing Parabolas
    
    Recall from your algebra classes that any parabola that opens up or down can be
    described by an equation of the form
    
    y = a(x - h)^2 + k
    
    Likewise, any equation of this form will have a graph that is a parabola. The high-
    est or lowest point on the parabola is called the vertex. The coordinates of the
    vertex are (h, k). The value of a determines how wide or narrow the parabola will
    be and whether it opens upward or downward.
    
    EXAMPLE 2 At a past Washington County Fair in Oregon, David Smith,
    Jr., The Bullet, was shot from a cannon. As a human cannonball, he reached
    a height of 70 feet before landing in a net 160 feet from the cannon. Sketch the
    graph of his path, and then find the equation of the graph.
    
    SOLUTION We assume that the path taken by the human cannonball is a parabola.
    If the origin of the coordinate system is at the opening of the cannon, then the net
    that catches him will be at 160 on the x-axis. Figure 5 shows a graph of this path.
    
    Net
    
    [ a es ee ee ee ee ee ee ]

    Figure 5
    Because the curve is a parabola, we know that the equation will have the form
    y = a(x - h)^2 + k
    
    Because the vertex of the parabola is at (80, 70), we can fill in two of the three
    constants in our equation, giving us
    
    y = a(x - 80)^2 + 70
    
    To find a we note that the landing point will be (160, 0). Substituting the coor-
    dinates of this point into the equation, we solve for a.
    
    0 = a(160 - 80)^2 + 70
    
    0 = a(80)^2 + 70

    Using Technology  
    
    To verify that the equation from Example 2 is correct, we can graph the parab-  
    ola and check the vertex and the x-intercepts. Graph the equation using the  
    following window settings:  
    
    0=x = 180, scale = 20; 0 = y = 80, scale = 10  
    
    Use the appropriate command on your calculator to find the maximum point  
    on the graph (Figure 6), which is the vertex. Then evaluate the function at  
    x = 0 and again at x = 160 to verify the x-intercepts (Figure 7).

    NOTE There are many different models of graphing calculators, and each  
    model has its own set of commands. For example, to perform the previous  
    
    steps on a TI-84 we would press|2nd||CALC] and use the maximum and value  
    commands. Because we have no way of knowing which model of calculator  
    you are working with, we will generally avoid providing specific key icons or  
    command names throughout the remainder of this text. Check your calculator  
    manual to find the appropriate command for your particular model.  
    
    The Distance Formula  
    
    Our next definition gives us a formula for finding the distance between any two  
    points on the coordinate system.  
    
    The Distance Formula
  - |-
    The distance between any two points (x), y,) and (x, y) in a rectangular coor-
    dinate system is given by the formula
    
    r= √(x₁ — x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)²
    
    The distance formula can be derived by applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the
    right triangle in Figure 8. Because r is a distance, r = 0.
    
    EXAMPLE 3. Find the distance between the points (—1, 5) and (2, 1).
    
    SOLUTION It makes no difference which of the points we call (x₁, y₁) and
    which we call (x₂, y₂) because this distance will be the same between the two
    points regardless (Figure 9).

    Circles  
    Because of their symmetry, circles have been used for thousands of years in many  
    1 disciplines. For example, Stonehenge is based on a circular plan that is thought to  
    have both religious and astronomical significance.  
    (x, y) A circle is defined as the set of all points in the plane that are a fixed distance  
    . from a given fixed point. The fixed distance is the radius of the circle, and the fixed  
    (h, k) point is called the center. If we let r > 0 be the radius, (/, &) the center, and (x, y)  
    
    represent any point on the circle, then (x, y) is r units from (A, k) as Figure 11

    22 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions
    
    The circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 from Example 5 is called the unit circle because its
    radius is 1. As you will see, it will be an important part of one of the definitions
    that we will give in Chapter 3.
    
    Using Technology: Graphing a Circle
    
    To graph the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 on a graphing calculator, we must first isolate y:
    
    y^2 = 1 - x^2
    
    y = ±√(1 - x^2)
  - |-
    Because of the + sign, we see that a circle is really the union of two separate
    functions. The positive square root represents the top half of the circle and
    the negative square root represents the bottom half. Define these functions
    separately (Figure 13).

    Figure 13
    
    When you graph both functions, you will probably see a circle that is not
    quite round and has gaps near the x-axis (Figure 14). Getting rid of the gaps
    can be tricky, and it requires a good understanding of how your calculator
    works. However, we can easily make the circle appear round using the zoom-
    square command (Figure 15).

    the terminal side.
  - |-
    SOLUTION If we draw 45° in standard position, we see that the terminal side is
    along the line y = x in quadrant I (Figure 16). Because the terminal side of 45°
    lies along the line y = x in the first quadrant, any point on the terminal side will
    have positive coordinates that satisfy the equation y = x. Here are some of the
    points that do just that.
    
    Vocabulary
    
    If angle θ is in standard position and the terminal side of θ lies in quadrant I,
    then we say θ lies in quadrant I and we abbreviate it like this:
    
    θ ∈ QI
    
    Likewise, θ ∈ QII means θ is in standard position with its terminal side in quad-
    
    rant II.
    y
    
    If the terminal side of an angle in standard position lies along one of the
    axes, then that angle is called a quadrantal angle. For example, an angle of 90°
    drawn in standard position would be a quadrantal angle, because the terminal
    side would lie along the positive y-axis. Likewise, 270° in standard position is a
    quadrantal angle because the terminal side would lie along the negative y-axis
    (Figure 17).
    
    Two angles in standard position with the same terminal side are called
    coterminal angles. Figure 18 shows that 60° and —300° are coterminal angles when
    they are in standard position. Notice that these two angles differ by 360°. That is,
    60° — (—300°) = 360°. Coterminal angles always differ from each other by some
    multiple of 360°.

    Draw —45° in standard position two negative angles that are coterminal with —90°.
    and name two positive angles
    coterminal with it. SOLUTION Figure 19 shows —90° in standard position. To find a coterminal
    
    angle, we must traverse a full revolution in the positive or the negative direction.

    One revolution in the positive direction: —90° + 360° = 270°
    A second revolution in the positive direction: 270° + 360° = 630°
    One revolution in the negative direction: —90° — 360° = —450°
    A second revolution in the negative direction: —450° — 360° = —810°
    
    Thus, 270° and 630° are two positive angles coterminal with —90° and —450°

    —90°. We can find a coterminal angle by adding or subtracting 360° any number
    of times. If we let k be any integer, then the angle —90° + 360° will be coterminal
    with —90°. For example, if k = 2, then

    and calendars and in navigation. The trigonometry of that period was spherical  
    in nature, as it was based on measurement of arcs and chords associated with  
    spheres (see image at left). Unlike the trigonometry of the Greeks, our introduc-  
    tion to trigonometry takes place on a rectangular coordinate system. It concerns  
    itself with angles, line segments, and points in the plane.

    The definition of the trigonometric functions that begins this section is one of three definitions we will use. For us, it is the most important definition in the text. What should you do with it? Memorize it. Remember, in mathematics, definitions are simply accepted. That is, unlike theorems, there is no proof associated with a definition; we simply accept them exactly as they are written, memorize them, and then use them. When you are finished with this section, be sure that you have memorized this first definition. It is the most valuable thing you can do for yourself at this point in your study of trigonometry.

    30 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions
    
    Definition | = Trigonometric Functions (x, y, r Definitions) |
    If θ is an angle in standard position, and the point (x, y) is any point on the
    terminal side of θ other than the origin, then the six trigonometric functions of
    angle θ are defined as follows:
    Function Abbreviation Definition
    sin θ = y/r
    cos θ = x/r
    tan θ = y/x (x ≠ 0)
    cot θ = x/y (y ≠ 0)
    sec θ = r/x (x ≠ 0)
    csc θ = r/y (y ≠ 0)
    where x² + y² = r², or r = √(x² + y²). That is, r is the distance from the origin
    to (x, y).
    (x, y)
    As you can see, the six trigonometric functions are simply names given to
    r | y the six possible ratios that can be made from the numbers x, y, and r as shown in
    | Figure 1. In particular, notice that tan θ can be interpreted as the slope of the line
    θ corresponding to the terminal side of θ. Both tan θ and sec θ will be undefined
    when x = 0, which will occur any time the terminal side of θ coincides with the
    y-axis. Likewise, both cot θ and csc θ will be undefined when y = 0, which will
    Figure 1 occur any time the terminal side of θ coincides with the x-axis.

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1  
    Find the six trigonometric functions of θ if θ is in standard position and the point (1, —4) is on the terminal side of θ.
    
    Find the six trigonometric functions of θ if θ is in standard position and the point (—2, 3) is on the terminal side of θ.
    
    SOLUTION We begin by making a diagram showing θ, (—2, 3), and the distance r from the origin to (—2, 3), as shown in Figure 2.

    NOTE In algebra, when we encounter expressions like 3/V 13 that contain a  
    radical in the denominator, we usually rationalize the denominator; in this case,  
    
    by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by V 13.

    It is easier to use 3/V 13. In most cases we will go ahead and rationalize denominators, but you should check and see if your instructor has a preference either way.

    EXAMPLE 2 Find the sine and cosine of 45°.
    SOLUTION According to the definition given earlier, we can find sin 45° and
    cos 45° if we know a point (x, y) on the terminal side of 45°, when 45° is in stan-
    dard position. Figure 3 is a diagram of 45° in standard position.

    Because the terminal side of 45° lies along the line y = x, any point on
    the terminal side will have equal coordinates. A convenient point to use is the
    point (1, 1). (We say it is a convenient point because the coordinates are easy
    to work with.)
    Because x = 1 and y = 1 and r = √(x² + y²), we have
    r = √2
    Substituting these values for x, y, and r into our definition for sine and cosine,
    we have √2 √2
    sin 45° = — = —= = — and cos 45° = — = —= = —

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:

    A convenient point on the terminal side of 270° is (0, -1). Therefore,
    
    $$
    = V_0^2 + (-1)^2 = V_1
    $$
    
    270° =  
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \text{We have } x = 0, y = -1, \text{ and } r = 1. \\
    & \text{Here are the six trigonometric ratios for } \theta = 270^\circ. \\
    & \sin(270^\circ) = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{-1}{1} = -1, \\
    & \csc(270^\circ) = \frac{r}{y} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1. \\
    & \cos(270^\circ) = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{0}{1} = 0, \\
    & \sec(270^\circ) = \frac{r}{x} = \frac{1}{0} = \text{undefined}. \\
    & \tan(270^\circ) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{-1}{0} = \text{undefined}, \\
    & \cot(270^\circ) = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{0}{-1} = 0.
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Note that $\tan(270^\circ)$ and $\sec(270^\circ)$ are undefined since division by 0 is undefined.
    
    ---
    
    We can use Figure 1 to get some idea of how large or small each of the six trigonometric ratios might be based on the relative sizes of $x$, $y$, and $r$, as illustrated in the next example.
    
    ---
    
    **PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4**
    
    Which will be greater, $\tan(30^\circ)$ or $\tan(40^\circ)$? How large could $\tan(\theta)$ be?
    
    Which will be greater, $\cot(30^\circ)$ or $\cot(60^\circ)$?
    
    **SOLUTION**
    
    In Figure 5 we have chosen points $P$ and $Q$ on the terminal sides of $30^\circ$ and $40^\circ$ so that the x-coordinate is the same for both points. Because $40^\circ > 30^\circ$, we can see that $y_2 > y_1$. Therefore, the ratio $\frac{y_2}{x}$ must be greater than the ratio $\frac{y_1}{x}$, and so $\tan(40^\circ) > \tan(30^\circ)$.
    
    $$
    \text{Figure 5: } P(x, y_1), Q(x, y_2)
    $$
    $$
    \text{For } 40^\circ: \text{Terminal side is steeper.}
    $$
    
    As $\theta$ continues to increase, the terminal side of $\theta$ will get steeper and steeper. Because $\tan(\theta)$ can be interpreted as the slope of the terminal side of $\theta$, $\tan(\theta)$ will become larger and larger. As $\theta$ nears $90^\circ$, the terminal side of $\theta$ will be almost vertical, and its slope will become exceedingly large. Theoretically, there is no limit as to how large $\tan(\theta)$ can be.

    **Algebraic Signs of Trigonometric Functions**
    
    The algebraic sign, + or —, of each of the six trigonometric functions will depend
    on the quadrant in which θ terminates. For example, in quadrant I all six trigono-
    metric functions are positive because x, y, and r are all positive. In quadrant II, only

    **PROBLEM 5**
    If tan θ = 4/3 and θ terminates in
    quadrant III, find sin θ and cos θ.
    
    **NOTE** In Example 5 we are not
    saying that if y/r = —5/13, then
    
    y must be —5 and r must be 13.
    There are many pairs of numbers
    whose ratio is —5/13, not just —5
    and 13. Our definition for sine and
    cosine indicates we can choose
    any point on the terminal side of
    θ. However, because r is always
    positive, we must associate the
    negative sign with y.
    
    **SECTION 1.3 Bf Definition I: Trigonometric Functions 33**
    
    sin θ and csc θ are positive because y and r are positive and x is negative. Table 1
    shows the signs of all the ratios in each of the four quadrants.

    For θ in QI QII QIII QIV

    tan θ = + + — — + +
    csc θ = + + — + + —
    sec θ = + — + — + +
    cot θ = + + — — + +
    
    **EXAMPLE 5**
    If sin θ = —5/13, and θ terminates in quadrant III, find cos θ
    and tan θ.
  - |-
    SOLUTION Because sin 6 = —5/13, we know the ratio of y to r, or y/r, is —5/13.  
    We can let y be —5 and r be 13 and use these values of y and r to find x. Figure 6  
    shows θ in standard position with the point on the terminal side of θ having a  
    y-coordinate of —5.

    Figure 6
    
    To find x, we use the fact that x² + y² = r².  
    x² + y² = r²  
    x² + (—5)² = 13²  
    x² + 25 = 169  
    x² = 144  
    x = ±12  
    
    Is x the number 12 or —12?  
    Because θ terminates in quadrant III, we know any point on its terminal  
    side will have a negative x-coordinate; therefore,  
    
    x = -12  
    Using x = —12, y = —5, and r = 13 in our original definition, we have  
    sin θ = y/r = —5/13  
    cos θ = x/r = —12/13  
    tan θ = y/x = (—5)/(-12) = 5/12

    38 CHAPTER 1 Bf The Six Trigonometric Functions
    
    You may recall from the work you have done in algebra that an expression such as 
    sin @ = y/r, where (x, y) is a point on the terminal side of an angle @ in standard position and r = √(x² + y²). 
    
    To find the value of a trigonometric function, you can use the definitions of the six trigonometric functions in terms of x, y, and r. These are:
    
    sin @ = y/r  
    cos @ = x/r  
    tan @ = y/x  
    csc @ = r/y  
    sec @ = r/x  
    cot @ = x/y  
    
    Using these definitions, you can find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the coordinates of a point on the terminal side of an angle. For example, if (x, y) is a point on the terminal side of @, then:
    
    sin @ = y/r  
    cos @ = x/r  
    tan @ = y/x  
    csc @ = r/y  
    sec @ = r/x  
    cot @ = x/y  
    
    where r = √(x² + y²). 
    
    You can also use reciprocal identities to find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the value of its reciprocal. For example, if you know that csc @ = 2, then sin @ = 1/2. 
    
    You can also use ratio identities to find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the values of two other trigonometric functions. For example, if you know that sin @ = 3/5 and cos @ = 4/5, then tan @ = (3/5)/(4/5) = 3/4. 
    
    You can also use a Pythagorean identity to find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the value of another trigonometric function. For example, if you know that sin @ = 3/5, then cos @ can be found using the Pythagorean identity: sin²@ + cos²@ = 1. So, (3/5)² + cos²@ = 1 → 9/25 + cos²@ = 1 → cos²@ = 16/25 → cos @ = ±4/5. 
    
    The sign of the trigonometric function depends on the quadrant in which the angle terminates. For example, if @ is in QII, then sin @ is positive and cos @ is negative. 
    
    You can also evaluate a trigonometric function raised to an exponent by using the definitions of the trigonometric functions. For example, if sin @ = 3/5, then (sin @)² = (3/5)² = 9/25. 
    
    By using these definitions and identities, you can find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the coordinates of a point on the terminal side of an angle or the value of one trigonometric function.

    Vx" + 9 cannot be simplified further because the square root of a sum is not equal to the sum of the square roots. (In other words, it would be a mistake to write Vx? +9 as x + 3.) However, expressions such as Vx* + 9 occur frequently enough in mathematics that we would like to find expressions equivalent to them that do not contain square roots. As it turns out, the relationships that we develop in this section and the next are the key to rewriting expressions such as V.x* + 9 in a more convenient form, which we will show in Section 1.5.
    
    Before we begin our introduction to identities, we need to review some con-
    cepts from arithmetic and algebra.
    
    In algebra, statements such as 2x =x +x, x°=x-x-+x, and Z= ; are
    called identities. They are identities because they are true for all replacements of
    the variable for which they are defined.
    
    NOTE jz is not equal to ‘ when x is 0. The statement 7. = t is still an identity,
    however, since it is true for all values of x for which z- is defined.
    
    The eight basic trigonometric identities we will work with in this section are
    all derived from our definition of the trigonometric functions. Because many trig-
    onometric identities have more than one form, we will list the basic identity first
    and then give the most common equivalent forms of that identity.
    
    Reciprocal Identities
    
    Our definition for the sine and cosecant functions indicate that they are recipro-
    cals; that is,
    1 r
    
    csc 9 = — because ; =—=-—=csced
    sin 0 sn@ y/r yp
    
    NOTE We can also write this same relationship between sin @ and csc @ in
    another form as
    1
    
    1 yi,
    sin 9 = —— because =—=-=sin0
    csc 8 escO rly 4
    
    The first identity we wrote, csc 9 = 1/sin @, is the basic identity. The second
    one, sin 0 = 1/csc @, is an equivalent form of the first.

    From the preceding discussion and from the definition of cos 6, sec 0, tan 0, and
    cot 0, it is apparent that sec 6 is the reciprocal of cos 6, and cot @ is the reciprocal of
    tan 9. Table 1 lists three basic reciprocal identities and their common equivalent forms.

    40 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions
    
    Notation
    
    The notation sin² @ is a shorthand notation for (sin @)². It indicates we are to
    square the number that is the sine of @.
    
    PROBLEMS EXAMPLES
    8. If cos @ = 3/5, find cos² @. 8. If sin @ = 3/5, then sin² @ = (3/5)² = 9/25
    9. If cos @ = -4/5, find cos² @. 9. If tan @ = 3/5, find tan² @.

    Pythagorean Identities
    
    To derive our first Pythagorean identity, we start with the relationship among x, y,
    and r as given in the definition of sin @ and cos @.
    
    x² + y² = r²
    Divide through by r²
    
    x²/r² + y²/r² = 1
    
    (x/r)² + (y/r)² = 1
    Property of exponents
    
    (cos @)² + (sin @)² = 1 Definition of sin @ and cos @
    (cos @)² + (sin @)² = 1 Notation
    
    This last line is our first Pythagorean identity. We will use it many times through-
    out the text. It states that, for any angle @, the sum of the squares of sin @ and
    cos @ is always 1.
    
    There are two very useful equivalent forms of the first Pythagorean identity.
    One form occurs when we solve (cos @)² + (sin @)² = 1 for cos @, and the other form
    is the result of solving for sin @.
    
    Solving for cos @ we have
    
    (cos @)² = 1 - (sin @)²
    Solving for sin @ we have
    
    (sin @)² = 1 - (cos @)²
  - |-
    cos’ 6 = 1 — sin’ 6  
    Add —sin² @ to both sides  
    cos@ = +√(1 — sin²θ) Take the square root of both sides  
    Similarly, solving for sin 6 gives us  
    sin² θ = 1 — cos² 6  
    sin θ = +√(1—cos²θ)
    
    Our next Pythagorean identity is derived from the first Pythagorean identity,  
    cos² θ + sin² θ = 1, by dividing both sides by cos² θ. Here is that derivation:
    
    cos² θ + sin² θ = 1 First Pythagorean identity  
    cos² θ + sin² θ 1  
    = Divide each side by cos² θ  
    cos² θ cos² θ

    1 + tan² θ = sec² θ Ratio and reciprocal identities
    
    This last expression, 1 + tan² θ = sec² θ, is our second Pythagorean identity. To  
    arrive at our third, and last, Pythagorean identity, we proceed as we have earlier,  
    but instead of dividing each side by cos² θ, we divide by sin² θ. Without showing  
    the work involved in doing so, the result is
    
    1 + cot² θ = csc² θ
    
    We summarize our derivations in Table 3.

    Pythagorean Identities Equivalent Forms
    
    cos² θ + sin² θ = 1 cos θ = +√(1 — sin²θ)  
    sin θ = +√(1 — cos²θ)
  - |-
    1 + tan²θ = sec²θ  
    1 + cot²θ = csc²θ  
    
    Notice the + sign in the equivalent forms. It occurs as part of the process of taking the square root of both sides of the preceding equation. (Remember: We would obtain a similar result in algebra if we solved the equation x² = 9 to get x = ±3.) In Example 10 we will see how to deal with the + sign.
    
    PROBLEM 10 EXAMPLE 10 If sin θ = 3/5 and θ terminates in QII, find cos θ and tan θ.  
    If sin θ = −1/3 and θ terminates in QI, find cos θ and tan θ.  
    SOLUTION We begin by using the identity cos θ = ±√(1 − sin²θ). First, we  
    must decide whether cos θ will be positive or negative (it can’t be both). We are  
    told that θ terminates in QII, so we know that cos θ must be negative. Therefore  
    
    cos θ = −√(1 − sin²θ)  
    
    Now we can substitute the given value of sin θ.  
    
    If sin θ = 3/5  
    the identity cos θ = −√(1 − sin²θ)  
    becomes cos θ = −√(1 − (3/5)²)  
    = −√(1 − 9/25)  
    = −√(16/25)  
    = −4/5  
    
    Now we can find tan θ using the identity tan θ = sin θ / cos θ.  
    
    tan θ = (3/5) / (−4/5)  
    = −3/4  
    
    If sin θ = −1/3 and θ terminates in QI, find cos θ and tan θ.  
    SOLUTION We begin by using the identity cos θ = ±√(1 − sin²θ). First, we  
    must decide whether cos θ will be positive or negative (it can’t be both). We are  
    told that θ terminates in QI, so we know that cos θ must be positive. Therefore  
    
    cos θ = √(1 − sin²θ)  
    
    Now we can substitute the given value of sin θ.  
    
    If sin θ = −1/3  
    the identity cos θ = √(1 − sin²θ)  
    becomes cos θ = √(1 − (−1/3)²)  
    = √(1 − 1/9)  
    = √(8/9)  
    = 2√2/3  
    
    Now we can find tan θ using the identity tan θ = sin θ / cos θ.  
    
    tan θ = (−1/3) / (2√2/3)  
    = −1/(2√2)  
    = −√2/4

    As a final note, we should mention that the eight basic identities we have
    derived here, along with their equivalent forms, are very important in the study
    of trigonometry. It is essential that you memorize them. It may be a good idea
    to practice writing them from memory until you can write each of the eight, and
    their equivalent forms, perfectly. As time goes by, we will increase our list of iden-
    ities, so you will want to keep up with them as we go along.

    SECTION 1.5 Bf More on Identities 47
    
    The topics we will cover in this section are an extension of the work we did with
    identities in Section 1.4. We can use the eight basic identities we introduced in the
    previous section to rewrite or simplify certain expressions. It will be helpful at this
    point if you have already begun to memorize these identities.
    
    The first topic involves writing any of the six trigonometric functions in terms
    of any of the others. Let’s look at an example.
    
    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Write tan 6 in terms of sin 6.
    Write sec 6 in terms of sin 6.
    SOLUTION When we say we want tan 6 written in terms of sin 0, we mean that
    
    we want to write an expression that is equivalent to tan 6 but involves no trigo-
    nometric function other than sin 6. Let’s begin by using a ratio identity to write
    tan @ in terms of sin 6 and cos 6.
    
    Now we need to replace cos 6 with an expression involving only sin 0. Since
    cos@ = + V1 -— sin’@
    
    sin 6
    
    tan 8
    cos 6
    
    sin 0
    +V1— sin? 6
    sin 6
    
    >
    V1 — sin? @
    
    This last expression is equivalent to tan 6 and is written in terms of sin @ only.
    (In a problem like this, it is okay to include numbers and algebraic symbols
    with sin 0.) a

    **PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2**  
    Write sec θ tan θ in terms of sin θ and cos θ, and then simplify.  
    Write tan θ csc θ in terms of sin θ and cos θ, and then simplify.
    
    **SOLUTION**  
    Since sec θ = 1 / cos θ and tan θ = sin θ / cos θ, we have  
    sec θ tan θ = (1 / cos θ)(sin θ / cos θ) = sin θ / cos² θ.
    
    The next examples show how we manipulate trigonometric expressions using algebraic techniques.

    **PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3**  
    Add 1 / sin θ + 1 / cos θ.  
    Add sin θ + cos θ.
    
    **SOLUTION**  
    We can add these two expressions in the same way we would add 1 / x + 1 / y by first finding a least common denominator (LCD), and then writing each expression again with the LCD for its denominator.
    
    1 / sin θ + 1 / cos θ = (cos θ + sin θ) / (sin θ cos θ)
    
    The LCD is sin θ cos θ.
    
    **PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4**  
    Multiply (sin θ + 2)(sin θ - 5).  
    Multiply (2 cos θ + 1) cos θ - 2.
    
    **SOLUTION**  
    We multiply these two expressions in the same way we would multiply (x + 2)(x - 5). In some algebra books, this kind of multiplication is accomplished using the FOIL method.

    In the introduction to Section 1.4, we mentioned that trigonometric identities are  
    the key to writing the expression √(x² + 9) without the square root symbol. Our  
    next example shows how we do this using a trigonometric substitution.

    PROBLEM 5 EXAMPLE 5 Simplify the expression √(x² + 9) as much as possible after sub-  
    Simplify the expression √(16 — x²) stituting 3 tan θ for x.
    
    as much as possible after substituting 4 cos θ for x. SOLUTION Our goal is to write the expression x² + 9 without a square root  
    by first making the substitution x = 3 tan θ.
    
    If x = 3 tan θ  
    then the expression √(x² + 9)  
    becomes √(9 tan²θ + 9) = √(9 tan²θ + 9)  
    = √[9(tan²θ + 1)]  
    = √[9 sec²θ]  
    = 3 |sec θ|  
    
    NOTE 1 We must use the absolute value symbol unless we know that sec θ is  
    positive. Remember, in algebra, √a = a only when a is positive or zero. If it is  
    possible that a is negative, then √a = |a|. In Section 4.7, we will see how to sim-  
    plify our answer even further by removing the absolute value symbol.

    SECTION 1.5 Bf More on Identities 49  
    
    NOTE2 After reading through Example 5, you may be wondering if it is math-  
    ematically correct to make the substitution x = 3 tan 0. After all, x can be any real  
    number because x” + 9 will always be positive. (Remember: We want to avoid taking  
    the square root of a negative number.) How do we know that any real number can be  
    written as 3 tan 0? We will take care of this in Section 4.4 by showing that for any  
    real number x, there is a value of 6 between —90° and 90° for which x = 3 tan 0.  
    
    In the examples that follow, we want to use the eight basic identities we devel-  
    oped in Section 1.4, along with some techniques from algebra, to show that some  
    more complicated identities are true.  
    
    \
    
    EXAMPLE 6 Show that the following statement is true by transforming the  
    left side into the right side.  
    
    cos # tan 6 = sin 0  
    SOLUTION We begin by writing the left side in terms of sin 6 and cos @.  
    sin 8  
    os 6  
    _ cos 6 sin 6  
    
    cos 6 tan 8 = cos 6:  
    
    cos 6  
    
    = sin 6 Divide out the cos @ common to  
    the numerator and denominator  
    
    Because we have succeeded in transforming the left side into the right side, we  
    have shown that the statement cos 6 tan @ = sin @ is an identity. a  
    
    EXAMPLE 7 Prove the identity (sin 9 + cos 6)? = 1 + 2 sin 6 cos 8.  
    
    SOLUTION Let’s agree to prove the identities in this section, and the problem set  
    that follows, by transforming the left side into the right side. In this case, we begin by  
    
    expanding (sin @ + cos 6)°. (Remember from algebra, (a + 5)’ = a? + 2ab + b?.)  
    (sin 8 + cos 6) = sin? 6 + 2 sin 6 cos 6 + cos” 6

    PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM [1.1]
    
    In any right triangle, the square of the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse)

    SPECIAL TRIANGLES [1.1]
    
    In any right triangle in which the two acute angles are 30° and 60°, the longest side
    (the hypotenuse) is always twice the shortest side (the side opposite the 30° angle),
    and the side of medium length (the side opposite the 60° angle) is always √3 times
    the shortest side.
    
    If the two acute angles in a right triangle are both 45°, then the two shorter
    sides (the legs) are equal and the longest side (the hypotenuse) is √2 times as long
    as the shorter sides.

    (h, k) the center, then the equation for a circle is given by the formula
    
    (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

    STANDARD POSITION FOR ANGLES [1.2]
    
    An angle is said to be in standard position if its vertex is at the origin and its initial
    side is along the positive x-axis.
    
    COTERMINAL ANGLES [1.2]
    
    Two angles in standard position with the same terminal side are called cotermi-

    of 360°.

    rf The Pythagorean Theorem
    
    In a right angled triangle, the area of the
    square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the
    areas of the squares on the other two sides.
    Theorem of Pythagoras
    
    a OBJECTIVE: To prove the Pythagorean
    Theorem using several different geometric
    approaches.
  - |-
    Although the Babylonians appear to have had an understanding of this relationship a thousand years before Pythagoras, his name is associated with the theorem because he was the first to provide a proof. In this project you will provide the details for several proofs of the theorem.
    
    EM The diagram shown in Figure 1 was used by the Hindu mathematician Bhaskara to prove the theorem in the 12th century. His proof consisted only of the diagram and the word "Behold!" Use this figure to derive the Pythagorean Theorem. The right triangle with sides a, b, and c has been repeated three times. The area of the large square is equal to the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the area of the small square in the center. The key to this derivation is in finding the length of a side of the small square. Once you have the equation, simplify the right side to obtain the theorem.
    Figure 1
    
    1 The second proof, credited to former president James Garfield, is based on the diagram shown in Figure 2. Use this figure to derive the Pythagorean Theorem. The right triangle with sides a, b, and c has been repeated and a third triangle created by placing a line segment between points P and Q. The area of the entire figure (a trapezoid) is equal to the sum of the areas of the three triangles. Once you have the equation, simplify both sides and then isolate c" to obtain the theorem.
    
    FE] For the third "proof," consider the two squares shown in Figure 3. Both squares are of the same size, so their areas must be equal. Write a paragraph explaining how this diagram serves as a "visual proof" of the Pythagorean Theorem. The key to this argument is to make use of what the two squares have in common.

    The curved lines on the map are called contour lines; they are used to show the  
    changes in elevation of the land shown on the map. On this map, the change in ele-  
    vation between any two contour lines is 40 feet, meaning that, if you were standing  
    on one contour line and you were to hike to a position two contour lines away  
    from your starting point, your elevation would change by 80 feet. In general, the  
    closer the contour lines are together, the faster the land rises or falls. In this chap-  
    ter, we use right triangle trigonometry to solve a variety of problems, some of  
    which will involve topographic maps.

    Study Skills  
    
    The quote at the beginning of this chapter reinforces the idea that success  
    in mathematics comes from practice. We practice trigonometry by work-  
    ing problems. Working problems is probably the single most important  
    thing you can do to achieve excellence in trigonometry.  
    
    If you have successfully completed Chapter 1, then you have made a  
    good start at developing the study skills necessary to succeed in all math  
    classes. Here is the list of study skills for this chapter. Some are a continu-  
    ation of the skills from Chapter 1, while others are new to this chapter.  
    
    El Continue to Set and Keep a Schedule Sometimes we find students do  
    well in Chapter 1 and then become overconfident. They will spend less  
    time with their homework. Don’t do it. Keep to the same schedule.  
    
    FA Continue to Memorize Definitions and Important Facts The impor-  
    tant definitions in this chapter are those for trigonometric ratios in right  
    triangles. We will point these out as we progress through the chapter.
  - |-
    Ei List Difficult Problems Begin to make lists of problems that give you the most difficulty. These are the problems that you are repeatedly making mistakes with. Try to spend a few minutes each day reworking some of the problems from your list. Once you are able to work these problems successfully, you will have much more confidence going into the next exam.
    
    23 Begin to Develop Confidence with Word Problems It seems that the main difference between people who are good at working word problems and those who are not, is confidence. People with confidence know that no matter how long it takes them, they will eventually be able to solve the problem they are working on. Those without confidence begin by saying to themselves, “I will never be able to work this problem.” If you are in the second category, then instead of telling yourself that you can’t do word problems, that you don’t like them, or that they’re not good for anything anyway, decide to do whatever it takes to master them. As Aristotle said, it is practice that produces excellence. For us, practice means working problems, lots of problems.

    62 CHAPTER 2 Right Triangle Trigonometry
  - |-
    The word trigonometry is derived from two Greek words: tri’gonon, which trans-
    lates as triangle, and met’ron, which means measure. Trigonometry, then,
    is triangle measure. In this section, we will give a second definition for the trigo-
    nometric functions that is, in fact, based on “triangle measure.” We will define
    the trigonometric functions as the ratios of sides in right triangles. As you will
    see, this new definition does not conflict with the definition from Chapter 1 for
    the trigonometric functions.

    NOTE The prefix co- in cosine,  
    cosecant, and cotangent is a  
    reference to the complement.  
    Around the year 1463,  
    Regiomontanus used the term  
    sinus rectus complementi,  
    presumably referring to the cosine  
    as the sine of the complementary  
    angle. In 1620, Edmund Gunter  
    shortened this to co.sinus, which  
    was further abbreviated as cosinus  
    by John Newton in 1658.

    The two definitions agree as long as A is an acute angle. If A is not an acute angle, then  
    Definition II does not apply, because in right triangle ABC, A must be an acute angle.  
    
    Here is another definition that we will need before we can take Definition II  
    any further.  
    
    Definition = Cofunctions

    Sine and cosine are cofunctions, as are tangent and cotangent, and secant and  
    cosecant. We say sine is the cofunction of cosine, and cosine is the cofunction of sine

    As you can see in Figure 5, every trigonometric function of A is equal to the  
    cofunction of B. That is, sin A = cos B, sec A = csc B, and tan A = cot B, to name  
    a few. Because A and B are the acute angles in a right triangle, they are always  
    complementary angles; that is, their sum is always 90°. What we actually have here  
    is another property of trigonometric functions: The sine of an angle is the cosine  
    of its complement, the secant of an angle is the cosecant of its complement, and  
    the tangent of an angle is the cotangent of its complement. Or, in symbols,  
    
    sin A =cos B  
    if d+ B=90°,then Jsec A =csc B  
    tan A = cot B  
    
    and so on.  
    We generalize this discussion with the following theorem.  
    
    Cofunction Theorem  
    
    A trigonometric function of an angle is always equal to the cofunction of the  
    complement of the angle.
  - |-
    To clarify this further, if two angles are complementary, such as 40° and 50°,
    then a trigonometric function of one is equal to the cofunction of the other. That is,
    sin 40° = cos 50°, sec 40° = csc 50°, and tan 40° = cot 50°.

    SOLUTION Using the theorem on cofunctions of complementary angles, we fill
    in the blanks as follows:
    
    a. sin 60° = cos 30° Because sine and cosine are cofunctions and
    60° + 30° = 90°
    Because tangent and cotangent are cofunctions and
    
    y + (90° — y) = 90°
    
    b. tan y = cot (90° — y)
    
    Because secant and cosecant are cofunctions and
    75° + 15° = 90° |
    
    c. sec 75° = csc 15°
    
    For our next application of Definition II, we need to recall the two special
    triangles we introduced in Chapter 1. They are the 30°-60°-90° triangle and the
    45°-45°_90° triangle. Figure 6 shows both of these triangles for the case in which
    the shortest side is 1 (¢ = 1).

    Figure 6
    
    Using these two special triangles and Definition II, we can find the trigono-
    metric functions of 30°, 45°, and 60°. For example,
  - |-

    side adjacent 45° V2  
    cos 45° = = — =  
    hypotenuse V2 2  
    
    If we were to continue finding the sine, cosine, and tangent for these special angles  
    (Figure 7), we would obtain the results summarized in Table 1. Because we will be  
    using these values so frequently, you should either memorize the special triangles  
    in Figure 6 or the information in Table 1.
    
    Table 1 is called a table of exact values to distinguish it from a table of approx-  
    imate values. Later in this chapter we will work with a calculator to obtain tables  
    of approximate values.

    As you will see as we progress through the text, there are times when it is
    appropriate to use Definition II for the trigonometric functions and times when
    it is more appropriate to use Definition I. To illustrate, suppose we wanted to find
    sin 6, cos 6, and tan 6 for 8 = 90°. We would not be able to use Definition II because
    we can’t draw a right triangle in which one of the acute angles is 90°. Instead, we
    would draw 90° in standard position, locate a point on the terminal side, and use
    Definition I to find sin 90°, cos 90°, and tan 90°.
  - |-
    As shown in Figure 8, a point on the terminal side of 90° is (0, 1). The dis-
    tance from the origin to (0, 1) is 1. Therefore, x = 0, y = 1, and r = 1. From Defi-
    nition I we have
    
    y
    sin 90° = - = - = 1 ,
    r 1
    (0, 1)
    cos 90° = - = - = 0

    y 1 . . <t > xX
    tan 90° = x = 0 which is undefined
    vy
    Figure 8
    
    In a similar manner, using the point (1, 0) we can show that sin 0° = 0, cos 0° = 1,
    and tan 0° = 0.

    we have written some of the exact

    SECTION 2.2 ff Calculators and Trigonometric Functions of an Acute Angle 71
    
    Learning Objectives
    
    Add and subtract angles expressed in degrees and minutes.
    
    Convert angles from degrees and minutes to decimal degrees or
    vice-versa.
    
    Use a calculator to approximate the value of a trigonometric function.
    
    Use a calculator to approximate an acute angle given the value of a
    trigonometric function.
    
    In this section, we will see how calculators can be used to find approximations for
    trigonometric functions of angles between 0° and 90°. Before we begin our work
    with calculators, we need to look at degree measure in more detail.
    
    We previously defined 1 degree (1°) to be 1/360 of a full rotation. A degree itself
    can be broken down further. If we divide 1° into 60 equal parts, each one of the
    parts is called 1 minute, denoted 1’. One minute is 1/60 of a degree; in other words,
    there are 60 minutes in every degree. The next smaller unit of angle measure is a
    second. One second, 1”, is 1/60 of a minute. There are 60 seconds in every minute.
    
    1 °
    1° = 60’ 1’ = 1/60° 1” = 1/60’
    
    Table 1 shows how to read angles written in degree measure.
    
    TABLE 1
    
    The Expression Is Read
    
    52° 10’ 52 degrees, 10 minutes
    
    5° 27' 30” 5 degrees, 27 minutes, 30 seconds
    13° 24’ 15” 13 degrees, 24 minutes, 15 seconds
  - |-
    The ability to measure angles to the nearest second provides enough accuracy for most circumstances, although in some applications, such as surveying and astronomy, even finer measurements may be used. For example, the NASA Gravity Probe B (GP-B) mission successfully confirmed two effects predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity: the geodetic effect, in which the earth warps spacetime, and the frame-dragging effect, in which the earth drags spacetime around it as it rotates. To do so required designing four ultra-precise gyroscopes sensitive enough to detect a tilt corresponding to 0.1 milliarcsecond

    hair when seen from 10 miles away).'
    
    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Add 48° 49’ and 72° 26’.
    Add 39° 27' and 65° 36’,
    SOLUTION We can add in columns with degrees in the first column and minutes in the second column.
    48° 49’
    + 72° 26’
    120° 75’
    
    Because 60 minutes is equal to 1 degree, we can carry 1 degree from the minutes
    column to the degrees column.
    
    120° 75’ = 121° 15’ a
    
    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2. Subtract 24° 14’ from 90°.
    Subtract 39° 14’ from 87°.
    
    SOLUTION To subtract 24° 14’ from 90°, we will have to "borrow" 1° and write
    that 1° as 60’.
  - |-
    90° == 89° 60" (Still 90°)
    — 24°14’ — 24°14’
    65° 46’
    
    Decimal Degrees
    
    An alternative to using minutes and seconds to break down degrees into smaller
    units is decimal degrees. For example, 30.5°, 101.75°, and 62.831° are measures of
    angles written in decimal degrees.
    
    To convert from decimal degrees to degrees and minutes, we simply multiply
    the fractional part of the angle (the part to the right of the decimal point) by
    60 to convert it to minutes.
    
    “N\
    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Change 27.25° to degrees and minutes.
    Change 18.75° to degrees and
    minutes. SOLUTION Multiplying 0.25 by 60, we have the number of minutes equivalent
    to 0.25°.
    27.25° = 27° + 0.25°
    = 27° + 0.25(60')
    = 27° + 15’
    = 27° 15’
    Of course in actual practice, we would not show all these steps. They are shown
    here simply to indicate why we multiply only the decimal part of the decimal
    degree by 60 to change to degrees and minutes. a

    EXAMPLE 4 Change 10° 45’ to decimal degrees.  
    SOLUTION We have to reverse the process we used in Example 3. To change 45’  
    to a decimal, we must divide by 60.  
    10° 45’ = 10° + 45’  
    45 / 60  
    = 10° + 45/60  
    = 10° + 0.75°  
    = 10.75°  
    
    CALCULATOR NOTE Most scientific and graphing calculators have keys that let  
    you enter angles in degrees, minutes, and seconds format (DMS) or in decimal  
    degrees (DD). You may also have keys or commands that let you convert from one  
    format to the other. Figure 1 shows how Examples 1 through 4 might look when  
    solved on a TI-84 graphing calculator. Consult your calculator’s manual to see  
    how this is done with your particular model.

    The process of converting back and forth between decimal degrees and  
    degrees and minutes can become more complicated when we use decimal numbers  
    with more digits or when we convert to degrees, minutes, and seconds. In this text,  
    most of the angles written in decimal degrees will be written to the nearest tenth  
    or, at most, the nearest hundredth. The angles written in degrees, minutes, and  
    seconds will rarely go beyond the minutes column.  
    
    Table 2 lists the most common conversions between decimal degrees and  
    minutes.  
    
    Trigonometric Functions and Acute Angles
  - |-
    Until now, we have been able to determine trigonometric functions only for angles
    for which we could find a point on the terminal side or angles that were part of
    special triangles. We can find decimal approximations for trigonometric functions
    of any acute angle by using a calculator with keys for sine, cosine, and tangent.
    
    First, there are a couple of things you should know. Just as distance can be
    measured in feet and also in meters, angles can be measured in degrees and also in
    radians. We will cover radian measure in Chapter 3. For now, you simply need to
    be sure that your calculator is set to work in degrees. We will refer to this setting
    as being in degree mode. The most common mistake students make when finding
    values of trigonometric functions on a calculator is working in the wrong mode. As
    a rule, you should always check the mode settings on your calculator before evaluat-
    ing a trigonometric function.

    number, as are the trigonometric functions of most angles. a

    Using Technology: Working with Tables
    
    Most graphing calculators have the ability to display several values of one or
    more functions simultaneously in a table format. We can use the table feature
    
    Plot! Plot2 Plot3 to display approximate values for the sine and cosine functions. Then we can
    \¥1Esin(X) easily compare the different trigonometric function values for a given angle, or
    mana compare values of a single trigonometric function for different angles.
    
    \Y4= Create a table for the two functions Y, = sin x and Y, = cos x (Figure 3).
    \Y5= Be sure your calculator is set to degree mode. Set up your table so that you can
    \Y6= input the values of x yourself. On some calculators, this is done by setting the
    AYT= independent variable to Ask (Figure 4). Display the table, and input the fol-

    The | sin |, |cos|, and|tan| keys allow us to find the value of a trigonometric func-
    tion when we know the measure of the angle. (Remember: We can think of this value
    as being the ratio of the lengths of two sides of a right triangle.) There are some prob-
    lems, however, where we may be in the opposite situation and need to do the reverse.
    That is, we may know the value of the trigonometric function and need to find the
    angle. The calculator has another set of keys for this purpose. They are the [sin 1],
    [cos 1], and keys. At first glance, the notation on these keys may lead you to
    believe that they will give us the reciprocals of the trigonometric functions. Instead,
    this notation is used to denote an inverse function, something we will cover in more
    detail in Chapter 4. For the time being, just remember that these keys are used to find
    the angle given the value of one of the trigonometric functions of the angle.
    
    CALCULATOR NOTE Some calculators do not have a key labeled as [sin |}
    
    You may need to press a combination of keys, such as |INV]] sin |, [ARC]|sin|, or

    Sundials The Moorish sundial is designed so that the shadow of the gnomon (the vertical
    triangular piece) is consistent at each hour from one day to the next. This allows the hours
    to be marked on the sundial using a single scale that is not affected by the changes in the
    Sun’s path during the year. If the sundial is positioned so that the gnomon is aligned along
    a longitudinal line from north to south, then at exactly noon the gnomon will cast a shadow
    due north.

    As the sun moves, the shadow will sweep out an angle toward the east, labeled @ in
    Figure 7, called the shadow angle. This angle can be calculated using the formula

    The first Ferris wheel was designed and built by American engineer George W. G.
    Ferris in 1893. The diameter of this wheel was 250 feet. It had 36 cars, each of which
    held 40 passengers. The top of the wheel was 264 feet above the ground. It took
    20 minutes to complete one revolution. As you will see as we progress through
    the text, trigonometric functions can be used to model the motion of a rider on a
    Ferris wheel. The model can be used to give information about the position of the
    rider at any time during a ride. For instance, in the last example in this section,
    we will use Definition IJ for the trigonometric functions to find the height a rider
    is above the ground at certain positions on a Ferris wheel.
    
    In this section, we will use Definition II for trigonometric functions of an
    acute angle, along with our calculators, to find the missing parts to some right
    triangles. Before we begin, however, we need to talk about significant digits.
    
    Definition = Significant Digits
    
    The number of significant digits (or figures) in a number is found by counting
    all the digits from left to right beginning with the first nonzero digit on the left.
    When no decimal point is present, trailing zeros are not considered significant, 4

    According to this definition,
    
    0.042 has two significant digits
    0.005 has one significant digit
    20.5 has three significant digits
    6.000 has four significant digits
    9,200. has four significant digits
    700 has one significant digit
  - |-
    NOTE In actual practice it is not always possible to tell how many significant digits an integer like 700 has. For instance, if exactly 700 people signed up to take history at your school, then 700 has three significant digits. On the other hand, if 700 is the result of a calculation in which the answer, 700, has been rounded to the nearest ten, then it has two significant digits. There are ways to write integers like 700 so that the number of significant digits can be determined exactly. One way is with scientific notation. However, to simplify things, in this text we will assume that measurements (other than angles) written without decimal points have the least possible number of significant digits. In the case of 700, that number is one. For angles, we will assume that all angle measures written as integers are accurate to the nearest degree.
    
    The relationship between the accuracy of the sides of a triangle and the accuracy of the angles in the same triangle is shown in Table 1.
    
    TABLE 1
    
    Accuracy of Sides Accuracy of Angles
    
    Two significant digits Nearest degree
    
    Three significant digits Nearest 10 minutes or tenth of a degree
    Four significant digits Nearest minute or hundredth of a degree
    
    We are now ready to use Definition II to solve right triangles. We solve a right triangle by using the information given about it to find all of the missing sides and angles. In all the examples and in the Problem Set that follows, we will assume that C is the right angle in all of our right triangles, unless otherwise noted.
    
    Unless stated otherwise, we round our answers so that the number of significant digits in our answers matches the number of significant digits in the least significant number given in the original problem. Also, we round our answers only and not any of the numbers in the intermediate steps. Finally, we are showing the values of the trigonometric functions to four significant digits simply to avoid cluttering the page with long decimal numbers. This does not mean that you should stop halfway through a problem and round the values of trigonometric functions to four significant digits before continuing.

    **EXAMPLE 2**
    
    In right triangle ABC, a = 2.73 and b = 3.41. Find the remaining side and angles.
    
    **SOLUTION**
    
    Figure 2 is a diagram of the triangle. We can find A by using the formula for tan A.
    
    $$
    \tan A = \frac{a}{b} = \frac{2.73}{3.41}
    $$
    
    $$
    \tan A = 0.8006
    $$
    
    Now, to find A, we use a calculator.
    
    $$
    A = \tan^{-1}(0.8006) = 38.7^\circ
    $$
    
    Next we find B.
    
    $$
    B = 90.0^\circ - A
    = 90.0^\circ - 38.7^\circ
    B = 51.3^\circ

    **84 CHAPTER 2 Trigonometry**
    
    Notice we are rounding each angle to the nearest tenth of a degree since the sides we were originally given have three significant digits.
    
    We can find c using the Pythagorean Theorem or one of our trigonometric functions. Let’s start with a trigonometric function.
    
    If:
    
    $$
    \sin A = \frac{a}{c}
    $$
    
    Multiply each side by c, then divide each side by sin A:
    
    $$
    c = \frac{a}{\sin A}
    = \frac{2.73}{\sin 38.7^\circ}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \frac{2.73}{0.6252} = 4.37 \text{ (to three significant digits)}
    $$
    
    Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we obtain the same result.
    
    If:
    
    $$
    c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
    = \sqrt{(2.73)^2 + (3.41)^2}
    = \sqrt{19.081} = 4.37

    SOLUTION In triangle ADC, the side opposite A is 18 and the hypotenuse is  
    x + 18. We can use sin A to write an equation that will allow us to solve for x.  
    
    $$
    \frac{18}{x + 18} = \sin 35^\circ
    $$  
    
    (x + 18) sin 35° = 18 Multiply each side by x + 18  
    
    $$
    \frac{18}{\sin 35^\circ} = x + 18
    $$  
    
    Divide each side by sin 35°  
    
    $$
    x = \frac{18}{\sin 35^\circ} - 18

    EXAMPLE 4 In Figure 4, the distance from A to D is 32 feet. Use the informa-

    SOLUTION To find x, we write two equations, each of which contains the vari-

    h equal to each other.  
    
    $$

    EXAMPLE 5 In the introduction to this section, we gave some of the facts

    SOLUTION We know from the introduction to this section that the diameter
    of the first Ferris wheel was 250 feet, which means the radius was 125 feet.
    Because the top of the wheel was 264 feet above the ground, the distance from
    the ground to the bottom of the wheel was 14 feet (the distance to the top minus
    the diameter of the wheel). To form a right triangle, we draw a horizontal line

    information is shown in Figure 6.
  - |-
    The key to solving this problem is recognizing that x is the difference between OA (the distance from the center of the wheel to the ground) and h. Because OA is 139 feet (the radius of the wheel plus the distance between the bottom of the wheel and the ground: 125 + 14 = 139), we have
    
    x = 139 - h
    
    We use a cosine ratio to write an equation that contains h.
    
    cos 45° = (139 - h) / 125
    
    Solving for h we have
    
    125 cos 45° = 139 - h
    h = 139 - 125 cos 45°
    = 139 - 125(0.7071)
    = 51 ft To two significant digits
    
    If θ = 45°, a rider at position P, is 1/2 of the way around the wheel. At that point, the rider is approximately 51 feet above the ground.

    Soccer A regulation soccer field has a rectangular penalty area that measures 132 feet by 54 feet. The goal is 24 feet wide and centered along the back of the penalty area. Assume the goalkeeper can block a shot 6 feet to either side of his or her position for a total coverage of 12 feet. (Source: Fédération Internationale de Football Association)
    
    58. A penalty kick is taken from a corner of the penalty area at position A (see Figure 11). The goalkeeper stands 6 feet from the goalpost nearest the shooter and can thus block a shot anywhere between the middle of the goal and the nearest goalpost (segment CD). To score, the shooter must kick the ball within the angle CAE.

    PROBLEM 1
    
    The two equal sides of an isosceles triangle are each 14 centimeters. If each of the equal angles measures 48°, find the length of the base and the length of the altitude.
    
    SECTION 2.4 Applications 93
    
    Figure 1
    
    Example 1 The two equal sides of an isosceles triangle are each 24 centimeters. If each of the two equal angles measures 52°, find the length of the base and the altitude.
    
    SOLUTION An isosceles triangle is any triangle with two equal sides. The angles opposite the two equal sides are called the base angles, and they are always equal. Figure 1 shows a picture of our isosceles triangle.
    
    We have labeled the altitude x. We can solve for x using a sine ratio.
    
    sin 52° = x / 24
    then x = 24 sin 52°
    = 24(0.7880)
    = 19 cm Rounded to two significant digits
    
    We have labeled half the base with y. To solve for y, we can use a cosine ratio.
    
    cos 52° = y / 24
    then y = 24 cos 52°
    = 24(0.6157)
    = 15 cm To two significant digits
    The base is 2y = 2(15) = 30 cm. 
    
    For our next applications, we need the following definition.
    
    Definition: Angle of Elevation or Depression
    
    An angle measured from the horizontal up is called an angle of elevation. An
    angle measured from the horizontal down is called an angle of depression (Figure 2).

    Angle of
    depression
    
    Angle of

  - |-
    These angles of elevation and depression are always considered positive angles.
    Also, if an observer positioned at the vertex of the angle views an object in the
    direction of the nonhorizontal side of the angle, then this side is sometimes called
    the line of sight of the observer.

    PROBLEM 4  
    
    Rework Example 4 if the  
    distance between Amy and  
    Stacey is 0.5 inches on the map  
    and there are five contour  
    intervals between them.  
    
    NOTE On a map, all digits shown  
    are considered to be significant.  
    That is, 1600 means 1600., which  
    contains four significant figures.  
    
    SECTION 2.4 Applications 95

    EXAMPLE 4 Figure 5 shows the topographic map we mentioned in the intro-  
    duction to this chapter. Suppose Stacey and Amy are climbing Bishop’s Peak.  
    Stacey is at position S, and Amy is at position A. Find the angle of elevation  
    from Amy to Stacey.

    Contour interval = 40 ft  
    
    1 inch = 1600 ft  
    
    Figure 5  
    
    SOLUTION To solve this problem, we have to use two pieces of information from  
    the legend on the map. First, we need to find the horizontal distance between the  
    two people. The legend indicates that 1 inch on the map corresponds to an actual  
    horizontal distance of 1,600 feet. If we measure the distance from Amy to Stacey  
    with a ruler, we find it is ; inch. Multiplying this by 1,600, we have  
    
    - 1,600. = 600. ft  
    
    which is the actual horizontal distance from Amy to Stacey.
  - |-
    Next, we need the vertical distance Stacey is above Amy. We find this by
    counting the number of contour intervals between them. There are three. From
    the legend on the map we know that the elevation changes by 40 feet between
    any two contour lines. Therefore, Stacey is 120 feet above Amy. Figure 6 shows
    a triangle that models the information we have so far.

    96 CHAPTER 2 Right Triangle Trigonometry
    Our next applications are concerned with what is called the bearing of a line.
    It is used in navigation and surveying.
    Definition: Bearing
    The bearing of a line l is the acute angle formed by the north-south line and the
    line l. The notation used to designate the bearing of a line begins with N or S
    (for north or south), followed by the number of degrees in the angle, and ends
    with E or W (for east or west).
    Figure 7 shows some examples.

    Recall from geometry that when two parallel lines are crossed by a transversal,
    alternate interior angles are equal.

    EXAMPLE 7 Figure 10 is a diagram that shows how Diane estimates the height of  
    a flagpole. She can’t measure the distance between herself and the flagpole directly  
    because there is a fence in the way. So she stands at point A facing the pole and  
    finds the angle of elevation from point A to the top of the pole to be 61.7°. Then she  
    turns 90° and walks 25.0 feet to point B, where she measures the angle between her  
    path and a line from B to the base of the pole. She finds that angle is 54.5°. Use this  
    information to find the height of the pole.

    tan 54.5° = 350
    
    x = 25.0 tan 54.5°

    = 35.0487 ft
    
    Without rounding x, we use it to find / in right triangle ACD using another
    tangent ratio.

    Note that if it weren’t for the fence, she could measure x directly and use just
    one triangle to find the height of the flagpole.
    
    EXAMPLE8 A helicopter is hovering over the desert when it develops mechan-
    ical problems and is forced to land. After landing, the pilot radios his position
    to a pair of radar stations located 25 miles apart along a straight road running
    north and south. The bearing of the helicopter from one station is N 13° E, and
    from the other it is S 19° E. After doing a few trigonometric calculations, one of
    the stations instructs the pilot to walk due west for 3.5 miles to reach the road.
    Is this information correct?
    
    SOLUTION Figure 11 is a three-dimensional diagram of the situation. The heli-
    copter is hovering at point D and lands at point C. The radar stations are at A
    
    Figure 11
    
    and B, respectively. Because the road runs north and south, the shortest dis-
    tance from C to the road is due west of C toward point F. To see if the pilot has
    the correct information, we must find y, the distance from C to F.
  - |-
    The radar stations are 25 miles apart, thus 4B = 25. If we let AF = x, then
    FB = 25 — x. If we use cotangent ratios in triangles AFC and BFC, we will save
    ourselves some work.
    
    In triangle AFC cot 13° = ‘
    SO x = ycot 13°
    25 — x
    
    In triangle BFC cot 19° =
    sO 25— x= ycot 19°
    Solving this equation for x we have
    
    —x = —25 + ycot 19° Add —25 to each side
    25 — y cot 19° Multiply each side by —1
    
    xX
    
    Next, we set our two values of x equal to each other.
    
    XTX
    y cot 13° = 25 — y cot 19°
    y cot 13° + y cot 19° = 25 Add y cot 19° to each side
    y(cot 13° + cot 19°) = 25 Factor y from each term
    y= 25 Divide by the coefficient of y
    cot 13° + cot 19°

    = 3.5 mi To two significant digits
    The information given to the pilot is correct. a

    1. An angle measured upward from a horizontal line is called an angle of elevation; and an angle measured downward from a horizontal line is called an angle of depression.
    
    2. If an observer positioned at the vertex of an angle views an object in the direction of the nonhorizontal side of the angle, then this side is called the line of sight of the observer.
    
    3. The bearing of a line is the acute angle between the line and a north - line.
    
    4. The bearing of a line is always measured as an angle from the north or east, rotating toward the east or south.

    By most accounts, the study of vectors is based on the work of Irish mathematician
    Sir William Hamilton (1805-1865). Hamilton was actually studying complex
    numbers (a topic we will cover in Chapter 8) when he made the discoveries that
    led to what we now call vectors.
    
    Today, vectors are treated both algebraically and geometrically. In this sec-
    tion, we will focus our attention on the geometric representation of vectors. We
    will cover the algebraic approach later in Section 7.5. We begin with a discussion
    of vector quantities and scalar quantities.
    
    Many of the quantities that describe the world around us have both magni-
    tude and direction, while others have only magnitude. Quantities that have mag-
    nitude and direction are called vector quantities, while quantities with magnitude
    only are called scalars. Some examples of vector quantities are force, velocity,
    and acceleration. For example, a car traveling 50 miles per hour due south has a
    different velocity from another car traveling due north at 50 miles per hour, while
    a third car traveling at 25 miles per hour due north has a velocity that is different
    from both of the first two.
    
    One way to represent vector quantities geometrically is with arrows. The
    direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector quantity, and the
    length of the arrow corresponds to the magnitude. For example, the velocities of
    the three cars we mentioned above could be represented as in Figure 1.

    To distinguish between vectors and scalars, we will write the letters used to
    represent vectors with boldface type, such as U or V. (When you write them on
    paper, put an arrow above them like this: Uor V) The magnitude of a vector
    is represented with absolute value symbols. For example, the magnitude of V is
    written | V |. Table 1 illustrates further.

    V3, or Va = —V;.

    Addition and Subtraction of Vectors
    
    The sum of the vectors U and V, written U + V, is called the resultant vector. It is
    the vector that extends from the tail of U to the tip of V when the tail of V is placed
    at the tip of U, as illustrated in Figure 3. Note that this diagram shows the resultant
    vector to be a diagonal in the parallelogram that has U and V as adjacent sides.
    This being the case, we could also add the vectors by putting the tails of U and V
    together to form adjacent sides of that same parallelogram, as shown in Figure 4.
    In either case, the resultant vector is the diagonal that starts at the tail of U.
    
    Figure 3 Figure 4
    
    To subtract one vector from another, we can add its opposite. That is,
    U-V=U+(-V)
  - |-
    If U and V are the vectors shown in Figure 3, then their difference, U — V, is  
    shown in Figure 5. Another way to find U — V is to put the tails of U and V  
    together and then draw a vector from the tip of V to the tip of U, completing a  
    triangle as shown in Figure 6.

  - |-
    It may help to imagine the first hour of the journey as a sequence of separate events. First, the boat travels 12 miles directly across the river while the river remains still. We can represent this part of the trip by a vector pointing due east with magnitude 12. Then the boat turns off its engine, and we allow the river to flow while the boat remains still (although the boat will be carried by the river). We use a vector pointing due north with magnitude 5.1 to represent this second part of the journey. The end result is that each hour the boat travels both east and north (Figure 7).

    Horizontal and Vertical Vector Components
    
    In Example 1, we saw that V was the sum of a vector pointing east (in a horizontal  
    direction) and a second vector pointing north (in a vertical direction). Many times  
    it is convenient to express a vector as the sum of a horizontal and vertical vector. To  
    do so, we first superimpose a coordinate system on the vector in question so that the  
    tail of the vector is at the origin. We call this standard position for a vector. Figure 8  
    shows a vector with magnitude 15 making an angle of 52° with the horizontal.
    
    Two horizontal and vertical vectors whose sum is V are shown in Figure 9. Note  
    that in Figure 9 we labeled the horizontal vector as V,, and the vertical as V,. We call  
    V,, the horizontal vector component of V and V, the vertical vector component of V.  
    We can find the magnitudes of these vectors by using sine and cosine ratios.

    Imagine a 10-pound bronze sculpture sitting on a coffee table. The force of  
    gravity pulls the sculpture downward with a force of magnitude 10 pounds. At  
    the same time, the table pushes the sculpture upward with a force of magnitude  
    10 pounds. The net result is that the sculpture remains motionless; the two forces,  
    
    represented by vectors, add to the zero vector (Figure 16).
    
    Although there may be many forces acting on an object at the same time, if the  
    object is stationary, the sum of the forces must be 0. This leads us to our next  
    
    definition.
    
    Definition: Static Equilibrium
    
    When an object is stationary (at rest), we say it is in a state of static equilib-  
    rium. When an object is in this state, the sum of the forces acting on the object  
    must be equal to the zero vector 0. y
    
    EXAMPLE 5 Danny is 5 years old and weighs 42.0 pounds. He is sitting on a  
    swing when his sister Stacey pulls him and the swing back horizontally through  
    an angle of 30.0° and then stops. Find the tension in the ropes of the swing and  
    the magnitude of the force exerted by Stacey. (Figure 17 is a diagram of the  
    situation.)
    
    Figure 17
    
    SOLUTION As you can see from Figure 17, there are three forces acting on Danny  
    (and the swing), which we have labeled W, H, and T. The vector W is due to the  
    force of gravity, pulling him toward the center of the earth. Its magnitude is  
    | W | = 42.0 pounds, and its direction is straight down. The vector H represents the  
    force with which Stacey is pulling Danny horizontally, and T is the force acting  
    on Danny in the direction of the ropes. We call this force the tension in the ropes.
  - |-
    If we rearrange the vectors from the diagram in Figure 17, we can get a
    better picture of the situation. Since Stacey is holding Danny in the position
    shown in Figure 17, he is in a state of static equilibrium. Therefore, the sum of
    the forces acting on him is 0. We add the three vectors W, H, and T using the
    tip-to-tail rule. The resultant vector, extending from the tail of W to the tip of
    T, must have a length of 0. This means that the tip of T has to coincide with the
    tail of W, forming a right triangle, as shown in Figure 18.

    Work
    
    One application of vectors that is related to the concept of force is work. Intu-
    itively, work is a measure of the “effort” expended when moving an object by
    applying a force to it. For example, if you have ever had to push a stalled automo-
    bile or lift a heavy object, then you have experienced work. Assuming the object
    moves along a straight line, then the work is calculated by finding the component
    of the force parallel to this line and multiplying it by the distance the object is
    moved. A common unit of measure for work is the foot-pound (ft-lb).
    
    Definition = Work
    
    If a constant force F is applied to an object and moves the object in a straight
    line a distance d, then the work W performed by the force is
    
    W = (|F|cos 0@)-d
    
    where 6 is the angle between the force F and the line of motion of the object. y
    
    Our next example illustrates this situation.

    EXAMPLE 6 _ A shipping clerk pushes a heavy package across the floor. He applies
    a force of 64 pounds in a downward direction, making an angle of 35° with the
    horizontal. If the package is moved 25 feet, how much work is done by the clerk?
    
    SOLUTION A diagram of the problem is shown in Figure 19, where the 35° angle
    is represented as an angle of depression.

    Because the package moves in a horizontal direction, and not in the direc-
    tion of the force, we must first find the amount of force that is directed hori-
    zontally. This will be the magnitude of the horizontal vector component of F.
  - |-
    | F,.| = | F | cos 35° = 64 cos 35° Ib
    To find the work, we multiply this value by the distance the package moves.

    = 1,300 ft-lb To two significant digits

    2 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS (DEFINITION II) [2.1]  
    If triangle ABC is a right triangle with C = 90°, then the six trigonometric functions for angle A are  
    sin A = opposite / hypotenuse  
    cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse  
    tan A = opposite / adjacent  
    cot A = adjacent / opposite  
    sec A = hypotenuse / adjacent  
    csc A = hypotenuse / opposite  
    
    COFUNCTION THEOREM [2.1]  
    cos 10° = sin 80°  
    tan 15° = cot 75°  
    
    A trigonometric function of an angle is always equal to the cofunction of its complement. In symbols, since the complement of x is 90° — x, we have  
    sin x = cos (90° — x)  
    sec x = csc (90° — x)  
    tan x = cot (90° — x)  
    
    The values given in the table are called exact values because they are not decimal approximations.

    CONVERTING TO AND FROM DECIMAL DEGREES [2.2]
    
    To convert from decimal degrees to degrees and minutes, multiply the fractional  
    part of the angle (that which follows the decimal point) by 60 to get minutes.
    
    To convert from degrees and minutes to decimal degrees, divide minutes by 60  
    to get the fractional part of the angle.
    
    SIGNIFICANT DIGITS [2.3]
    
    The number of significant digits (or figures) in a number is found by counting the  
    number of digits from left to right, beginning with the first nonzero digit on the left.
    
    The relationship between the accuracy of the sides in a triangle and the accu-  
    racy of the angles in the same triangle is given below.
    
    Accuracy of Sides Accuracy of Angles
    
    Two significant digits Nearest degree
    
    Three significant digits Nearest 10 minutes or tenth of a degree  
    Four significant digits Nearest minute or hundredth of a degree
    
    ANGLE OF ELEVATION AND ANGLE OF DEPRESSION [2.4]
    
    An angle measured from the horizontal up is called an angle of elevation. An  
    angle measured from the horizontal down is called an angle of depression. If an  
    observer positioned at the vertex of the angle views an object in the direction of  
    the nonhorizontal side of the angle, then this side is sometimes called the line of  
    sight of the observer.
    
    DIRECTION [2.4]
    
    One way to specify the direction of a line or vector is called bearing. The notation  
    used to designate bearing begins with N or S, followed by the number of degrees  
    in the angle, and ends with E or W, as in S 60° W.
    
    VECTORS [2.5]
    
    Quantities that have both magnitude and direction are called vector quantities,  
    while quantities that have only magnitude are called scalar quantities. We repre-  
    sent vectors graphically by using arrows. The length of the arrow corresponds  
    to the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the arrow corresponds to the  
    direction of the vector. In symbols, we denote the magnitude of vector V  
    with | V |.

    ADDITION OF VECTORS [2.5]
    
    The sum of the vectors U and V, written U + V, is the vector that extends from the
    tail of U to the tip of V when the tail of V coincides with the tip of U. The sum of
    U and V is called the resultant vector.
    
    HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL VECTOR COMPONENTS [2.5]

    The 15°—75°—90° Triangle
    
    OBJECTIVE: To find exact values of the six trigonometric functions for 15° and 75° angles.
  - |-
    A In Section 2.1 we saw how to obtain exact values for the trigonometric functions
    h f using two special triangles, the 30°-60°-90° triangle and the 45°-45°-90° triangle.
    In this project you will use both of these triangles to create a 15°-75°—90° triangle.
    b 45° Once your triangle is complete, you will be able to use it to find additional exact
    8 values of the trigonometric functions.
    The diagram shown in Figure 1 is called an Ailles rectangle. It is named after a
    17? high school teacher, Doug Ailles, who first discovered it. Notice that the rectangle
    c is constructed from four triangles. The triangle in the middle is a 30°-60°—90° tri-
    angle, and the triangle above it in the upper right corner is a 45°-45°-90° triangle.
    
    Find the measures of the remaining four angles labeled A, B, C, and D.
    Figure 1
    Use your knowledge of a 30°-60°-90° triangle to find sides g and h.
    
    Now use your knowledge of a 45°-45°-90° triangle to find sides e and f-
    
    Find c and d, and then find sides a and 5 using your values for sides c, d, e, and f.
    
    Now that the diagram is complete, you should have a 15°—75°—90° triangle
    with all three sides labeled. Use this triangle to fill in the table below with
    exact values for each trigonometric function.

    [al Use your calculator to check each of the values in your table. For example, find
    sin 15° on your calculator and make sure it agrees with the value in your table.
    (You will need to approximate the value in your table with your calculator also.)

    Shadowy Origins
  - |-
    The origins of the sine function are found in the tables of chords for a circle constructed by the Greek astronomers/mathematicians Hipparchus and Ptolemy. However, the origins of the tangent and cotangent functions lie primarily with Arabic and Islamic astronomers. Called the umbra recta and umbra versa, their connection was not to the chord of a circle but to the gnomon of a sundial.
    
    Research the origins of the tangent and cotangent functions. What was the connection to sundials? What other contributions did Arabic astronomers make to trigonometry? Write a paragraph or two about your findings.

    Introduction
    
    The first cable car was built in San Francisco, California, by Andrew Smith Hal-
    lidie. It was completed on August 2, 1873. Today, three cable car lines remain in
    operation in San Francisco. The cars are propelled by long steel cables. Inside the
    powerhouse, these cables are driven by large 14-foot drive wheels, called sheaves,
    that turn at a rate of 19 revolutions per minute (Figure 1).

    In this chapter we introduce a second type of angle measure that allows us to
    define rotation in terms of an arc along the circumference of a circle. With radian
    measure, we can solve problems that involve angular speeds such as revolutions per
    minute. For example, we will be able to use this information to determine the linear
    speed at which the cable car travels.

    Learning Objectives
    
    Identify the reference angle for a given angle in standard position.
    
    Use a reference angle to find the exact value of a trigonometric  
    function.
    
    Use a calculator to approximate the value of a trigonometric function.
    
    Find an angle given the quadrant and the value of a trigonometric  
    function.
    
    In the previous chapter we found exact values for trigonometric functions of certain  
    angles between 0° and 90°. By using what are called reference angles, we can find  
    exact values for trigonometric functions of angles outside the interval 0° to 90°.
    
    Definition = Reference Angle
  - |-
    The reference angle (sometimes called related angle) for any angle 6 in standard position is the positive acute angle between the terminal side of 6 and the x-axis. In this text, we will denote the reference angle for 0 by 0.
    
    Note that, for this definition, 6 is always positive and always between 0° and 90°. That is, a reference angle is always an acute angle.

    We can use our information on reference angles and the signs of the trigonometric  
    functions to write the following theorem.
    
    **Reference Angle Theorem**
    
    A trigonometric function of an angle and its reference angle are the same,  
    except, perhaps, for a difference in sign.
    
    We will not give a detailed proof of this theorem, but rather, justify it by  
    example. Let’s look at the sines of all the angles between 0° and 360° that have a  
    reference angle of 30°. These angles are 30°, 150°, 210°, and 330° (Figure 2).
    
    $$
    \sin 150^\circ = \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}
    $$
    $$
    \text{and} \quad \sin 210^\circ = \sin 330^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}

    Figure 2
    
    As you can see, any angle with a reference angle of 30° will have a sine of $ \frac{1}{2} $ or $ -\frac{1}{2} $. The sign, + or —, will depend on the quadrant in which the angle termi-  
    nates. Using this discussion as justification, we write the following steps to find  
    trigonometric functions of angles between 0° and 360°.
    
    **Step 1** Find $ \theta $, the reference angle.  
    **Step 2** Determine the sign of the trigonometric function based on the quadrant  
    in which $ \theta $ terminates.  
    **Step 3** Write the original trigonometric function of $ \theta $ in terms of the same  
    trigonometric function of $ \theta $.  
    **Step 4** Find the trigonometric function of $ \theta $.

    **SOLUTION**
    
    For this example, we will list the steps just given as we use them.
    
    **Figure 3** is a diagram of the situation.
    
    240°  
    —180° A .  
    240° 60°  
    
    **Step 1** We find $ \theta $ by subtracting 180° from 6.  
    $ 240° - 180° = 60° $  
    
    **Step 2** Since $ \theta $ terminates in quadrant III, and the sine function is negative in quadrant III, our answer will be negative. That is, $ \sin \theta = -\sin 60° $.  
    
    **Step 3** Using the results of Steps 1 and 2, we write  
    $ \sin 240° = -\sin 60° $  
    
    **Step 4** We finish by finding $ \sin 60° $.  
    $ \sin 240° = -\sin 60° $ (Sine is negative in QIII)  
    $ \sin 240° = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $

    **EXAMPLE 3.** Find the exact value of $ \tan 315° $.  
    
    **SOLUTION** The reference angle is $ 360° - 315° = 45° $. Since 315° terminates in quadrant IV, its tangent will be negative (Figure 4).  
    
    $ \tan 315° = -\tan 45° $ (Because tangent is negative in QIV)  
    $ \tan 315° = -1 $
  - |-
    EXAMPLE 4 Find the exact value of csc 300°.
    SOLUTION The reference angle is 360° — 300° = 60° (Figure 5). To find the
    exact value of csc 60°, we use the fact that cosecant and sine are reciprocals.
    csc 300° = —csc 60° Because cosecant is negative in QIV
    = -1/csc 60° = 1/sin 60° = √3/2
    
    Recall that coterminal angles always differ from each other by multiples of 360°.
    For example, —45° and 315° are coterminal, as are 10° and 370° (Figure 6).
    
    Figure 6

    10°
    
    The trigonometric functions of an angle and any angle coterminal to it are
    always equal. For sine and cosine, we can write this in symbols as follows:
    
    for any integer k,
    sin (6 + 360°k) = sin 6 and cos (9 + 360°) = cos 6
    
    To find values of trigonometric functions for an angle larger than 360° or
    smaller than 0°, we simply find an angle between 0° and 360° that is coterminal to
    it and then use the steps outlined in Examples 2 through 4.

    Find the exact value of cos 495°.  
    Find the exact value of sin 405°.
    
    **SOLUTION**  
    By subtracting 360° from 495°, we obtain 135°, which is coterminal with 495°. The reference angle for 135° is 45°. Because 495° terminates in quadrant I, its cosine is negative (Figure 7).
    
    **cos 495° = cos 135°**  
    495° and 135° are coterminal.  
    In QI, cos θ = -cos 45°  
    Exact value:  
    $$
    \cos 495^\circ = -\cos 45^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

    Approximations
    
    To find trigonometric functions of angles that do not lend themselves to exact values, we use a calculator. To find an approximation for sin θ, cos θ, or tan θ, we simply enter the angle and press the appropriate key on the calculator. Check to see that you can obtain the following values for sine, cosine, and tangent of 250° and -160° on your calculator. (These answers are rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth.) Make sure your calculator is set to degree mode.
    
    $$
    \sin 250^\circ = -0.9397 \quad \sin (-160^\circ) = -0.3420
    $$
    $$
    \cos 250^\circ = -0.3420 \quad \cos (-160^\circ) = -0.9397
    $$
    $$
    \tan 250^\circ = 2.7475 \quad \tan (-160^\circ) = 0.3640
    $$
    
    To find csc 250°, sec 250°, and cot 250°, we must use the reciprocals of sin 250°, cos 250°, and tan 250°.
    
    **Scientific Calculator**  
    $$
    \csc 250^\circ = \frac{1}{\sin 250^\circ} = -1.0642
    $$
    $$
    \sec 250^\circ = \frac{1}{\cos 250^\circ} = -2.9238
    $$
    $$
    \cot 250^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 250^\circ} = 0.3640

    $$
    \csc 250^\circ = \sin^{-1}(250) [1/x] = -1.0642

(Remember: A reference angle is between 0° and 90°, so all six trigonometric functions of that angle will be positive.)

    EXAMPLE 6 Find @ to the nearest degree if sin 6 = —0.5592 and 6 terminates in QIII with 0° = 6 < 360°.
    
    SOLUTION First we find the reference angle using the key with the positive value 0.5592. From this, we get 9 = 34°. As shown in Figure 8, the desired angle in QIII whose reference angle is 34° is
    
    @ = 180° + 6
    = 180° + 34°
    = 214°
    If we wanted to list all the angles that terminate in QIII and have a sine of —0.5592, we would write
    
    6 = 214° + 360°k
    
    where k is any integer
    
    This gives us all angles coterminal with 214°. a
    
    CALCULATORNOTE There is a big difference between the key and the key. The key can be used to find the value of the sine function for any angle. However, the reverse is not true with the key. For example, if you were to try Example 6 by entering —0.5592 and using the key, you would not obtain the angle 214°. To see why this happens you will have to wait until we cover inverse trigonometric functions in Chapter 4. In the meantime, to use a calculator on this kind of problem, use it to find the reference angle and then proceed as we did in Example 6.
    
    EXAMPLE 7 Find @ to the nearest tenth of a degree if tan @ = —0.8541 and 6 terminates in QIV with 0° = 6 < 360°.
    
    SOLUTION Using the key with the positive value 0.8541 gives the reference angle 8 = 40.5°. The desired angle in QIV with a reference angle of 40.5° is
    
    6 = 360° — 40.5° = 319.5°
    Again, if we want to list all angles in QIV with a tangent of —0.8541, we write
    
    6 = 319.5° + 360°k
    
    where k is any integer
    
    to include not only 319.5° but all angles coterminal with it. a

    SECTION 3.2 If Radians and Degrees 135
  - |-
    If you think back to the work you have done with functions of the form y = f(x)  
    in your algebra class, you will see that the variables x and y were always real  
    numbers. The trigonometric functions we have worked with so far have had the form  
    y = f(θ), where θ is measured in degrees. To apply the knowledge we have about  
    functions from algebra to our trigonometric functions, we need to write our angles  
    as real numbers, not degrees. The key to doing this is called radian measure.
    
    Radian measure is a relatively new concept in the history of mathematics. The  
    first printed use of the term radian was by physicist James T. Thomson in examina-  
    tion questions in 1873. It is believed that the concept of radian measure was origi-  
    nally proposed by Roger Cotes (1682-1716), who was also the first to calculate 1  
    radian in degrees. The introduction of radian measure will allow us to do a number  
    of useful things. For instance, in Chapter 4 we will graph the function y = sin x on  
    a rectangular coordinate system, where the units on the x- and y-axes are given by  
    real numbers, just as they would be if we were graphing y = 2x + 3 or y = x².
    
    To understand the definition for radian measure, we have to recall from geom-  
    etry that a central angle in a circle is an angle with its vertex at the center of the  
    circle. Here is the definition for an angle with a measure of 1 radian.
    
    Definition: Radian
    
    In a circle, a central angle that cuts off an arc equal in length to the radius of  
    the circle has a measure of 1 radian (rad). Figure 1 illustrates this.
    
    Angle θ has a  
    measure of 1 radian
    
    O
    
    The vertex of θ is at the center of  
    the circle; the arc cut off by θ is  
    equal in length to the radius
    
    Figure 1
  - |-
    To find the radian measure of any central angle, we must find how many radii are in the arc it cuts off. To do so, we divide the arc length by the radius. If the radius is 2 centimeters and the arc cut off by central angle 0 is 6 centimeters, then the radian measure of 0 is 6/2 = 3 rad. Here is the formal definition:
    
    Definition: Radian Measure
    
    If a central angle θ, in a circle of radius r, cuts off an arc of length s, then the measure of θ, in radians, is given by s/r (Figure 2).
    
    θ (in radians) = s / r
    
    Figure 2
    
    As you will see later in this section, one radian is equal to approximately 57.3°.

    136 CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure
    
    Example 1
    A central angle θ in a circle of radius 5 centimeters cuts off an arc of length 15 centimeters. What is the radian measure of θ?
    
    SOLUTION We have r = 5 cm and s = 15 cm (Figure 3);
    therefore,
    θ (in radians) = s / r
    = 15 cm / 5 cm
    = 3
    
    We say the radian measure of θ is 3, or θ = 3 rad.
    
    Figure 3
    
    PROBLEM 1
    A central angle θ in a circle of radius 3 centimeters cuts off an arc of length 6 centimeters. What is the radian measure of θ?
    
    SOLUTION We have r = 3 cm and s = 6 cm (Figure 3);
    therefore,
    θ (in radians) = s / r
    = 6 cm / 3 cm
    = 2
    
    We say the radian measure of θ is 2, or θ = 2 rad.
    
    Figure 3
  - |-
    NOTE Because radian measure is defined as a ratio of two lengths, s/r, technically it is a unitless measure. That is, radians are just real numbers. To see why, look again at Example 1. Notice how the units of centimeters divide out, leaving the number 2 without any units. For this reason, it is common practice to omit the word radian when using radian measure. (To avoid confusion, we will sometimes use the term rad in this text as if it were a unit.) If no units are showing, an angle is understood to be measured in radians; with degree measure, the degree symbol ° must be written.
    
    §6=2 means the measure of ∠ is 2 radians  
    § = 2° means the measure of ∠ is 2 degrees  
    
    To see the relationship between degrees and radians, we can compare the  
    number of degrees and the number of radians in one full rotation (Figure 4).  
    S The angle formed by one full rotation about the center of a circle of radius r  
    
    will cut off an arc equal to the circumference of the circle. Since the circumference  
    of a circle of radius r is 2πr, we have  
    
    θ measures one full rotation The measure of θ  
    
    Figure 4: full rotation d = 2πr in radians is 2π  
    
    Because one full rotation in degrees is 360°, we have the following relationship  
    between radians and degrees.  
    
    360° = 2π rad  
    Dividing both sides by 2 we have  
    180° = π rad  
    
    NOTE We could also find this conversion factor using the definition of π, which  
    is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter for any circle. Because  
    
    C = πd  
    2r = r  
    
    by our definition of radian measure, π is the angle in radians corresponding to an  
    arc length of half the circumference of the circle. Therefore, π rad = 180°.

    CALCULATOR NOTE Some calculators have the ability to convert angles from
    degree measure to radian measure, and vice versa. For example, Figure 8 shows
    how Examples 3 and 4 could be done on a graphing calculator that is set to
    radian mode. Consult your calculator manual to see if your model is able to per-
    form angle conversions.
    
    Converting from Radians to Degrees

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:

    **EXAMPLE 5** Convert $ \frac{7}{6} $ to degrees.  
    **SOLUTION** To convert from radians to degrees, we multiply by $ \frac{180}{\pi} $.  
    $$
    \frac{7}{6} \text{ (rad)} = \frac{7}{6} \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 30^\circ
    $$  
    Note that $ 60^\circ $ is twice $ 30^\circ $, so $ 2 \times \frac{7}{6} = \frac{7}{3} $ must be the radian equivalent of $ 60^\circ $.  
    **Figure 9 illustrates.**
    
    **Figure 9**
    
    ---
    
    **PROBLEM 6**  
    Convert $ \frac{7}{6} $ to degrees.
    
    **PROBLEM 7**  
    Convert $ -3.4 $ to degrees. Round to the nearest tenth of a degree.
    
    ---
    
    **EXAMPLE 6** Convert $ \frac{4\pi}{3} $ to degrees.  
    **SOLUTION** Multiplying by $ \frac{180}{\pi} $ we have  
    $$
    \frac{4\pi}{3} \text{ (rad)} = \frac{4\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 240^\circ
    $$  
    Or, knowing that $ \frac{\pi}{3} = 60^\circ $, we could write  
    $$
    \frac{4\pi}{3} = 4 \times \frac{\pi}{3} = 4 \times 60^\circ = 240^\circ
    $$  
    Note that the reference angle for the angle shown in Figure 10 can be given in either degrees or radians.
    
    In degrees: $ 6 = 240^\circ - 180^\circ = 60^\circ $  
    In radians: $ 6 = \frac{4\pi}{3} - \pi = \frac{\pi}{3} $  
    $ \frac{\pi}{3} = 60^\circ $
    
    **Figure 10**
    
    ---
    
    **EXAMPLE 7** Convert $ -4.5 $ to degrees. Round to the nearest tenth of a degree.  
    **SOLUTION** Remember that if no units are showing, an angle is understood to be measured in radians. We multiply by $ \frac{180}{\pi} $ and then approximate using a calculator.  
    $$
    -4.5 \text{ (rad)} = -4.5 \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx -257.8^\circ
    $$

    CALCULATOR NOTE Figure 11 shows how Examples 6 and 7 could be done on
    a graphing calculator that is set to degree mode. If your model is able to perform
    angle conversions, try these examples and make sure you can get the same values.
    
    As is apparent from the preceding examples, changing from degrees to radians
    and radians to degrees is simply a matter of multiplying by the appropriate conver-
    
    sion factors.

    of these angles for your convenience. In Figure 12 we show each of the special

    **Problem 8 Example 8**
    Find sin(7π/6)
    
    **Solution:**
    Because 7π/6 and 30° are equivalent, so are their sines.
    $$
    \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}\right) = \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}
    $$
    
    **Calculator Note:**
    To work this problem on a calculator, we must first set the calculator to radian mode. If your calculator does not have a key labeled π, use 3.1416.
    Here is the sequence to key in your calculator to work the problem given in Example 8.
    
    **Scientific Calculator:**
    3.1416 [=] 6 [=] [sin]
    
    **Graphing Calculator:**
    3.1416 [=] 6 [=] [sin] [C [=] [=] 6 [J] ENTER!
    
    ---
    
    **Problem 9 Example 9**
    Find $4 \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$
    
    **Solution:**
    Because 7π/6 is just slightly larger than π = 6π/6, we know that it terminates in QIII and therefore its sine will be negative (Figure 13).
    
    The reference angle is:
    $$
    \frac{7\pi}{6} - \pi = \frac{\pi}{6}
    $$
    
    Then:
    $$
    4 \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}\right) = 4 \cdot -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = 4 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -2
    $$

    PROBLEM 11 EXAMPLE 11 In navigation, distance is not usually measured along a straight

    coordinates
    
    P\(N 36° 43.403’, E 25° 16,930’) mula to determine the great circle distance between two points P,(L7,, LN,) and
    and P,(LT>, LN) whose coordinates are given as latitudes and longitudes involves

    corresponding to Ios and
    Santorini.
    
    sin (L7,) sin (LT,) + cos (LT;) cos (LT) cos (LN, — LN3)
    
    To use this formula, the latitudes and longitudes must be entered as angles in
    radians. However, most GPS (global positioning system) units give these coor-
    dinates in degrees and minutes. To use the formula thus requires converting
    from degrees to radians.

    The origins of the trigonometric functions are actually found in astronomy and  
    the need to find the length of the chord subtended by the central angle of a circle.  
    The Greek mathematician Hipparchus is believed to have been the first to produce  
    a table of chords in 140 B.C., making him the founder of trigonometry in the eyes of  
    many. This table is essentially a table of values of the sine function, because the sine  
    of a central angle on the unit circle is half the chord of twice the angle (Figure 1). In  
    modern notation,  
    
    chord (θ) = AC = 2AB = 2 sin (θ)

    The first explicit use of the sine as a function of an angle occurs in a table of  
    half-chords by the Hindu mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata around the  
    year 510 in his work the Aryabhatiya. The word ardha-jya was used for the half-  
    chord, which was eventually shortened to simply jya or jiva. When the Arabs trans-  
    lated the Aryabhatiya, they replaced jya with the term jiba, a meaningless word that  
    sounded the same. The word jiba evolved into jaib, meaning fold, bosom, or bay.  
    This was then later translated into Latin as sinus, which later became sine in English.  
    
    In this section, we will give a third and final definition for the trigonometric  
    functions. Rather than give the new definition first and then show that it does not  
    conflict with our previous definitions, we will do the reverse and show that either  
    of our first two definitions leads to conclusions that imply a third definition.  
    
    To begin, recall that the unit circle (Figure 2) is the circle with center at the  
    origin and radius 1. The equation of the unit circle is x² + y² = 1.  
    
    Suppose the terminal side of angle θ, in standard position, intersects the unit  
    circle at point (x, y) as shown in Figure 3. Because the radius of the unit circle is 1,

    148 CHAPTER 3 Bf Radian Measure
    
    the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) is 1. We can use our first definition
    for the trigonometric functions from Section 1.3 to write
    
    a
    1 y
    
    x . y
    cos@=—-=-=x and sing=-=
    r r
    
    x
    1
    In other words, the ordered pair (x, y) shown in Figure 3 can also be written as
    (cos 6, sin 6). We can arrive at this same result by applying our second definition
    for the trigonometric functions (from Section 2.1). Because @ is an acute angle in
    a right triangle, by Definition I] we have
    
    side adjacent@ — x
    
    cos 6 = =x
    
    hypotenuse 1
    
    side opposite@ = y
    sin 6 = = —=y
    hypotenuse 1
    
    As you can see, both of our first two definitions lead to the conclusion that the
    point (x, y) shown in Figure 3 can be written as (cos 6, sin 0).
    
    Next, consider the length of the arc from (1, 0) to (x, y), which we have labeled
    tin Figure 3. If 6 is measured in radians, then by definition
    
    The length of the arc from (1, 0) to (x, y) is exactly the same as the radian measure
    of angle 6. Therefore, we can write
    
    cos@=cost=x and sin @ = sint = y
    
    These results give rise to a third definition for the trigonometric functions.

    SECTION 3.3 Definition III: Circular Functions 149
    
    As we travel around the unit circle starting at (1, 0), the points we come across  
    all have coordinates $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$, where $ \theta $ is the distance we have traveled. (Note that  
    $ \theta $ will be positive if we travel in the counterclockwise direction but negative if we  
    travel in the clockwise direction.) When we define the trigonometric functions this  
    way, we call them circular functions because of their relationship to the unit circle.
    
    Figure 5 shows an enlarged version of the unit circle with multiples of $ \frac{\pi}{6} $ and $ \frac{7\pi}{4} $ marked off. Each angle is given in both degrees and radians. The radian  
    measure of each angle is the same as the distance from (1, 0) to the point on the  
    terminal side of the angle, as measured along the circumference of the circle in a  
    counterclockwise direction. The x- and y-coordinate of each point shown are the  
    cosine and sine, respectively, of the associated angle or distance.
    
    Figure 5
  - |-
    Figure 5 is helpful in visualizing the relationships among the angles shown and  
    the trigonometric functions of those angles. You may want to make a larger copy  
    of this diagram yourself. In the process of doing so you will become more familiar  
    with the relationship between degrees and radians and the exact values of the angles  
    in the diagram. Keep in mind, though, that you do not need to memorize this entire  
    figure. By using reference angles, it is really only necessary to know the values of the  
    circular functions for the quadrantal angles and angles that terminate in QI.
    
    **PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1** Use Figure 5 to find the six trigonometric functions of $ \frac{5\pi}{6} $.  
    Use Figure 5 to find the sine, cosine, and tangent of $ \frac{2\pi}{3} $.  
    **SOLUTION** We obtain cosine and sine directly from Figure 5. The other trigonometric functions of $ \frac{5\pi}{6} $ are found by using the ratio and reciprocal identities, rather than the new definition.
    
    $$
    \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
    $$
    
    $$
    \tan\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)}{\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
    $$
    
    $$
    \cot\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)} = -\sqrt{3}
    $$
    
    $$
    \sec\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
    $$
    
    $$
    \csc\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)} = 2
    $$
    
    For $ \frac{2\pi}{3} $:
    
    $$
    \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{1}{2}
    $$
    
    $$
    \tan\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}{\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
    $$
    
    $$
    \cot\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
    $$
    
    $$
    \sec\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} = -2
    $$
    
    $$
    \csc\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}

    Using Technology: Graphing the Unit Circle
    
    We can use Definition III to graph the unit circle with a set of parametric equations. We will cover parametric equations in more detail in Section 6.4. First,
    set your graphing calculator to parametric mode and to radian mode. Then
    define the following pair of functions (Figure 6).
    
    XIT = cos(t)
    YiT = sin(t)
    
    Set the window variables so that
    0 ≤ t ≤ 2π, scale = π/12; -1.5 ≤ x ≤ 1.5; -1.5 ≤ y ≤ 1.5
    
    Graph the equations using the zoom-square command. This will make the
    circle appear round and not like an ellipse. Now you can trace the circle in
    increments of π/12. For example, to find the sine and cosine of 7π/3 radians, we
    would trace through four increments (Figure 7).

    Because it is easier for a calculator to display angles exactly in degrees rather
    than in radians, it is sometimes helpful to graph the unit circle using degrees. Set

    variables with functions, where
    
    x represents a domain value and

    unit circle until the x-coordinate is 0.5. The calculator shows us there are two
    such points, at ¢ = 60° and at ¢ = 300° (Figure 8).

    Remember that a function is a rule that pairs each element of the domain
    with exactly one element from the range. When we see the statement y = sin x, it
    is identical to the notation y = f(x). In fact, if we wanted to be precise, we would
    write y = sin (x). In visual terms, we can picture the sine function as a machine
    that assigns a single output value to every input value (Figure 10).
    
    Figure 10
    
    The input x is a real number, which can be interpreted as a distance along
    the circumference of the unit circle or an angle in radians. The input is formally
    referred to as the argument of the function.

    Because tan θ = y/x and sec θ = 1/x, the tangent and secant functions will be
    undefined when x = 0, which will occur at the points (0, 1) and (0, −1). Look-
    ing back at Figure 5, we see these points correspond to θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/2.

    or counterclockwise direction, we will encounter these points again and again,
    such as when θ = 5π/2 and θ = 7π/2, or θ = −7π/2 and θ = −3π/2. All these values
    differ from each other by some multiple of π because (0, 1) and (0, −1) are on
    opposite sides of the unit circle a half-revolution apart. Therefore, the tangent
    and secant functions are defined for all real numbers θ except θ = π/2 + kπ, where
    k is any integer.
    
    In a similar manner, the cotangent and cosecant functions will be undefined
    when y = 0, corresponding to the points (1, 0) or (−1, 0). To avoid either of these
    two positions, we must avoid the values θ = kπ for any integer k. We summarize
    these results here:

    a. cosz = 2 b. csc 7 =z c. tan z = 1000
    SOLUTION
    a. This statement is not possible because 2 is not within the range of the
    
    cosine function. The largest value cos z can assume is 1.
    
    b. This statement is also not possible, because csc 7 is undefined and therefore
    not equal to any real number.
    
    c. This statement is possible because the range of the tangent function is all
    real numbers, which certainly includes 1,000. a
    
    Geometric Representations
    
    Based on the circular definitions, we can represent the values of the six trigono-
    metric functions geometrically as indicated in Figure 12. The diagram shows a
    point P(x, y) that is ¢ units from the point (1, 0) on the circumference of the unit
    circle. Point Q is located where the horizontal line tangent to the circle at C inter-
    sects line OP. Similarly, point R is located where the vertical line tangent to the
    circle at B intersects line OP.

    NOTE There are many concepts  
    that can be visualized from  
    
    Figure 12. One of the more  
    important is the variations that  
    occur in sin t, cos t, and tan t as P  
    travels around the unit circle. We  
    illustrate this in Example 7.
    
    PROBLEM 7  
    Describe how tan θ varies as  
    t increases from 0 to π/2.
    
    Therefore, cos θ = x and sin θ = y. Because triangle BOR is similar to triangle  
    AOP, we have
    
    BR _ AP _ sinθ  
    
    OB OA _ cosθ  
    
    = tanθ  
    Because OB = 1, BR is equal to tan θ. Notice that this will be the slope of  
    
    OP. Using a similar argument, it can be shown that CO = cot θ, OO = csc θ, and  
    OR = sec θ.

    However, keep in mind that the values of the trigonometric functions will  
    sometimes be negative, and so we must obey the following rules when using line  
    segments to represent them geometrically:
    
    1. sin θ and tan θ are positive when AP and BR extend above the x-axis, and  
    negative when they extend below the x-axis.
    
    2. cos θ and cot θ are positive when OA and CQ extend to the right of the y-axis,  
    and negative when they extend to the left of the y-axis.
    
    3. sec θ and csc θ are positive when OR and OQ are measured in the same direc-
    tion as the terminal side of the angle, and negative when measured in the op-
    posite direction.
    
    EXAMPLE 7 Describe how sec θ varies as θ increases from 0 to π/2.
    
    SOLUTION When θ = 0, OR = 1 so that sec θ will begin at a value of 1. As θ  
    increases, sec θ grows larger and larger. Eventually, when θ = π/2, OP will be  
    vertical so sec θ = OR will no longer be defined.

    **PROBLEM 8 EXAMPLE 8**  
    *Describe how tan θ varies as θ increases from π/2 to π.*  
    *Describe how cot t varies as t increases from π/2 to π.*
    
    **SOLUTION**  
    When θ = π/2, the line tangent to the unit circle at B will be parallel to OP. Because these lines will not intersect, the point R does not exist and so tan θ = BR is undefined. Once θ increases slightly, the line tangent to the unit circle at B will intersect with the opposite side of ray OP, so that BR extends downward from the x-axis and is therefore negative (see Figure 13).
    
    **Figure 13**
    
    At first, BR will be very long, so that tan θ will be an extremely large negative value. As θ continues to increase towards π, R will move in closer to P, with the result that BR decreases in length. As a value, this means that tan θ is negative but increasing. Finally, when θ reaches π, the segment BR will have shrunk to zero so that tan θ = 0.
    
    To summarize, tan θ is undefined at π/2, but then increases from −∞ to 0 as θ increases toward π.

    PROBLEM SET
    
    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY
    
    For Questions 1 through 6, fill in each blank with the appropriate word or number.
    
    1. If (x, y) is a point on the unit circle and t is the distance from (1, 0) to the point along
    the circumference of the circle, then x is the cosine of t and y is the sine of t.
    
    2. On the unit circle, the measure of a central angle and the length of
    it cuts off are exactly the same value.
    
    3. The input to a trigonometric function is formally called the argument of the function.
    4. The circular functions are functions of numbers, so we must always use a
    calculator set to radian mode when evaluating them.
    5. The trigonometric functions having a domain of all real numbers are sine and
    cosine, and the functions having a range of all real numbers are sine and
    cosine.
    6. The largest possible value for the sine or cosine function is 1 and the smallest
    possible value is -1.

Our study of arc length will allow us to find the distance traveled by a rider on a Ferris wheel at any point during the ride.
    
    In Section 3.2, we found that if a central angle 0, measured in radians, in a circle of radius r cuts off an arc of length s, then the relationship between s, r, and @ can be written as 0 = - Figure 1 illustrates this.

    Because r would be constant for a given circle, this formula tells us that the

    off an arc twice as long.

    **EXAMPLE 2** Figure 3 is a model of George Ferris’s Ferris wheel. Recall that the diameter of the wheel is 250 feet, and θ is the central angle formed as a rider travels from his or her initial position P1 to position P2. Find the distance traveled by the rider if θ = 45° and if θ = 105°.
    
    **SOLUTION** The formula for arc length, s = rθ, requires θ to be given in radians. Since θ is given in degrees, we must multiply it by π/180 to convert to radians. Also, since the diameter of the wheel is 250 feet, the radius is 125 feet.
    
    For θ = 45°:
    s = rθ  
    = 125(45)(π/180)  
    = (125π)/4  
    ≈ 98 ft
    
    For θ = 105°:
    s = rθ  
    = 125(105)(π/180)  
    = (875π)/12  
    ≈ 230 ft
    
    **Figure 3**
    
    **EXAMPLE 3** The minute hand of a clock is 1.2 centimeters long. To two significant digits, how far does the tip of the minute hand move in 20 minutes?
    
    **SOLUTION** We have r = 1.2 centimeters. Since we are looking for s, we need to find θ. We can use a proportion to find θ. One complete rotation is 60 minutes and 2π radians, so we say θ is to 2π as 20 minutes is to 60 minutes, or
    
    θ/2π = 20/60  
    θ = (20/60)(2π)  
    θ = (1/3)(2π)  
    θ = 2π/3 radians
    
    Now, using the formula s = rθ:
    s = (1.2)(2π/3)  
    = 0.8π  
    ≈ 2.5 cm

    If we are working with relatively small central angles in circles with large radii,
    we can use the length of the intercepted arc to approximate the length of the associated
    chord. For example, Figure 5 shows a central angle of 1° in a circle of radius
    1,800 feet, along with the arc and chord cut off by 1°. (Figure 5 is not drawn to scale.)
    
    Chord AB
    
    1800 ft A
    
    Figure 5
    
    To find the length of arc AB, we convert 1° to radians by multiplying by π/180.
    Then we apply the formula s = rθ.
    
    WT
    
    s=1×π/180 × 1800
    = (π × 1800)/180
    = 10π
    ≈ 31.4159 ft
    
    If we had carried out the calculation of arc AB to six significant digits, we
    would have obtained s = 31.4159. The length of the chord AB is 31.4155 to six
    significant digits (found by using the law of sines, which we will cover in Chapter
    7). As you can see, the first five digits in each number are the same. It seems rea-
    sonable then to approximate the length of chord AB with the length of arc AB.
    
    As our next example illustrates, we can also use the procedure just outlined
    in the reverse order to find the radius of a circle by approximating arc length with
    the length of the associated chord.

    SOLUTION Figure 6 is a diagram of the situation. Because we are working with
    a relatively small angle in a circle with a large radius, we use the length of the

    If we let A represent the area of the sector formed by central angle θ, we can find A by setting up a proportion as follows: We say the area A of the sector is to the area of the circle as θ is to one full rotation. That is,
    
    Area of sector —> A _ 9 «— Central angle θ  
    Area of circle —> πr² <— One full rotation  
    
    We solve for A by multiplying both sides of the proportion by πr².

    If θ (in radians) is a central angle in a circle with radius r, then the area of the sector (Figure 8) formed by angle θ is given by  
    
    1  
    A = (1/2)θr² (θ in radians)

    Find the area of the sector 1.4 radians in a circle of radius 2.1 meters.  
    formed by a central angle of  
    1.6 radians in a circle of radius 3.5 meters.  
    
    SOLUTION We have r = 2.1 meters and θ = 1.4. Applying the formula for A  
    gives us  
    1  
    A = (1/2)θr²  
    = (1/2)(1.4)(2.1)²  
    = 3.1 (to the nearest tenth)  
    
    REMEMBER Area is measured in square units. When r = 2.1 m, r² = (2.1 m)² = 4.41 m².  
    
    PROBLEM 6 EXAMPLE 6 If the sector formed by a central angle of 15° has an area of 77/3  
    
    If the sector formed by a central angle of 30° has an area of 27/3  
    square centimeters, find the radius of the circle.  
    
    SOLUTION We first convert 15° to radians.  
    θ = 15° = (π/180) × 15 = π/12 radians.  
    
    Using the formula for the area of a sector:  
    A = (1/2)θr²  
    
    Solving for r:  
    r² = 2A / θ  
    r = √(2A / θ)  
    
    Plugging in the values:  
    r = √(2 × (77/3) / (π/12))  
    r = √((154/3) × (12/π))  
    r = √(616 / π)  
    
    This is the radius of the circle.

    EXTENDING THE CONCEPTS
    
    Apparent Diameter As we mentioned in this section, for small central angles in circles with
    large radii, the intercepted arc and the chord are approximately the same length. Figure 19
    shows a diagram of a person looking at the moon. The arc and the chord are essentially the
    same length and are both good approximations to the diameter.

    Figure 19
    
    In astronomy, the angle α at which an object is seen by the eye is called the apparent diameter
    of the object. Apparent diameter depends on the size of the object and its distance from
    the observer. To three significant figures, the diameter of the moon is 3,470 kilometers and
    its average distance to the earth is 384,000 kilometers. The diameter of the sun is 1,390,000
    kilometers and its mean distance to the earth is 150,000,000 kilometers. Use this information for Problems 63 through 66.

    this apparent similarity in size even though the diameter of the sun is about 400 times
    greater than the diameter of the moon?
    
    66. The distance between the earth and the moon varies as the moon travels its orbit
    around the earth. Accordingly, the apparent diameter of the moon must also vary. The
    smallest distance between the earth and the moon is 356,340 kilometers, while the
    greatest distance is 406,630 kilometers. Find the largest and smallest apparent diameter

    The specifications for the first Ferris wheel indicate that one trip around the wheel took 20 minutes. How fast was a rider traveling around the wheel? There are a number of ways to answer this question. The most intuitive measure of the rate at which the rider is traveling around the wheel is what we call linear velocity. The units of linear velocity are miles per hour, feet per second, and so forth.
    
    Another way to specify how fast the rider is traveling around the wheel is with what we call angular velocity. Angular velocity is given as the amount of central angle through which the rider travels over a given amount of time. The central angle swept out by a rider traveling once around the wheel is 360°, or 2π radians. If one trip around the wheel takes 20 minutes, then the angular velocity of a rider is
    
    2π radians / 20 minutes = π/10 rad/min
    
    In this section, we will learn more about angular velocity and linear velocity and the relationship between them. Let’s start with the formal definition for the linear velocity of a point moving on the circumference of a circle.
    
    Definition: Linear Velocity
    
    If P is a point on a circle of radius r, and P moves an arc length s along the circumference of the circle in an amount of time t, then the linear velocity, v, of P is given by the formula
    
    v = s/t
    
    To calculate the linear velocity, we simply divide distance traveled by time. It does not matter whether the object moves on a curve or in a straight line.

    EXAMPLE 3A bicycle wheel with a radius of 13.0 inches turns with an angu-
    lar velocity of 3 radians per second. Find the distance traveled by a point on
    the bicycle tire in 1 minute.
    
    SOLUTION We have w = 3 radians per second, r = 13.0 inches, and ¢ = 60 sec-

    If w= 0

    then 6=ot
    = (3 rad/sec)(60 sec)
    = 180 rad
    
    To find the distance traveled by the point in 60 seconds, we use the formula
    s = ré from Section 3.4, with r = 13.0 inches and 6 = 180.
    
    s = 13.0(180)

    Now, these equations give us d and / in terms of 9. To write d and /in terms of
    t, we solve w = 0/t for 6 to obtain 6 = wt = wt. Substituting this for 6 in each
    equation, we have d and / expressed in terms of f.

    The Relationship Between the Two Velocities
    
    To find the relationship between the two kinds of velocities we have developed so
    far, we can take the equation that relates arc length and central angle measure,

    Linear velocity is the product of the radius and the angular velocity. Just as with
    arc length, this relationship implies that the linear velocity is proportional to the
    angular velocity because r would be constant for a given circle.

    As suggested by William McClure of Orange Coast Community College, a
    helpful analogy to visualize the relationship between linear and angular velocity
    is to imagine a group of ice skaters linked arm to arm on the ice in a straight
    line, with half the skaters facing in one direction and the other half facing in the
    opposite direction. As the line of skaters rotates in a circular motion, every skater
    is moving with the same angular velocity. However, in terms of linear velocity,
    the skaters near the center of the line are barely moving while the skaters near the
    ends of the line are moving very rapidly because they have to skate a much larger
    circle in the same amount of time.

    PROBLEM 5
    
    A DVD is turning at 3,300 revo-
    lutions per minute (rpm). If the
    distance from the center of the
    DVD to a point on the DVD is
    1.5 inches, find the angular veloc-
    ity and the linear velocity of the
    point (in feet per minute).
    
    PROBLEM 6
    
    Repeat Example 6, but assume the
    diameter is 200 feet and one com-
    plete revolution takes 10 minutes.

    EXAMPLE 5 A DVD is turning at 4,500 revolutions per minute (rpm). If the
    distance from the center of the DVD to a point on the DVD is 2 inches, find the
    angular velocity and the linear velocity of the point in feet per minute.
  - |-
    SOLUTION The quantity 4,500 revolutions per minute is another way of
    expressing the rate at which the point on the DVD is moving. We can obtain
    the angular velocity from it by remembering that one complete revolution is
    equivalent to 27 radians. Therefore,
    
    4,500 rev × 27 rad
    1 min × 1 rev
    
    = 9,000 rad/min
    
    w = 4,500 rpm =
    
    Because one revolution is equivalent to 27 radians, the fraction
    
    27 rad
    1 rev
    
    is just another form of the number 1. We call this kind of fraction a conversion
    factor. Notice how the units of revolutions divide out in much the same way
    that common factors divide out when we reduce fractions to lowest terms. The
    conversion factor allows us to convert from revolutions to radians by dividing
    out revolutions.
    
    To find the linear velocity, we multiply w by the radius.
    
    v = rω
    = (2 in.)(9,000 rad/min)
    = 18,000 in./min Exact value
    ≈ 18,000(3.14) Approximate value
    = 56,500 in./min To three significant digits
    
    To convert 56,500 inches per minute to feet per minute, we use another conver-
    sion factor relating feet to inches. Here is our work:
    
    56,500 in./min × 1 ft
    1 min × 12 in.
    
    = 56,500 ft/min ≈ 4,710 ft/min
    
    NOTE In light of our previous discussion about units, you may be wondering
    how we went from (inches)(radians/minute) to just inches/minute in Example 5.
    Remember that radians are just real numbers and technically have no units. We
    sometimes write them as if they did for our own convenience, but one of the advan-
    tages of radian measure is that it does not introduce a new unit into calculations.

    176 CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure
    
    SOLUTION
    
    a. We found the angular velocity in the introduction to this section. It is
    
    $$
    \omega = \frac{7}{10} \text{ rad/min}
    $$
    
    Next, we use the formula $ v = r\omega $ to find the linear velocity. That is, we multiply the angular velocity by the radius to find the linear velocity.
    $$
    v = r\omega
    $$
    Figure 2: $ v = (125 \pi) \left( \frac{7}{10} \right) \text{ rad/min} $
    
    $$
    = 39.27 \text{ ft/min} \quad \text{(intermediate answer)}
    $$
    
    To convert to miles per hour, we use the facts that there are 60 minutes in 1 hour and 5,280 feet in 1 mile.
    
    $$
    \frac{39.27 \text{ ft/min} \times 60 \text{ min}}{5,280 \text{ ft/mi}} = \frac{(39.27)(60)}{5,280} \text{ mi/hr}
    $$
    
    $$
    = 0.45 \text{ mi/hr}
    $$
    
    b. Suppose the person riding on the wheel is at position $ P $; as shown in Figure 2.
    Based on our work in Example 5 of Section 2.3, the height, $ H $, of the rider can be found from the central angle $ \theta $ using the equation
    
    $$
    H = 139 - 125 \cos \theta
    $$
    
    Because the angular velocity of the wheel is $ \omega = \frac{7}{10} $ radians per minute, then assuming $ \theta $ is measured in radians we have
    
    $$
    \theta = \omega t \quad \text{Definition of angular velocity}
    $$
    
    $$
    \theta = \frac{7}{10} t \quad \text{Multiply both sides by } t
    $$
    
    So,
    
    $$
    H = 139 - 125 \cos\left( \frac{7}{10} t \right)
    $$
    
    This equation gives us the height of the rider at any time $ t $, where $ t $ is measured in minutes.

    Sured in minutes from the beginning of the ride. Later, in Section 4.5, we will

    To gain a more intuitive understanding of the relationship between the radius  
    of a circle and the linear velocity of a point on the circle, imagine that a bird is sit-  
    ting on one of the spokes that connects the center of the Ferris wheel in Example 6  
    to the wheel itself. Imagine further that the bird is sitting exactly halfway between  
    the center of the wheel and a rider on the wheel. How does the linear velocity of  
    the bird compare with the linear velocity of the rider? The angular velocity of the  
    bird and the rider are equal (both sweep out the same amount of central angle in

    a given amount of time), and linear velocity is the product of the radius and the

    obtain the linear velocity of the bird. Therefore, the bird is traveling at  
    
    ; - 0.45 mi/hr = 0.225 mi/hr  
    
    In one revolution around the wheel, the rider will travel a greater distance than the  
    bird in the same amount of time, so the rider’s velocity is greater than that of the  
    bird. Twice as great, to be exact.

    1. If a point travels along a circle with constant velocity, then the motion of the point is called circular motion.
    
    2. For a point moving with uniform circular motion, the distance traveled per unit time by the point is called linear velocity, and the amount of rotation per unit time is called angular velocity.

    Gear Trains Figure 8 shows a single-stage gear train. Gear trains are used in many products,
    such as clocks and automotive transmissions, to reduce or increase the angular velocity of a
    component. The size of each gear is measured by the number of teeth rather than the radius.
    Suppose the first gear has n, teeth and the second gear has n, teeth.

    Cycling When a cyclist pedals, he turns a gear, called a chainring. The angular velocity of the
    chainring will determine the linear speed at which the chain travels. The chain connects the
    chainring to a smaller gear, called a sprocket, which is attached to the rear wheel (Figure 11).
    The angular velocity of the sprocket depends upon the linear speed of the chain. The sprocket
    and rear wheel rotate at the same rate, and the diameter of the rear wheel is 700 millimeters.
    The speed at which the cyclist travels is determined by the angular velocity of his rear wheel.

    REFERENCE ANGLE (3.1]
    
    The reference angle θ for any angle θ in standard position is the positive acute
    angle between the terminal side of θ and the x-axis.
    A trigonometric function of an angle and its reference angle differ at most in sign.
    We find trigonometric functions for angles between 0° and 360° by first finding the
    reference angle. We then find the value of the trigonometric function of the reference
    angle and use the quadrant in which the angle terminates to assign the correct sign.

    GROUP PROJECT  
    Modeling a Double Ferris Wheel
    
    OBJECTIVE: To find a model for the height of a rider on a double Ferris wheel.
    
    In 1939, John Courtney invented the first double Ferris wheel, called a Sky Wheel,
    consisting of two smaller wheels spinning at the ends of a rotating arm.
    
    For this project, we will model a double Ferris wheel with a 50-foot arm that
    is spinning at a rate of 3 revolutions per minute in a counterclockwise direction.
    The center of the arm is 44 feet above the ground. The diameter of each wheel is
    32 feet, and the wheels turn at a rate of 5 revolutions per minute in a clockwise
    direction. A diagram of the situation is shown in Figure 1. M is the midpoint of
    the arm, and O is the center of the lower wheel. Assume the rider is initially at
    point P on the wheel.

    Figure 2 shows the location of the rider after a short amount of time has passed. The arm has rotated counterclockwise through an angle θ, while the wheel has rotated clockwise through an angle φ relative to the direction of the arm. Point P shows the current position of the rider, and the height of the rider is h.

    We know that the angular velocity of the arm is 3 revolutions per minute, and the
    angular velocity of the wheel is 5 revolutions per minute. The last step is to find
    the radian measure of angles θ and φ.

    The Third Man
    
    We mentioned in Chapter 2 that the Ferris wheel called the Riesenrad, built in
    Vienna in 1897, is still in operation today. A brochure that gives some statistics
    associated with the Riesenrad indicates that passengers riding it travel at 2.5 feet
    per second. The Orson Welles movie *The Third Man* contains a scene in which
    Orson Welles rides the Riesenrad through one complete revolution. Watch *The
    Third Man* so you can view the Riesenrad in operation. Then devise a method
    of using the movie to estimate the angular velocity of the wheel. Give a detailed
    account of the procedure you use to arrive at your estimate. Finally, use your
    results either to prove or to disprove the claim that passengers travel at 2.5 feet
    per second on the Riesenrad.

    Introduction
    
    Trigonometric functions are periodic functions because they repeat all their range  
    values at regular intervals. The riders on the Ferris wheels we have been studying  
    repeat their positions around the wheel periodically as well. That is why trigono-  
    metric functions are good models for the motion of a rider on a Ferris wheel. When  
    we use a rectangular coordinate system to plot the distance between the ground  
    and a rider during a ride, we find that the shape of the graph matches exactly the  
    shape of the graph of one of the trigonometric functions.

    Once we have modeled the motion of the rider with a trigonometric function,  
    we have a new set of mathematical tools with which to investigate the motion of  
    the rider on the wheel.
    
    Study Skills
    
    The study skills for this chapter are about attitude. They are points of view  
    that point toward success.
    
    EN Be Focused, Not Distracted We have students who begin their assign-  
    ments by asking themselves, “Why am I taking this class?” If you are  
    asking yourself similar questions, you are distracting yourself from  
    doing the things that will produce the results you want in this course.

    SECTION 4.1 Basic Graphs 193
    
    Don’t dwell on questions and evaluations of the class that can be used
    as excuses for not doing well. If you want to succeed in this course, focus
    your energy and efforts toward success, rather than distracting yourself
    from your goals.
    
    PA Be Resilient Don’t let setbacks keep you from your goals. You want to put
    yourself on the road to becoming a person who can succeed in this class, or
    any college class. Failing a test or quiz, or having a difficult time on some top-
    ics, is normal. No one goes through college without some setbacks. Don’t
    let a temporary disappointment keep you from succeeding in this course. A
    low grade on a test or quiz is simply a signal that some reevaluation of your
    study habits needs to take place.
    
    FE] Intend to Succeed We always have a few students who simply go through
    the motions of studying without intending on mastering the material. It
    is more important to them to look as if they are studying than to actu-
    ally study. You need to study with the intention of being successful in the
    course. Intend to master the material, no matter what it takes.
    
    Learning Objectives
    
    Sketch the graph of a basic trigonometric function.
    Analyze the graph of a trigonometric function.
    
    Evaluate a trigonometric function using the even and odd function
    relationships.
    
    Prove an equation is an identity.
    
    In Section 3.3 we introduced the circular functions, which define the six trigono-
    metric functions as functions of real numbers, and investigated their domains.
    Now we will sketch the graphs of these functions and determine their ranges.
    
    The Sine Graph
  - |-
    To graph the function y = sin x, we begin by making a table of values of x and y that  
    satisfy the equation (Table 1), and then use the information in the table to sketch the  
    graph. To make it easy on ourselves, we will let x take on values that are multiples of  
    7/4. As an aid in sketching the graphs, we will approximate V/2/2 with 0.7.
    
    Graphing each ordered pair and then connecting them with a smooth curve, we  
    obtain the graph in Figure 1.

    **Graphing y = sin x Using the Unit Circle**
    
    We can also obtain the graph of the sine function by using the unit circle definition (Definition III). Figure 2 shows a diagram of the unit circle we introduced earlier in Section 3.3. If the point (x, y) is funits from (1, 0) along the circumference of the unit circle, then sin θ = y. Therefore, if we start at the point (1, 0) and travel once around the unit circle (a distance of 2π units), we can find the value of y in the equation y = sin t by simply keeping track of the y-coordinates of the points that are θ units from (1, 0).
    
    **NOTE:** In Figure 2 we are using x and y differently than we are in Figure 1. Because in Figure 2 we need x to represent the coordinate of a point on the unit circle, we let t be the input value to the trigonometric function. The variable x in Figure 1 represents the same quantity as the variable θ in Figure 2.

    As θ increases from 0 to 7/2, meaning P travels from (1, 0) to (0, 1), y = sin θ increases from 0 to 1. As θ continues in QU from 7/2 to π, y decreases from 1 back to 0. In QIII the length of segment AP increases from 0 to 1, but because it is located below the x-axis the y-coordinate is negative. So, as θ increases from π to 3π/2, y decreases from 0 to —1. Finally, as θ increases from 3π/2 to 2π in QIV, bringing P back to (1, 0), y increases from —1 back to 0. Figure 3 illustrates how the y-coordinate of P (or AP) is used to construct the graph of the sine function as θ increases.

We can extend the graph of y = sin x to the right of x = 2π by realizing that, once we go past x = 2π, we will begin to name angles that are coterminal with the angles between 0 and 2π. Because of this, we will start to repeat the values of sin x. Likewise, if we let x take on values to the left of x = 0, we will simply get the values of sin x between 0 and 2π in the

    196 = CHAPTER 4 Il Graphing and Inverse Functions
    
    The graph of y = sin x never goes above | or below —1, repeats itself every 27
    units on the x-axis, and crosses the x-axis at multiples of 7. This gives rise to the
    following three definitions.
    
    Definition = Period
    
    For any function y = f(x), the smallest positive number p for which
    
    F(x + p) = f(x)
    for all xin the domain of fis called the period of f(x). y
    
    In the case of y = sin x, the period is 277 because p = 27ris the smallest positive
    number for which sin (x + p) = sin x for all x.
    
    Definition = Amplitude
    
    If the greatest value of y is M and the least value of y is m, then the amplitude
    of the graph of y is defined to be
    
    4-+\m—ml
    2
    
    IN
    
    In the case of y = sin x, the amplitude is 1 because
    
    1 Lo
    5 I —(-1)| =5@Q=1
    
    Definition = Zero
    
    A zero of a function y = f(x) is any domain value x = c for which f(c) = 0.
    If c is a real number, then x =c will be an x-intercept of the graph of

    From the graph of y = sin x, we see that the sine function has an infinite num-
    ber of zeros, which are the values x = kw for any integer k. These values will be
    very important later in Chapter 6 when we begin solving equations that involve
    trigonometric functions.

    In Section 3.3 we saw that the domain for the sine function is all real numbers.
    Because point P in Figure 2 must be on the unit circle, we have
    
    -1 ≤ y ≤ 1 which implies -1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1
    
    This means the sine function has a range of [−1, 1]. The sine of any angle can only
    be a value between −1 and 1, inclusive.

    The Cosine Graph
    
    The graph of y = cos x has the same general shape as the graph of y = sin x.
    
    EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of y = cos x.
    
    SOLUTION We can arrive at the graph by making a table of convenient values of
    x and y (Table 2). Plotting points, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 5.

    We can generate the graph of the cosine function using the unit circle just as we did for the sine function. By Definition III, if the point (x, y) is ¢ units from (1, 0) along the circumference of the unit circle, then cos ¢ = x. We start at the point (1, 0) and travel once around the unit circle, keeping track of the x-coordinates of the points that are ¢ units from (1, 0). To help visualize how the x-coordinates generate the cosine graph, we have rotated the unit circle 90° counterclockwise so that we may represent the x-coordinates as vertical line segments (Figure 6).

    cross or touch this line. If we were to calculate values of tan x when x is very close
    to 7/2 (or very close to 90° in degree mode), we would find that tan x would become
    very large for values of x just to the left of the asymptote and very large in the nega-
    tive direction for values of x just to the right of the asymptote, as shown in Table 4.
    
    In terms of the unit circle (Definition II), visualize segment BR in Figure 10a
    as t increases from 0 to 7/2. When t = 0, OP is horizontal and so BR = 0. As
    t increases, BR grows in length, getting very large as θ nears 7/2. At t = 7/2, OP is
    vertical and BR is no longer defined. The exact reverse happens as θ increases from
    π/2 to π, except that now tan θ is negative because BR will be located below the
    x-axis (Figure 10b). As θ continues through π, the values of tan θ will be a repeat
    of the values we saw in QI. The same can be said of QIV and QII.

    We can also visualize tan θ as the slope of OP. At t = 0, OP is horizontal and
    the slope is zero. As P travels around the unit circle through QI, you can see how
    OP gets very steep when θ nears 7π/2. At t = π/2, OP is vertical and the slope is not
    defined. As P travels through QII the slopes are all negative, reaching a zero slope
    once again at θ = π. For P in QIII and QIV, the slope of OP will simply repeat the
    values seen in QI and QII.

    Extending the graph in Figure 9 to the right of 7 and to the left of 0, we obtain
    the graph shown in Figure 11. As this figure indicates, the period of y = tan x is 7.
    The tangent function has no amplitude because there is no largest or smallest value of
    y on the graph of y = tan x. For this same reason, the range of the tangent function is
    all real numbers. Because tan x = sin x/cos x, the zeros for the tangent function are the
    same as for the sine; that is, x = π for any integer k. The vertical asymptotes corre-
    spond to the zeros of the cosine function, which are x = π/2 + kπ for any integer k.

    **PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of y = csc x.**
    
    Graph y = sec x.
    
    **SOLUTION** To graph y = csc x, we can use the fact that csc x is the reciprocal of sin x. In Table 5, we use the values of sin x from Table 1 and take reciprocals. Filling in with some additional points, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 12.

    4π/3 | -√3/2 | -2/√3 ≈ -1.1547
    3π/2 | -1 | -1
    5π/3 | -√3/2 | -2/√3 ≈ -1.1547
    7π/4 | -√2/2 | -√2 ≈ -1.4
    5π/6 | -1/2 | -2
    3π | 0 | undefined
    
    **Figure 12**
    
    As you can see in Figure 12, the reciprocals of 1 and -1 are themselves, so these points are common to both the graphs of the sine and cosecant functions. When sin x is close to 1 or -1, so is csc x. When sin x is close to zero, csc x will be a very large positive or negative number. The cosecant function will be undefined whenever the sine function is zero, so that y = csc x has vertical asymptotes at the values x = kπ for any integer k.
    
    Because y = sin x repeats every 2π, so do the reciprocals of sin x, so the period of y = csc x is 2π. As was the case with y = tan x, there is no amplitude. The range of y = csc x is y = -1 or y = 1, or in interval notation, (-∞, -1] U [1, ∞). The cosecant function has no zeros because y cannot ever be equal to zero. Notice in Figure 12 that the graph of y = csc x never crosses the x-axis.

    Because the calculator graphs a function by plotting points and connecting
    them, the vertical line seen in Figure 13 will sometimes appear where an asymp-
    tote exists. We just need to remember that this line is not part of the graph of
    the cosecant function, as Figure 14 indicates. To make sure that these artificial
    lines do not appear in the graph, we can graph the function in dot mode or with
    the dot style, as illustrated in Figure 15.

    NOTE Some instructors prefer to define the basic cycle for the tangent function
    to be (—7/2, 7/2) as shown in Figure 18. This allows the graph of a cycle to be
    drawn as a single, unbroken curve. We have chosen to define the basic cycle over
    the interval [0, 7], which will allow us to graph all six trigonometric functions
    using a consistent approach.

    Even and Odd Functions
    
    Recall from algebra the definitions of even and odd functions.
    
    Definition = Even Function
    
    An even function is a function for which
    f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f
    
    The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis. y
    
    An even function is a function for which replacing x with −x leaves the expression
    that defines the function unchanged. If a function is even, then every time the point
    (x, y) is on the graph, so is the point (−x, y). The function f(x) = x² + 3 is an even
    function because
    
    f(−x) = (−x)² + 3 = x² + 3 = f(x)
    
    Definition = Odd Function
    
    An odd function is a function for which
    
    f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain of f
    
    The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin. y
  - |-
    An odd function is a function for which replacing x with —x changes the sign of the expression that defines the function. If a function is odd, then every time the point (x, y) is on the graph, so is the point (—x, —y). The function f(x) = x7 — x is an odd function because
    
    f(—x) = (—x)^7 — (—x)
    
    = -x^7 + x
    
    = —(x^7 — x)
    
    = f(x)
    
    From the unit circle it is apparent that sine is an odd function and cosine is an even function. To begin to see that this is true, we locate 7/6 and —7/6 (—7/6 is coterminal with 11π/6) on the unit circle and notice that
    
    and
    
    We can generalize this result by drawing an angle θ and its opposite —θ in standard position and then labeling the points where their terminal sides intersect the unit circle with (x, y) and (x, —y), respectively. (Can you see from Figure 19 why we label these two points in this way? That is, does it make sense that if (x, y) is on the terminal side of θ, then (x, —y) must be on the terminal side of —θ?)

    indicating that sine is an odd function.
    
    Now that we have established that sine is an odd function and cosine is an even
    function, we can use our ratio and reciprocal identities to find which of the other
    trigonometric functions are even and which are odd. Example 3 shows how this is
    done for the cosecant function.

    Because the sine function is odd, we can see in Figure 4 that the graph of
    y = sin x is symmetric about the origin. On the other hand, the cosine function is
    even, so the graph of y = cos x is symmetric about the y-axis as can be seen in Fig-
    ure 7. We summarize the nature of all six trigonometric functions for easy reference.

    Learning Objectives
    
    Find the amplitude of a sine or cosine function.
    Find the period of a sine or cosine function.
    
    Graph a sine or cosine function having a different amplitude and
    period.
    
    Solve a real-life problem involving a trigonometric function as a model.
    
    In Section 4.1, the graphs of y = sin x and y = cos x were shown to have an ampli-
    tude of 1 and a period of 2π. In this section, we will extend our work with these
    two functions by considering what happens to the graph when we allow for a coef-
    ficient with a trigonometric function.
    
    Amplitude
    
    First, we will consider the effect that multiplying a trigonometric function by a
    numerical factor has on the graph.
    
    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of y = 2 sin x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π.
    Graph y = 4 cos x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π.
  - |-
    SOLUTION The coefficient 2 on the right side of the equation will simply multiply each value of sin x by a factor of 2. Therefore, the values of y in y = 2 sin x should all be twice the corresponding values of y in y = sin x. Table 1 contains some values for y = 2 sin x.

    Figure 1 shows the graphs of y = sin x and y = 2 sin x. (We are including the graph of y = sin x simply for reference and comparison. With both graphs to look at, it is easier to see what change is brought about by the coefficient 2.)

    Summary
    
    Generalizing the results of these last two examples, we can say that if A > 0,
    then the graphs of y = A sin x and y = A cos x will have amplitude A and
    range [— A, A].
    
    Reflecting About the x-Axis
    
    In the previous examples we only considered changes to the graph if the coefficient
    A was a positive number. To see how a negative value of A affects the graph, we will
    
    consider the function y = —2 cos x.

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Graph y = —2 cos x, from x = —27 to x = 4a.
    Graph y = —3 sin x for
    27 =x = 4n. SOLUTION Each value of y on the graph of y = —2 cos x will be the opposite
    
    of the corresponding value of y on the graph of y = 2 cos x. The result is that
    the graph of y = —2 cos x is the reflection of the graph of y = 2 cos x about the
    x-axis. Figure 3 shows the extension of one complete cycle of y = —2 cos x to
    the interval —27 = x = 47.

    Summary
    
    If A <0, then the graphs of y = Asin xand y = Acosx will be sine and cosine
    graphs that have been reflected about the x-axis. The amplitude will be |A|.
    
    Period
    
    Up to this point we have considered the effect that a coefficient, which multiplies
    the trigonometric function, has on the graph. Now we will investigate what hap-
    pens if we allow the input variable to have a coefficient. Remember that the input
    is formally called the argument of the function.

    The graph of y = sin 2x has a period of π. It goes through two complete  
    cycles in 2π units on the x-axis. Notice that doubling the argument to the function  
    has the reverse effect of halving the period. This may be surprising at first, but we  
    can see the reason for it by looking at a basic cycle. We know that the sine function  
    completes one cycle when the input value, or argument, varies between 0 and 2π.
    
    One cycle: 0 ≤ argument ≤ 2π  
    0 ≤ 2x ≤ 2π  
    0 ≤ x ≤ π  
    Divide by 2 to isolate x  
    
    Because of the factor of 2, the variable x only needs to reach π to complete one  
    cycle, thus shortening the period.

    and crosses the x-axis halfway through, we sketch the graph of y = sin 3x as
    shown in Figure 5. The graph of y = sin x is also shown for comparison. Notice
    that y = sin 3x completes three cycles in 277 units.

    NOTE We are not just “moving”
    the negative out of the argument.
    The properties of even and odd
    functions allow us to write the
    functions differently when a
    negative is involved. For the same
    reason, we cannot just “move” the
    factor of 2 out from the argument.
    That is, sin 2x is not the same as

    The period of the cosine function will be twice as long. To aid in sketching the
    graph, we divide the length of the period, 4π, into 4 intervals of equal width.

    Starting at x = 0, we mark off the x-axis every π units. The coordinates of these
    points will be 0, π, 2π, 3π, and 4π. Figure 6 shows the graph, along with the graph of
    y = cos x for comparison. Notice that y = cos 5x completes one-half cycle in 2π units.

    In general, for y = sin Bx or y = cos Bx to complete one cycle, the product Bx
    must vary from 0 to 2π. Therefore
    
    2π = Bx = 2π if 0 ≤ x ≤ π/B
    
    The period will be 2π/B, and the graph will complete B cycles in 2π units. We summarize all of the information gathered from the previous examples as follows.

    If A is any real number and B> 0, then the graphs of y = Asin Bx and
    y = Acos Bx will have

    In the situation where B < 0, we can use the properties of even and odd func-
    tions to rewrite the function so that B is positive. For example,
    
    y=3 sin (—2x) Is equivalent to y = —3 sin (2x) because
    sine is an odd function
    
    y = 3cos (—2x) Is equivalent to y = 3 cos (2x) because
    
    cosine is an even function
    
    In the next two examples, we use this information about amplitude and period
    to graph one complete cycle of a sine and cosine curve and then extend these
    graphs to cover more than the one cycle. We also take this opportunity to intro-
    duce a method of drawing the graph by constructing a “frame” for the basic cycle.

    65. Alternating Current In North America, the voltage of the alternating current coming through an electrical outlet can be modeled by the function V = 163 sin (120πt), where t is measured in seconds and V in volts. Sketch the graph of this function for t = 0 to t = 0.1.
    
    66. Sound Wave The oscillations in air pressure representing the sound wave for a tone at the standard pitch of A can be modeled by the equation y = 0.02 sin (880πt), where y is the sound pressure in pascals after t seconds. Sketch the graph of this function for t = 0 to t = 0.01.
    
    Frequency With simple harmonic motion, the reciprocal of the period is called the frequency. The frequency, given by
    
    f = 1/period
    
    represents the number of cycles (or oscillations) that are completed per unit time. The units used to describe frequency are Hertz, where 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second.

    In the previous section, we considered what happens to the graph when we allow for a coefficient (a multiplier) with a sine or cosine function. We will conclude our study of the graphs of these two functions by investigating the effect caused by inserting a term (that is, adding or subtracting a number) in the equation of the function. As we will see, the addition of a term creates a translation, in which the position, but not shape, of the graph is changed.
    
    Vertical Translations
    
    Recall from algebra the relationship between the graphs of y = x² and y = x² — 3. Figures 1 and 2 show the graphs. The graph of y = x² — 3 has the same shape as the graph of y = x² but with its vertex (and all other points) moved down three units. If we were to graph y = x² + 2, the graph would have the same shape as the graph of y = x², but it would be shifted up two units. In general, the graph of
    
    y = f(x) + k is the graph of y = f(x) translated k units vertically. If k is a positive number, the translation is up. If k is a negative number, the translation is down.

    SOLUTION By rewriting the function slightly
    y=—3-2sin 7x = —2 sinawx — 3
    we see that y = —3 — 2 sin wx will have a graph that is identical to that of
    
    y = —2s1n 7x, except that all points on the graph will be shifted downward three
    units. Using the result of Example 8 in the previous section, we move every point
    3 units downward to obtain the graph shown in Figure 3.

    Notice how the vertical translation has changed the range as well. By subtracting
    3 units, the original range [—2, 2] becomes [—5, —1]. a
    
    In our next example we show how to graph a trigonometric function involving a
    vertical translation directly. Because the sine and cosine functions are centered
    about the x-axis, we can shift the axis first and then sketch the graph as usual.

    **Example 2**
    
    In Example 6 of Section 3.5, we found that the height of a rider on a Ferris wheel was given by the function
    
    $$
    H = 139 - 125 \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{20}\right)
    $$
    
    where $\theta$ is the number of minutes from the beginning of a ride. Graph a complete cycle of this function.
    
    **SOLUTION**
    
    The term 139 indicates that the cosine graph is shifted 139 units upward. We lightly draw the dashed horizontal line $H = 139$ to act as a place for the $y$-axis, and then proceed as normal.
    
    The amplitude is 125, and there is a reflection about the $y$-axis due to the negative sign.
    
    $$
    0 < \theta < 27\\
    10 < \theta < 20
    $$
    
    One cycle:
    $$
    \frac{10}{2} = 5
    $$
    
    The period is 20. Dividing 20 by 4, we will mark the $y$-axis at intervals of 5. Using a rectangle to frame the cycle, we then sketch in the graph as shown in Figure 4. Notice that we measure 125 units above and below the line $H = 139$ to create the frame and that we must remember to plot points for a cycle that is reflected.

    H = 139 \\
    125 < \theta < 4
    $$
    
    **Figure 4**
    
    **Summary**
    
    The graphs of $y = k + \sin x$ and $y = k + \cos x$ will be sine and cosine graphs that have been translated vertically $k$ units upward if $k > 0$, or $|k|$ units downward if $k < 0$.
    
    **Horizontal Translations**
    
    If we add a term to the argument of the function, the graph will be translated in a horizontal direction instead of a vertical direction as demonstrated in the next example.

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Graph y = sin (x + 7/2) if x < 2
    Graph y = cos |x — 7/2| for 2 ≤ x ≤ 2
    T 7 SOLUTION Because we have not graphed an equation of this form before, it is
    300 3 a good idea to begin by making a table (Table 1). In this case, multiples of 7/2
    will be the most convenient replacements for x in the table. Also, if we start with
    x = —7/2, our first value of y will be 0.
    TABLE 1
    x y=sin (x + 7/2) (x,y)
    -7/2 sin(-7/2 + 7/2) = sin(0) = 0 (-7/2, 0)
    -5/2 sin(-5/2 + 7/2) = sin(1) = 0 (-5/2, 0)
    0 sin(0 + 7/2) = sin(7/2) = 1 (0, 1)
    5/2 sin(5/2 + 7/2) = sin(6) = 0 (5/2, 0)
    3a sin(3a + 7/2) = sin(3a) = -1 (3a, -1)
    -7/2 sin(-7/2 + 7/2) = sin(0) = 0 (-7/2, 0)
    5/2 sin(5/2 + 7/2) = sin(6) = 0 (5/2, 0)
    Graphing these points and then drawing the sine curve that connects them
    gives us the graph of y = sin (x + 7/2), as shown in Figure 5.

    It seems that the graph of y = sin (x + 7/2) is shifted 7/2 units to the left of the
    graph of y = sin x. We say the graph of y = sin (x + 7/2) has a horizontal trans-
    lation, or horizontal shift, of —7/2, where the negative sign indicates the shift is
    
    to the left (in the negative direction).
    We can see why the graph was shifted to the left by looking at how the extra

    Notice that a cycle will now begin at x = —7/2 instead of at zero, and will end at
    3π/2 instead of 2π, which agrees with the graph in Figure 5. The graph has sim-
    ply shifted 7/2 units to the left. The horizontal shift is the value of x at which the
    basic cycle begins, which will always be the left value in the preceding inequality
    after x has been isolated.

    y =sin (x + π/6) SOLUTION There are no additional coefficients present, so the amplitude is 1
    
    and the period is 2π. The term in the argument will cause a horizontal transla-
    tion. We consider a basic cycle:
    
    qT
    
    One cycle: 0 ≤ x — π/6 ≤ 2π
    Add π/6 to isolate x
    TEX = π/6 to isolate x

    A cycle will begin at x = π/6 and end at x = 7π/6. Notice that the period has
    not changed, because
    
    7π/6
    6
    
    = π
    
    Dividing 2π by 4, we get π/2. To mark the x-axis, we begin at x = π/6 and add
    increments of π/2 as follows:

    Summary  
    
    The graphs of y = sin (x — h) and y = cos (x — h) will be sine and cosine  
    graphs that have been translated horizontally h units to the right if h > 0, or  
    h units to the left if h < 0.

    and a horizontal shift.

    Because the original problem asked for the graph on the interval 0 = x = 27,  
    we extend the graph to the right by adding the first quarter of a second cycle. On  
    the left, we add the last three quarters of an additional cycle to reach 0. The final  
    graph is shown in Figure 8.

    In general, for y = sin (Bx + C) or y = cos (Bx + C) to complete one cycle,  
    the quantity Bx + C must vary from 0 to 2π. Therefore, assuming B > 0,  
    0 < Bx + C < 2π if −C/B < x < (2π − C)/B  
    The horizontal shift will be the left end point of the cycle, or −C/B. If you find the  
    difference between the end points, you will see that the period is 2π/B as before.  
    The constant C in y = sin(Bx + C) or y = cos(Bx + C) is called the phase. Phase  
    is important in situations in which two sinusoidal curves are being compared to one  
    another (such as when working with alternating currents). If x represents time, then  
    the phase is the fraction of a standard period of 2π that a point on the graph of  
    y = sin (Bx + C) lags or leads a corresponding point on the graph of y = sin Bx.  
    For instance, the phase of the equation in Example 3 is π/2, which indicates  
    that the graph of y = sin (x + π/2) leads the graph of y = sin x by 1/4 of a complete  
    cycle. In Figure 5 you can see how all the points on the red graph would occur π/2  
    units of time before the corresponding points on the blue graph, and  
    1 1 π

    Likewise, in Example 5 the phase is −3π/2. As you can see in Figure 8, the graph  
    of y = 4cos (2x − 3π/2) lags behind the graph of y = 4 cos 2x by 3/4 of a cycle, and

    230 CHAPTER 4 Graphing and Inverse Functions
    
    Another method of determining the period and horizontal shift is to rewrite
    the function so that the argument looks like B(x — h) instead of combined as
    Bx + C. For instance, using the function from Example 5 we have
    
    377 377
    y =4cos (> — ). 4 cos (2(. — r))
    
    which is accomplished by factoring out the coefficient of 2. We can now easily
    identify that B = 2 and h = 37/4.
    
    Before working a final example that ties everything together, we summarize all
    the information we have covered about the graphs of the sine and cosine functions.
    
    Graphing the Sine and Cosine Functions THT
    
    The graphs of y =A + A sin (B(x — h)) and y =k + A cos (B(x — /A)), where

    The term 5 in the equation y = sin(x + 5) affects the graph by vertically stretching it. This means that the amplitude of the sine wave is increased, making the peaks and troughs more pronounced. The graph will have a greater height from the maximum to the minimum points compared to the standard sine wave.
    
    The term 5 in the equation y = sin(x - 5) affects the graph by horizontally shifting it. Specifically, it shifts the graph to the right by 5 units. This means that the entire sine wave moves along the x-axis, and the key points of the graph (such as the maximum, minimum, and intercepts) will also shift to the right by 5 units.

    236 CHAPTER 4 Il Graphing and Inverse Functions  
    
    The same techniques that we used to graph the sine and cosine functions can be  
    used with the other four trigonometric functions.  
    
    Tangent and Cotangent  
    
    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Graph y = 3 tanxfor -7=x<7.  
    
    1  
    Graph y = 3 tan x for —TEXET.  
    
    SOLUTION Although the tangent does not have a defined amplitude, we know  
    from our work in the previous sections that the factor of 3 will triple all of the  
    y-coordinates. That is, for the same x, the value of y in y = 3 tan x will be three  
    times the corresponding value of y in y = tan x.
  - |-
    To sketch the graph of one cycle, remember that a cycle begins with an x-
    intercept, has the vertical asymptote in the middle, and ends with an x-inter-
    cept. At x = 7/4, the normal y-value of 1 must be tripled, so we plot a point at
    (7/4, 3). For the same reason we plot a point at (37/4, —3). Figure 1 shows a
    complete cycle for y = 3 tan x (we have included the graph of y = tan x for
    comparison).
    
    The original problem asked for the graph on the interval —7 = x = 7. We
    extend the graph to the left by adding a second complete cycle. The final graph
    is shown in Figure 2.
    
    Figure 1 Figure 2
    
    In Section 1.5, we found that the expression √(x^7 + 9) could be rewritten without
    a square root by making the substitution x = 3 tan θ. Then we noted that the
    substitution itself was questionable because we did not know at that time if every
    real number x could be written as 3 tan θ, for some value of θ. As you can see from
    the graph in Figure 2, the range for y = 3 tan θ is all real numbers. This means that
    any real number can indeed be written as 3 tan θ, which confirms the validity of
    the substitution.
    
    As we saw in Section 4.2, the presence of a coefficient (other than 1) with the
    independent variable may result in a reflection or change in the period, which, for
    the tangent and cotangent functions, is π. We consider this case in the following
    two examples.

    PROBLEM 2 ' EXAMPLE 2. Graph one complete cycle of y = cot (—2x).  
    Graph one cycle of y = 2 cot 3 x. 2  
    
    SOLUTION Because the cotangent is an odd function,  
    
    1 1  
    y = cot (—2x) = — cot (2x)  
    The factor of 4 will halve all of the y-coordinates of y = cot (2x) and cause an  
    x-axis reflection. In addition, there is a coefficient of 2 in the argument. To see  
    how this will affect the period, we identify a complete cycle. Remember that the  
    period of the cotangent function is π, not 2π.  
    
    One cycle: 0 < argument = π  
    
    0 ≤ 2x ≤ π The argument is 2x  
    
    π  
    0 ≤ x ≤ π/2 Divide by 2 to isolate x  
    
    The period is π/2. Dividing this by 4 gives us π/8, so we will mark the x-axis in  
    increments of π/8 starting at x = 0.

    The basic cycle of a cotangent graph begins with a vertical asymptote, has an  
    x-intercept in the middle, and ends with another vertical asymptote (see Table 6,  
    Section 4.1). We can sketch a frame to help plot the key points and draw the  
    asymptotes, much as we did with the sine and cosine functions. The difference  
    is that the upper and lower sides of the frame do not indicate maximum and  
    minimum values of the graph but are only used to define the position of two key  
    points. Figure 3 shows the result.

    the wall and rotates through one complete revolution every 2 seconds. Graph the
    function that gives the length din terms of time ¢ from ¢ = 0 to f = 2.
    
    Figure 4
    
    SOLUTION From Example 4 of Section 3.5, we know that d= 10 tan zt. We
    must multiply all the y-values of the basic tangent function by 10. Also, the coef-
    ficient of zr will change the period.

    of i The graph is shown in Figure 5. Because the original problem asks for the
    graph from ¢ = 0 to ¢ = 2, we extended the graph by adding an additional cycle
    on the right.

    PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4 Graph one complete cycle of y = 3 + 2 tan (3x + π/2)
    Graph one cycle of y = 2 + 4 tan (3x − π/2)
    SOLUTION The first term of 3 will shift the graph of y = tan x vertically 3 units
    upward. The factor of 2 will double the y-coordinates. To determine the horizon-
    tal shift and period, we check one cycle.

    _2 = * = π/2 Subtract −π/2
    § 2 8 8
    _= π/2 x i Multiply by 2
    4 4
    
    A cycle will begin at −π/4, so the graph is shifted π/4 units to the left. To find
    the period, we compute the difference between endpoints for the cycle:
    
    Period = π/2 − (−π/4) = 3π/4
    Dividing the period by 4 gives us π/2, so we mark the x-axis at intervals of
    π/2 beginning with x = −π/4 as follows (we only need to find the three middle
    points).
    
    −π/4, −π/4 + π/2 = π/4, −π/4 + 2(π/2) = 3π/4, −π/4 + 3(π/2) = 5π/4
    
    A cycle will begin and end with x-intercepts at x = −π/4 and x = 5π/4 (on the
    shifted axis). There will be a vertical asymptote at x = 3π/4. Figure 6 shows the
    key points, and the final graph is given in Figure 7.

    Period and Horizontal Shift for Tangent and Cotangent |

    y  
    
    We can also rewrite the function by factoring so that the argument looks like  
    B(x — h) instead of combined as Bx + C. For instance, using the function from  
    Example 4 we have

    The graphs of $ y = k + A \tan (B(x - h)) $ and $ y = k + A \cot (B(x - h)) $, where  
    $ B > 0 $, will have the following characteristics:
    
    Period = $ \frac{\pi}{|B|} $  
    Horizontal translation = $ h $  
    Vertical translation = $ k $
    
    In addition, $ |A| $ is the factor by which the basic graphs are expanded or contracted vertically. If $ A < 0 $ the graph will be reflected about the x-axis.

    SECTION 4.4 The Other Trigonometric Functions 241
    
    In Figure 9 we have included the graph of $ y = 4 \sin x $. Notice how the sine  
    graph, in a sense, defines the behavior of the cosecant graph. The graph of $ y =  
    4 \csc x $ has a vertical asymptote wherever $ y = 4 \sin x $ crosses the x-axis (has a  
    zero). Furthermore, the highest and lowest points on the sine graph tell us where  
    the two key points on the cosecant graph are.
  - |-
    As Example 5 illustrates, because the secant and cosecant are reciprocals of the
    cosine and sine, respectively, there is a natural relationship between their graphs.
    We can take advantage of this relationship to graph the secant and cosecant func-
    tions by first graphing a corresponding cosine or sine function.

    One cycle: 0 ≤ 2x ≤ 2π
    0 ≤ x ≤ π
    The period is π. We can sketch two complete cycles between −π and π, and
    
    then use two half-cycles to extend the graph out to −3π/2 and 3π/2. Figure 10
    shows the resulting graph.

    To sketch the graph of the secant function, we note that the zeros of the cosine
    graph correspond to the vertical asymptotes of the secant graph, and the peaks
    and valleys of the cosine graph correspond to the valleys and peaks of the
    secant graph, respectively.

    The graph of y = 3 cos 2x is shown in Figure 11. Notice that the range of the
    
    function is y = −1/3 or y= 1/3.

    NOTE In sketching the graph of the cosecant function in Example 5 and the secant function in Example 6, we are not actually taking reciprocals of the y-coordinates of points on the sine and cosine graphs. Because of the change in amplitude, we would not obtain the correct graphs if we did so. We are simply using the shape of a sine or cosine graph with the proper amplitude to guide us in drawing the correct graph of the cosecant or secant function.

    PROBLEM 7 EXAMPLE 7 Identify the period, range, and horizontal and vertical translations for y = 2 + 2 sec(3x + 6).
    
    Identify the period, range, and horizontal and vertical translations for y = 2 + 2 sec(3x + 6).
    
    SOLUTION There is a vertical translation of 2 units upward. Normally, the range for the secant function is y = -1 or y = 1. The factor of 2 will double the y-coordinates, so that y = -2 or y = 2. Adding 2 units due to the vertical translation, we get {y|y = 0 or y = 4} for the range.
    
    To find the period and horizontal translation, we consider one cycle:
    
    One cycle: 0 ≤ 3x + 6 ≤ 2π  
    Solving for x:
    
    0 ≤ 3x + 6 ≤ 2π  
    -6 ≤ 3x ≤ 2π - 6  
    -2 ≤ x ≤ (2π - 6)/3  
    
    The horizontal translation is 2 units to the right and the period is (2π)/3.
    
    PROBLEM 8 EXAMPLE 8 Graph one cycle of y = -1 - 3 csc(x + π/2).  
    Graph one cycle of y = -1 - 3 csc(x + π/2).
    
    SOLUTION First, we sketch the graph of y = sin(x + π/2). The graph of y = -1 - 3 csc(x + π/2) is the reciprocal of y = sin(x + π/2), reflected over the x-axis, vertically scaled by a factor of 3, and shifted down by 1 unit. The period is the same as the sine function, which is 2π. The vertical asymptotes occur where sin(x + π/2) = 0, which is at x = -π/2 + nπ for integer n. One cycle of the graph will be from x = -π/2 to x = 3π/2.

    In graphing the secant and cosecant functions, the period, horizontal transla-
    tion, and vertical translation are identical to those for the sine and cosine. For this

    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY
    
    For Questions 1 through 4, fill in each blank with the appropriate word or expression.
    
    1. In y = A tan x, |A| is the factor by which the basic tangent graph will be stretched or vertically compressed. To sketch the graph, the y-coordinate of each point on the basic tangent graph is multiplied by A.
    
    2. The number 3 in y = 3 sec x will stretch the graph of y = sec x vertically by a factor of 3. The number 3 in y = 3 sec x will stretch the graph of y = sec x vertically by a factor of 3.
    
    3. The period of y = tan Bx is π/B.
    
    4. To graph y = k + A csc (Bx + C), first sketch the graph of the corresponding function to use as a guide.

    SOLUTION From algebra we know that the equation of any straight line (except
    a vertical one) can be written in slope-intercept form as
    
    y=mx + b
    
    where m is the slope of the line, and b is its y-intercept.
    
    Because the line in Figure 2 crosses the y-axis at 3, we know the y-intercept
    b is 3. To find the slope of the line, we find the ratio of the vertical change to the
    horizontal change between any two points on the line (sometimes called rise/
    run). From Figure 1 we see that this ratio is —1/2. Therefore, m = —1/2. The
    equation of our line must be

    horizontal shift) as the graph shown in Figure 6. In addition, it has undergone a  
    vertical shift up of two units; therefore, the equation is  
    
    y = 2 + 3 sin 2x for 0 < x ≤ 2π

    SOLUTION § If we look at the graph from x = 0 to x = 2, it looks like a cosine curve  
    that has been reflected about the x-axis. The general form for a cosine curve is  
    y = k + A cos (B(x — h))  
    From Figure 10 we see that the amplitude is 5. Because the graph has been  
    reflected about the x-axis, A = —5. The period is 2, giving us an equation to  
    solve for B:  
    21  
    Period = — = 2 > B = 7  
    B  
    There is no horizontal or vertical translation of the curve (if we assume it is a  
    cosine curve), so h and k are both 0. An equation that describes this graph is  
    y = —5 cos 7x for —0.5 ≤ x ≤ 2.5  
    
    In Examples 2 through 4, a sine function was the most natural choice given the  
    appearance of the graph, and this resulted in the simplest equation possible. We  
    could also have used a cosine function, but it would have required us to consider  
    additional factors, such as a horizontal translation.  
    
    Likewise, we could use a sine function for the graph in Example 5 instead of a  
    cosine function. As a sine curve, we see that a cycle begins at x = 0.5. This would  
    require that we include a horizontal shift of 0.5 = h. Then we would have A = 5,  
    B = 7, h = 0.5 and k = 0, giving us  
    
    y = 5 sin(7(x — 0.5))  
    = sin(7x — 3.5)

    If we use a reflected sine function, then 4 = —5 and a cycle begins at —0.5.
    This would give us a horizontal shift of 5, so

    As you can see, there are many possible equations we could find to represent
    the graph of a trigonometric function. The point is not to overwhelm you with too
    many choices but to let you know that there is more than one correct answer for
    each of these problems. Whether you choose a sine function or a cosine function,
    you should be able to find an equation that works. In making your choice, use what
    seems most “natural” to you, and try to keep the equation as simple as possible.

    Using Technology: Verifying Trigonometric Models
    
    With a graphing calculator, we can easily verify that our equation, or model,
    for the graph in Figure 10 is correct. First, set your calculator to radian mode,
    and then define
    
    Y1 = —5 cos (77x)
    
    Set the window variables to match the given graph:
    
    —0.5 =x =2.5, scale = 0.5; -6 = y ≤6
    
    Figure 11
    If our equation is correct, the graph drawn by our calculator should be identical
    to the graph provided. Because the graph shown in Figure 11 is the same as the
    graph in Figure 10, our equation must be correct.
    
    In our next example, we use a table of values for two variables to obtain a
    graph. From the graph, we find the equation.

    **SECTION 4.5 I Finding an Equation from Its Graph 253**
    
    First, make a table that shows the rider’s height H above the ground for each of the nine values of f shown in Figure 12. Then graph the ordered pairs indicated by the table. Finally, use the graph to find an equation that gives H as a function of f.
    
    **SOLUTION**
    
    Here is the reasoning we use to find the value of H for each of the given values of f: When f = 0 and f = 20, the rider is at the bottom of the wheel, 14 feet above the ground. When f = 10, the rider is at the top of the wheel, which is 264 feet above the ground. At times f = 5 and f = 15, the rider is even with the center of the wheel, which is 139 feet above the ground. The other four values of H are found using right triangle trigonometry, as we did in Section 2.3. Table 1 shows our corresponding values of f and H.

    If we graph the points (¢, H) on a rectangular coordinate system and then
    connect them with a smooth curve, we produce the diagram shown in Figure 13.
    The curve is a cosine curve that has been reflected about the f-axis and then
    shifted up vertically.
    
    The curve is a cosine curve, so the equation will have the form
    
    H = k + A cos(B(x — h))
    
    To find the equation for the curve in Figure 13, we must find values for k, A, B,
    and h. We begin by finding h. Because the curve starts at ¢ = 0, the horizontal
    shift is 0, which gives us
    
    h = 0
    
    The amplitude, half the difference between the highest point and the lowest
    point on the graph, must be 125 (also equal to the radius of the wheel). How-
    ever, because the graph is a reflected cosine curve, we have
    
    A = —125
    The period is 20 minutes, so we find B with the equation
    
    2π
    20 = — B → B = —

    The amount of the vertical translation, k, is the distance the center of the wheel

    SECTION 4.5 If Finding an Equation from Its Graph 255
    
    The horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum values is half
    the period. The maximum value occurs at x = 5 and the minimum value occurs at
    x =11, so
    
    Period = 2(11 — 5) = 12
    
    Now we can find B. Because the formula for the period is 2π/B, we have
    
    2π = 2π / B
    B = 1
    
    Because a cosine cycle begins at its maximum value, the horizontal shift will be
    the corresponding x-coordinate of this point. The maximum occurs at x = 5, so
    we have h = 5. Substituting the values for A, B, k, and h into the general form
    gives us
    
    y = 19,450 + 18,550 cos (πx - 5)
    0 < x < 12
    
    In Figure 15 we have used a graphing calculator to graph this function against
    the data. As you can see, the model is a good fit for the second half of the year
    but does not fit the data as well during the spring months.

    **Simple Harmonic Motion**  
    As we discussed earlier in Problem Set 4.2, any object or quantity that is moving with a periodic sinusoidal oscillation is said to exhibit simple harmonic motion. This motion can be modeled by the trigonometric function
    
    $$ y = A \sin(\omega t) $$  
    or  
    
    $$ y = A \cos(\omega t) $$  
    where $ A $ and $ \omega $ are constants. The frequency, given by  
    
    $$ f = \frac{1}{\text{period}} $$  
    
    represents the number of cycles (or oscillations) that are completed per unit time. The unit used to describe frequency is the Hertz, where $ 1 \text{ Hz} = 1 \text{ cycle per second} $.

    **Equilibrium**
    
    35. **Oscillating Spring**  
    A mass attached to a spring is pulled downward and released. The displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position after $ t $ seconds is given by the function  
    
    $$ d = A \cos(\omega t) $$  
    where $ d $ is measured in centimeters (Figure 16). The length of the spring when it is shortest is 11 centimeters, and 21 centimeters when it is longest. If the spring oscillates with a frequency of 0.8 Hertz, find $ d $ as a function of $ t $.
    
    36. **Alternating Current**  
    The voltage of an alternating current can be modeled by the function  
    
    $$ V = A \sin(\omega t) $$  
    where $ t $ is measured in seconds and $ V $ in volts. If the voltage alternates between –210 and 210 volts, and the frequency is 90 Hertz, find $ V $ as a function of $ t $. Assume the voltage begins at 0 and increases at first.

    Learning Objectives
    
    Use addition of y-coordinates to evaluate a function.
    
    Use addition of y-coordinates to graph a function.
    
    In this section, we will graph equations of the form y = y1 + y2, where y1 and y2 are algebraic or trigonometric functions of x. For instance, the equation y = 1 + sin x can be thought of as the sum of the two functions y1 = 1 and y2 = sin x. That is,
    
    if y = 1 and y = sin x  
    then y = y1 + y2
    
    Using this kind of reasoning, the graph of y = 1 + sin x is obtained by adding each value of y1 in y1 = sin x to the corresponding value of y2 in y2 = 1. Graphically, we can show this by adding the values of y from the graph of y1 to the corresponding values of y from the graph of y2 (Figure 1). If y1 > 0, then y1 + y2 will be above y1 by a distance equal to y1. If y1 < 0, then y1 + y2 will be below y1 by a distance equal to the absolute value of y1.

    Although in actual practice you may not draw in the little vertical lines we
    have shown here, they do serve the purpose of allowing us to visualize the idea
    of adding the y-coordinates on one graph to the corresponding y-coordinates on
    
    another graph.

    PROBLEM I, EXAMPLE 1. Graph y = By ~ sin x between x = O and x = 47.
    Graph y = 3 + sin x for
    In <x <2n. SOLUTION Wecan think of the equation y = iy — sin x as the sum of the equa-
    tions y,; = ax and y, = —sin x. Graphing each of these two equations on the
    
    same set of axes and then adding the values of y, to the corresponding values of
    y1, we have the graph shown in Figure 2.
    
    Figure 2 =
    
    For the rest of the examples in this section, we will not show the vertical
    lines used to visualize the process of adding y-coordinates. Sometimes the graphs
    become too confusing to read when the vertical lines are included. It is the idea
    behind the vertical lines that is important, not the lines themselves.

    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2. Graph y = 2 sin x + cos 2x for x between 0 and 47.
    Graph y = 2 sin x — cos 2x for
    0=x<4n. SOLUTION Wecan think of y as the sum of y, and y5, where

    SECTION 4.6 Graphing Combinations of Functions 265
    
    Using Technology: Combinations of Functions
  - |-
    Although a graphing calculator can easily graph the function  
    y = 2sin x + cos 2x in Example 2 without using the methods in this section, it  
    Plot! Plot? Plot3 can also help reinforce them. Set your calculator to radian mode and enter the  
    \Y 12sin(X) following functions:  
    “Y 2Hicos(2X)  
    ee Y1 = 2 sin (x), Y2 = cos (2x), and Y3=Yi+Y2  
    an If your calculator has the ability to set different graphing styles, set the first  
    \Y7= function Y1 to graph in the normal style, the second function Y2 in the dot style,  
    Figure 4 and the third function Y3 in the bold style. Figure 4 shows how the functions  
    would be defined on a TI-84. Now set your window variables so that  
    O=<x=47,scale=7;-45y 54  
    When you graph the functions, your calculator screen should look similar to  
    Figure 5. For any x, the dotted graph (Y2) indicates the distance we should  
    travel above or below the normal graph (Y1) in order to locate the bold  
    graph (Y3).  
    Notice that the period of the function y = 2sin x + cos 2x is 2π. We can also  
    see that the function is at a minimum when the individual component functions  
    y1 = 2sin x and y2 = cos 2x are both at their minimum values of −2 and −1.  
    Because y = y1 + y2, this minimum value will be (−2) + (−1) = −3. However,  
    the maximum values of y1 and y2 do not occur simultaneously, so the maxi-  
    mum of y = 2 sin x + cos 2x is not so easily determined. Using the appropri-  
    ate command on the calculator, we find that the maximum value is 1.5, as  
    shown in Figure 6.

    **Problem 4 Example 4**
    
    Graph $ y = \sin x + \cos x $ for $ x $ between 0 and $ 4\pi $.
    
    Graph $ y = \sin x - \cos x $ for $ 0 \leq x < 4\pi $.  
    **SOLUTION:** We let $ y_1 = \sin x $ and $ y_2 = \cos x $, and graph $ y_1 $, $ y_2 $, and $ y = y_1 + y_2 $.  
    **Figure 8** illustrates these graphs.
    
    $$
    y = y_1 + y_2 = \sin x + \cos x

    **Figure 8**
    
    The graph of $ y = \sin x + \cos x $ has amplitude $ \sqrt{2} $. If we were to extend the graph to the left, we would find it crossed the x-axis at $ -\frac{7\pi}{4} $. It would then be apparent that the graph of $ y = \sin x + \cos x $ is the same as the graph of $ y = \sqrt{2} \sin\left(x + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) $; both are sine curves with amplitude $ \sqrt{2} $ and horizontal shift $ -\frac{\pi}{4} $.

    One application of combining trigonometric functions can be seen with Fourier series. Fourier series are used in physics and engineering to represent certain waveforms as an infinite sum of sine and/or cosine functions.

    The following function, which consists of an infinite number of terms, is called a Fourier series.

    The value of one of the trigonometric functions. This is the reverse of what a trigonometric function is designed to do. When we try to use a function in the reverse direction, we are really using what is called the inverse of the function. We begin this section with a brief review of the inverse of a function. If this is a new topic for you, a more thorough presentation of functions and inverse functions is provided in Appendix A.
    First, let us review the definition of a function and its inverse.
    
    Definition: Function and Inverse
    
    A function is a rule or correspondence that pairs each element of the domain with exactly one element from the range. That is, a function is a set of ordered pairs in which no two different ordered pairs have the same first coordinate.
    
    The inverse of a function is found by interchanging the coordinates in each ordered pair that is an element of the function.

    SECTION 4.7 Inverse Trigonometric Functions 271
    
    With the inverse, the domain and range of the function have switched roles. To find the equation of the inverse of a function, we simply exchange x and y in the equation and then solve for y. For example, to find the inverse of the function y = x² - 4, we would proceed like this:
    
    The inverse of y = x² - 4
    is x = y² - 4 Exchange x and y
    or y² = x + 4 Add 4 to both sides
    
    y = √(x + 4) Take the square root of both sides
    
    The inverse of the function y = x² - 4 is given by the equation y = √(x + 4).
  - |-
    The graph of y = x² — 4 is a parabola that crosses the x-axis at —2 and 2 and  
    has its vertex at (0, —4). To graph the inverse, we take each point on the graph of  
    y = x² — 4, interchange the x- and y-coordinates, and then plot the resulting point.  
    Figure 1 shows both graphs. Notice that the graph of the inverse is a reflection of  
    the graph of the original function about the line y = x.
    
    A y = x² — 4 y = ex
    
    Figure 1
    
    From Figure 1 we see that the inverse of y = x² — 4 is not a function because  
    the graph of y = ±√x + 4 does not pass the vertical line test. For the inverse to  
    also be a function, the graph of the original function must pass the horizontal line  
    test. Functions with this property are called one-to-one functions. If a function is  
    one-to-one, then we know its inverse will be a function as well.
    
    Inverse Function Notation
    
    If y = f(x) is a one-to-one function, then the inverse of f is also a function and  
    can be denoted by y = f⁻¹(x).
    
    Because the graphs of all six trigonometric functions do not pass the horizontal line  
    test, the inverse relations for these functions will not be functions themselves. However, we will see that it is possible to define an inverse that is a function  
    if we restrict the original trigonometric function to certain angles. In this section,  
    we will limit our discussion of inverse trigonometric functions to the inverses of the  
    three major functions: sine, cosine, and tangent. The other three inverse trigonometric functions can be handled with the use of reciprocal identities.

    The Inverse Sine Relation  
    To find the inverse of y = sin x, we interchange x and y to obtain  
    x = sin y  
    
    This is the equation of the inverse sine relation.  
    To graph x = sin y, we simply reflect the graph of y = sin x about the line  
    y = x, as Shown in Figure 2.

    As you can see from the graph, x = sin y is a relation but not a function. For  
    every value of x in the domain, there are many values of y. The graph of x = sin y  
    fails the vertical line test.  
    
    The Inverse Sine Function  
    
    If the function y = sin x is to have an inverse that is also a function, it is necessary  
    to restrict the values that x can assume so that we may satisfy the horizontal line  
    test. The interval we restrict it to is −π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2. Figure 3 displays the graph of  
    y = sin x with the restricted interval showing. Notice that this segment of the sine  
    graph passes the horizontal line test, and it maintains the full range of the function  
    −1 ≤ y ≤ 1. Figure 4 shows the graph of the inverse relation x = sin y with the  
    restricted interval after the sine curve has been reflected about the line y = x.

    The inverse sine function will  
    return an angle between −π/2  
    and π/2, inclusive, corresponding  
    to QIV or QI.

    SECTION 4.7 Inverse Trigonometric Functions 273
    
    It is apparent from Figure 4 that if x = sin y is restricted to the interval
    –π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, then each value of x between –1 and 1 is associated with exactly
    one value of y, and we have a function rather than just a relation. The equation
    x = sin y, together with the restriction –π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, forms the inverse sine
    function. To designate this function, we use the following notation.
    
    The notation used to indicate the inverse sine function is as follows:
    
    Notation Meaning
    
    y = sin⁻¹x or y = arcsin x
    x = sin y and –π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2
    
    In words: y is the angle between –π/2 and π/2, inclusive, whose sine is x.
    
    NOTE The notation sin⁻¹x is not to be interpreted as meaning the reciprocal of
    sin x. That is,
    
    sin⁻¹x ≠ 1/sin x
    
    If we want the reciprocal of sin x, we use csc x or (sin x)⁻¹, but never sin⁻¹x.
    
    The Inverse Cosine Function
    
    Just as we did for the sine function, we must restrict the values that x can assume
    with the cosine function in order to satisfy the horizontal line test. The interval
    we restrict it to is 0 ≤ x ≤ π. Figure 5 shows the graph of y = cos x with the
    restricted interval. Figure 6 shows the graph of the inverse relation x = cos y with
    the restricted interval after the cosine curve has been reflected about the line y = x.

    The inverse cosine function will
    return an angle between 0 and π,

    or QII.
    
    The inverse tangent function will
    return an angle between — π/2
    and π/2, corresponding to QIV
    or QI.
    
    The notation used to indicate the inverse cosine function is as follows:
    
    Notation Meaning
    
    $ y = \cos^{-1} x $ or $ y = \arccos x $ $ x = \cos y $ and $ 0 \leq y \leq \pi $
    
    In words: $ y $ is the angle between 0 and π, inclusive, whose cosine is $ x $. 
    
    The Inverse Tangent Function
    
    For the tangent function, we restrict the values that $ x $ can assume to the interval
    $ -\pi/2 < x < \pi/2 $. Figure 7 shows the graph of $ y = \tan x $ with the restricted interval. Figure 8 shows the graph of the inverse relation $ x = \tan y $ with the restricted interval after it has been reflected about the line $ y = x $.

    more details on this property of inverse functions, see Appendix A.) The reason
    this same process did not occur in Example 4b is that the original angle 135° is
    not within the restricted domain of the sine function and is therefore outside the
    range of the inverse sine function. In a sense, the functions in Example 4b are not

    number such that f(x + p) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f.  
    
    AMPLITUDE [4.1, 4.2]

    largest value of y, denoted by M, and the smallest value of y, denoted by m.

    BASIC GRAPHS [4.1]  
    
    The graphs of y = sinx and y = cos x are both periodic with period 27. The  
    amplitude of each graph is 1. The sine curve passes through 0 on the y-axis, while  
    the cosine curve passes through | on the y-axis.  
    
    The graphs of y = csc x and y = sec x are also periodic with period 277. We  
    graph them by using the fact that they are reciprocals of sine and cosine. There is  
    no largest or smallest value of y, so we say the secant and cosecant curves have no  
    amplitude.
  - |-
    The graphs of y = tan x and y = cot x are periodic with period π. The tangent
    curve passes through the origin, while the cotangent is undefined when x is 0. There
    is no amplitude for either graph.

    Tangent is an even and odd function [4.1]

    An even function is a function for which
    f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f

    An odd function is a function for which
    f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain of f

    Cosine is an even function, and sine is an odd function. That is,
    cos(−θ) = cos θ
    Cosine is an even function
    and
    sin(−θ) = −sin θ
    Sine is an odd function
    
    The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis, and the graph of an
    odd function is symmetric about the origin.

    of y = 5 sin(x + 2) is ...
    The horizontal translation for a sine or cosine curve is the distance the curve has
    moved right or left from the curve y = sin x or y = cos x. For example, we usu-
    ally think of the graph of y = sin x as starting at the origin. If we graph another
    sine curve that starts at π/4, then we say this curve has a horizontal translation, or
    horizontal shift, of π/4.

    GROUP PROJECT
    
    From my earlier observations, which I have reported every year in this journal, it
    appears that there is a certain periodicity in the appearance of sunspots and this
    theory seems more and more probable from the results of this year...
    Heinrich Schwabe, 1843
    
    OBJECTIVE: To find a sinusoidal model for the average annual sunspot number
    using recent data.
    
    Sunspots have been observed and recorded for thousands of years. Some of the earli-
    est observations were made by Chinese astronomers. Further observations were made
    following the invention of the telescope in the 17th century by a number of astrono-
    mers, including Galileo and William Herschel. However, it was the German astron-
    omer Heinrich Schwabe who, in searching for evidence of other planets between
    Mercury and the Sun, first observed an apparent periodic cycle in sunspot activity.
    
    Table 1 provides the average annual sunspot number for each year between
    1978 and 1998.

    CHAPTER 4 Graphing and Inverse Functions
    
    EM Sketch a graph of the data, listing the year along the horizontal axis and the
    sunspot number along the vertical axis.
    
    PM] Using the data and your graph from Question 1, find an equation of the form
    y = k + A sin(B(x − h)) or y = k + A cos(B(x − h)) to match the graph, where
    x is the year and y is the sunspot number for that year. Explain how you deter-
    mined the values of k, A, B, and h, and show supporting work.
    
    E] According to your model, what is the length of the sunspot cycle (in years)?
    In 1848, Rudolph Wolf determined the length of the sunspot cycle to be
    11.1 years. How does your value compare with his?
    
    Use your model to predict the sunspot number for 2001. How does your pre-
    diction compare with the actual value of 111?
  - |-
    Using your graphing calculator, make a scatter plot of the data from the table.
    Then graph your model from Question 2 along with the data. How well does
    your model fit the data? What could you do to try to improve your model?
    
    If your graphing calculator is capable of computing a least-squares sinusoidal
    regression model, use it to find a second model for the data. Graph this new
    equation along with your first model. How do they compare?
    
    RESEARCH PROJECT
    The Sunspot Cycle
    
    Although many astronomers made regular observations of sunspots, it was the
    Swiss astronomer Rudolph Wolf who devised the first universal method for
    counting sunspots. The daily sunspot number, sometimes called the Wolf num-
    ber, follows a periodic cycle. Wolf calculated the length of this cycle to be about
    11.1 years.
    
    Research the astronomer Rudolph Wolf and the sunspot cycle. Why do
    modern astronomers consider the length of the sunspot cycle to be 22 years?
    What are some of the effects that the sunspot cycle causes here on Earth? Write
    a paragraph or two about your findings.

    Introduction
    Although it doesn’t look like it, Figure 1 shows the graphs of two functions, namely
    
    5 d 1 — sin* x
    = cos x an = ——_
    y y 1 + sin? x
    Although these two functions look quite different from one another, they are in
    fact the same function. This means that, for all values of x,
    
    5 1 — sin’ x
    cos’ xX = ———_—
    1 + sine x
    
    This last expression is an identity, and identities are one of the topics we will study
    in this chapter.

    **290 CHAPTER 5: Identities and Formulas**
    
    **Study Skills**
    
    The study skills for this chapter focus on the way you approach new situations in mathematics. The first study skill is a point of view you hold about your natural instincts for what does and doesn’t work in mathematics. The second study skill gives you a way of testing your instincts.
    
    **E.H. Don’t Let Your Intuition Fool You**  
    As you become more experienced and more successful in mathematics, you will be able to trust your mathematical intuition. For now, though, it can get in the way of your success. For example, if you ask a beginning algebra student to expand (a + 5)², many will write a² + b², which is incorrect. In trigonometry, at first glance it may seem that a statement such as sin (A + B) = sin A + sin B is true. However, it too is false, as you will see in this chapter.
    
    **1 Test Properties You Are Unsure Of**  
    From time to time you will be in a situation in which you would like to apply a property or rule, but you are not sure it is true. You can always test a property or statement by substituting numbers for variables. For instance, we always have students that rewrite (x + 3)² as x² + 9, thinking that the two expressions are equivalent. The fact that the two expressions are not equivalent becomes obvious when we substitute 10 for x in each one.
  - |-
    When x = 10, the expression (x + 3)' is (10 + 3)? = 137 = 169  
    When x = 10, the expression x7 + 9 = 10° + 9 = 100 + 9 = 109  
    Similarly, there may come a time when you are wondering if sin 2A is the  
    same as 2 sin A. If you try A = 30° in each expression, you will find out  
    quickly that the two expressions are not the same.  
    
    V3  
    When 4 = 30°, the expression sin 2A = sin 2(30°) = sin 60° = >  
    1  
    When 4 = 30°, the expression 2 sin A = 2 sin 30° = 2 - a 1  
    
    When you test the equivalence of expressions by substituting numbers for  
    the variable, make it easy on yourself by choosing numbers that are easy  
    to work with, as we did above.  
    
    It is not good practice to trust your intuition or instincts in every new sit-  
    uation in mathematics. If you have any doubt about generalizations you are  
    making, test them by replacing variables with numbers and simplifying.  
    
    Learning Objectives

    SECTION 5.1 Proving Identities 291  
    
    We began proving identities in Chapter 1. In this section, we will extend the work  
    we did in that chapter to include proving more complicated identities. For review, Table | lists the basic identities and some of their more important equivalent forms.

    cos θ = 1/sec θ  
    
    csc θ = 1/sin θ  
    sin θ = 1/csc θ  
    
    sec θ = 1/cos θ  
    cos θ = 1/sec θ  
    
    cot θ = 1/tan θ  
    tan θ = 1/cot θ  
    
    Ratio  
    tan θ = sin θ / cos θ  
    cos θ = 1/tan θ  
    
    cot θ = cos θ / sin θ  
    sin θ = 1/cot θ  
    
    Pythagorean  
    cos² θ + sin² θ = 1  
    sin² θ = 1 - cos² θ  
    
    cos² θ = 1 - sin² θ  
    sin θ = ±√(1 - cos² θ)  
    cos θ = ±√(1 - sin² θ)  
    
    1 + tan² θ = sec² θ  
    1 + cot² θ = csc² θ  
    
    NOTE The last two Pythagorean identities can be derived from cos² θ + sin² θ = 1  
    by dividing each side by cos² θ and sin² θ, respectively. For example, if we divide  
    each side of cos² θ + sin² θ = 1 by cos² θ, we have  
    
    cos² θ + sin² θ = 1  
    cos² θ / cos² θ + sin² θ / cos² θ = 1 / cos² θ  
    1 + tan² θ = sec² θ  
    
    To derive the last Pythagorean identity, we would need to divide both sides of  
    cos² θ + sin² θ = 1 by sin² θ to obtain 1 + cot² θ = csc² θ.  
    
    The rest of this section is concerned with using the basic identities (or their  
    equivalent forms) just listed, along with our knowledge of algebra, to prove other  
    identities.  
    
    Recall that an identity in trigonometry is a statement that two expressions  
    are equal for all replacements of the variable for which each expression is defined.  
    To prove (or verify) a trigonometric identity, we use trigonometric substitutions  
    and algebraic manipulations to either  
    
    1. transform the right side of the identity into the left side, or  
    2. transform the left side of the identity into the right side.

    292 CHAPTER 5 Bf Identities and Formulas
    
    The main thing to remember in proving identities is to work on each side of
    the identity separately. We do not want to use properties from algebra that involve
    both sides of the identity—like the addition property of equality. To do so would
    be to assume that the two sides are equal, which is what we are trying to establish.
    We are not allowed to treat the problem as an equation.
    
    We prove identities to develop the ability to transform one trigonometric
    expression into another. When we encounter problems in other courses that require
    the techniques used to verify identities, we usually find that the solutions to these
    problems hinge on transforming an expression containing trigonometric functions
    into less complicated expressions. In these cases, we do not usually have an equal
    sign to work with.

    In this example, we have transformed the left side into the right side. Remember,
    we verify identities by transforming one expression into another. a
    
    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2 Prove tan x + cos x = sin x (sec x + cot x).
    Prove
    
    cot x + 1 =cosx(cscx + secx). PROOF Wecan begin by applying the distributive property to the right side to
    multiply through by sin x. Then we can change the right side to an equivalent
    expression involving only sin x and cos x.

    Before we go on to the next example, let’s list some guidelines that may be
    useful in learning how to prove identities. Keep in mind that these are simply
    guidelines. The best way to become proficient at proving trigonometric iden-
    tities is to practice. The more identities you prove, the more you will be able
    to prove and the more confident you will become. Don’t be afraid to stop and
    start over if you don’t seem to be getting anywhere. With most identities, there
    are a number of different proofs that will lead to the same result. Some of the
    proofs will be longer than others.

    SECTION 5.1 Proving Identities 293
    
    Guidelines for Proving Identities RTT THT THT
    
    1. It is usually best to work on the more complicated side first.
    
    2. Look for trigonometric substitutions involving the basic identities that
    may help simplify things.
    
    3. Look for algebraic operations, such as adding fractions, the distributive
    property, or factoring, that may simplify the side you are working with or
    that will at least lead to an expression that will be easier to simplify.
    
    4. If you cannot think of anything else to do, change everything to sines and
    cosines and see if that helps.
    
    5. Always keep an eye on the side you are not working with to be sure you
    are working toward it. There is a certain sense of direction that accompa-

    Using Technology: Verifying Identities
    
    You can use your graphing calculator to decide if an equation is an identity
    or not. If the two expressions are indeed equal for all defined values of the
    variable, then they should produce identical graphs. Although this does not
    constitute a proof, it does give strong evidence that the identity is true.

    We can verify the identity in Example 4 by defining the expression on the  
    \Y IE +cos(X) left as a function Y1 and the expression on the right as a second function Y2. If  
    -O0Y2H{sin(X))*/(1-cos(X)) . . . ; :  
    \W3= your calculator is equipped with different graphing styles, set the style of Y2 so

    \Y6= . ; .; ;

    When you graph the functions, your calculator screen should look similar to  
    Figure 2 (the small circle is a result of the path style in action). Observe that the  
    two graphs are identical.

    296 CHAPTER 5 Identities and Formulas
    
    In the previous examples, we have concentrated on methods for proving that a
    statement is an identity, meaning that the two expressions are equal for all replace-
    ments of the variable for which each expression is defined. To show that a state-
    ment is not an identity is usually much simpler. All we must do is find a single
    value of the variable for which each expression is defined, but which makes the
    statement false. This is known as finding a counterexample.
    
    PROBLEM 8 EXAMPLE 8 Show that cot²θ + cos²θ = cot²θ cos²θ is not an identity by
    finding a counterexample.
    SOLUTION Because cot θ is undefined for θ = kπ, where k is any integer, we
    must choose some other value of θ as a counterexample. Using θ = π/4, we find
    
    cot²(π/4) + cos²(π/4) vs. cot²(π/4) cos²(π/4)
    
    cot(π/4) = 1, and cos(π/4) = √2/2
    
    So:
    
    cot²(π/4) + cos²(π/4) = 1² + (√2/2)² = 1 + (2/4) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2
    
    cot²(π/4) cos²(π/4) = (1)² * (√2/2)² = 1 * (2/4) = 1/2
    
    Therefore, cot²θ + cos²θ ≠ cot²θ cos²θ when θ = π/4, so the statement is not
    an identity. a
    
    Using Technology: Finding Counterexamples
    
    In the previous Using Technology section, we saw that a graphing calculator
    can be used to determine whether an equation appears to be an identity or not.
    Using this approach with Example 8, we define
  - |-
    Y1 = (tan (x)) 7 + (cos (x))’
    and Y2 = (tan (x)) 7(cos (x))* (Bold style)
    As shown in Figure 3, the two graphs are not identical so we suspect that this
    equation is not an identity. To find a counterexample, simply choose any value of
    the variable where the two graphs do not overlap. In Figure 4 we have used the
    
    calculator to evaluate each expression at 7/4. You can see how the expressions
    give different results.

    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY
    
    For Questions 1 through 6, fill in each blank with the appropriate word.
    
    1. An identity is a statement that two expressions are for all replacements of the
    variable for which each expression is defined.
    
    2. To prove, or verify, an identity, we start with one side of the equation and
    transform it until it is identical to the other side of the equation.
    3. To prove an identity, it is usually best to start with the more complex side first.
    
    4. If nothing else comes to mind, try changing everything in the expression into
    sine and cosine and then simplify.
    
    5. To investigate if an equation is an identity, graph the left side and the right side separately and see if the two graphs are identical.
    
    6. To prove that an equation is not an identity, find a value of the variable for which the two expressions do not have the same value.

    The expressions $ \sin(A + B) $ and $ \cos(A + B) $ occur frequently enough in mathematics that it is necessary to find expressions equivalent to them that involve sines and cosines of single angles. Let’s start by deriving the formula for $ \cos(A + B) $.
    
    We begin by drawing angle A in standard position and then adding B to it. Next we draw $ -B $ in standard position. Figure 1 shows these angles in relation to the unit circle. Note that the points on the unit circle through which the terminal sides of the angles A, A + B, and $ -B $ pass have been labeled with the sines and cosines of those angles.

    Now, applying the distance formula, we have  
    [cos (A + B) — 1f + [sin (4 + B) — Of = (cos A — cos BY + (sin A + sin B)  
    
    Let’s call this Equation 1. Taking the left side of Equation 1, expanding it, and  
    then simplifying by using the first Pythagorean identity gives us

    Adding —2 to both sides and then dividing both sides by —2 gives us the formula
    we are after:
    
    cos (A + B) =cos Acos B— sin A sin B
    
    This is the first formula in a series of formulas for trigonometric functions of
    the sum or difference of two angles. It must be memorized. Before we derive the
    others, let’s look at some of the ways we can use our first formula.
    
    NOTE Itisacommon mistake for students to think that
    
    cos (A + B)=cos A + cos B
    
    Is this true? The answer is no. Substituting almost any pair of numbers for A and
    B in the formula will yield a false statement. As a counterexample, we can let
    A = 30° and B = 60° in the preceding formula and then simplify each side.
    
    cos (30° + 60°) = cos 30° + cos 60°

    Notice that this is not a new relationship. We already know that if two angles are coterminal, then their cosines are equal—and x + 27 and x are coterminal.
    What we have done here is shown this to be true with a formula instead of the definition of cosine. a
    \
    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3 Write cos 3x cos 2x — sin 3x sin 2x as a single cosine.
    Write cos 5x cos x + sin 5x sin x
    as a single cosine. SOLUTION We apply the formula for cos (A + B) in the reverse direction from
    the way we applied it in the first two examples.
    cos 3x cos 2x — sin 3x sin 2x = cos (3x + 2x)
    = cos 5x a
    
    Here is the derivation of the formula for cos (A — B). It involves the formula for
    cos (A + B) and the formulas for even and odd functions.
    
    cos (A — B) =cos[A + (—B)] Write A — Bas a sum
    = cos A cos(—B)— sin A sin(—B) — Sum formula
    = cos A cos B — sin A (—sin B) Cosine is an even
    function, sine is odd
    
    = cos Acos B+ sin A sin B
    
    The only difference in the formulas for the expansion of cos (4 + B) and
    cos (A — B) is the sign between the two terms. Here are both formulas.
    
    cos (A + B) =cos Acos B— sin A sin B
    cos (A — B) =cos Acos B+ sin A sin B
  - |-
    Again, both formulas are important and should be memorized.

    PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4 Show that cos (90° — A) = sin A.
    Show that cos (270° + B) = sin B.
    SOLUTION We will need this formula when we derive the formula for
    
    sin (A + B).
    
    cos (90° — A) = cos 90° cos A + sin 90° sin A
    0·cosA+1·sin A
    sin A
    
    Note that the formula we just derived is not a new formula. The angles 90° — A
    and A are complementary angles, and we already know by the Cofunction Theo-
    rem from Chapter 2 that the sine of an angle is always equal to the cosine of its
    complement. We could also state it this way:
    
    sin (90° — A) = cos A
    We can use this information to derive the formula for sin (A + B). To under-
    
    stand this derivation, you must recognize that A + B and 90° — (A + B) are com-
    plementary angles.
    
    sin (A + B) = cos [90° — (A + B)] The sine of an angle is the
    cosine of its complement
    = cos [90° — A — B] Remove parentheses
    = cos [(90° — A) — B] Regroup within brackets
    
    Now we expand using the formula for the cosine of a difference.
    
    = cos (90° — A) cos B + sin (90° — A) sin B
    sin A cos B+ cos A sin B
    
    This gives us an expansion formula for sin (A + B).
    
    sin (A + B) = sin A cos B+ cos A sin B
  - |-
    This is the formula for the sine of a sum. To find the formula for sin (A — B),
    we write A — Bas A + (—B) and proceed as follows:
    sin (A — B) = sin (A + (—B))
    = sin A cos (—B) + cos A sin (— B)
    = sin A cos B— cos A sin B
    
    This gives us the formula for the sine of a difference.
    
    sin (4 — B) = sin A cos B— cos A sin B

    PROBLEM 5 EXAMPLE 5 Graph y = 4 sin 5x cos 3x — 4 cos 5x sin 3x from x = 0 to x = 2.
    Graph y = 5 (cos 6x cos 4x +
    sin 6x sin 4x) for 0 <= x = 2r. SOLUTION ‘To write the equation in the form y = A sin Bx, we factor 4 from
    
    each term on the right and then apply the formula for sin (A — B) to the remain-
    ing expression to write it as a single trigonometric function.
    
    y = 4sin 5x cos 3x — 4 cos 5x sin 3x
    = 4 (sin 5x cos 3x — cos 5x sin 3x)
    = 4 sin (5x — 3x)
    = 4 sin 2x

    Find the exact value of cos 12°  
    SOLUTION We have to write 7/12 in terms of two numbers for which the exact val-

    This is the answer we obtained in Example 1 because 7/12 = 15° is the comple-  
    ment of 75°, and the cosine of an angle is equal to the sine of its complement.

    find sin (A — B), cos (A — B), and tan (A — B).  
    
    SOLUTION We have sin A and cos B. We need to find cos A and sin B before we  
    can apply any of our formulas. Some equivalent forms of our first Pythagorean  
    identity will help here.
    
    If sin A = 2 with A in QI, then  
    cosA = +V1 — sin² A

    begin by deriving the difference formula for cos (A — B) instead of the sum formula. Figure 3 shows angles A and B in standard position, and the angle representing  
    A — B is labeled. Figure 4 also shows angle A — B, but rotated clockwise so that it is  
    in standard position.

    Prove an equation is an identity using a double-angle formula.
    
    We will begin this section by deriving the formulas for sin 2A and cos 2A using the formulas for sin (A + B) and cos (A + B). The formulas we derive for sin 2A and cos 2A are called double-angle formulas. Here is the derivation of the formula for sin 2A.
    
    sin 2A = sin (A + A) Write 2A as A + A
    
    = sin A cos A + cos A sin A Sum formula
    
    = sin A cos A + sin A cos A. Commutative property  
    = 2 sin A cos A
    
    The last line gives us our first double-angle formula.
    
    sin 2A = 2 sin A cos A
    
    The first thing to notice about this formula is that it indicates the 2 in sin 2A  
    cannot be factored out and written as a coefficient. That is,
    
    sin 2A ≠ 2 sin A  
    For example, if A = 30°, sin 2(30°) = sin 60° = √3/2, which is not the same as  
    2 sin 30° = 2(1/2) = 1.

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 If sin A = 2/3 with A in QII, find sin 2A.
    If cos A = -3/8 with A in QII,
    find sin 2A. SOLUTION ‘To apply the formula for sin 2A, we must first find cos A. Because
    A terminates in QII, cos A is negative.
    cos A = -√(1 - sin² A)
    3 2
    =-√1 - (3)² A in QII so cos A is negative

    Now we can apply the formula for sin 2A.

    There are three forms of the double-angle formula for cos 2A. The first involves
    both sin A and cos A, the second involves only cos A, and the third involves only
    sin A. Here is how we obtain the three formulas.

    314 CHAPTER 5 Identities and Formulas  
    
    To write this last formula in terms of cos A only, we substitute 1 — cos² A for  
    sin² A.  
    cos 2A = cos² A — (1 — cos² A)  
    = cos² A — 1 + cos² A  
    = 2cos² A — 1  
    
    To write the formula in terms of sin A only, we substitute 1 — sin² A for cos² A in  
    the last line above.  
    cos 2A = 2cos² A — 1  
    = 2(1 — sin² A) — 1  
    = 2 — 2sin² A — 1  
    = 1 — 2sin² A  
    
    Here are the three forms of the double-angle formula for cos 2A.  
    
    cos 2A = cos² A — sin² A First form  
    2cos² A — 1 Second form  
    = 1 — 2sin² A Third form  
    
    Which form we choose will depend on the circumstances of the problem, as the  
    next three examples illustrate.

    **Problem 4 Example 4**  
    If sin A = 3/√5, find cos 2A.  
    
    **Solution**:  
    In this case, because we are given sin A, applying the third form of the formula for cos 2A will give us the answer more quickly than applying either of the other two forms.  
    
    cos 2A = 1 - 2 sin² A  
    = 1 - 2(3/√5)²  
    = 1 - 2(9/5)  
    = 1 - 18/5  
    = (5/5 - 18/5)  
    = -13/5

    Prove cos 4x = 8 cos⁴ x - 8 cos² x + 1.  
    
    Prove sin 2x - 4 cos x sin² x = sin 2x cos 2x.  
    
    **Proof**:  
    We can write cos 4x as cos(2 * 2x) and apply our double-angle formula. Because the right side is written in terms of cos x only, we will choose the second form of our double-angle formula for cos 2θ.  
    
    cos 4x = cos(2 * 2x)  
    = 2 cos² 2x - 1 (Double-angle formula)  
    = 2(2 cos² x - 1)² - 1 (Double-angle formula)  
    = 2(4 cos⁴ x - 4 cos² x + 1) - 1 (Square)  
    = 8 cos⁴ x - 8 cos² x + 2 - 1 (Distribute)  
    = 8 cos⁴ x - 8 cos² x + 1 (Simplify)

    2 4  
    SOLUTION To substitute for the first term above, we need to write 6 in terms  
    of x. To do so, we solve the equation x = 3 tan 6 for @.

    Next, because the inverse tangent function can take on values only between — 7/2  
    and 7/2, wecan visualize 0 by drawing a right triangle in which 0 is one of the acute  
    angles. Because tan 0 = x/3, we label the side opposite 6 with x and the side  
    adjacent to 6 with 3.  
    By the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse of the triangle in Figure 2  
    must be Vx* + 9, which means

    half-angle formulas and are derived from the double-angle formulas for cos 2.4.
    In Section 5.3, we developed three ways to write the formula for cos 24, two
    
    of which were
    
    cos2A = 1-—2sin’ A and cos 2A = 2cos* A - 1
    The choice of the letter we use to denote the angles in these formulas is arbitrary,
    SO we can use x instead of A.

    Let us exchange sides in the first formula and solve for sin x.
    
    1 — 2 sin? x = cos 2x Exchange sides
    —2 sin? x = —1 + cos 2x Add —1 to both sides
    5 1 — cos 2x
    sin“ x = > Divide both sides by —2
    1 — cos 2x
    sn x= > Take the square root of both sides
    
    Because every value of x can be written as ; of some other number A, we can
    replace x with A/2. This is equivalent to saying 2x = A.

    **PROOF** We can use a half-angle formula on the left side. In this case, because we have sin²(x/2), we write the half-angle formula without the square root sign. After that, we multiply the numerator and denominator on the left side by tan x because the right side has tan x in both the numerator and the denominator.  
    
    sin²(x/2) = (1 - cos x)/2

    d = cos⁻¹[(sin(LT₁) sin(LT₂) + cos(LT₁) cos(LT₂) cos(LN₁ − LN₂))]
    
    An alternate formula that can be used is

    Express a sum or difference of two trigonometric functions as a product.
    
    Use the sum to product and product to sum formulas to prove an identity.
    
    There are two main parts to this section, both of which rely on the work we have  
    done previously with identities and formulas. In the first part of this section, we  
    will extend our work on identities to include problems that involve inverse trigo-

    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2 Write sin (2 tan⁻¹ x) as an equivalent algebraic expression involving only x. (Assume x is positive.)
    Write cos (2 tan⁻¹ x) as an expression involving only x. 
    
    SOLUTION We begin by letting θ = tan⁻¹ x, which means
    tan θ = x
    
    Draw a right triangle with an acute angle of θ and label the opposite side with
    x and the adjacent side with 1. Then the ratio of the side opposite θ to the side
    adjacent to θ is x/1 = x.
    
    From Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse is √(x² + 1).
    
    Figure 2
    
    From Figure 2, we have
    sin θ = x / √(x² + 1)
    cos θ = 1 / √(x² + 1)
    
    Therefore,
    sin (2 tan⁻¹ x) = sin 2θ Substitute θ for tan⁻¹ x
    = 2 sin θ cos θ Double-angle identity
    = 2 * (x / √(x² + 1)) * (1 / √(x² + 1)) From Figure 2
    = 2x / (x² + 1) Multiplication
    
    Product to Sum Formulas
    If we add the formula for sin (A + B) to the formula for sin (A - B), we will eventually arrive at a formula for the product sin A cos B.
    sin A cos B + cos A sin B = sin (A + B)
    sin A cos B - cos A sin B = sin (A - B)
    2 sin A cos B = sin(A + B) + sin (A - B)
    
    Dividing both sides of this result by 2 gives us
    
    sin A cos B = [sin(A + B) + sin (A - B)] / 2 (1)

    NOTE These four product formulas are of use in calculus.
    
    The reason they are useful is that they indicate how we can convert a product into a sum. In calculus, it is sometimes much easier to work with sums of trigonometric functions than it is to work with products.
    
    cos A sin B = sin (A + B) — sin (A — B)] (2)
    
    cos A cos B = [cos (A + B) + cos (A — B)] (3)
    
    sin A sin B = [cos (A — B)—cos(A + B)] (4)
    
    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Verify product formula (3) for A = 30° and B = 120°.
    
    Verify the product formula for cos A cos B if A = 240° and B = 30°.
    
    SOLUTION Substituting A = 30° and B = 120° into
    
    cos A cos B = [cos (A + B) + cos (A — B)]
    
    we have
    
    cos 30° cos 120° = [cos 150° + cos (—90°)]
    
    = [√3/2 + 1/2]
    
    = (√3 + 1)/2
    
    A true statement.
    
    PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4. Write 10 cos 5x sin 3x as a sum or difference.
    
    Write 6 cos 7x cos 3x as a sum or difference.
    
    SOLUTION Product formula (2) is appropriate for an expression of the form
    
    cos A sin B. If we substitute A = 5x and B = 3x, then
    
    10 cos 5x sin 3x = 10 [sin (5x + 3x) — sin (5x — 3x)]
    
    = 10 [sin 8x — sin 2x]
    
    = 5(sin 8x — sin 2x)
    
    Sum to Product Formulas
    
    By some simple manipulations we can change our product formulas into sum formulas. If we take the formula for sin A cos B, exchange sides, and then multiply through by 2 we have
  - |-
    sin (4 + B) + sin (A — B) = 2 sin A cos B
    
    If we let a = A + B and B = A — B, then we can solve for A by adding the left
    sides and the right sides.
    
    A + B = a  
    A — B = B  
    2A = a + B  
    A = (a + B) / 2

    By subtracting the expression for B from the expression for a, we have  
    A = (a — B) / 2
    
    Writing the equation sin (A + B) + sin (A — B) = 2 sin A cos B in terms of a and  
    B gives us our first sum formula:

    Verify sum formula (7) for a = 30° and B = 90°.  
    Verify formula (5) for a = 240° and B = 60°.  
    
    **SOLUTION**  
    We substitute a = 30° and B = 90° into sum formula (7) and simplify each side of the resulting equation.  
    
    cos 30° + cos 90° = 2 cos (30° + 90°)/2 cos (30° - 90°)/2  
    cos 30° + cos 90° = 2 cos 60° cos (−30°)  
    
    cos 30° = √3/2, cos 90° = 0  
    Thus:  
    √3/2 + 0 = 2 * (1/2) * cos (−30°)  
    √3/2 = 1 * (√3/2)  
    
    This is a true statement.  
    
    **PROBLEM 6 EXAMPLE 6**  
    Verify the identity:  
    −tan x = (sin 5x − sin 7x) / (cos 5x − cos 7x)  
    
    Prove: cot x = (sin 5x + sin 7x) / (cos 5x − cos 7x)  
    
    **PROOF**  
    Applying the formulas for cos a − cos B and sin a + sin B to the right side and then simplifying, we arrive at −tan x.  
    
    cos 3x − cos x = −2 sin ( (3x + x)/2 ) sin ( (3x − x)/2 )  
    sin 3x + sin x = 2 sin ( (3x + x)/2 ) cos ( (3x − x)/2 )  
    
    So:  
    (cos 3x − cos x) / (sin 3x + sin x) = [−2 sin 2x sin x] / [2 sin 2x cos x]  
    
    Simplify:  
    = −sin x / cos x = −tan x  
    
    Ratio identity.

    PROVING IDENTITIES [5.1]
    
    An identity in trigonometry is a statement that two expressions are equal for all  
    replacements of the variable for which each expression is defined. To prove a trig-  
    onometric identity, we use trigonometric substitutions and algebraic manipula-  
    tions to either  
    
    1. transform the right side into the left side, or  
    2. transform the left side into the right side.
    
    Remember to work on each side separately. We do not want to use properties from  
    algebra that involve both sides of the identity—like the addition property of  
    equality.

    The GPS (global positioning system) allows a person to locate their position any-  
    where in the world. To determine position, a GPS receiver downloads a signal  
    that contains navigation data from a NAVSTAR satellite (Figure 1) and performs  
    a series of calculations using this data. Several of the calculations require writing  
    the sum of a sine and cosine function as a single sine function. In this project you  
    will learn how this is done.

    340 CHAPTER 5 Bl Identities and Formulas
    
    In Example 4 of Section 4.6, we showed how we could graph the function
    y = sin x + cos x by adding y-coordinates. We observed that the resulting graph
    appeared to have the shape of a sine function.
    
    ®) Ei) Graph y = sin x + cos x with your graphing calculator. Use your calculator to
    find the coordinates of a high point on the graph and a low point (you can use
    your key, or your calculator may have special commands for finding
    maximum and minimum points). Find an equation of the graph in the form
    y =A sin (Bx + C) by using these coordinates to estimate values of A, B,
    and C. Check your equation by graphing it. The two graphs should be nearly
    identical.
    
    To find an equation for this graph using an algebraic method, we need to find a way
    to write y = asin Bx + bcos Bx as y = A sin (Bx + C). That is, we would like to
    find values of A, B, and C so that the equation
    
    asin Bx + bcos Bx = A sin (Bx + C)
    
    is an identity. Because the value of B will be the same for both functions, we only
    need to find values for A and C.
    
    PM First, we will assume a sin Bx + b cos Bx = A sin (Bx + C). Express the right
    side of this equation as a sum using a sum identity. In order for the resulting
    equation to be an identity, explain why it must be true that 4 cos C = a and
    Asin C = b.
    
    E] Solve for A in terms of a and b using the Pythagorean identity
    sin? C + cos?’ C= 1
    Assume A is positive. To find the value of C, we simply need to find an angle

    Figure 2 shows a visual way to remember the relationships between a, b, A,

    The solution set for an equation is the set of all numbers that, when used in place of
    the variable, make the equation a true statement. In the previous chapter we worked
    with identities, which are equations that are true for every replacement of the vari-
    able for which it is defined. Most equations, however, are not identities. They are only
    true for certain values of the variable. For example, the solution set for the equation
    4x° — 9 = Ois {—3/2, 3/2} because these are the only two numbers that, when used in
    place of x, turn the equation into a true statement. We call these types of equations
    conditional equations.
    
    In algebra, the first kind of equations you learned to solve were linear (or first-
    degree) equations in one variable. Solving these equations was accomplished by
    applying two important properties: the addition property of equality and the mul-
    tiplication property of equality. These two properties were stated as follows:
    
    Addition Property of Equality
    
    For any three algebraic expressions A, B, and C
    If A=B
    then A+C=B+C
    
    In words: Adding the same quantity to both sides of an equation will not
    change the solution set.
    
    Multiplication Property of Equality
    
    For any three algebraic expressions A, B, and C, with C ≠ 0,
    If A=B
    then AC = BC
    
    In words: Multiplying both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity
    will not change the solution set.
    
    Here is an example that shows how we use these two properties to solve a
    linear equation in one variable.

    EXAMPLE 1 Solve 5x + 7 = 2x — 5 for x.
    
    SOLUTION

    3
    
    Notice in the last step we could just as easily have divided both sides by 3 instead  
    of multiplying both sides by 5. Division by a number and multiplication by its  
    reciprocal are equivalent operations. a
    
    The process of solving trigonometric equations is very similar to the process  
    of solving algebraic equations. With trigonometric equations, we look for values  
    of an angle that will make the equation into a true statement. We usually begin by  
    solving for a specific trigonometric function of that angle and then use the concepts  
    we have developed earlier to find the angle. Here are some examples that illustrate  
    this procedure.
    
    EXAMPLE 2 Solve 2 sin x — 1 = 0 for x.
    
    SOLUTION We can solve for sin x using our methods from algebra. We then  
    use our knowledge of trigonometry to find x itself.

    From Figure | we can see that if we are looking for radian solutions between 0

    tions between 0° and 360°, then our solutions will be 30° and 150°. Without the
    aid of Figure 1, we would reason that, because sin x = 5, the reference angle for
    x is 30°. Then, because ; is a positive number and the sine function is positive in
    QI and QII, x must be 30° or 150° (Figure 2).

    Because the sine function is periodic with period 27 (or 360°), any angle
    coterminal with x = 77/6 (or 30°) or x = 57/6 (or 150°) will also be a solution of
    the equation. For any integer k, adding 2477 (or 360°) will result in a coterminal
    angle. Therefore, we can represent all solutions to the equation as follows.

    We can solve the equation in Example 2 using a graphing calculator. If we
    define the left side of the equation as function Y1, then the solutions of the
    equation will be the x-intercepts of this function. We sometimes refer to these

    346 CHAPTER 6 Trigonometric Equations  
    
    Because sin θ is between —1 and 1 for all values of θ, sin θ can never be 3/2. There-  
    fore, there is no solution to our equation.  
    
    To justify our conclusion further, we can graph y = 2 sin x — 3. The graph  
    is a sine curve with amplitude 2 that has been shifted down 3 units vertically. The graph is shown in Figure 4. The graph does not cross the x-axis, so there is  
    no solution to the equation 2 sin x — 3 = 0.

    sin (A — 60°) = ——. SOLUTION The reference angle is given by cos ! (2/2) = 45°. Because the
    cosine function is negative in QII or QIII, the expression A — 25° must be
    coterminal with 135° or 225°. Therefore,
    A — 25° = 135° + 360° or A — 25° = 225° + 360°
    for any integer k. We can now solve for A by adding 25° to both sides.
    A — 25° = 135° + 360° or A — 25° = 225° + 360°
    A = 160° + 360° A = 250° + 360° a
    
    Using Technology: Solving Equations: Finding Intersection Points
    
    We can solve the equation in Example 4 with a graphing calculator by defin-
    ing the expression on each side of the equation as a function. The solutions
    to the equation will be the x-values of the points where the two graphs
    intersect.
    
    Set your calculator to degree mode and then define Y1 = cos(x — 25) and
    Y2 = -V2/2. Set your window variables so that
    
    0= x = 360, scale = 90; -2 Sy = 2, scale = 1
    
    Graph both functions and use the appropriate command on your calculator to
    find the coordinates of the two intersection points. From Figure 5 we see that the
    x-coordinates of these points are x = 160° and x = 250°.

    **EXAMPLE 5** Solve $7 - 8\sin(x + 3) = 10$ for $x$ if $0 \leq x < 2\pi$. Use a calculator to approximate all answers to the nearest hundredth.  
    
    **SOLUTION** First we isolate the sine function.
    
    $$
    7 - 8\sin(x + 3) = 10  
    -8\sin(x + 3) = 3 \quad \text{Subtract 7 from both sides}  
    \sin(x + 3) = -\frac{3}{8} \quad \text{Divide both sides by } -8  
    $$
    
    Now we will use a calculator to approximate the reference angle, rounding the result to two decimal places. Remember that we must use a positive value in the inverse sine function to find the reference angle. Also, make sure your calculator is set to radian mode.
    
    $$
    \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) = 0.38
    $$
    
    Because the sine function is negative in QIII and QIV, the expression $x + 3$ must be coterminal with $0.38$ (Figure 6).
    
    **QIII ** QIV  
    $x + 3 = \pi + 0.38 \approx 3.52$ or $x + 3 = 2\pi - 0.38 \approx 5.90$
  - |-
    Therefore,
    x + 3 = 3.52 + 2ka or x + 3 = 5.90 + 2k
    for any integer k. Isolating the variable x by subtracting 3 gives us
    x = 0.52 + 2ka or x = 2.90 + 2ka
    
    The two solutions that lie within the interval 0 = x < 27 are x = 0.52 and
    x = 2.90.
    
    EXAMPLE 6 Solve 3 sin@ — 2=7sin@ — 1 if 0° = @ < 360°.
    
    SOLUTION We can solve for sin 6 by collecting all the variable terms on the left
    side and all the constant terms on the right side of the equation.
    
    3sin@—2=7sin@—1
    
    -4sin@ - 2 = -1 Add -7 sin @ to each side
    -4sin@ = 1 Add 2 to each side

    SOLUTION We begin by writing the equation in standard form (0 on the right
    side—decreasing powers of the variable on the left side). We then factor the left
    side and set each factor equal to 0.

    because sin 6 must be between —1 and 1. For sin 6 = 0.3661, we use a calculator
    to find the angle whose sine is nearest to 0.3661. That angle is approximately
    0.37 radian, and it is the reference angle for 6. Since sin @ is positive, 9 must

    Learning Objectives  
    
    Use an identity to solve a trigonometric equation.  
    Solve a trigonometric equation by clearing denominators.  
    Solve a trigonometric equation by squaring both sides.  
    
    Use a graphing calculator to approximate the solutions to a  
    trigonometric equation.  
    
    In this section, we will use our knowledge of identities to replace some parts of the  
    equations we are solving with equivalent expressions that will make the equations  
    easier to solve. Here are some examples.  
    
    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Solve 2cosx — 1 = secx if 0 ≤ x < 2π.  
    
    Solve 2 cos x — 3 sec x = —1  
    if 0 ≤ x < 2π.  
    
    SOLUTION To solve this equation as we have solved the equations in the previ-  
    ous section, we must write each term using the same trigonometric function. To  
    do so, we can use a reciprocal identity to write sec x in terms of cos x.  
    
    1  
    COS X  
    
    2cosx — 3 sec x = —1  
    
    To clear the equation of fractions, we multiply both sides by cos x. (Note that  
    we must assume cos x ≠ 0 in order to multiply both sides by it. If we obtain  
    solutions for which cos x = 0, we will have to discard them.)  
    
    cos x (2cos x — 3) = -cos x  
    
    2 cos²x — 3 cos x = -cos x  
    
    We are left with a quadratic equation that we write in standard form and then  
    solve.  
    2 cos²x — 3 cos x + cos x = 0  
    2 cos²x — 2 cos x = 0  
    
    Factor: 2 cos x (cos x — 1) = 0  
    
    Set each factor to 0:  
    2 cos x = 0 or cos x — 1 = 0  
    
    Solve for x:  
    cos x = 0 or cos x = 1  
    
    For 0 ≤ x < 2π:  
    cos x = 0 when x = π/2 or 3π/2  
    cos x = 1 when x = 0 or 2π  
    
    However, since the original equation is defined for 0 ≤ x < 2π, we exclude 2π.  
    
    Therefore, the solutions are:  
    x = 0, π/2, 3π/2  
    
    Check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they are valid.  
    For x = 0: 2 cos(0) — 3 sec(0) = 2(1) — 3(1) = -1 ✅  
    For x = π/2: 2 cos(π/2) — 3 sec(π/2) = 0 — undefined ❌ (discard this solution)  
    For x = 3π/2: 2 cos(3π/2) — 3 sec(3π/2) = 0 — undefined ❌ (discard this solution)  
    
    Thus, the only valid solution is x = 0.

    EXAMPLE 2. Solve sin 20 + V2 cos 6 = Oif 0° S$ 4 < 360°.
    
    SOLUTION To solve this equation, both trigonometric functions must be func-
    tions of the same angle. As the equation stands now, one angle is 20, while the
    other is 8. We can write everything as a function of 6 by using the double-angle
    identity sin 20 = 2 sin 6 cos 0.
    
    sin 20 + V2cos 6 = 0

    **EXAMPLE 3 Solve cos 2θ + 3 sin θ - 2 = 0 if 0° ≤ θ < 360°.**  
    **SOLUTION** We have the same problem with this equation that we did with the  
    equation in Example 2. We must rewrite cos 2θ in terms of functions of just θ.  
    Recall that there are three forms of the double-angle identity for cos 2θ. We  
    choose the double-angle identity that involves sin θ only, because the middle  
    term of our equation involves sin θ, and it is best to have all terms involve the  
    same trigonometric function.
    
    **cos 2θ + 3 sin θ - 2 = 0**  
    **1 - 2 sin²θ + 3 sin θ - 2 = 0 cos 2θ = 1 - 2 sin²θ**  
    **-2 sin²θ + 3 sin θ - 1 = 0 Simplify**  
    **2 sin²θ - 3 sin θ + 1 = 0 Multiply each side by -1**  
    **(2 sin θ - 1)(sin θ - 1) = 0 Factor**  
    **2 sin θ - 1 = 0 or sin θ - 1 = 0 Set factors to 0**  
    **sin θ = 1/2 or sin θ = 1**  
    **θ = 30°, 150° or θ = 90°**

    **EXAMPLE 4 Solve 4 cos²x + 4 sin x - 5 = 0 if 0 ≤ x < 2π.**  
    **SOLUTION** We cannot factor and solve this quadratic equation until each term  
    involves the same trigonometric function. If we change the cos²x in the first term  
    to 1 - sin²x, we will obtain an equation that involves the sine function only.
    
    **4 cos²x + 4 sin x - 5 = 0**

    Solve cos θ − √3 sin θ = 0 if 0° ≤ θ < 360°.  
    SOLUTION If we separate sin θ and cos θ on opposite sides of the equal sign,  
    and then square both sides of the equation, we will be able to use an identity to  
    write the equation in terms of one trigonometric function only.

    Set factors to 0  
    cos @ = 0 cos @ = -1  
    @ = 3π/2 or @ = π  
    
    We have three possible solutions, some of which may be extraneous because we  
    squared both sides of the equation in Step 2. Any time we raise both sides of  
    an equation to an even power, we have the possibility of introducing extraneous  
    solutions. We must check each possible solution in our original equation.
    
    Checking @ = 3π/2 Checking @ = π Checking @ = 37π/2  
    sin(3π/2) - cos(3π/2) = 1 sin(π) - cos(π) = 1 sin(37π/2) - cos(37π/2) = 1  
    -1 - 0 = 1 -1 - (-1) = 1 sin(37π/2) - cos(37π/2) = 1  
    -1 = 1 -1 + 1 = 1 sin(37π/2) - cos(37π/2) = 1  
    -1 ≠ 1 -1 = 1 sin(37π/2) - cos(37π/2) = 1  
    -1 ≠ 1  
    
    @ = 3π/2 is not a solution @ = π is a solution @ = 37π/2 is not a solution  
    
    All possible solutions, except @ = 37π/2, produce true statements when used in  
    place of the variable in the original equation. @ = 37π/2 is an extraneous solution  
    produced by squaring both sides of the equation. Our solution set is {3π/2, π}.

    SOLUTION Wecan use a half-angle formula, which will result in a radical equa-
    tion containing only the cosine function. We can then square both sides of the
    equation to eliminate the square root.
  - |-
    The first step in solving the equation $2 \cos x - 1 = \sec x$ is to rewrite $\sec x$ in terms of cosine, since $\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}$. This gives the equation $2 \cos x - 1 = \frac{1}{\cos x}$. Next, multiply both sides of the equation by $\cos x$ to eliminate the denominator and simplify the equation. This results in $ (2 \cos x - 1) \cos x = 1 $. Expanding this equation gives $2 \cos^2 x - \cos x = 1$. Then, rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation in terms of $\cos x$: $2 \cos^2 x - \cos x - 1 = 0$. Finally, solve this quadratic equation for $\cos x$ using factoring or the quadratic formula.

    1. To solve an equation containing secant, cosecant, or cotangent functions, first rewrite
    each function using a identity and then fractions by
    both sides of the equation by the least common denominator.
    
    2. For equations containing trigonometric functions with different arguments, use an
    appropriate to write all of the functions in terms of the same
    
    3. When solving an equation containing a single sine and cosine, sometimes it is neces-
    
    sary to both sides of the equation so that the Pythagorean identity can be
    used. Just be sure to check for solutions.

    Learning Objectives
    
    Solve a simple trigonometric equation involving a multiple angle.
    
    Use an identity to solve a trigonometric equation involving a multiple
    angle.
    
    Solve a trigonometric equation involving a multiple angle by factoring
    or the quadratic formula.
    
    Solve a real-life problem using a trigonometric equation.
    
    In this section, we will consider equations that contain multiple angles. We will use
    most of the same techniques to solve these equations that we have used in the past.
    We have to be careful at the last step, however, when our equations contain mul-
    tiple angles. Here is an example.
    
    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Solve cos 26 = V3 ie 0° = 6 < 360°.

    if 0° = @ < 360°.
    SOLUTION The equation cannot be simplified further. The reference angle is
    given by cos ! (V3/2) = 30°. Because the cosine function is positive in QI or
    QIV, the expression 20 must be coterminal with 30° or 330°. Therefore, for any
    integer k, all solutions will have the form
    
    20 = 30° + 360% or 20 = 330° + 360°
    30° 360°k 330° 360°k
    9=—+ 9 =——+
    2 2 2 2
    6 = 15° + 180°% 0 = 165° + 180°k
    
    Because we were asked only for values of 6 between 0° and 360°, we substitute
    the appropriate integers in place of k.
    
    If k=0 If k=1
    then 6 = 15° + 180°(0) = 15° then 6 = 15° + 180°(1) = 195°
    or 6 = 165° + 180°(0) = 165° or 6 = 165° + 180°(1) = 345°
    
    For all other values of k, 6 will fall outside the given interval. a

    Using Technology: Solving a Trigonometric Equation
    
    To solve the equation in Example 1 graphically, we can use the intersection
    1.5 of graphs method that was introduced in Section 6.1. Set your graphing calculator
    to degree mode, then define each side of the equation as an individual function.
    
    Y1 = cos (2x), Y2 = V3/2

    0 = x = 360, scale = 90; -1.5 = y = 1.5, scale = 1
    
    1.5
    Because the period of y = cos 2x is 360°/2 = 180°, we see that two cycles of the
    cosine function occur between 0° and 360° (Figure 1). Within the first cycle there
    are two intersection points. Using the appropriate command, we find that the
    x-coordinates of these points are x = 15° and x = 165° (Figure 2).

    Because the period is 180°, the next pair of intersection points (located on the
    second cycle) is found by adding 180° to each of the above values (Figure 3).
    Use the intersection command on your calculator to verify that the next solu-
    tions occur at x = 195° and x = 345°.

    Find all radian solutions for exact values.

    SOLUTION First we find all values of 3x in the interval 0 = 3x < 7 that satisfy
    tan 3x = 1, and then we add on multiples of 7 because the period of the tan-
    gent function is 7. After that, we simply divide by 3 to solve for x.

    tan² 3x = 1  
    tan 3x = +1 Square root of both sides  
    The period of the tangent function is π, so we have

    Solve sin θ — cos θ = √2

    sin θ — cos θ = 1  
    (sin θ — cos θ)² = 1² Square both sides  
    sin² θ — 2 sin θ cos θ + cos² θ = 1 Expand left side  
    —2 sin θ cos θ + 1 = 1 sin² θ + cos² θ = 1  
    —2 sin θ cos θ = 0 Add —1 to both sides  
    —sin 2θ = 0 Double-angle identity  
    sin 2θ = 0 Multiply both sides by —1
  - |-
    The sine function is zero for 0° or 180°. Therefore, the expression 20 must be
    coterminal with either of these. For any integer &, we can represent all solutions
    more concisely as
    20 = 0° + 180°n
    20 = 180°n
    6 = 90°n
    We were asked only for values of 6 in the interval 0° ≤ 6 < 360°. Choosing k = 0,
    1, 2, or 3 we have 6 = 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°. For all other values of k, 6 will fall
    outside the given interval.

    Because our first step involved squaring both sides of the equation, we must

    where x is the month, with x = 1 corresponding to January. Use this model to
    determine the percentage of the year that the average attendance is at least 25,000.
  - |-
    SOLUTION  
    To begin, we will find the values of x for which y is exactly 25,000.  
    To do so, we must solve the equation  
    
    19480 + 18,550 cos (2 - x) = 25,000  
    
    First we isolate the trigonometric function.  
    
    19,480 + 18,550 cos (2x) = 25,000  
    
    18,550 cos (2x) = 25,000 - 19,480  
    18,550 cos (2x) = 5,520  
    
    cos (2x) = 5,520 / 18,550  
    cos (2x) ≈ 0.2992  
    
    The reference angle is cos⁻¹ (0.2992) ≈ 1.27 radians. The cosine is positive in QI and QIV, so we have  
    
    2x = 1.27 or 2x = 2π - 1.27  
    2x ≈ 1.27 or 2x ≈ 5.013  
    
    x ≈ 0.635 or x ≈ 2.507

    40,000 The solution x ≈ 2.507 is within the given interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 12. However,  
    4 because the period is 12, adding or subtracting any multiple of 12 to 2.507 will  
    give another solution. Thus, x ≈ 2.507 is a valid solution within the given interval.  
    Oo Looking at Figure 7, we see that y will be at least 25,000 between x ≈ 2.507

    down the wall. How long after one of them sees the light does the other one see it?

    Use parametric equations as a model in a real-life problem.
    
    Up to this point we have had a number of encounters with the Ferris wheel problem. In Sections 3.5 and 4.5, we were able to find a function that gives the rider’s height above the ground at any time t during the ride. A third way to derive this function is with parametric equations, which we will study in this section.
    
    Let’s begin with a model of the giant wheel built by George Ferris. The diameter of this wheel is 250 feet, and the bottom of the wheel sits 14 feet above the ground. We can superimpose a coordinate system on our model, so that the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the wheel. This is shown in
    
    Figure 1.

    The two equations on the right are called parametric equations. They show x and  
    y as functions of a third variable, ¢, called the parameter. Each number we substi-  
    tute for ¢ gives us an ordered pair (x, y). If we graph each of these ordered pairs  
    on a rectangular coordinate system, the resulting curve is called a plane curve. We  
    demonstrate this in the following example.

    the two equations to find corresponding values of x and y. Table 1 shows a  
    number of ordered pairs, which we obtained by letting ¢ be different multiples  
    of 7/4.

    The graph of the plane curve is shown in Figure 3. We have labeled each point with its associated value of the parameter θ. As expected, the curve is a circle. More importantly, notice in which direction the circle is traversed as θ increases from 0 to 2π. We say that the plane curve is oriented in a counterclockwise direction and indicate the orientation using small arrows.

    In general, the orientation of a plane curve is the direction the curve is traversed as the parameter increases. The ability of parametric equations to associate points on a curve with values of a parameter makes them especially suited for describing the path of an object in motion.

    Soe in) We can use a graphing calculator to graph the plane curve for a set of parametric equations. For instance, to graph the plane curve in Example 1, set your calculator to radian mode and parametric mode. Define the parametric equations as shown in Figure 4, and set your window as follows:
    Figure 4 Ox θ=2π, step = 7/24
    —150 = x = 150, scale = 25
    —150 = y = 150, scale = 25
    To make the circle look right, graph the equations using the zoom-square command. The result is shown in Figure 5.
    To see the orientation, we can trace the circle and follow the cursor as the parameter θ increases (Figure 6). We can also evaluate the equations for any given value of the parameter. Figure 7 shows how this might look for θ = 3π/4.
    Figure 5 Notice that the coordinates match our results in Table 1.

    We recognize this last equation as the equation of a circle with a radius of 125 and
    center at the origin. What we have done is eliminate the parameter ¢ to obtain an
    equation in just x and y whose graph we recognize. This process is called e/iminat-
    ing the parameter. Note that it gives us further justification that the graph of our
    set of parametric equations is a circle.

    however, we must solve the first equation for cos ¢ and the second equation for
    sin ¢.

    Making Our Models More Realistic
    
    Let’s go back to our Ferris wheel model from the beginning of this section.
    Our wheel has a radius of 125 feet and sits 14 feet above the ground. One trip
    around the wheel takes 20 minutes. Figure 11 shows this model with a coor-
    dinate system superimposed with its origin at the center of the wheel. Also
    shown are the parametric equations that describe the path of someone riding
    the wheel.
    
    Our model would be more realistic if the x-axis was along the ground, below
    the wheel. We can accomplish this very easily by moving everything up 139 feet
    (125 feet for the radius and another 14 feet for the wheel’s height above the ground).
    Figure 12 shows our new graph next to a new set of parametric equations.

    378  CHAPTER6 Bf Equations
    
    Continuing to improve our model, we would like the rider on the wheel to  
    start their ride at the bottom of the wheel. Assuming f is in radians, we accomplish  
    this by subtracting 7/2 from θ giving us  
    
    x = 200 + 125 cos (θ - π/2)  
    y = 139 + 125 sin (θ - π/2)  
    
    Finally, one trip around the wheel takes 20 minutes, so we can write our equations  
    in terms of time T by using the proportion  
    
    Solving for θ we have  
    
    θ = (π/10)T  
    
    Substituting this expression for θ into our parametric equations we have  
    
    x = 200 + 125 cos (π/10 T - π/2)  
    y = 139 + 125 sin (π/10 T - π/2)  
    
    These last equations give us a very accurate model of the path taken by some-  
    one riding on this Ferris wheel. To graph these equations on our graphing calcula-  
    tor, we can use the following window:  
    
    Radian mode: θ = 0 to 2π, step = 1  
    -50 = x = 330, scale = 20  
    -50 = y = 330, scale = 20  
    Using the zoom-square command, we have the graph shown in Figure 14.  
    
    Figure 15 shows a trace of the graph. Tracing around this graph gives us the posi-  
    tion of the rider at each minute of the 20-minute ride.

    Parametric Equations and the Human Cannonball
  - |-
    In Section 2.5, we found that the human cannonball, when shot from a cannon at 53 miles per hour at 60° from the horizontal, will have a horizontal velocity of 27 miles per hour and an initial vertical velocity of 46 miles per hour (Figure 16).

    SECTION 6.4 Parametric Equations and Further Graphing 379
    
    We can generalize this so that a human cannonball, if shot from a cannon at |Vo| miles per hour at an angle of elevation 6, will have a horizontal speed of |V| cos 6 miles per hour and an initial vertical speed of |V| sin 6 miles per hour (Figure 17).

    Figure 16 Figure 17
    
    Neglecting the resistance of air, the only force acting on the human cannon-
    ball is the force of gravity, which is an acceleration of 32 feet per second squared
    toward the earth. Because the cannonball’s horizontal speed is constant, we can
    find the distance traveled after t seconds by simply multiplying speed and time.
    Therefore, the distance traveled horizontally after t seconds is
    
    x = (|V| cos 0)t
    
    To find the cannonball’s vertical distance from the cannon after t seconds, we use
    a formula from physics:
    
    1 _ 2 ;
    — (lV| sin @)t — —e?? where g = 32 ft/sec” (the acceleration
    y = (Vol ) 78
    
    of gravity on earth)
    
    This gives us the following set of parametric equations:
  - |-
    x = (|V|) cos 6)t  
    y = (|Vo| sin 6)¢ — 1677  
    
    The equations describe the path of a human cannonball shot from a cannon at  
    a speed of |V,|, at an angle of 6 degrees from horizontal. So that the units will agree,  
    |Vo| must be in feet per second because f¢ is in seconds.

    For example, consider the equation:
    
    sin 3x = 1/2
    
    We can use the identity for sin 3x:
    
    sin 3x = 3 sin x - 4 sin^3 x
    
    Substituting this into the equation gives:
    
    3 sin x - 4 sin^3 x = 1/2
    
    This is a cubic equation in sin x. We can solve this equation by letting y = sin x, so the equation becomes:
    
    3y - 4y^3 = 1/2
    
    Rearranging terms, we get:
    
    -4y^3 + 3y - 1/2 = 0
    
    Multiplying through by -2 to eliminate the fraction:
    
    8y^3 - 6y + 1 = 0
    
    Now we have a cubic equation in y. We can solve this equation using methods such as factoring, the rational root theorem, or numerical methods. Once we find the solutions for y (which are values of sin x), we can then solve for x by taking the inverse sine of each solution.
    
    In summary, when solving equations involving multiple angles, it is often helpful to use the appropriate trigonometric identities to rewrite the equation in terms of a single angle. This simplifies the problem and allows us to solve it more easily.

    Deriving the Cycloid  
    
    OBJECTIVE: To derive parametric equations for the cycloid.  
    
    The cycloid is a famous planar curve with a rich history. First studied and named  
    by Galileo, the cycloid is defined as the curve traced by a point on the circumference  
    of a circle that is rolling along a line without slipping (Figure 1).

    Herman Melville  
    
    eH Herman Melville referred to the cycloid in this passage from Moby-Dick:

    It was in the left-hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently  
    circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact,  
    that in geometry all bodies gliding along a cycloid, my soapstone, for ex-  
    ample, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.
    
    To begin, we will assume the circle has radius r and is positioned on a rectangular  
    coordinate system with its center on the positive y-axis and tangent to the x-axis  
    (Figure 2). The x-axis will serve as the line that the circle will roll along. We will  
    choose point P, initially at the origin, to be the fixed point on the circumference of  
    the circle that will trace the cycloid. Figure 3 shows the position of the circle after  
    it has rolled a short distance d along the x-axis. We will use θ to represent the angle  
    (in radians) through which the circle has rotated.

    equations for x and y in terms of these values.

    The aerial tram in Rio de Janeiro, which carries sightseers up to the top of Sug-
    arloaf Mountain, provides a good example of forces acting in equilibrium. The
    force representing the weight of the gondola and its passengers must be with-
    stood by the tension in the cable, which can be represented by a pair of forces
    pointing in the same direction as the cable on either side (Figure 1). Because
    these three forces are in static equilibrium, they must form a triangle as shown
    in Figure 2.

    SECTION 7.1 & The Law of Sines 391

    Use the law of sines to find a missing side in an oblique triangle.
    Solve a real-life problem using the law of sines.
    
    Use vectors and the law of sines to solve an applied problem.
    
    C In this chapter we return to the matter of solving triangles. Up to this point, the tri-
    angles we have worked with have always been right triangles. We will now look at situ-
    ations that involve oblique triangles, which are triangles that do not have a right angle.
    
    It is important to remember that our triangle definitions of the six trigonomet-
    ric functions (Definition I) involve ratios of the sides of a right triangle only. These
    definitions do not apply to oblique triangles. For example, the triangle shown in
    A c B. Figure 1 is oblique, so we cannot say that sin A = a/c. In this chapter we will see how
    the sine and cosine functions can be used properly to solve these kinds of triangles.
  - |-
    Every triangle has three sides and three angles. To solve any triangle, we must  
    know at least three of these six values. Table 1 summarizes the possible cases and  
    shows which method can be used to solve the triangle in each case.

    392 = CHAPTER7 Bf Triangles
    
    We will begin with oblique triangles that can be solved using the law of sines.  
    The law of cosines will be introduced in Section 7.2.
    
    The Law of Sines
    
    There are many relationships that exist between the sides and angles in a triangle.  
    One such relationship is called the law of sines, which states that the ratio of the sine  
    of an angle to the length of the side opposite that angle is constant in any triangle.
    
    Given triangle ABC shown in Figure 2,  
    
    sin A / sin B = sin C / a  
    or, equivalently,
    
    a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C  
    
    Figure 2
    
    PROOF
  - |-
    The altitude of the triangle in Figure 3 can be written in terms of sin A or sin B depending on which of the two right triangles we are referring to:
    
    h h  
    sin A = — sin B = —  
    b a  
    
    A : 2 h=bsinA h=asnB  
    
    Figure 3 Because / is equal to itself, we have
    
    h=h  
    bsin A=asin B  
    
    bsn A asnB  
    
    Divide both sides by ab  
    ab ab  
    sin A sin B  
    = i Divide out common factors

    If we do the same kind of thing with the altitude that extends from A, we will have  
    ; , ; sin C  
    the third ratio in the law of sines, a equal to the two preceding ratios.  
    
    Note that the derivation of the law of sines will proceed in the same manner  
    if triangle ABC contains an obtuse angle, as in Figure 4.

    So, sin B = h/a, which is the result we obtained previously. Using triangle  
    ADC, we have sin A = h/b. As you can see, these are the same two expressions we  
    began with when deriving the law of sines for the acute triangle in Figure 3. From  
    this point on, the derivation would match our previous derivation.  
    
    We can use the law of sines to find missing parts of triangles for which we are  
    given two angles and a side.
  - |-
    Two Angles and One Side
    
    In our first example, we are given two angles and the side opposite one of them.
    (You may recall that in geometry these were the parts we needed equal in two tri-
    angles in order to prove them congruent using the AAS Theorem.)
    
    EXAMPLE 1 In triangle ABC, A = 30°, B = 70°, and a = 8.0 cm. Find the
    length of side c.
    
    SOLUTION We begin by drawing a picture of triangle ABC (it does not have to
    be accurate) and labeling it with the information we have been given (Figure 5).
    
    A c B
    Figure 5
    
    When we use the law of sines, we must have one of the ratios given to us. In this
    case, since we are given a and A, we have the ratio a/sin A. To solve for c, we need
    to first find angle C. The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180°, so we have
    C= 180° — (A + B)
    = 180° — (30° + 70°)
    = 80°
    To find side c, we use the following two ratios given in the law of sines.
    
    c/c = a/sin A

    To solve for c, we multiply both sides by sin C and then substitute.
    c = (a * sin C) / sin A
    = (8.0 * sin 80°) / sin 30°
    = (8.0 * 0.9848) / 0.5000
    = 16 cm To two significant digits
  - |-
    NOTE 1 The equal sign in the third line should actually be replaced by the approximately equal to symbol, ~, because the decimal 0.9848 is an approximation to sin 80°.
    (Remember, most values of the trigonometric functions are irrational numbers.) In
    this chapter, we will use an equal sign in the solutions to all of our examples, even when
    the ~ symbol would be more appropriate, to make the examples a little easier to follow.
    
    NOTE2 As in Chapter 2, we round our answers so that the number of significant digits in our answers matches the number of significant digits in the least
    significant number given in the original problem. Also, we round our answers
    only, not any of the numbers in the intermediate steps. We are showing the values
    of the trigonometric functions to four significant digits simply to avoid cluttering
    the page with long decimal numbers. This does not mean that you should stop
    halfway through a problem and round the values of trigonometric functions to
    four significant digits before continuing.
    
    In our next example, we are given two angles and the side included between
    them (ASA) and are asked to find all the missing parts.
    
    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2 Find the missing parts of triangle ABC if B = 34°, C = 82°, and
    a= 5.6cm.

    finding angle A so that we have one of the ratios in the law of sines completed.

    The law of sines, along with some fancy electronic equipment, was used to
    obtain the results of some of the field events in one of the past Olympic Games.
    For instance, Figure 7 is a diagram of a shot put ring. The shot is tossed (put)
    from the left and lands at A. A small electronic device is then placed at A (there
    is usually a dent in the ground where the shot lands, so it is easy to find where
    to place the device). The device at A sends a signal to a booth in the stands that
    gives the measures of angles A and B. The distance a is found ahead of time.
    With this information, we have the case AAS. To find the distance x, the law of
    sines is used.

    EXAMPLE 5 A hot-air balloon is flying over a dry lake when the wind stops
    blowing. The balloon comes to a stop 450 feet above the ground at point D
    as shown in Figure 9. A jeep following the balloon runs out of gas at point A.
    The nearest service station is due north of the jeep at point B. The bearing of
    the balloon from the jeep at 4 is N 13° E, while the bearing of the balloon from
    the service station at Bis S 19° E. If the angle of elevation of the balloon from A
    is 12°, how far will the people in the jeep have to walk to reach the service station
    at point B?
    
    Figure 9
    
    SOLUTION First we find the distance between C and 4 using right triangle
    trigonometry. Because this is an intermediate calculation, which we will use
    again, we keep more than two significant digits for AC.

    tan 12° =  
    
    Next we find angle ACB. This will give us the case ASA.  
    
    ∠ACB = 180° — (13° + 19°) = 148°  
    
    Finally, we find AB using the law of sines.  
    
    AB — 2,117  
    sin 148° sin 19°  
    — 2,117 sin 148°

    There are 5,280 feet in a mile, so the people at 4A will walk approximately  
    
    3,400/5,280 = 0.64 mile to get to the service station at B.

    PROBLEM 6 EXAMPLE 6 A traffic light weighing 22 pounds is suspended by two wires

    SOLUTION We assume that the traffic light is not moving and is therefore in a  
    state of static equilibrium. When an object is in this state, the sum of the forces  
    acting on the object must be 0. It is because of this fact that we can redraw the  
    vectors from Figure 10 and be sure that they form a closed triangle. Figure 11  
    shows a convenient redrawing of the two tension vectors T, and T,, and the vec-  
    tor W that is due to gravity. Notice that we have the case ASA.

    1. A triangle that does not have a right angle is called an **oblique** triangle.  
    
    2. We use the law of sines to find the missing parts of triangles for which we are given  
    two **angles** and one **side**. In either case, a triangle is  
    determined.  
    
    3. The law of sines states that the ratio of the **sine** of an angle to the length of  
    the side that angle is in any triangle.  
    
    4. To solve an oblique triangle given the case ASA, the first step is to find the  
    missing **angle** so that the law of sines can be used.

    Use the law of cosines to find a missing side in an oblique triangle.
    Use the law of cosines to find a missing angle in an oblique triangle.
    Draw a vector representing a given heading.
    
    Use the law of cosines to solve a real-life problem involving heading or
    true course.
    
    In this section, we will derive another relationship that exists between the sides
    and angles in any triangle. It is called the Law of Cosines and it is stated like this:
    
    Law of Cosines (SAS)
    
    Given triangle ABC shown in Figure 1: C
    a = b² + c² - 2bc cos A  
    b = a² + c² - 2ac cos B  
    c = a² + b² - 2ab cos C  
    
    Figure 1
    
    Derivation
    
    To derive the formulas stated in the law of cosines, we apply the Pythagorean Theorem and some of our basic trigonometric identities. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to right triangle BCD in Figure 2, we have
    
    a² = (c - x)² + h²  
    = c² - 2cx + x² + h²  
    
    From right triangle ACD, we have x² + h² = b², so
    
    a² = c² - 2cx + b²  
    = h² + c² - 2cx  
    
    Now, since cos A = x/b, we have x = b cos A, or
    
    a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A

    We can use the law of cosines to solve triangles for which we are given two  
    sides and the angle included between them (SAS) or triangles for which we are  
    given all three sides (SSS).

    The solution process will include the use of both the law of cosines and the law  
    of sines. We begin by using the law of cosines to find a.

    a = 29 inches To two significant digits  
    
    Now that we have a, we can use either the law of sines or the law of cosines to  
    solve for angle B or C.
    
    When we have a choice of angles to solve for, and we are using the law of  
    sines to do so, it is best to solve for the smaller angle. This is because a triangle  
    can have at most one obtuse angle, which, if present, must be opposite the lon-  
    gest side. Since c is the longest side, only angle C might be obtuse. Therefore  
    we solve for angle B first because we know it must be acute. If using the law of  
    cosines, it does not matter which angle we solve for first.

    variable x to represent the length of the shorter side. Note also that we labeled  
    
    17.7 cm half of each diagonal with its length to give us the sides of a triangle. (Recall  
    that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.)

    Three Sides  
    
    To use the law of cosines to solve a triangle for which we are given all three sides,  
    it is convenient to rewrite the equations with the cosines isolated on one side.  
    
    a’ = b* + c*—2becos A  
    
    a’ + 2bcecos A = b* + C7? Add 2hc cos A to both sides  
    2bcecos A = b24+ 7 - a? Add —a? to both sides

    Solve triangle ABC if a = 26 km,

    b = 19km, and c = 15km.  
    SOLUTION We will use the law of cosines to solve for one of the angles and then use the law of sines to find one of the remaining angles. Since there is never any confusion as to whether an angle is acute or obtuse if we have its cosine (the cosine of an obtuse angle is negative), it is best to solve for the largest angle first. Since the longest side is a, we solve for A first.
    
    Angle A  
    $$
    A = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \right)
    $$
    $$
    A = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{20^2 + 18^2 - 34^2}{2 \cdot 20 \cdot 18} \right)
    $$
    $$
    A = \cos^{-1} (-0.6000) = 127° \text{ To the nearest degree}
    $$
    
    There are two ways to find angle C. We can use either the law of sines or the law of cosines.
    
    Angle C  
    Using the law of sines,  
    $$
    \frac{\sin C}{c} = \frac{\sin A}{a}
    $$
    $$
    \sin C = \frac{c \cdot \sin A}{a} = \frac{18 \cdot \sin 127°}{34}
    $$
    $$
    \sin C = 0.4228
    $$
    
    Using the law of cosines,  
    $$
    \cos C = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
    $$
    $$
    \cos C = \frac{34^2 + 20^2 - 18^2}{2 \cdot 34 \cdot 20}
    $$
    $$
    \cos C = 0.9059
    $$
    
    NOTE: Angle C must be acute, so we do not have to check.  
    So, $ C = \cos^{-1} (0.9059) $ or $ C = \sin^{-1} (0.4228) $
    
    $$
    C = 25° \text{ To the nearest degree}
    $$
    
    Angle B  
    $$
    B = 180° - (A + C) = 180° - (127° + 25°) = 28°
    $$
    
    Navigation  
    
    In Section 2.4, we used bearing to give the position of one point from another and to give the direction of a moving object. Another way to specify the direction of a moving object is to use heading.

    Figure 6 traveling 12 miles per hour at 240° from due north. Note that this method of giving

    PROBLEM 4  
    
    A plane is flying with an airspeed  
    of 205 miles per hour with a head-  
    ing of 105°. The wind currents are  
    running at a constant 35 miles per  
    hour at 155° clockwise from due  
    north. Find the true course and  
    the ground speed of the plane.  
    
    SECTION 7.2 If The Law of Cosines 407  
    
    the path of a moving object is a little simpler than the bearing method used in Sec-  
    tion 2.4. To give the path of the ship traveling 14 miles per hour using the bearing  
    method, we would say it is on a course with bearing S 60° E.  
    
    In Example 1 of Section 2.5, we found that although a boat is headed in one  
    direction, its actual path may be in a different direction because of the current of  
    the river. The same type of thing can happen with a plane if the air currents are in a  
    direction different from that of the plane. With headings, the angle is measured from  
    due north to the intended path of the object, meaning the path when not influenced  
    by exterior forces such as wind or current. The true course is the angle measured  
    from due north to the actual path traveled by the object relative to the ground. If no  
    exterior force is present, then the two paths and the two angles are the same.  
    
    Definition = True Course  
    
    The true course of an object is the angle, measured clockwise from due north,  
    to the vector representing the actual path of the object. y
  - |-
    With the specific case of objects in flight, we use the term airspeed for the
    speed of the object relative to the air and ground speed for the speed of the object
    relative to the ground. The airspeed is the magnitude of the vector representing
    the velocity of the object in the direction of the heading, and the ground speed is
    the magnitude of the vector representing the velocity of the object in the direction
    of the true course. Likewise, the wind speed is the magnitude of the vector repre-
    senting the wind. As illustrated in Figure 7, the ground speed/true course vector
    is the resultant vector found by adding the airspeed/heading vector and the wind
    speed/wind direction vector.

    plane.
    
    SOLUTION Figure 8 is a diagram of the situation with the vector V represent-
    ing the airspeed and direction of the plane and W representing the speed and

    From Figure 8, we see that
    a = 180° — 120° = 60°
    and
    6 = 360° — (a + 165°) = 135°
    
    We now have the case SAS. The magnitude of V + W can be found from the

    Using the Law of Sines
    
    EXAMPLE 1 Find angle B in triangle ABC if a = 2, b = 6, and A = 30°.
    SOLUTION Applying the law of sines we have
    
    sin B / sin A = b / a
    b sin A
    sin B = ---
    a
    6 sin 30°
    sin B = ---
    2
    ~15 Figure 1
    
    Because sin B can never be larger than 1, no triangle exists for which a = 2,
    b = 6, and A = 30°. (You may recall from geometry that there was no congruence
    theorem SSA.) Figure 1 illustrates what went wrong here. No matter how
    we orient side a, we cannot complete a triangle.
    
    When we are given two sides and an angle opposite one of them (SSA), we
    have several possibilities for the triangle or triangles that result. As was the case in
    Example 1, one of the possibilities is that no triangle will fit the given information.
    If side a in Example 1 had been equal in length to the altitude drawn from vertex
    
    C, then we would have had a right triangle that fit the given information, as shown
    
    in Figure 2. If side a had been longer than this altitude but shorter than side b,
    we would have had two triangles that fit the given information, triangle AB’C and
    triangle ABC as illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Notice that the two possibili-
    ties for side a in Figure 3 create an isosceles triangle B’CB.
    
    Figure 4
    
    If side a in triangle ABC of Example 1 had been longer than side b, we would
    have had only one triangle that fit the given information, as shown in Figure 5.
  - |-
    Because of the different possibilities that arise in solving a triangle for which  
    we are given two sides and an angle opposite one of the given sides, we call this  
    situation the ambiguous case.

    Find the missing parts of triangle and A = 40°.

    4 ties (Figure 6). We will call one of them B and the other B’.

    4° 483° Notice that B’ = 132° is the supplement of B. We have two different angles that  
    > x can be found with a = 54cm, b = 62 cm, and A = 40°. Figure 7 shows both of  
    
    them. One is labeled ABC, while the other is labeled 4B’C. Also, because trian-  
    Figure 6 gle B’ BC is isosceles, we can see that angle 4B’C must be supplementary to B.

    Because sin A is positive in QI and QII, we have two possible values for A.
    A = sin ! (0.3782) = 22.2° and A’ = 180° — 22.2° = 157.8°
    The second possibility, A’ = 157.8°, will not work, however, because C is 35.4°
    and therefore
    C+ A’ = 35.4° + 157.8° = 193.2°
    
    which is larger than 180°. This result indicates that there is exactly one triangle
    that fits the description given in Example 3. In that triangle

    Using the Law of Cosines  
    
    The ambiguous case can also be solved using the law of cosines. In the next three  
    examples, we will solve the same triangles from Examples 1, 2, and 3, but using  
    the law of cosines instead of the law of sines. This way you will be able to com-  
    pare the two methods.

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:

    **PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4**
    Find angle B in triangle ABC if a = 2, b = 6, and A = 30°.
    
    In triangle ABC, if A = 36°, a = 5.0, and b = 14, find angle B.
    
    **SOLUTION**
    First we apply the law of cosines to find the missing side.
    $$
    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
    $$
    $$
    2^2 = 6^2 + c^2 - 2 \cdot 6 \cdot c \cos 30°
    $$
    $$
    4 = 36 + c^2 - 12c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
    $$
    $$
    4 = 36 + c^2 - 6\sqrt{3}c
    $$
    $$
    0 = c^2 - 6\sqrt{3}c + 32
    $$
    
    Using the quadratic formula to solve this quadratic equation, we obtain:
    $$
    c = \frac{-(-6\sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{(-6\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(32)}}{2(1)}
    $$
    $$
    c = \frac{6\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{-20}}{2}
    $$
    
    Because of the negative number in the square root, c is not a real number.
    Therefore no triangle is possible.

    **PROBLEM 5 EXAMPLE 5**
    Find the missing parts in triangle ABC if a = 54cm, b = 62 cm, and A = 40°.
    
    Find the missing parts of triangle ABC if A = 44°, a = 55 cm, and b = 66 cm.
    
    **SOLUTION**
    Once again, we begin by using the law of cosines to find side c.
    
    $$
    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
    $$
    $$
    54 = 62^2 + c^2 - 2 \cdot 62 \cdot c \cos 40°
    $$
    $$
    2916 = 3844 + c^2 - 124c \cdot 0.7660
    $$
    Approximate cos 40°
    $$
    2916 = 3844 + c^2 - 94.984c
    $$
    $$
    0 = c^2 - 94.984c + 928
    $$
    
    Using the quadratic formula to solve for c, we obtain:
    $$
    c = \frac{-(-94.984) + \sqrt{(-94.984)^2 - 4(1)(928)}}{2(1)}
    $$
    $$
    c = \frac{94.984 + 72.8695}{2}
    $$
    
    Which gives us c = 11 or c = 84, to two significant digits. Since both of these
    values are positive real numbers, there are two triangles possible. We can use the
    law of cosines again to find either of the remaining two angles.

    The possibilities for the ground with vectors, the resultant of which will be the ground speed and true course of
    speed of the plane? the plane. First, measure an angle of 52.5° from north (clockwise) and draw a
    vector in that direction with magnitude 170 to represent the heading and air-
    speed. Then draw a second vector at an angle of 64.1° from north with unknown
    magnitude to represent the true course and ground speed. Because this second
    vector must be the resultant, the wind velocity will be some vector originating at
    the tip of the first vector and ending at the tip of the second vector, and having
    a length of 40.0. Figure 10 illustrates the situation. From Figure 10, we see that
    
    6 = 64.1° — 52.5° = 11.6°
    
    First we use the law of sines to find angle a.
    
    sin a = (sin 11.6°) * (170 / 40.0)
    
    sin a = (sin 11.6°) * 4.25
    
    sin a = 0.8546
    
    Because sin a is positive in quadrants I and II, we have two possible values for a.
    a = sin ! (0.8546) = 58.7° and a’ = 180° — 58.7°
    = 121.3°
    
    We see there are two different triangles that can be formed with the three vec-
    tors. Figure 11 shows both of them. There are two values for a, so there are two
    values for B.
    
    B = 180° — (11.6° + 58.7°) and B’ = 180° — (11.6° + 121.3°)
    B = 109.7° and B’ = 47.1°
    
    Now we can use the law of sines again to find the ground speed.
    From Figure 11:
    
    40 / sin 109.7° = x / sin 11.6°
    and
    40 / sin 47.1° = x’ / sin 11.6°
    
    Solving for x and x’:
    
    x = (40 * sin 109.7°) / sin 11.6°
    x’ = (40 * sin 47.1°) / sin 11.6°
    
    x = 187 mi/hr
    x’ = 146 mi/hr

    To three significant digits, the two possibilities for the ground speed of the plane  
    are 187 miles per hour and 146 miles per hour. a

    424  CHAPTER7 B—l Triangles
    
    In this section, we will derive three formulas for the area S of a triangle. We will
    start by deriving the formula used to find the area of a triangle for which two sides
    and the included angle are given.
    
    Two Sides and the Included Angle
    
    To derive our first formula, we begin with the general formula for the area of a
    triangle:
    
    1
    S= ½ (base)(height)
    
    The base of triangle ABC in Figure 1 is c and the height is h. So the formula for
    S becomes, in this case,
    
    Figure 1
    
    Suppose that, for triangle ABC, we are given the lengths of sides b and c and the
    measure of angle A. Then we can write sin A as
    h = b sin A
    or, by solving for h,
    h=bsin A
    Substituting this expression for h into the formula
    1
    S= ½ (base)(height)
    we have
    1
    S= ½ (c)(b sin A)
    
    Applying the same kind of reasoning to the heights drawn from A and B, we also
    have the following.
    
    Area of a Triangle (SAS)
    
    S = ½ ab sin C = ½ bc sin A = ½ ac sin B
    
    Each of these three formulas indicates that to find the area of a triangle for which
    we are given two sides and the angle included between them, we multiply half the
    product of the two sides by the sine of the angle included between them.

    Two Angles and One Side
    
    The next area formula we will derive is used to find the area of triangles for which
    we are given two angles and one side.
    
    Suppose we were given angles A and B and side a in triangle ABC in Figure 1.
    We could easily solve for C by subtracting the sum of A and B from 180°.
    
    To find side b, we use the law of sines
    
    b a
    sinB sinA
    
    Solving this equation for b would give us
    
    _ asin B
    
    sin A
    
    Substituting this expression for b into the formula
    
    1
    S= 5b sin C
    
    we have
    
    1 asin B\ .
    s= ta sin A )sin c
    
    _ a sin B sin C
    2 sin A
    
    A similar sequence of steps can be used to derive the following. The formula we
    use depends on the side we are given.

    C = 180° — (24° 10’ + 120° 40’)

    Now, applying the formula
    _ a sin B sin C
    2 sin A
    with a = 4.25, A = 24° 10’, B = 120° 40’, and C = 35° 10’, we have
    
    5- (4.25)(sin 120° 40’)(sin 35° 10’)

    = 10.9 ft? To three significant digits a
    
    Three Sides
    
    The last area formula we will discuss is called Heron’s formula. It is used to find the
    area of a triangle in which all three sides are known. Heron’s formula is attributed
    to Heron of Alexandria, a geometer of the first century A.D. Heron proved his
    formula in Book I of his work, Metrica.
    
    Area of a Triangle (SSS)
    
    Given a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, the semiperimeter of the
    triangle is defined as

    and the area of the triangle is given by
    
    S=Vs(s — als — bs — 0) y
    
    The semiperimeter is simply half the perimeter of the triangle.
  - |-
    PROOF  
    We begin our proof by squaring both sides of the formula  
    
    $$
    S = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C
    $$  
    
    to obtain  
    
    $$
    S^2 = \frac{1}{4}a^2b^2 \sin^2 C
    $$  
    
    Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{4}{a^2b^2}$ to isolate $\sin^2 C$ on the right side.  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \sin^2 C
    $$  
    
    Replacing $\sin^2 C$ with $1 - \cos^2 C$ and then factoring as the difference of two squares, we have  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = 1 - \cos^2 C = (1 + \cos C)(1 - \cos C)
    $$  
    
    From the law of cosines, we know that $\cos C = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}$.  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \left(1 + \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\right)\left(1 - \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\right)
    $$  
    
    Simplifying each term:  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \left(\frac{2ab + a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\right)\left(\frac{2ab - a^2 - b^2 + c^2}{2ab}\right)
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \left(\frac{(a + b)^2 - c^2}{2ab}\right)\left(\frac{(-a + b)^2 + c^2}{2ab}\right)
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \left(\frac{(a + b + c)(a + b - c)}{2ab}\right)\left(\frac{(a - b + c)(-a + b + c)}{2ab}\right)
    $$  
    
    Now, we factor each numerator as the difference of two squares and multiply the denominators.  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(a + b + c)(a + b - c)(a - b + c)(-a + b + c)}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    Now, because $a + b + c = 2s$, it is also true that  
    $$
    a + b - c = 2s - 2c\\
    a - b + c = 2s - 2b\\
    -a + b + c = 2s - 2a
    $$  
    
    Substituting these expressions into our last equation, we have  
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2s - 2c)(2s - 2b)(2s - 2a)}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    Simplifying the right-hand side:  
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    Simplifying further:  
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    $$
    \frac{4S^2}{a^2b^2} = \frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}
    $$  
    
    Now, solving for $S$, we get:  
    $$
    S = \sqrt{\frac{(2s)(2(s - c))(2(s - b))(2(s - a))}{4a^2b^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{16s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}{4a^2b^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}{a^2b^2}}
    $$  
    
    $$
    S = \frac{2\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}}{ab}
    $$  
    
    Hence, we have derived the formula for the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.

    In this section, we will take a second look at vectors, this time from an algebraic
    point of view. Much of the credit for this treatment of vectors is attributed to
    both Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) and German
    mathematician Hermann Grassmann (1809-1877). Grassmann is famous for his
    book Ausdehnungslehre (The Calculus of Extension), which was first published in
    1844. However, it wasn’t until 60 years later that this work was fully accepted or
    the significance realized, when Albert Einstein used it in his theory of relativity.

    vector corresponds to the point (a, b), then the coordinates of this point provide a
    unique representation for the vector. That is, the point (a, b) determines both the
    length of the vector and its direction, as shown in Figure 1.
    
    Figure 1
    
    To avoid confusion between the point (a, b) and the vector, which is the ray
    extending from the origin to the point, we will denote the vector as V = (a, b). We
    refer to this notation as component form. The x-coordinate, a, is called the horizon-
    tal component of V, and the y-coordinate, b, is called the vertical component of V.
    
    Magnitude
    
    As you know from Section 2.5, the magnitude of a vector is its length. Referring to
    Figure 1, we can find the magnitude of the vector V = (a, b) using the Pythagorean
    
    Theorem:
    |V| = √(a² + b²)

    square root of the sum of the squares of the horizontal and vertical components.

    Addition and Subtraction with Algebraic Vectors
    
    Adding and subtracting vectors written in component form is simply a matter of
    adding (or subtracting) the horizontal components and adding (or subtracting)
    the vertical components. Figure 3 shows the vector sum of vectors U = (6, 2) and
    V = (-3, 5).

    Figure 3
    
    By simply counting squares on the grid you can convince yourself that the
    sum can be obtained by adding horizontal components and adding vertical com-
    ponents. That is,
    
    U + V = (6, 2) + (-3, 5)
    = (6 + (-3), 2 + 5)
    = (3, 7)
    
    Figure 4 shows the difference of vectors U and V. As the diagram in Figure 4
    indicates, subtraction of algebraic vectors can be accomplished by subtracting
    corresponding components. That is,
    
    U - V = (6, 2) - (-3, 5)
    
    = (6 - (-3), 2 - 5)

    SECTION 7.5 Vectors: An Algebraic Approach 433
    
    Scalar Multiplication
    To multiply a vector in component form by a scalar (real number) we multiply
    each component of the vector by the scalar. Figure 5 shows the vector V = (2, 3)
    and the vector 3V. As you can see,
    3V = 3(2, 3)
    = (3*2, 3*3)
    = (6, 9)
    Notice that the vector 3V has the same direction as V but is three times as long.
    Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar will preserve the direction of the vector
    but change its length (assuming the scalar is not equal to 1). Multiplying a vector
    by a negative scalar will result in a vector with the opposite direction and different
    length (assuming the scalar is not equal to —1).

    = (20 + 30, -12 — 20)
    = (50, -32)

    Component Vector Form
    
    Another way to represent a vector algebraically is to express the vector as the sum of a
    horizontal vector and a vertical vector. As we mentioned in Section 2.5, any vector V
    can be written in terms of its horizontal and vertical component vectors, V_h and
    V_v, respectively. To do this, we need to define two special vectors.
    
    Definition = Unit Vectors
    
    NOTE A unit vector is any vector The vector that extends from the origin to the point (1, 0) is called the unit
    
    whose magnitude is 1. The vector that extends from the origin to the point (1, 0) is called the unit
    
    horizontal vector and is denoted by i. The vector that extends from the origin to the point (0, 1) is called the unit vertical vector and is denoted by j. Figure 6
    shows the vectors i and j.

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Write the vector V = (3, 4) in terms of the unit vectors i and j.
    Write V = (5, 12) in terms
    of iand j. SOLUTION From the origin, we must go three units in the positive x-direction,
    
    and then four units in the positive y-direction, to locate the terminal point of V at
    
    (3, 4). Because i is a vector of length 1 in the positive x-direction, 3i will be a vec-
    
    tor of length 3 in that same direction. Likewise, 4j will be a vector of length 4 in
    
    the positive y-direction. As shown in Figure 7, V is the sum of vectors 3i and 4j.
    Therefore, we can write V in terms of the unit vectors i and j as
    
    V = 3i + 4j

    In Example 3, the vector 3i is the horizontal vector component of V, which we  
    have previously referred to as V,. Likewise, 4j is the vertical vector component of  
    V, previously referred to as V,. Notice that the coefficients of these vectors are  
    simply the coordinates of the terminal point of V. That is,  
    
    V = (3,4) = 3i + 4j  
    We refer to the notation V = 3i + 4j as vector component form. Every vector V can be  
    
    written in terms of horizontal and vertical components and the unit vectors i and j.  
    Here is a summary of the information we have developed to this point.

    If i is the unit vector from (0, 0) to (1, 0), and j is the unit vector from (0, 0) to  
    (0, 1), then any vector V can be written as y  
    V = ai + bj = (a,b) t (a,b)  
    where a and b are real numbers (Figure 8).  
    The magnitude of V is y bj

    and makes an angle of 55° with
    the positive x-axis. Its magnitude is 15. Write V in terms of i and j.
    SOLUTION Figure 9 is a diagram of V. The horizontal and vertical compo-
    nents of V are a and b, respectively.
    We find a and b using right triangle 4
    trigonometry.
    a = 12 cos 35° = 9.8 V
    b = 12 sin 35° = 6.9 12 p
    Writing V in terms of the unit vectors i and j 35° Z
    we have 0 7 mx
    V = 9.8i + 6.9j Figure 9 a
    
    We can generalize the results of the previous example for any vector in standard
    position as follows.
    
    Vector Component Form
    
    If V is a vector in standard position, and θ is the angle that V makes with the
    positive x-axis, then the vector component form for V is given by
    
    V = |V|cos θ i + |V| sin θ j
    
    Working with vectors in vector component form ai + bj is no different from
    working with them in component form (a, b), as illustrated in the next example.

    magnitude of the force exerted
    
    by Susan.
    
    Figure 10
    
    y SOLUTION When we solved this problem in Section 2.5, we noted that there
    A are three forces acting on Danny (and the swing), which we have labeled W,
    H, and T. Recall that the vector W is due to the force of gravity: its magnitude
    30 T is |W| = 42 Ib, and its direction is straight down. The vector H represents the
    60° ay force with which Stacey is pulling Danny horizontally, and T is the force acting
    ~< > >» x on Danny in the direction of the ropes.
    
    Ww If we place the origin of a coordinate system on the point at which the
    tails of the three vectors intersect, we can write each vector in terms of its
    magnitude and the unit vectors i and j. The coordinate system is shown in
    Figure 11. The direction along which H acts is in the positive x direction, so
    we can write
    
    vy
    
    v
    
    Figure 11
    H = |H|i
    
    Likewise, the weight vector W is straight down, so we can write
    W= -|W|j= ~42j
    
    Using right triangle trigonometry, we write T in terms of its horizontal and
    vertical components:
    
    T = —|T| cos 60° + |T|sin 60°
    
    Because Danny and the swing are at rest, we have static equilibrium. There-
    fore, the sum of the vectors is the zero vector.
    
    T+H+W=0
    —|T| cos 60° + |T| sin 60° + |H|i + (—42j) = 0
    
    Collecting all the i components and all the j components together, we have
    
    (—|T| cos 60° + |H|)i + (|T| sin 60° — 42)j = 0

    Compute a dot product.  
    Find the angle between two vectors.  
    Determine if two nonzero vectors are perpendicular.  
    
    Use the dot product to calculate work.  
    
    Now that we have a way to represent vectors algebraically, we can define a type of multiplication between two vectors. The dot product (also called the scalar product) is a form of multiplication that results in a scalar quantity. For our purposes, it will be useful when finding the angle between two vectors or for finding the work done by a force in moving an object. Here is the definition of the dot product of two vectors.
    
    Definition = Dot Product  
    
    The dot product of two vectors U = ai + bj and V = ci + dj is written U · V and is defined as follows:
    
    U · V = (ai + bj) · (ci + dj)
    
    = (ac) + (bd)  
    
    As you can see, the dot product is a real number (scalar), not a vector.

    Finding the Angle Between Two Vectors
    
    One application of the dot product is finding the angle between two vectors. To
    do this, we will use an alternate form of the dot product, shown in the following
    theorem.
    
    Theorem 7.1
    
    The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes
    multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. That is, when @ is the angle
    between two nonzero vectors U and V, then
    
    U*V=|U||V| cos 6 4
    
    The proof of this theorem is derived from the law of cosines and is left as an
    exercise.
    
    When we are given two vectors and asked to find the angle between them, we
    rewrite the formula in Theorem 7.1 by dividing each side by | U||V|. The result is
    
    cos § =
    1U||v|
    
    This formula is equivalent to our original formula, but is easier to work with when
    finding the angle between two nonzero vectors.

    Perpendicular Vectors
    
    If two nonzero vectors are perpendicular, then the angle between them is 90°. We
    sometimes refer to perpendicular vectors as being orthogonal. Because the cosine

    Work
    
    In Section 2.5 we introduced the concept of work. Recall that work is performed
    when a constant force F is used to move an object a certain distance. We can
    represent the movement of the object using a displacement vector, d, as shown in
    Figure 1.

    Figure 1 Figure 2
    
    In Figure 2 we let V represent the component of F that is oriented in the same
    direction as d, since only the amount of the force in the direction of movement
    can be used in calculating work. V is sometimes called the projection of F onto d.
    We can find the magnitude of V using right triangle trigonometry:
    
    |V| = |F| cos 6
    
    Because |d| represents the distance the object is moved, the work performed by
    the force is
    
    Work = |V||d|
    = (|F|cos 6) - |d|

    with the horizontal. If the package is moved 25 feet, how much work is done

    SOLUTION We solved this problem previously in Example 6 of Section 2.5 by
    finding the magnitude of the horizontal vector component of the force. Now we
    will see how this same problem can be solved using a dot product.
    
    To begin, we express the force applied to the package and its resulting
    motion in terms of vectors. We can assume the package moves horizontally to
    the right as shown in Figure 4.
    
    Force F = 64 cos (—35°) + 64 sin (—35°)

    THE LAW OF SINES [7.1]  
    
    For any triangle ABC, the following relationships are always true:  
    $$
    \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
    $$  
    
    For example, if A = 30°, B = 70°, and a = 8.0 cm in triangle ABC, then:  
    
    $$
    \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{8.0}{\sin 30^\circ}
    $$  
    
    So,  
    $$
    \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{8.0}{\sin 30^\circ}
    $$  
    
    Therefore,  
    $$
    b = \frac{8.0 \cdot \sin 70^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ}
    $$  
    
    Similarly,  
    $$
    c = \frac{8.0 \cdot \sin C}{\sin 30^\circ}
    $$  
    
    THE LAW OF COSINES [7.2]  
    
    In any triangle ABC, the following relationships are always true:  
    $$
    \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}
    $$  
    $$
    \cos B = \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}
    $$  
    $$
    \cos C = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
    $$  
    
    For example, if b = 20 km, and c = 18 km, then we can find A using the law of cosines:  
    
    $$
    \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}
    $$  
    
    So,  
    $$
    \cos A = \frac{20^2 + 18^2 - a^2}{2 \cdot 20 \cdot 18}
    $$  
    
    If we assume a = 34 km, then:  
    $$
    \cos A = \frac{20^2 + 18^2 - 34^2}{2 \cdot 20 \cdot 18}
    $$  
    
    Calculating:  
    $$
    \cos A = \frac{400 + 324 - 1156}{720}
    $$  
    $$
    \cos A = \frac{-432}{720}
    $$  
    $$
    \cos A = -0.6000
    $$

    Because sin B is positive for any two different triangles can be obtained from the given information, and a third

    VECTOR COMPONENT FORM [7.5]
    
    If V is a vector in standard position, and θ is the angle that V makes with the positive x-axis, then the vector component form for V is given by
    
    V = |V|cos θi + |V|sin θj
    
    DOT PRODUCT [7.6]
    
    The dot product of two vectors U = ai + bj and V = ci + dj is written U · V and
    is defined as follows:
    
    U · V = ac + bd
    If θ is the angle between the two vectors, then it is also true that
    
    U · V = |U||V|cos θ or cos θ = (U · V)/(|U||V|)
    
    PERPENDICULAR VECTORS [7.6]
    
    If U and V are two nonzero vectors, then
    U · V = 0 ⇨ |U| ≠ 0 and |V| ≠ 0
    
    In Words: Two nonzero vectors are perpendicular, or orthogonal, if and only if
    their dot product is 0.
    
    WORK [7.6]

    the force is
    
    Work = F · d

    Measuring the Distance to Mars
    
    OBJECTIVE: To find the distance of Mars from the sun using two Earth-based  
    observations.
    
    The planet Mars orbits the Sun once every 687 days. This is referred to as its  
    sidereal period. When observing Mars from Earth, the angle that Mars makes  
    with the Sun is called the solar elongation (Figure 1). On November 13, 2000,  
    Mars had a solar elongation of 42.8° W. On October 1, 2002, 687 days later, the  
    solar elongation of Mars was 17.1° W. Because the number of days between these  
    observations is equal to the sidereal period of Mars, the planet was in the same  
    position on both occasions. Figure 2 is an illustration of the situation.

    The distance from the Sun to Earth is defined as 1 astronomical unit (1 AU), which is about 93 million miles. Because both AC and BC have a length of 1 AU, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.
    
    EM Use the fact that Earth completes one revolution about the Sun every 365.25 days to determine how many degrees the Earth travels in one day. On November 13, 2002, Earth would again be at point B. Find the number of days it would take Earth to move from point A to point B. Now, using both of these results, compute the number of degrees for central angle ACB.
    
    Find the distance AB using triangle ABC.
    
    Because triangle ABC is isosceles, angles CAB and CBA are equal. Find the measure of these two angles. Use this result to find angles DAB and DBA.
    
    Use triangle ABD to find the length of AD.
    
    Find the length of CD. Give your answer both in terms of AU and in miles.

    Introduction
    
    In 1545, Jerome Cardan (Girolamo Cardano) published the mathematical work
    Ars Magna, the title page of which is shown in Figure 1. The title translates to The
    Great Art of Solving Algebraic Equations. In this book Cardan posed a number of
    problems, such as solving certain cubic and quartic equations.

    In our present-day notation, many of the problems posed by Cardan can be
    solved with some simple algebra, but the solutions require taking square roots
    of negative numbers. Square roots of negative numbers are handled with the
    complex number system, which had not been developed when Cardan wrote his
    book. The foundation of the complex number system is contained in this chapter,
    along with the very interesting and useful connection between complex numbers
    and trigonometric functions.

    Learning Objectives
    
    Express the square root of a negative number as an imaginary number.
    Add and subtract complex numbers.
    Simplify powers of i.
    
    Multiply and divide complex numbers.
    
    One of the problems posed by Cardan in Ars Magna is the following:
    
    If someone says to you, divide 10 into two parts, one of which multiplied into the
    other shall produce 40, it is evident that this case or question is impossible.
  - |-
    Using our present-day notation, this problem can be solved with a system of
    equations:
    x+y=10
    xy = 40
    Solving the first equation for y, we have y = 10 — x. Substituting this value of y
    into the second equation, we have
    x(10 — x) = 40
    The equation is quadratic. We write it in standard form and apply the quadratic
    formula.
    0 = x² — 10x + 40
    10 ± √(100 — 4(1)(40))
    2
    10 ± √(100 — 160)
    2
    10 ± √(—60)
    2
    10 ± 2√(—15)
    2
    = 5 ± √(—15)
    
    This is as far as Cardan could take the problem because he did not know what to do
    with the square root of a negative number. We handle this situation by using com-
    plex numbers. Our work with complex numbers is based on the following definition.
    
    Definition = Imaginary Unit
    
    The number i, called the imaginary unit, is such that i² = —1. (That is, i is the
    number whose square is — 1.) y

    456 CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates
    
    The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler was the first to introduce the num-
    ber i in 1777 in one of his memoirs. The memoir was later formally published in
    1794 in his work Institutionum Calculi Integralis.

    The number i is not a real number. We can use it to write square roots of
    negative numbers without a negative sign. To do so, we reason that if a > 0, then

    ov a. V—9 = iV9 = 3)

    NOTE We usually place / after the
    coefficient, but in front of the radical, C. -—17 =iV 17 |
    
    so that we avoid inadvertently
    writing the / inside the radical.
    
    To simplify expressions that contain square roots of negative numbers by
    using the properties of radicals developed in algebra, it is necessary to write each
    square root in terms of i before applying the properties of radicals. For example,
    
    this is correct) WV—4V—9 = (iV4)(iV9) = (21)(3i) = 677 = —6
    this is incorrect: V—4V—9 = V—4(—9) = V36 = 6
    
    Remember, the properties of radicals you developed in algebra hold only for expres-
    sions in which the numbers under the radical sign are nonnegative. When the radi-
    cals contain negative numbers, you must first write each radical in terms of i and
    then simplify.
    
    Next, we use i to write a definition for complex numbers.
    
    Definition = Complex Number a
    
    A complex number is any number that can be written in the form
    
    at bi
    where a and b are real numbers and i? = —1. The forma + Dis called standard
    form for complex numbers. The number a is called the real part of the com-
    plex number. The number b is called the imaginary part of the complex num-
    ber. If b = 0, then a + bi = a, which is a real number. If a = 0 and b # 0, then
    a + bi = bi, which is called an imaginary number.

    EXAMPLE 2
    
    a. The number 3 + 2i is a complex number in standard form. The number 3 is
    the real part, and the number 2 (not 27) is the imaginary part.
    
    b. The number —7i is a complex number because it can be written as 0 + (—7)i.
    The real part is 0. The imaginary part is —7. The number —7 is also an
    imaginary number since a = 0 and b # 0.
    
    c. The number 4 is a complex number because it can be written as 4 + Oi. The
    real part is 4 and the imaginary part is 0. a
    
    From part c in Example 2, it is apparent that real numbers are also complex num-
    bers. The real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers.
    
    Equality for Complex Numbers
    
    Definition = Equality for Complex Numbers BC
    
    Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and
    their imaginary parts are equal. That is, for real numbers a, b, c, and d,
    
    a+ bi=ct+di if and only if a=candb=d y
    
    EXAMPLE 3. Find x and y if (—3x — 9) + 4i = 6 + (y — 2)i.
    SOLUTION The real parts are —3x — 9 and 6. The imaginary parts are 4 and 
    y — 2. Setting the real parts equal and the imaginary parts equal, we get:
    
    —3x — 9 = 6 and 4 = y — 2
    
    Solving the first equation:
    
    —3x — 9 = 6
    —3x = 15
    x = -5
    
    Solving the second equation:
    
    4 = y — 2
    y = 6
    
    Therefore, x = -5 and y = 6.

    Definition = Sum and Difference |
    
    If z; = a, + bi and z, = a, + bi are complex numbers, then the sum and dif-

    Multiplication and Division with Complex Numbers
    
    Definition: Multiplication
    
    If z₁ = a + bi and z₂ = a + bi are complex numbers, then their product is
    defined as follows:
    = (aa) — (bb)(byby) + (ayby + anb,)i 4
    
    This formula is simply a result of binomial multiplication and is much less com-
    plicated than it looks. Complex numbers have the form of binomials with i as the

    EXAMPLE 6 Multiply (3 — 4i)(2 — 5i).
    SOLUTION Multiplying as if these were two binomials, we have
    (3 — 4i)(2 — 5i) = 3*2 — 3*5i — 4i*2 + 4i*5i
    = 6 — 15i — 8i + 20i²
    = 6 — 23i + 20i²
    Now, because i² = -1, we can simplify further.
    = 6 — 23i + 20(-1)
    = 6 — 23i — 20
    = -14 — 23i

    EXAMPLE 7 Multiply (4 — 5i)(4 + 5i).
    
    SOLUTION This product has the form (a — b)(a + b), which we know results in
    the difference of two squares, a² — b².
    
    (4 — 5i)(4 + 5i) = 4² — (5i)²
    = 16 — 25i²
    = 16 — 25(-1)
    = 16 + 25
    = 41 a
    
    The product of the two complex numbers 4 — 5i and 4 + 5i is the real number 41.
    This fact is very useful and leads to the following definition.
    
    Definition: Complex Conjugates
    
    The complex numbers a + bi and a — bi are called complex conjugates. Their
    product is the real number a² + b². Here’s why:
    
    (a + bi)(a — bi) = a² — (bi)²
    = a² — b²i²
    = a² — b²(-1)
    = a² + b²
    
    The fact that the product of two complex conjugates is a real number is the key to
    division with complex numbers.

    SOLUTION We want to find a complex number in standard form that is equiva-
    lent to the quotient 5i/(2 — 3i). To do so, we need to replace the denominator
    with a real number. We can accomplish this by multiplying both the numerator
    and the denominator by 2 + 3i, which is the conjugate of 2 — 3i.

    SECTION 8.1 Complex Numbers 461
    
    SOLUTION First we write the number x = 5+ √—15 with our complex number notation as x = 5 + i√15. Now, to find the value of y that accompanies this value of x, we substitute 5 + i√15 for x in the equation x + y = 10 and solve for y:
    
    When x=5+i√15
    
    then x+y=10
    
    becomes 5+i√15+y=10
    y=5-i√15
    
    All we have left to do is show that these values of x and y satisfy the second equation, xy = 40. We do so by substitution:
    
    If x=5+i√15 and y=5-i√15
    then the equation xy = 40
    becomes (5 + i√15)(5 — i√15) = 40
    
    5² - (i √15)² = 40
    25 - (-1)(15) = 40
    
    25+ 15 = 40
    40 = 40
    
    Because our last statement is a true statement, our two expressions for x and y together form a solution to the equation. a

    let’s look at a definition that will give us a visual representation for complex numbers.
  - |-
    To graphically represent a complex number a + bi, we need a system which  
    allows us to indicate the values of both a and b. To do this, we set up a rectangular  
    coordinate system much like the Cartesian coordinate system, except that we use  
    the horizontal axis to indicate the real part and the vertical axis to indicate the  
    imaginary part. We refer to the horizontal axis as the real axis, which represents  
    the real part of a complex number, and the vertical axis as the imaginary axis,  
    which represents the imaginary part. The resulting two-dimensional coordinate  
    system is called the complex plane, or Argand plane (Figure 1).

    tance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the complex plane. If this distance

    The argument of the complex number z = x + yi, denoted arg(z), is the small-
    est positive angle 6 from the positive real axis to the graph of z. y
    
    Figure 4 illustrates the relationships between the complex number z = x + yi,
    its graph, and the modulus r and argument 6 of z. From Figure 4 we see that

    **EXTENDING THE CONCEPTS**
    
    Euler’s Formula There is a surprising relationship between the natural exponential function and complex numbers that are written in trigonometric form. This relationship, sometimes referred to as Euler’s Formula, is defined by the following equation:
    
    e^iθ = cos θ + i sin θ  
    
    We can extend this relationship by multiplying both sides by r to obtain:
    
    r e^iθ = r (cos θ + i sin θ) = r cis θ  
    
    For instance, based on our work in Example 4 from this section, we could write:
    
    −1 + i = √2 cis (π/4) = √2 e^i(π/4)
    
    73. Use Euler’s Formula to evaluate e^iθ.
    
    74. Use Euler’s Formula to evaluate e^i(−θ).
    
    75. Write 2e^i(π/4) as a complex number in standard form.
    
    76. Write 4e^i(π/3) as a complex number in standard form.
    
    77. Use Euler’s Formula along with the relationship e^iθ = e^i(−θ) to derive the sum formulas for both sine and cosine.
    
    78. Use Euler’s Formula to write e^iθ and e^i(−θ) in trigonometric form. Then use the resulting pair of equations to solve for sin θ and cos θ, writing both functions as expressions.

    **Learning Objectives**
    
    - Multiply complex numbers in trigonometric form.
    - Divide complex numbers in trigonometric form.
    - Use de Moivre’s Theorem to find powers of complex numbers.
    - Use trigonometric form to simplify expressions involving complex numbers.
    
    Multiplication and division with complex numbers become very simple processes when the numbers are written in trigonometric form. Let’s state the rule for finding the product of two complex numbers written in trigonometric form as a theorem and then prove the theorem.
    
    **Theorem (Multiplication)**  
    Let $ z_1 = r_1(\cos \theta_1 + i \sin \theta_1) $ and $ z_2 = r_2(\cos \theta_2 + i \sin \theta_2) $. Then the product $ z_1 \cdot z_2 $ is given by:  
    $$
    z_1 \cdot z_2 = r_1 r_2 [\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)]
    $$
    
    **Proof:**  
    Using the distributive property:
    $$
    z_1 \cdot z_2 = r_1(\cos \theta_1 + i \sin \theta_1) \cdot r_2(\cos \theta_2 + i \sin \theta_2)
    $$
    $$
    = r_1 r_2 [(\cos \theta_1)(\cos \theta_2) - (\sin \theta_1)(\sin \theta_2) + i(\cos \theta_1)(\sin \theta_2) + i(\sin \theta_1)(\cos \theta_2)]
    $$
    Grouping real and imaginary parts:
    $$
    = r_1 r_2 [(\cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 - \sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_2) + i(\cos \theta_1 \sin \theta_2 + \sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_2)]
    $$
    Using the cosine addition formula and sine addition formula:
    $$
    = r_1 r_2 [\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)]
    $$
    
    Thus, the theorem is proved.

    the moduli and add the arguments.  
    
    PROOF  
    We begin by multiplying algebraically. Then we simplify our product by using the  
    sum formulas we introduced in Section 5.2.  
    Z₁Z₂ = [r₁(cos θ₁ + i sin θ₁)][r₂(cos θ₂ + i sin θ₂)]  
    = r₁r₂(cos θ₁ + i sin θ₁)(cos θ₂ + i sin θ₂)  
    = r₁r₂[cos θ₁ cos θ₂ + i cos θ₁ sin θ₂ + i sin θ₁ cos θ₂ + i² sin θ₁ sin θ₂]  
    = r₁r₂[cos θ₁ cos θ₂ + i(cos θ₁ sin θ₂ + sin θ₁ cos θ₂) − sin θ₁ sin θ₂]  
    = r₁r₂[(cos θ₁ cos θ₂ − sin θ₁ sin θ₂) + i(sin θ₁ cos θ₂ + cos θ₁ sin θ₂)]  
    = r₁r₂[cos(θ₁ + θ₂) + i sin(θ₁ + θ₂)]  
    This completes our proof. As you can see, to multiply two complex numbers in  
    trigonometric form, we multiply absolute values, r₁r₂, and add angles, θ₁ + θ₂.

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Find the product of 3 cis 40° and 5 cis 10°.
    Multiply 4 cis 20° and 3 cis 55°.
    SOLUTION Applying the formula from our theorem on products, we have
    (3 cis 40°)(5 cis 10°) = 3 * 5 cis (40° + 10°)
    = 15 cis 50° a
    NN“
    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2. Find the product of z1 = 1 + i√3 and z2 = −√3 + i in standard form, and then write z1 and z2 in trigonometric form and find their product again.
    
    SOLUTION Leaving each complex number in standard form and multiplying we have
    
    z1*z2 = (1 + i√3)(−√3 + i)
    = −√3*1 + i*1 − √3*i√3 + i^2*√3
    = −√3 − 2i + i^2√3
    = −√3 − 2i − √3
    = −2√3 − 2i
    
    Changing z1 and z2 to trigonometric form and multiplying looks like this:
    
    z1 = 1 + i√3 = 2(cos 60° + i sin 60°)
    
    z2 = −√3 + i = 2(cos 150° + i sin 150°)
    
    z1*z2 = [2(cos 60° + i sin 60°)][2(cos 150° + i sin 150°)]
    = 4(cos 210° + i sin 210°)
    
    To compare our two products, we convert our product in trigonometric form to
    
    standard form.
    4(cos 210° + i sin 210°) = 4*(−√3/2 − i*1/2)
    = −2√3 − 2i
    
    As you can see, both methods of multiplying complex numbers produce the
    same result. a

    The next theorem is an extension of the work we have done so far with multiplication. It is named after Abraham de Moivre, who published the formula in a paper in 1722. De Moivre was born in France but emigrated to London to avoid religious persecution. Although he was a competent mathematician, as a foreigner he was unable to attain a post at a university and had to earn a living as a private tutor of mathematics. De Moivre made significant contributions to the development of analytic geometry and the theory of probability. We will not give a formal proof of the theorem.

    SECTION 8.3 Products and Quotients in Trigonometric Form 475
    
    The theorem seems reasonable after the work we have done with multiplication. For example, if n is 2,
    [r(cos θ + isin θ)]² = r(cos θ + isin θ) * r(cos θ + isin θ)
    = r*r[cos(θ + θ) + isin(θ + θ)]
    = r²(cos 2θ + isin 2θ)
    
    EXAMPLE 3. Find (4 cis 145°)².
    SOLUTION Applying de Moivre’s Theorem, we have 
    z² = (4)² cis (2 * 145°)
    = 16 cis 290°
  - |-
    (4 cis 145°)? = (4)° cis (3 - 145°)
    
    = 64 cis 435°
    = 64 cis 75°
    The last step is a result of replacing 435° with the coterminal angle of 75° so that
    the argument is less than 360°. a

    EXAMPLE 4 Find (1 + i)”.
    
    SOLUTION First we write 1 + i in trigonometric form:
    7 _ 7
    1+i=V2(cos— + isin—
    4 4
    Then we use de Moivre’s Theorem to raise this expression to the tenth power.
    
    10
    (1+i)"= | v{ cos + isin =)
    
    = (V2)( cos 10: 7 + isin 10- =)
    
    4
    5 5
    = 22(co > + isin =)
    which we can simplify to
    
    = 32( cos + isin =)
    
    because 7/2 and 57/2 are coterminal. In standard form, our result is
    = 32(0 + i)
    = 32i
    
    That is,
    
    (1 +1)" = 32: d
    
    Multiplication with complex numbers in trigonometric form is accomplished
    by multiplying the moduli and adding the arguments, so we should expect that
    division is accomplished by dividing the moduli and subtracting the arguments.

    PROBLEM 5 EXAMPLE 5 Use de Moivre’s Theorem to find the reciprocal of 1 + i√3.  
    Use de Moivre’s Theorem to find  
    the reciprocal of 1 — i√3. SOLUTION Writing 1 + i√3 in trigonometric form, we have  
    
    1 + i√3 = 2 cis 60°  
    The reciprocal of 1 + i√3 can be expressed using an exponent as  
    
    (1 + i√3)^{-1} = \frac{1}{1 + i\sqrt{3}}  
    Using the trigonometric form, we can write:  
    
    (1 + i\sqrt{3})^{-1} = (2 \text{ cis } 60°)^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cis } (-60°)  
    This can be simplified to:  
    
    \frac{1}{2} (\cos(-60°) + i \sin(-60°)) = \frac{1}{2} (\cos(60°) - i \sin(60°))  
    Since cos(-θ) = cos θ and sin(-θ) = -sin θ.  
    
    Similarly, for the reciprocal of 1 - i√3:  
    Writing 1 - i√3 in trigonometric form, we have:  
    
    1 - i\sqrt{3} = 2 \text{ cis } (-60°)  
    The reciprocal of 1 - i√3 is:  
    
    (1 - i\sqrt{3})^{-1} = (2 \text{ cis } (-60°))^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cis } (60°)  
    This can be simplified to:  
    
    \frac{1}{2} (\cos(60°) + i \sin(60°))

    EXAMPLE 7 Divide z, = 1 + i√3 by z = √3 +i and leave the answer in
    standard form. Then change each to trigonometric form and divide again.
    
    SOLUTION Dividing in standard form, we have
    
    (1 + i√3) / (√3 + i)
    = (1 + i√3)(√3 - i) / [(√3 + i)(√3 - i)]
    = (√3 - i + i√3 * √3 - i^2) / (3 + 1)
    = (√3 - i + i*3 - (-1)) / 4
    = (√3 - i + 3i + 1) / 4
    = (4 + 2i) / 4
    = 1 + i/2
    
    In trigonometric form, z1 = 1 + i√3 can be written as 2 cis 60°, and z = √3 + i can be written as 2 cis 30°. Dividing these, we get:
    
    (2 cis 60°) / (2 cis 30°) = cis(60° - 30°) = cis 30°
    
    Which is equivalent to 2 cos 30° + i 2 sin 30° = √3 + i, which matches our previous result.

    Some people, mathematics gives a clearer picture of the world in which we live.
    In other cases, the attraction is within mathematics itself. That is, for some
    people, mathematics itself is attractive, regardless of its connection to the real
    world. What you will find in this section is something in this second category. It
    is a property that real and complex numbers contain that is, by itself, surprising
    and attractive for people who enjoy mathematics. It has to do with roots of real
    and complex numbers.
    
    If we solve the equation x* = 25, our solutions will be square roots of 25.
    Likewise, if we solve x* = 8, our solutions will be cube roots of 8. Further, the
    solutions to x* = 81 will be fourth roots of 81.
    
    Without showing the work involved, here are the solutions to these three
    equations:
    
    Equation Solutions
    
    x? = 25 — Sand 5
    
    x = 8 2, -1 + iV3, and -1 -iV3
    x* = 81 —3, 3, —37, and 3/7
    
    The number 25 has two square roots, 8 has three cube roots, and 81 has four
    fourth roots. As we progress through this section, you will see that the num-
    bers we used in the equations given are unimportant; every real (or complex)
    number has exactly two square roots, three cube roots, and four fourth roots.
    In fact, every real (or complex) number has exactly n distinct nth roots, a
    surprising and attractive fact about numbers. The key to finding these roots is
    trigonometric form for complex numbers.
    
    Suppose that z and w are complex numbers such that w is an nth root of z.
    That is,
    
    waVz
    
    If we raise both sides of this last equation to the nth power, we have
    
    Now suppose z = r(cos 6 + i sin @) and w = s(cosa + i sina). Substituting
    these expressions into the equation w” = z, we have
    
    [s(cos a + isin a)]” = r(cos 6 + isin @)
    We can rewrite the left side of this last equation using de Moivre’s Theorem.
    s"(cos na + isin na) = r(cos 6 + isin 6)

    To summarize, we find the nth roots of a complex number by first finding the
    real nth root of the modulus. The angle for the first root will be 6/n, and the angles
    for the remaining roots are found by adding multiples of 360°/n. The values for k
    will range from 0 to nm — 1, because when k = n we would be adding

    CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates

    It is interesting to note the graphical relationship among these four roots, as
    illustrated in Figure 1. Because the modulus for each root is 2, the terminal point
    of the vector used to represent each root lies on a circle of radius 2. The vector
    representing the first root makes an angle of 0/n = 15° with the positive x-axis,
    then each following root has a vector that is rotated an additional 360°/n = 90°
    in the counterclockwise direction from the previous root. Because the fraction
    360°/n represents one complete revolution divided into n equal parts, the nth
    roots of a complex number will always be evenly distributed around a circle of
    
    radius r'.

    CALCULATOR NOTE
    
    If we use a graphing calculator to solve Example 1, we will
    
    only get one of the four fourth roots. Figure 2 shows the result with the values
    rounded to four decimal places. The complex number given by the calculator is an
    
    approximation of 2 cis 15°.
    
    One application of finding roots is in solving certain equations, as our next exam-
    
    ples illustrate.
    
    EXAMPLE 2 Solve x?+1=0.
    SOLUTION Adding —1 to each side of the equation, we have
    
    x= -]
    
    The solutions to this equation are the cube roots of —1. We already know that
    one of the cube roots of —1 is —1. There are two other complex cube roots as
    well. To find them, we write —1 in trigonometric form and then apply the for-
    mula from our theorem on roots. Writing —1 in trigonometric form, we have
    
    —1 = l(cos 7 + isin 77)

    where k = 0, 1, and 2. Replacing $k$ with 0, 1, and 2 and then simplifying each
    result, we have
    
    $$
    w_0 = \cos 0 + i\sin 0 = 1 + 0i = 1 \text{ when } k = 0
    $$
    $$
    w_1 = \cos 7 + i\sin 7 = -1 \text{ when } k = 1
    $$
    $$

    are shown in Figure 3.

    Note that the two complex roots are conjugates. Let’s check root $w_2$ by cubing it.

    You may have noticed that the equation in Example 2 can be solved by alge-
    braic methods. Let’s solve $x^3 + 1 = 0$ by factoring and compare our results to those
    
    in Example 2. [Recall the formula for factoring the sum of two cubes as follows:
    $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)]$
    
    $$
    x^3 + 1 = 0
    $$
    $$
    (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) = 0 \text{ Factor the left side}
    $$
    $$
    x + 1 = 0 \quad x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \text{ Set factors equal to 0}

    486 CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates
    
    The first equation gives us x = —1 for a solution. To solve the second equation,
    we use the quadratic formula.
    
    $$
    \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 12}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}
    $$
    
    This last expression gives us two solutions; they are
    
    $$
    \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}
    $$
    
    As you can see, the three solutions we found in Example 2 using trigonometry
    match the three solutions found using algebra. Notice that the algebraic method
    of solving the equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ depends on our ability to factor the left side
    of the equation. The advantage to the trigonometric method is that it is independent
    of our ability to factor.
    
    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Solve the equation $x^4 - 2\sqrt{3}x^2 + 4 = 0$.
    Solve $x^4 + 2x^2 + 2 = 0$.
    SOLUTION The equation is quadratic in $x^2$. We can solve for $x^2$ by applying the
    
    quadratic formula.
    
    $$
    \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 - 16}}{2} = \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm 2i}{2} = -\sqrt{3} \pm i
    $$
    
    The two solutions for $x^2$ are $-\sqrt{3} + i$ and $-\sqrt{3} - i$, which we write in trigonometric
    form as follows:
    
    $$
    x = -\sqrt{3} + i \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{3} - i
    $$
    
    $$
    = 2(\cos 150^\circ + i\sin 150^\circ) = 2(\cos 315^\circ + i\sin 315^\circ)
    $$
    
    Now each of these expressions has two square roots, each of which is a solution
    to our original equation.

    SECTION 8.4 Bf Roots of a Complex Number 489
    
    Let’s assume that the two cube roots are complex conjugates. If they are, then we can
    simplify our work by noticing that
    
    x= V24 111i + V2 —lli=atbita-—bi=2a
    
    which means that we simply double the real part of each cube root of 2 + 1lito
    find the solutions to x? = 15x + 4. Now, to end our work with Cardan, find the
    three cube roots of 2 + 117. Then, noting the discussion above, use the three cube
    roots to solve the equation x* = 15x + 4. Write your answers accurate to the nearest
    thousandth.

    . In the Problem Set for Section 8.2, we introduced Euler’s Formula, which can be
    expressed as
    
    North Wind Picture Archives/Alamy
    
    re” = r(cos@ + isin @) = rcis @
    Because the period of the sine and the cosine function is 27, we have
    rcis@ = rcis(@ + 2k7)
    for any integer &. Use this fact along with Euler’s Formula to derive the formula
    w, =r" cis (2 + 2)

    where w, is an nth root of r cis @.

    SECTION 8.5 Polar Coordinates 491
    
    In a way, the rectangular coordinate system is a map that tells us how to get any-
    where in the plane by traveling so far horizontally and so far vertically relative
    to the origin of our coordinate system. For example, to reach the point whose
    address is (2, 1), we start at the origin and travel 2 units right and then 1 unit up.
    In this section, we will see that there are other ways to get to the point (2, 1). In
    particular, we can travel √5 units on the terminal side of an angle in standard
    position. This type of map is the basis of what we call polar coordinates: The
    address of each point in the plane is given by an ordered pair (r, θ), where r is a
    directed distance on the terminal side of standard position angle θ.
    
    EXAMPLE 1 A point lies at (4, 4) on a rectangular coordinate system. Give its
    address in polar coordinates (r, θ).
    
    SOLUTION We want to reach the same point by traveling r units on the terminal side of a standard position angle θ. Figure 1 shows the point (4, 4), along with the distance r and angle θ.
    
    Figure 1
  - |-
    The triangle formed is a 45°—45°—90° right triangle. Therefore, r is 4√2,
    and θ is 45°. In rectangular coordinates, the address of our point is (4, 4). In
    polar coordinates, the address is (4√2, 45°) or (4√2, 7/4) using radians. a
    
    Now let’s formalize our ideas about polar coordinates.
    
    The foundation of the polar coordinate system is a ray called the polar axis,
    whose initial point is called the pole (Figure 2). In the polar coordinate system,
    points are named by ordered pairs (r, θ) in which r is the directed distance from
    the pole on the terminal side of an angle θ, the initial side of which is the polar
    axis. If the terminal side of θ has been rotated in a counterclockwise direction
    from the polar axis, then θ is a positive angle. Otherwise, θ is a negative angle.
    For example, the point (5, 30°) is 5 units from the pole along a ray that has been
    rotated 30° from the polar axis, as shown in Figure 3.

    The circular grids used in Example 2 are helpful when graphing points given
    in polar coordinates. The lines on the grid are multiples of 15° or π/12 radians,
    and the circles have radii of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

    Graph the points (3, 45°), (2, —477/3), (—4, 7/3), and (—5, —210°) on a polar coordinate system.
    
    **SOLUTION**
    
    To graph (3, 45°), we locate the point that is 3 units from the origin along the terminal side of 45°, as shown in Figure 4. The point (2, —477/3) is 2 units along the terminal side of —477/3, as Figure 5 indicates.

    As you can see from Figures 4 and 5, if r is positive, we locate the point (r, θ) along the terminal side of θ. The next two points we will graph have negative values of r.
    
    To graph a point (r, θ) in which r is negative, we look for the point that is |r| units in the opposite direction indicated by the terminal side of θ. That is, we extend a ray from the pole that is directly opposite the terminal side of θ and locate the point |r| units along this ray.
    
    To graph (—4, 7/3), we first extend the terminal side of θ through the origin to create a ray in the opposite direction. Then we locate the point that is 4 units from the origin along this ray, as shown in Figure 6. The terminal side of θ has been drawn in blue, and the ray pointing in the opposite direction is shown in red.

    SECTION 8.5 Polar Coordinates 493
    
    In rectangular coordinates, each point in the plane is named by a unique
    ordered pair (x, y). That is, no point can be named by two different ordered pairs.
    The same is not true of points named by polar coordinates. As Example 3 illus-
    trates, the polar coordinates of a point are not unique.
    
    \
    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Give three other ordered pairs that name the same point as
    Give three other ordered pairs that (3, 60°).
    
    name the same point as (2, 120°).
    SOLUTION As Figure 8 illustrates, the points (−3, 240°), (−3, −120°), and
    (3, −300°) all name the point (3, 60°). There are actually an infinite number of
    ordered pairs that name the point (3, 60°). Any angle that is coterminal with 60°
    will have its terminal side pass through (3, 60°). Therefore, all points of the form
    
    (3, 60° + 360°k) where k is any integer
    
    will name the point (3, 60°). Also, any angle that is coterminal with 240° can be
    used with a value of r = −3, so all points of the form
    
    (−3, 240° + 360°k) where k is any integer
    will name the point (3, 60°).

    NOTE: In Example 3, compare the ordered pairs (3, 60°) and (3, —300°). Because  
    60° — 360° = —300°, we can see that if 360° is subtracted from θ, r will be of the same  
    sign. The same will be true if 360° is added to θ. However, if 180° is added or sub-  
    tracted, r will be of the opposite sign. This can be seen with the ordered pairs  
    (—3, 240°) and (—3, —120°), since 60° + 180° = 240° and 60° — 180° = —120°.

    To derive the relationship between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates, we
    consider a point P with rectangular coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (r, θ).
    
    To convert back and forth between polar and rectangular coordinates, we
    simply use the relationships that exist among x, y, r, and θ in Figure 9.
    
    To Convert Rectangular Coordinates to Polar Coordinates
    
    r = √(x² + y²) and
    tan θ = y / x
    
    where the sign of r and the choice of θ place the point (r, θ) in the same quadrant as (x, y). 4
    
    To Convert Polar Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates
    
    The process of converting to rectangular coordinates is simply a matter of substi-
    tuting r and θ into the preceding equations. To convert to polar coordinates, we have to
    choose θ and the sign of r so the point (r, θ) is in the same quadrant as the point (x, y).

    CALCULATOR NOTE If we use the tan⁻¹ key on a calculator (set to degree mode)
    to find the angle θ in Example 5c, we will get
    
    θ = tan⁻¹(−√3) = −60°
    
    This would place the terminal side of θ in QIV. To locate our point in QII, we
    could use a negative value of r. The polar coordinates would then be (−2, −60°).

    SECTION 8.6 Equations in Polar Coordinates and Their Graphs 501  
    
    The curve, called the spiral of Archimedes, is shown in Figure 1, with a rectangular coordinate system superimposed on it so that the origin of the coordinate  
    system coincides with the initial point on the curve.  
    In rectangular coordinates, the equation  
    that describes this curve is  
    √(x² + y²) = 3 tan θ
  - |-
    If we were to superimpose a polar coordinate  
    system on the curve in Figure 1, instead of  
    the rectangular coordinate system, then the  
    
    Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS  
    
    Archimedes equation in polar coordinates that describes  
    the curve would be simply  
    —40 +  
    r= 30 Tr  
    Figure 1  
    As you can see, the equations for some curves  
    are best given in terms of polar coordinates.  
    
    In this section, we will consider the graphs of polar equations. The solutions  
    to these equations are ordered pairs (r, 8), where r and @ are the polar coordinates  
    we defined in Section 8.5.

    "PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of r = 6 sin @.
    Sketch the graph of r = 4 cos @.
    SOLUTION We can find ordered pairs (r, 0) that satisfy the equation by mak-
    ing a table. Table 1 is a little different from the ones we made for rectangular
    coordinates. With polar coordinates, we substitute convenient values for 6 and
    then use the equation to find corresponding values of r. Let’s use multiples of
    30° and 45° for 6.

    0 r= 6sin0 r (r, 0)
    0° r= 6 sin 0° = 0 0 (0, 0°)
    30° r = 6 sin 30° = 3 3 (3, 30°)
    45° r= 6sin 45° = 4.2 4.2 (4.2, 45°)
    60° r = 6 sin 60° = 5.2 5.2 (5.2, 60°)
    90° r = 6 sin 90° = 6 6 (6, 90°)
    120° r= 6sin 120° = 5.2 5.2 (5.2, 120°)
    135° r = 6sin 135° = 4.2 4.2 (4.2, 135°)
    150° r = 6sin 150° = 3 3 (3, 150°)
    180° r = 6sin 180° = 0 0 (0, 180°)
    210° r = 6 sin 210° = —3 —3 (—3, 210°)
    225° r = 6sin 225° = —4,2 —4,2 (—4.2, 225°)
    240° r = 6sin 240° = —5.2 —5.2 (—5.2, 240°)
    270° r = 6 sin 270° = —6 —~6 (—6, 270°)

    NOTE If we were to continue past 360° with values of θ, we would simply start
    
    to repeat the values of r we have already obtained, because sin θ is periodic with

    Using Technology: Creating Tables for Polar Equations
  - |-
    A graphing calculator may be used to create a table of values for a polar equation. For example, to make a table for the equation in Example 1, first set the
    calculator to degree mode and polar mode. Define the function ri = 6 sin @.
    Set up your table to automatically generate values starting at 6 = 0 and using
    an increment of 15° (Figure 3). On some calculators, this is done by setting the
    independent variable to Auto.

    Could we have found the graph of r = 6 sin 6 in Example 1 without making
    a table? The answer is yes, there are a couple of other ways to do so. One way is
    to convert to rectangular coordinates and see if we recognize the graph from the
    rectangular equation. We begin by replacing sin 6 with y/r.
  - |-
    r = 6 sin θ  
    r = 6 y sin θ ≈  
    r r  
    r = 6y Multiply both sides by r  
    
    The equation is now written in terms of rectangular coordinates. If we add −6y to both sides and then complete the square on y, we will obtain the rectangular equation of a circle with center at (0, 3) and a radius of 3.  
    
    x² + y² − 6y = 0 — Add −6y to both sides  
    x² + y² − 6y + 9 = 9 — Complete the square on y by adding 9 to both sides  
    
    x² + (y − 3)² = 9 — Standard form for the equation of a circle  
    
    This method of graphing, by changing to rectangular coordinates, works well only in some cases. Many of the equations we will encounter in polar coordinates do not have graphs that are recognizable in rectangular form.  
    
    In Example 2, we will look at another method of graphing polar equations that does not depend on the use of a table.  
    
    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of r = 4 sin 2θ.  
    Sketch the graph of r = 2 cos 2θ.  
    
    SOLUTION One way to visualize the relationship between r and θ as given by the equation r = 4 sin 2θ is to sketch the graph of y = 4 sin 2x on a rectangular coordinate system. (We have been using degree measure for our angles in polar coordinates, so we will label the x-axis for the graph of y = 4 sin 2x in degrees rather than radians as we usually do.) The graph of y = 4 sin 2x will have an amplitude of 4 and a period of 360°/2 = 180°. Figure 6 shows the graph of y = 4 sin 2x between 0° and 360°.

    If we continue to reason in this manner, we will obtain a good sketch of the
    graph of r = 4 sin 26 by watching how y is affected by changes in x on the graph

    capable of producing polar graphs. To graph the equation r = 4 sin 26 from
    Example 2, set the calculator to degree mode and polar mode, and then
    define the function ri = 4 sin (26). As shown in Example 2, we must allow
    § to vary from 0° to 360° to obtain the complete graph. Set the window

    Your graph should look similar to the one shown in Figure 10. For a more
    “true” representation of the graph, use your zoom-square command to remove
    the distortion caused by the rectangular screen (Figure 11).
    
    Figure 10 Figure 11
    
    To find points on the graph, you can use the key. Depending on
    your model of calculator, you may be able to obtain points in rectangular coor-
    dinates, polar coordinates, or both. (On the TI-84, select PolarGC in the FOR-
    MAT menu to see polar coordinates.) An added benefit of tracing the graph
    is that it reinforces the formation of the graph using the method explained in
    Example 2.
    
    You may also have a command that allows you to find a point (x, y) on the
    graph directly for a given value of 0. Figure 12 shows how this command was
    used to find the point corresponding to 6 = 112° in rectangular coordinates
    and then in polar coordinates.

    Although the method of graphing presented in Examples 2 and 3 is sometimes difficult to comprehend at first, with a little practice it becomes much easier.
    In any case, the usual alternative is to make a table and plot points until the shape of the curve can be recognized. Probably the best way to graph these equations is to use a combination of both methods.
    
    Here are some other common graphs in polar coordinates along with the equations that produce them (Figures 15-21). When you start graphing some of the equations in Problem Set 8.6, you may want to keep these graphs handy for reference. It is sometimes easier to get started when you can anticipate the general shape of the curve.

    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY
    
    For Questions | through 3, fill in the blank with an appropriate word or symbol.
    
    1. The simplest method of graphing a polar equation is to plot points by substituting
    convenient values of θ into the equation and solving for r.
    
    2. Another way to graph a polar equation is to convert it to rectangular
    and see if the resulting equation has a recognizable graph.
    
    3. A more advanced method of graphing a polar equation is to first graph a similar
    equation on a coordinate system, and then analyze the behavior to determine how the polar graph will look.
    
    4. Match each equation with its appropriate graph. Assume a and b are constants, and
    that n is a natural number.

    DEFINITIONS [8.1]  
    
    The number i is such that i² = -1. If a > 0, the expression √(-a) can be written  
    as √(a)i = i√a.  
    A complex number is any number that can be written in the form  
    a + bi  
    
    where a and b are real numbers and i² = -1. The number a is called the real part  
    of the complex number, and b is called the imaginary part. The form a + bi is  
    called standard form.  
    
    All real numbers are also complex numbers since they can be put in the form  
    a + bi, where b = 0. If a = 0 and b ≠ 0, then a + bi is called an imaginary number.  
    
    EQUALITY FOR COMPLEX NUMBERS [8.1]  
    
    Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their  
    imaginary parts are equal. That is,  
    
    a + bi = c + di if and only if a = c and b = d  
    
    OPERATIONS ON COMPLEX NUMBERS IN STANDARD FORM [8.1]  
    
    If z₁ = a + bi and z₂ = c + di are two complex numbers in standard form, then  
    the following definitions and operations apply.  
    
    Addition  
    Add real parts; add imaginary parts.  
    Subtraction  
    z₁ - z₂ = (a - c) + (b - d)i  
    
    Subtract real parts; subtract imaginary parts.  
    Multiplication  
    z₁ × z₂ = (a × c - b × d) + (a × d + b × c)i
  - |-
    21Z_ = (yay — byby) + (ayby + agby)i  
    In actual practice, simply multiply as you would multiply two binomials.  
    
    Conjugates  
    The conjugate of a + bi is a — bi. Their product is the real number a’ + b’.  
    
    Division  
    Multiply the numerator and denominator of the quotient by the conjugate of the  
    denominator.

    PRODUCTS AND QUOTIENTS IN TRIGONOMETRIC FORM [8.3]
    
    If z1 = r1(cos θ1 + i sin θ1) and z2 = r2(cos θ2 + i sin θ2) are two complex numbers
    in trigonometric form, then their product is
    
    z1*z2 = r1*r2[cos (θ1 + θ2) + i sin (θ1 + θ2)] = r1*r2 cis (θ1 + θ2)
    and their quotient is
    
    z1/z2 = (r1/r2)[cos (θ1 - θ2) + i sin (θ1 - θ2)] = (r1/r2) cis (θ1 - θ2)
    
    If z = √2 cis 30°,
    then
    z^2 = (√2)^2 cis (10 + 30°)

    DE MOIVRE’S THEOREM [8.3]
    
    If z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) is a complex number in trigonometric form and n is an
    integer, then
    
    z^n = r^n (cos nθ + i sin nθ) = r^n cis (nθ)

    The n nth roots of the complex number z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) are given by the
    
    formula

    where k = 0,1, 2,...,n − 1. If using radians, replace 360° with 2π.

    The ordered pair (r, θ) names the point that is r units from the origin along the

    GROUP PROJECT
    Intersections of Polar Graphs
    
    OBJECTIVE: To find the points of intersection
    of two polar graphs.
  - |-
    On July 16, 1994, Comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter (Figure 1). Potential
    collisions between planets and comets are
    found by identifying any intersection points
    in their orbits. These orbits are typically
    described using polar equations.
    
    In Sections 8.5 and 8.6 we learned about
    the polar coordinate system and how to
    graph equations in polar coordinates. One of
    the things we might need to know about the graphs is if they have any points of
    intersection. In this project you will learn how to find these points.
    
    First, we will find the points of intersection of the graphs of the polar equations
    r=1 and r=1+cosθ.
    
    EM We can approach the problem as a system of two equations in two variables.
    Using the substitution method, we can replace r in the second equation with
    the value 1 (from the first equation) to obtain an equation in just one variable:
    
    1=1+cosθ
    
    Solve this equation for θ, if 0 ≤ θ < 2π. Then use your values of θ to find the
    corresponding values of r. Write your results as ordered pairs (r, θ).
    
    M1 Verify your results from Question 1 graphically. Sketch the graph of both
    equations on the same polar coordinate system. How many points of inter-
    section are there? Did you find them all using the substitution method in
    Question 1?
    
    Next, we will find the points of intersection of the graphs of the polar equations
    r=3sinθ and r=1+sinθ.
    
    E] Use the substitution method to find any points of intersection for the two
    equations, if 0 ≤ θ < 2π. Write your results as ordered pairs (r, θ).

    Based on your observations of the graphs, try to explain why you were not able to find one of the intersection points using the substitution method.
    You may find it helpful to keep in mind that each point in the plane has more than one different representation in polar coordinates. Write your explanation in a paragraph or two.

    Complex Numbers
    
    As was mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Jerome Cardan (Girolamo Cardano) was unable to solve certain equations because he did not know how to interpret the square root of a negative number. His work set the stage for the arrival of complex numbers.
    
    Research the history of complex numbers. How were the works of Rafael Bombelli, Jean Robert Argand, Leonhard Euler, and Abraham de Moivre significant in the development of complex numbers? Write a paragraph or two about your findings.

    Appendix:
    Review Topics
    
    Introduction
    
    In the United States, temperature is usually measured in terms of degrees Fahrenheit;
    however, most European countries prefer to measure temperature in degrees Celsius.
    Table 1 shows some temperatures measured using both systems.
    
    TABLE 1
    °C Degrees Celsius (°C) Degrees Fahrenheit (°F)
    0 32
    3 25 77
    2 40 104
    100 212
    
    The relationship between these two systems of temperature measurement can be writ-
    ten in the form of an equation:
    F = (9/5)C + 32
    
    Every temperature measured in °C is associated with a unique measure in °F. We
    call this kind of relationship a function. In this appendix we will review the con-
    cept of a function, and see how in many cases a function may be “reversed.” First,
    though, we will review some concepts from algebra and geometry.

    522. APPENDIXA Bf Review Topics
    
    In this first Appendix section we will review many of the skills from algebra that
    are used throughout the text. You may find it helpful to work through this entire
    section at the very start of your trigonometry course, or you may want to refer
    to this section as needed to refresh your memory on specific skills as they arise
    in the text.
    
    Fractions and Unit Conversion
    
    Here is a brief summary of the rules for working with fractions.
    
    Operations with Fractions
    
    Multiplication: Multiply numerators and multiply denominators. You do not
    need a common denominator when multiplying fractions.
    Division: Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.
    
    Addition and subtraction: Write both fractions as equivalent fractions having a
    common denominator. Then add or subtract numerators and keep the common denominator.
    
    EXAMPLE 1 Divide:
    
    SOLUTION We multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second, and
    then reduce if possible.
    
    3/5 ÷ 2/4 = 3/5 × 4/2 = (3×4)/(5×2) = 12/10 = 6/5
    
    EXAMPLE 2 Simplify:
    
    a. The least common denominator (LCD) is 6.
    
    x/2 - x/7 = (3x/6 - 2x/6) = (3x - 2x)/6 = x/6
    
    SOLUTION
    
    a. The least common denominator (LCD) is 6.
    
    x/2 - x/7 = (3x/6 - 2x/6) = (3x - 2x)/6 = x/6
    
    b. The least common denominator (LCD) is 12.
    
    3a/4 + a/6 = (9a/12 + 2a/12) = (9a + 2a)/12 = 11a/12
    
    c. The least common denominator (LCD) is 30.
    
    5b/6 - 2b/15 = (25b/30 - 4b/30) = (25b - 4b)/30 = 21b/30 = 7b/10
    
    d. The least common denominator (LCD) is 24.
    
    x/8 + x/12 = (3x/24 + 2x/24) = (3x + 2x)/24 = 5x/24

    A complex fraction is a rational expression whose numerator or denominator
    contains fractions. We can simplify a complex fraction by using the LCD to clear
    denominators of all fractions appearing in the rational expression.

    To convert from one unit of measure to another, we multiply by the appro-
    priate fraction (an equivalent form of the number 1) so that the units reduce,
    leaving us with the desired unit of measure.

    Radical Expressions
    
    When working with expressions involving square roots, we often make use of the
    following properties.

    Sometimes we prefer not to leave a radical expression in the denominator of
    a fraction. When the denominator contains a square root, we can clear the radical
    by rationalizing the denominator as shown in the following example.

    Linear Equations and Inequalities
    
    With linear equations and inequalities, we use the addition and multiplication
    properties of equality to isolate the variable. When solving inequalities, we must
    remember to reverse the inequality symbol anytime we multiply or divide both
    sides of the inequality by a negative number.

    Quadratic Equations
    
    A quadratic equation is any equation that can be expressed as ax* + bx + c = 0.
    We call this standard form. There are a number of ways to solve a quadratic equa-
    tion. In many cases the left side of the equation can be factored, allowing us to use
    the zero-product property.

    EXAMPLE 15 Solve. Approximate solutions to the nearest hundredth.
    a. 2x^7 + 2x = 1 b. 2x^4 — 4x^2 + 1 = 0
    SOLUTION
    a. 2x^7 + 2x = 1 Original equation
    2x^7 + 2x - 1 = 0 Write in standard form
    Using the quadratic formula:
    - b ± √(b^2 - 4ac) = (-2)^2 - 4*2*(-1)
    = -2 ± √(4 + 8)
    = -2 ± √12
    = -2 ± 2√3
    = -1 + √3 or -1 - √3

    = -1.37 or 0.37 Approximate
    b. 2x^4 — 4x^2 + 1 = 0 Original equation
    2x^4 - 4x^2 + 1 = 0 Substitute u = x^2 and v = x^4
    Now we can use the quadratic formula and solve for u.
    -(-4) ± √((-4)^2 - 4*2*1)
    = 2*2
    = 4 ± √(16 - 8)
    = 4 ± √8
    = 4 ± 2√2
    = 0.29 or 1.71 Approximate
    We substitute back and then solve for the original variable x.
    u = 0.29 or u ≈ 1.71 Approximate values of u
    x^2 = 0.29 or x ≈ 1.71 Substitute back for x
    x = ±√0.29 or x ≈ ±√1.71 Square root property
    x ≈ ±0.54 or x ≈ ±1.31 Approximate
    
    Rational Equations
    
    When solving equations containing fractions where the variable appears in one
    or more denominators, we can clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the
    equation by the least common denominator (LCD). However, this can introduce
    extraneous solutions, so we must always check that our answers actually satisfy
    the original equation.

    In Section 1.1 we introduce angles and triangles, review their different classifications, and highlight a few of the important relationships involving these figures.
    In this section we will briefly summarize a number of other main concepts and theorems from geometry. Some of these concepts are referred to at various points in the text. Others can be very helpful when setting up diagrams that are necessary for solving application problems.
    
    Elementary Definitions
    
    A point denotes an exact location in space. A point has no dimension. A line is a collection of points along a straight path that extends endlessly in both directions. A line segment is the part of a line extending between two endpoints (see Figure 1). Two lines are parallel if they lie in the same plane but do not intersect.

    Ray AB the vertex of the angle, as shown in Figure 2.
    
    Two angles are complementary if the sum of their measures is 90°. If the
    
    C sum of their measures is 180°, then they are said to be supplementary. If placed
    
    adjacent to each other, complementary angles form a right angle and supplementary

    Angle ZCAB
    
    Figure 2 Vertical Angles
    
    When two lines or line segments intersect in a single point, they form pairs of
    equal angles, called vertical angles, which lie opposite one another. In Figure 3, the
    two pairs of vertical angles are A = Cand B= D.
    
    Figure 3
  - |-
    In Figure 3, any two adjacent angles are supplementary. For example, A and B are
    supplementary angles. Also, A + B+ C + D = 360°.
    
    Parallel Lines Crossed by a Transversal
    
    Figure 4 shows two parallel lines, AB and CD, which are crossed by a transversal
    line EF. Eight angles are formed as a result.
    
    Figure 4
    
    The four pairs of vertical angles are ∠1 = ∠2, ∠2 = ∠3, ∠5 = ∠8, and
    ∠6 = ∠7. There are also four pairs of corresponding angles that are equal; these
    are ∠1 = ∠5, ∠2 = ∠6, ∠3 = ∠7, and ∠4 = ∠8. In addition, there are two
    pairs of alternate interior angles that are equal, namely ∠3 = ∠6 and ∠4 = ∠5,
    and two pairs of alternate exterior angles that are equal, being ∠1 = ∠8 and
    ∠2 = ∠7. Finally, the consecutive interior angles ∠3 and ∠5 are supplementary,
    as are ∠4 and ∠6.

    a. Z1 and 43 are supplementary, therefore

    = 180°- 125°
    = 55°
    b. 21 and 74 are vertical angles, so

    EXAMPLE 2 Find, angles 4, B, and ACB shown in Figure 5. Assume AB and
    the dashed line are both vertical.
    
    SOLUTION Because AC is a transversal crossing parallel lines, A and the 45°
    angle are alternate interior angles. Therefore 4 = 45°. Likewise, BC is also a
    transversal crossing the same two parallel lines, so B = 60°. Finally, ACB is
    supplementary to 60° + 45° = 105°, so that
    
    Z ACB = 180° — 105° = 75° a
    
    Triangles
    
    Figure 5
    
    A triangle is a three-sided polygon. The different classifications of triangles are
    given in Section 1.1. In any triangle, the smallest angle will lie opposite the shortest
    side, and the largest angle will lie opposite the longest side. We also have the
    following theorem that applies to all triangles.
    
    Triangle Theorem
    
    In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is 180°.
    
    Congruent Triangles
    
    If two triangles are identical, they are said to be congruent. To be congruent, all
    three corresponding sides and all three corresponding angles must be equal.

    Similar Triangles
    
    If all three corresponding angles of two triangles are equal, then the triangles are
    said to be similar. Similar triangles have the same shape but not necessarily the
    same size. Figure 11 shows two similar triangles. We write AABC ~ ADEF.
  - |-
    A Cc D F  
    Figure 11  
    
    With similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional. Looking at Fig-  
    ure 11, this implies that  
    
    $$
    \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{AC}{DE} = \frac{DF}{EF}
    $$  
    
    **EXAMPLE 3** In Figure 12, AB is parallel to CD. Solve for x.  
    
    Figure 12  
    
    **SOLUTION** Consider triangles ABE and CDE. Because AB is parallel to CD,  
    ∠BAE and ∠DCE are corresponding angles and are therefore equal. Likewise,  
    ∠ABE and ∠CDE are corresponding angles and must be equal as well. Since  
    ∠E is common to both triangles, △ABE ~ △CDE. Thus, we have  
    
    **NOTE** In Example 3 we could also  
    have used the proportion $\frac{AE}{AB} = \frac{CE}{CD}$  
    Corresponding sides are proportional  
    $$
    \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AE}{CE}
    $$  
    $$
    \frac{x+14}{10} = \frac{14}{8}
    $$  
    Substitute known values  
    $$
    \frac{x+14}{10} = \frac{14}{8}
    $$  
    $$
    8(x + 14) = 14(10) \quad \text{Cross-multiplication}
    $$  
    $$
    8x + 112 = 140 \quad \text{Distribute}
    $$  
    $$
    8x = 28 \quad \text{Subtract 112}
    $$  
    $$
    x = 3.5 \quad \text{Divide by 8}

    **SECTION A.2 Basic Review of Geometry 539**
    
    **Pythagorean Theorem**
  - |-
    A right triangle is a triangle containing one right angle (measuring 90°). In
    Section 1.1 we introduce the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that for any
    right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of
    the two legs. Given right triangle ABC with C = 90°, this would be expressed as
    c² = a² + b² (see Figure 13).
    
    There are many ways to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. The Group Project
    at the end of Chapter 1 introduces several of these ways. The method that we are
    offering here is based on the diagram shown in Figure 14 and the formula for the
    area of a triangle. Figure 14 is constructed by taking the right triangle in the lower
    right corner and repeating it three times so that the final diagram is a square in
    which each side has length a + b.
    
    To derive the relationship between a, b, and c, we simply notice that the area
    of the large square is equal to the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the
    inner square. In symbols we have
    
    Area of large Area of four Area of inner
    Square triangles square
    1
    (a + b)² = 4*(1/2)*a*b + (c)²
    
    We expand the left side using the formula for the square of a binomial, from
    algebra. We simplify the right side by multiplying 4 by 1/2.
    
    a² + 2ab + b² = 2ab + c²
    
    Adding −2ab to each side, we have the relationship we are after:
    
    a² + b² = c²
    
    Circles
    
    We conclude our geometry review with a few facts about circles. In Section 1.2 we
    state the definition of a circle and provide the formula for a circle that has been
    placed onto a coordinate system. For any circle, the ratio of the circumference (pe-
    rimeter of the circle) to the diameter (twice the radius) is always the same value,
    which we define to be π. This leads to the following formulas.
    
    Circumference and Area of a Circle
    
    Circumference = πd = 2πr
    
    Area = πr²

    540 APPENDIX A Review Topics
    
    EXAMPLE 4 Find the area of a circle having a circumference of 127
    centimeters.
    
    SOLUTION First, we find the diameter. Because the circumference is 12π = πd,
    we have d = 12. The radius is half the diameter, so r = 6. Therefore, the area is
    π(6)^2 = 36π ≈ 113.1 square centimeters.

    An Informal Look at Functions
    
    To begin with, suppose you have a job that pays $7.50 per hour and that you work
    anywhere from 0 to 40 hours per week. The amount of money you make in one week
    depends on the number of hours you work that week. In mathematics we say that

    your weekly earnings are a function of the number of hours you work. If we let the
    variable x represent hours and the variable y represent the money you make, then
    
    the relationship between x and y can be written as
    
    y=7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40
    
    EXAMPLE 1 Construct a table and graph for the function
    y=7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40

    y = 7.5x. Figure 1 is the graph of the equation with the restriction 0 ≤ x ≤ 40.

    The equation y = 7.5x with the restriction 0 ≤ x ≤ 40, Table 1, and Fig-
    ure 1 are three ways to describe the same relationship between the number of
    hours you work in one week and your gross pay for that week. In all three, we
    input values of x and then use the function rule to output values of y.

    Domain and Range of a Function
  - |-
    We began this discussion by saying that the number of hours worked during the
    week was from 0 to 40, so these are the values that x can assume. From the line
    graph in Figure 1, we see that the values of y range from 0 to 300. We call the
    complete set of values that x can assume the domain of the function. The values
    that are assigned to y are called the range of the function.

    A Formal Look at Functions
    
    What is apparent from the preceding discussion is that we are working with paired
    data. The solutions to the equation y = 7.5x are pairs of numbers, and the points on
    the line graph in Figure 1 come from paired data. We are now ready for the formal
    definition of a function.

    Definition = Function
    
    A function is a rule that pairs each element in one set, called the domain, with
    exactly one element from a second set, called the range. y
    
    In other words, a function is a rule for which each input is paired with exactly
    one output.
    
    Functions as Ordered Pairs
    
    The function rule y = 7.5x from Example 1 produces ordered pairs of numbers
    (x, y). The same thing happens with all functions: The function rule produces
    ordered pairs of numbers. We use this result to write an alternative definition for
    a function.

    SOLUTION Without going into much detail, we graph the equation x = y by
    finding a number of ordered pairs that satisfy the equation, plotting these points,
    then drawing a smooth curve that connects them. Some values for x and y that satisfy
    the equation are given in Table 2, and the graph of x = y’ is shown in Figure 7.

    From the previous example, we see that some sets of paired data fail to qualify as functions. So, we need some additional language to refer to relationships in general. To classify all relationships specified by ordered pairs, whether they are functions or not, we include the following two definitions.
    
    Definition: Relation
    
    A relation is a rule that pairs each element in one set, called the domain, with one or more elements from a second set, called the range.
    
    Notice that the definition of a relation does not impose any condition on how the pairs of elements are assigned.
    We can also think of a relation as the set of ordered pairs themselves.
    
    Alternative Definition
    
    A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of all first coordinates is the domain of the relation. The set of all second coordinates is the range of the relation.
    
    Here are some facts that will help clarify the distinction between relations and functions.
    
    1. Any rule that assigns numbers from one set to numbers in another set is a relation. If that rule makes the assignment so that no input has more than one output, then it is also a function.
    
    2. Any set of ordered pairs is a relation. If none of the first coordinates of those ordered pairs is repeated, the set of ordered pairs is also a function.
    
    3. Every function is a relation.
    
    4. Not every relation is a function.
    
    Vertical Line Test
    
    Look at the graph shown in Figure 7. The reason this graph is the graph of a relation, but not of a function, is that some points on the graph have the same first coordinates—for example, the points (4, 2) and (4, —2). Furthermore, any time two points on a graph have the same first coordinates, those points must lie on a vertical line. This allows us to write the following test that uses the graph to determine whether a relation is also a function.
    
    Vertical Line Test
    
    If a vertical line crosses the graph of a relation in more than one place, the relation cannot be a function. If no vertical line can be found that crosses a graph in more than one place, then the graph is the graph of a function.

    SOLUTION We let x take on values of —4, —3, —2, —1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The
    corresponding values of y are shown in Table 3. The graph is shown in Figure 8.

    {y|y = 0}. ud
    
    Function Notation
    
    Let’s return to the discussion that introduced us to functions. If a job pays $7.50
    per hour for working from 0 to 40 hours a week, then the amount of money y
    earned in one week is a function of the number of hours worked, x. The exact
    relationship between x and y is written
    
    y=7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40
    
    Because the amount of money earned y depends on the number of hours worked
    x, we call y the dependent variable and x the independent variable. Furthermore, if
    we let f represent all the ordered pairs produced by the equation, then we can write
    
    f= {(x, y) | y = 7.5x and 0 ≤ x ≤ 40}
  - |-
    Once we have named a function with a letter, we can use an alternative notation to represent the dependent variable y. The alternative notation for y is f(x). It is read "f of x" and can be used instead of the variable y when working with functions.
    
    The notation y and the notation f(x) are equivalent—that is,
    
    y = 71.5x ==> f(x) = 7.5x
    
    When we use the notation f(x) we are using function notation. The benefit of using function notation is that we can write more information with fewer symbols than we can by using just the variable y. For example, asking how much money a person will make for working 20 hours is simply a matter of asking for f(20). Without function notation, we would have to say "find the value of y that corresponds to a value of x = 20." To illustrate further, using the variable y we can say "y is 150 when x is 20." Using the notation f(x), we simply say "f(20) = 150." Each expression indicates that you will earn $150 for working 20 hours.

    EXAMPLE 5 If f(x) = 3x² + 2x — 1, find f(0), f(3), and f(—2).
    SOLUTION Because f(x) = 3x² + 2x — 1, we have
    f(0) = 3(0)² + 2(0) — 1
    =0+0-1
    =-1
    f(3) = 3(3)² + 2(3) — 1
    =27+6-1
    = 32
    f(—2) = 3(-2)² + 2(-2) — 1
    =12-4-1
    
    In Example 5, the function f is defined by the equation f(x) = 3x² + 2x — 1.
    We could just as easily have said y = 3x² + 2x — 1; that is, y = f(x). Saying
    f(—2) = 7 is exactly the same as saying y is 7 when x is —2.
    
    Function Notation and Graphs
    
    We can visualize the relationship between x and f(x) on the graph of the function.
    Figure 9 shows the graph of f(x) = 7.5x along with two additional line segments.
    The horizontal line segment corresponds to x = 20, and the vertical line segment
    corresponds to f(20). (Note that the domain is restricted to 0 ≤ x ≤ 40.)

    Using Function Notation
    
    The final example in this section shows how to use and interpret function notation.
    
    EXAMPLE 6 A painting is purchased as an investment for $125. If its value increases continuously so that it doubles every 5 years, then its value is given by the function
    
    V(t) = 125 * 2^t
    where t is the number of years since the painting was purchased, and V(t) is its value (in dollars) at time t. Find V(5) and V(10), and explain what they mean.
    
    SOLUTION The expression V (5) is the value of the painting when t = 5 (5 years after it is purchased). We calculate V (5) by substituting 5 for t in the equation V(t) = 125 * 2^t. Here is our work:
    
    V(5) = 125 * 2^5 = 125 * 32 = 4000
    In words: After 5 years, the painting is worth $4000.
    The expression V(10) is the value of the painting after 10 years. To find this number, we substitute 10 for t in the equation:
    V(10) = 125 * 2^10 = 125 * 1024 = 128000
    In words: The value of the painting 10 years after it is purchased is $128000.
    The fact that V(5) = 4000 means that the ordered pair (5, 4000) belongs to the function V. Likewise, the fact that V(10) = 128000 tells us that the ordered pair (10, 128000) is a member of function V. 
    
    We can generalize the discussion at the end of Example 6 this way:
    (a,b) ∈ f if and only if f(a)=b

    After reading through the preceding section, respond in your own words and in complete sentences.
    
    What is a function?
    A function is a relation where each input has exactly one output.
    
    What is the vertical line test?
    The vertical line test is a method used to determine if a graph represents a function. If any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a function.
    
    Explain what you are calculating when you find f(2) for a given function f.
    When you find f(2) for a given function f, you are calculating the output of the function when the input is 2.
    
    If f(2) = 3 for a function f, what is the relationship between the numbers 2 and 3 and the graph of f?
    If f(2) = 3 for a function f, then the point (2, 3) is on the graph of f.

    Learning Objectives
    
    Find the equation of the inverse of a function.

    Use the horizontal line test to determine if a function is one-to-one.

    The diagram in Figure 1 shows the route Justin takes to school. He leaves his
    home and drives 3 miles east and then turns left and drives 2 miles north. When
    he leaves school to drive home, he drives the same two segments but in the
    reverse order and the opposite direction; that is, he drives 2 miles south, turns
    right, and drives 3 miles west. When he arrives home from school, he is right
    where he started. His route home “undoes” his route to school, leaving him
    where he began.

    As you will see, the relationship between a function and its inverse function  
    is similar to the relationship between Justin’s route from home to school and his  
    route from school to home.
    
    Suppose the function $ f $ is given by
    
    $$
    f = \{(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7)\}
    $$
    
    The inverse of $ f $ is obtained by reversing the order of the coordinates in each or-  
    dered pair in $ f $. The inverse of $ f $ is the relation given by
    
    $$
    g = \{(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7)\}
    $$
    
    It is obvious that the domain of $ f $ is now the range of $ g $, and the range of $ f $ is now  
    the domain of $ g $. Every function (or relation) has an inverse that is obtained from  
    the original function by interchanging the components of each ordered pair.

    Definition: Inverse of a Relation  
    
    The inverse of a relation is found by interchanging the coordinates in each  
    ordered pair that is an element of the relation. That is, if $ (a, b) $ is an element of  
    the relation, then $ (b, a) $ is an element of the inverse.  
    
    Suppose a function $ f $ is defined with an equation instead of a list of ordered  
    pairs. We can obtain the equation of the inverse of $ f $ by interchanging the role of  
    $ x $ and $ y $ in the equation for $ f $.  
    
    EXAMPLE 1 If the function $ f $ is defined by $ f(x) = 2x - 3 $, find the equation  
    that represents the inverse of $ f $.  
    SOLUTION Because the inverse of $ f $ is obtained by interchanging the compo-  
    nents of all the ordered pairs belonging to $ f $; and each ordered pair in $ f $ satisfies  
    the equation $ y = 2x - 3 $, we simply exchange $ x $ and $ y $ in the equation  
    $ y = 2x - 3 $ to get the formula for the inverse of $ f $:
  - |-
    x=2y—3  
    We now solve this equation for y in terms of x:  
    
    x+3=2y  
    x+3  
    > y  
    x + 3  
    
    a >  
    The last line gives the equation that defines the inverse of f. Let’s compare the  
    graphs of f and its inverse (see Figure 2).  
    
    y  
    Figure 2  
    The graphs of fand its inverse have symmetry about the line y = x. We say  
    
    that the graph of the inverse is a reflection of the graph of fabout the line y = x.  
    This is a reasonable result because the one function was obtained from the other  
    by interchanging x and y in the equation. The ordered pairs (a, b ) and (0, a)  
    always have symmetry about the line y = x. a

    SOLUTION We can obtain the graph of the inverse of y = x* — 2 by graphing  
    y = x? — 2 by the usual methods and then reflecting the graph about the line  
    y = x (Figure 3).

    by interchanging x and y to get x = y? — 2.  
    We can solve the equation x = y? — 2 for y in terms of x as follows:

    Using Technology: Graphing an Inverse
    
    One way to graph a function and its inverse is to use parametric equations,
    which we cover in more detail in Section 6.4. To graph the function y = x” — 2
    and its inverse from Example 2, first set your graphing calculator to parametric
    mode. Then define the following set of parametric equations (Figure 4).
    
    Xi = t; Yr = t^2 - 2
    Set the window variables so that
    -3 ≤ t ≤ 3, step = 0.05; -4 ≤ x ≤ 4, -4 ≤ y ≤ 4
    
    Graph the function using the zoom-square command. Your graph should look
    similar to Figure 5.

    560 APPENDIX A Review Topics
    
    Figure 5 Figure 6
    
    To graph the inverse, we need to interchange the roles of x and y for
    the original function. This is easily done by defining a new set of parametric
    equations that is just the reverse of the pair given above:
    
    X2 = t^2 - 2, Y2 = t
    Press | GRAPH | again, and you should now see the graphs of the original
    function and its inverse (Figure 6). If you trace to any point on either graph,
    you can alternate between the two curves to see how the coordinates of the
    
    corresponding ordered pairs compare. As Figure 7 illustrates, the coordinates
    of a point on one graph are reversed for the other graph.
    
    X1T = T Y1T = T^2 - 2
    X2T = T^2 - 2 Y2T = T
    
    T = 2 T = 2
    
    X = 2 Y = 2 X = 2 Y = 2
    Figure 7
  - |-
    Comparing the graphs from Examples 1 and 2, we observe that the inverse of a function is not always a function. In Example 1, both f and its inverse have graphs that are nonvertical straight lines and therefore both represent functions. In Example 2, the inverse of function f is not a function because a vertical line crosses it in more than one place.
    
    One-to-One Functions
    
    We can distinguish between those functions with inverses that are also functions and those functions with inverses that are not functions with the following definition.
    
    Definition: One-to-One Function
    
    A function is a one-to-one function if every element in the range comes from exactly one element in the domain. y
    
    This definition indicates that a one-to-one function will yield a set of ordered pairs in which no two different ordered pairs have the same second coordinates. For example, the function
    
    F = {(2, 3), (−1, 3), (5, 8)}
    
    is not one-to-one because the element 3 in the range comes from both 2 and −1 in the domain. On the other hand, the function
    
    g = {(6, 7), (−1, −1), (4, 2)}
    
    is a one-to-one function because every element in the range comes from only one element in the domain.
    
    Horizontal Line Test
    
    If we have the graph of a function, we can determine if the function is one-to-one with the following test. If a horizontal line crosses the graph of a function in more than one place, then the function is not a one-to-one function because the points at which the horizontal line crosses the graph will be points with the same y-coordinates but different x-coordinates. Therefore, the function will have an element in the range that comes from more than one element in the domain.
  - |-
    Functions Whose Inverses Are Functions
    
    Because one-to-one functions do not repeat second coordinates, when we reverse
    the order of the ordered pairs in a one-to-one function, we obtain a relation in
    which no two ordered pairs have the same first coordinate—by definition, this
    relation must be a function. In other words, every one-to-one function has an
    inverse that is itself a function. Because of this, we can use function notation to
    represent that inverse.
    
    Inverse Function Notation
    
    If y = f(x) is a one-to-one function, then the inverse of f is also a function and
    can be denoted by y = f⁻¹(x). 
    
    NOTE The notation f⁻¹ does not represent the reciprocal of f; that is, the −1
    in this notation is not an exponent. The notation f⁻¹ is defined as representing the inverse
    function for a one-to-one function. However, the inverse of the function in Example 2 is not itself a function, so we
    do not use the notation f⁻¹(x) to represent it.
    
    EXAMPLE 3 Find the inverse of g(x) = −4/x−2.
    
    SOLUTION To find the inverse for g, we begin by replacing g(x) with y to
    obtain
    
    y = −4/(x−2)
    
    To find an equation for the inverse, we exchange x and y.

    As we mentioned in the introduction to this section, one of the important  
    relationships between a function and its inverse is that an inverse undoes, or re-  
    verses, whatever actions were performed by the function.

    reversed, returning us to our original input x. a

    Functions, Relations, and Inverses—A Summary  
    Here is a summary of some of the things we know about functions, relations, and  
    their inverses:  
    
    1. Every function is a relation, but not every relation is a function.  
    
    2. Every function has an inverse, but only one-to-one functions have inverses  
    that are also functions.  
    
    3. The domain of a function is the range of its inverse, and the range of a  
    function is the domain of its inverse.  
    
    4. If y = f(x) is a one-to-one function, then we can use the notation y = f!(x)  
    to represent its inverse function.  
    
    5. The graph of a function and its inverse are reflections of each other about  
    the line y = x.  
    
    6. If the ordered pair (a, b) belongs to the function f/f, then the ordered pair  
    (b, a) belongs to its inverse.  
    
    7. The inverse of f will undo, or reverse, the actions performed by /-

    Then, to find the inverse, simply apply the inverse operations, in reverse order, to the
    variable x:
    
    a. Subtract 2.
    
    b. Divide by 3.

    For some of the problems in the early part of this problem set we will give the complete proof. Remember, however, that there is often
    more than one way to prove an identity. You may have a correct proof even if it doesn’t match the one you find here. As the problem set
    progresses, we will give hints on how to begin the proof instead of the complete proof. Solutions to problems not shown are given in the
