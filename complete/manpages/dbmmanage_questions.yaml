Resources available from the Apache HTTP server can be\n       restricted to just the users listed in the files created by dbmmanage.\n       This program can only be used when the usernames are stored in a DBM\n       file. To use a flat-file database see htpasswd.\n\n\n       Another tool to maintain a DBM password database is htdbm.\n\n\n       This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details of\n       the directives necessary to configure user authentication in httpd see\n       the httpd manual, which is part of the Apache distribution or can be\n       found at http://httpd.apache.org/."

    BUGS
           One should be aware that there are a number of different DBM file
           formats in existence, and with all likelihood, libraries for more than
           one format may exist on your system. The three primary examples are
           SDBM, NDBM, the GNU project's GDBM, and Berkeley DB 2. Unfortunately,
           all these libraries use different file formats, and you must make sure
           that the file format used by filename is the same format that dbmmanage
           expects to see. dbmmanage currently has no way of determining what type
           of DBM file it is looking at. If used against the wrong format, will
           simply return nothing, or may create a different DBM file with a
           different name, or at worst, it may corrupt the DBM file if you were
           attempting to write to it.


           dbmmanage has a list of DBM format preferences, defined by the
           @AnyDBM::ISA array near the beginning of the program. Since we prefer
           the Berkeley DB 2 file format, the order in which dbmmanage will look
           for system libraries is Berkeley DB 2, then NDBM, then GDBM and then
           SDBM. The first library found will be the library dbmmanage will
           attempt to use for all DBM file transactions. This ordering is slightly
           different than the standard @AnyDBM::ISA ordering in Perl, as well as
           the ordering used by the simple dbmopen() call in Perl, so if you use
           any other utilities to manage your DBM files, they must also follow
           this preference ordering. Similar care must be taken if using programs
           in other languages, like C, to access these files.
