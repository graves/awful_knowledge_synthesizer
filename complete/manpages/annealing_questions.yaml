It is described in some detail on the\n       Wiki http://wiki.tcl.tk/.... The idea is simple:\n\n       •      randomly select points within a given search space\n\n       •      evaluate the function to be optimised for each of these points\n\t      and select the point that has the lowest (or highest) function\n\t      value or - sometimes - accept a point that has a less optimal\n\t      value. The chance by which such a non-optimal point is accepted\n\t      diminishes over time.\n\n       •      Accepting less optimal points means the method does not\n\t      necessarily get stuck in a local optimum and theoretically it is\n\t      capable of finding the global optimum within the search space.\n\n       The method resembles the cooling of material, hence the name.\n\n       The package simulation::annealing offers the command findMinimum:\n\n\t   puts [::simulation::annealing::findMinimum  -trials 300  -parameters {x -5.0 5.0 y -5.0 5.0}  -function {$x*$x+$y*$y+sin(10.0*$x)+4.0*cos(20.0*$y)}]\n\n       prints the estimated minimum value of the function f(x,y) =\n       x**2+y**2+sin(10*x)+4*cos(20*y) and the values of x and y where the\n       minimum was attained:\n\n       result -4.9112922923 x -0.181647676593 y 0.155743646974"

The\n\t      function and the method's parameters is given via a list of\n\t      keyword-value pairs.\n\n\t      int n  List of keyword-value pairs, all of which are available\n\t\t     during the execution via the getOption command.\n\n       ::simulation::annealing::findCombinatorialMinimum args\n\t      Find the minimum of a function of discrete variables using\n\t      simulated annealing. The function and the method's parameters is\n\t      given via a list of keyword-value pairs.\n\n\t      int n  List of keyword-value pairs, all of which are available\n\t\t     during the execution via the getOption command.\n\n       The findMinimum command predefines the following options:\n\n       •      -parameters list: triples defining parameters and ranges\n\n       •      -function expr: expression defining the function\n\n       •      -code body: body of code to define the function (takes\n\t      precedence over -function). The code should set the variable\n\t      \"result\"\n\n       •      -init code: code to be run at start up -final code: code to be\n\t      run at the end -trials n: number of trials before reducing the\n\t      temperature -reduce factor: reduce the temperature by this\n\t      factor (between 0 and 1) -initial-temp t: initial temperature\n\t      -scale s: scale of the function (order of magnitude of the\n\t      values) -estimate-scale y/n: estimate the scale (only if -scale\n\t      is not present) -verbose y/n: print detailed information on\n\t      progress to the report file (1) or not (0) -reportfile file:\n\t      opened file to print to (defaults to stdout)\n\n       Any other options can be used via the getOption procedure in the body.\n       The findCombinatorialMinimum command predefines the following options:\n\n       •      -number-params n: number of binary parameters (the solution\n\t      space consists of lists of 1s and 0s). This is a required\n\t      option.\n\n       •      -initial-values: list of 1s and 0s constituting the start of the\n\t      search.\n\n       The other predefined options are identical to those of findMinimum.\n\nTIPS\n       The procedure findMinimum works by constructing a temporary procedure\n       that does the actual work. It loops until the point representing the\n       estimated optimum does not change anymore within the given number of\n       trials. As the temperature gets lower and lower the chance of accepting\n       a point with a higher value becomes lower too, so the procedure will in\n       practice terminate.\n\n       It is possible to optimise over a non-rectangular region, but some care\n       must be taken:\n\n       •      If the point is outside the region of interest, you can specify\n\t      a very high value.\n\n       •      This does mean that the automatic determination of a scale\n\t      factor is out of the question - the high function values that\n\t      force the point inside the region would distort the estimation.\n\n       Here is an example of finding an optimum inside a circle:\n\n\t   puts [::simulation::annealing::findMinimum  -trials 3000  -reduce 0.98  -parameters {x -5.0 5.0 y -5.0 5.0}\t-code {\n\t\t   if { hypot($x-5.0,$y-5.0) < 4.0 } {\n\t\t       set result [expr {$x*$x+$y*$y+sin(10.0*$x)+4.0*cos(20.0*$y)}]\n\t\t   } else {\n\t\t       set result 1.0e100\n\t\t   }\n\t       }]\n\n       The method is theoretically capable of determining the global optimum,\n       but often you need to use a large number of trials and a slow reduction\n       of temperature to get reliable and repeatable estimates.\n\n       You can use the -final option to use a deterministic optimization\n       method, once you are sure you are near the required optimum.\n\n       The findCombinatorialMinimum procedure is suited for situations where\n       the parameters have the values 0 or 1 (and there can be many of them).\n       Here is an example:\n\n       •      We have a function that attains an absolute minimum if the first\n\t      ten numbers are 1 and the rest is 0:\n\n\t      proc cost {params} {\n\t\t  set cost 0\n\t\t  foreach p [lrange $params 0 9] {\n\t\t      if { $p == 0 } {\n\t\t\t  incr cost\n\t\t      }\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  foreach p [lrange $params 10 end] {\n\t\t      if { $p == 1 } {\n\t\t\t  incr cost\n\t\t      }\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  return $cost\n\t      }"
