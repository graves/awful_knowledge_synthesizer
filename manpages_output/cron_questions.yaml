There should be no need to\n     start it manually.  See /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist\n     for details.\n\n     The cron utility searches /usr/lib/cron/tabs for crontab files which are\n     named after accounts in /etc/passwd; crontabs found are loaded into\n     memory.  The cron utility also searches for /etc/crontab which is in a\n     different format (see crontab(5)).\n\n     The cron utility then wakes up every minute, examining all stored\n     crontabs, checking each command to see if it should be run in the current\n     minute.  When executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of\n     the crontab (or to the user named in the MAILTO environment variable in\n     the crontab, if such exists)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `cron`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAdditionally, cron checks each minute to see if its spool directory's\n     modification time (or the modification time on /etc/crontab) has changed,\n     and if it has, cron will then examine the modification time on all\n     crontabs and reload those which have changed.  Thus cron need not be\n     restarted whenever a crontab file is modified.  Note that the crontab(1)\n     command updates the modification time of the spool directory whenever it\n     changes a crontab.\n\n     Available options:\n\n     -s      Enable special handling of situations when the GMT offset of the\n\t     local timezone changes, such as the switches between the standard\n\t     time and daylight saving time.\n\n\t     The jobs run during the GMT offset changes time as intuitively\n\t     expected.\tIf a job falls into a time interval that disappears\n\t     (for example, during the switch from standard time) to daylight\n\t     saving time or is duplicated (for example, during the reverse\n\t     switch), then it is handled in one of two ways:"

They work as always, skip the skipped time or run\n\t     in the added time as usual.\n\n\t     The second case is for the jobs that run less frequently.\tThey\n\t     are executed exactly once, they are not skipped nor executed\n\t     twice (unless cron is restarted or the user's crontab(5) is\n\t     changed during such a time interval).  If an interval disappears\n\t     due to the GMT offset change, such jobs are executed at the same\n\t     absolute point of time as they would be in the old time zone.\n\t     For example, if exactly one hour disappears, this point would be\n\t     during the next hour at the first minute that is specified for\n\t     them in crontab(5)."
