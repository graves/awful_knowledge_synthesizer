Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ssh-sk-helper`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSSH-SK-HELPER(8)\t    System Manager's Manual\t      SSH-SK-HELPER(8)\n\nNAME\n     ssh-sk-helper â€“ OpenSSH helper for FIDO authenticator support\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     ssh-sk-helper [-v]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     ssh-sk-helper is used by ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) to\n     access keys provided by a FIDO authenticator.\n\n     ssh-sk-helper is not intended to be invoked directly by the user.\n\n     A single option is supported:\n\n     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh-sk-helper to print debugging messages\n\t     about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging problems.\n\t     Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.\n\n\t     Note that ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) will\n\t     automatically pass the -v flag to ssh-sk-helper when they have\n\t     themselves been placed in debug mode.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), ssh-keygen(1)\n\nHISTORY\n     ssh-sk-helper first appeared in OpenBSD 6.7.\n\nAUTHORS\n     Damien Miller <djm@openbsd.org>\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\tApril 29, 2022\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
