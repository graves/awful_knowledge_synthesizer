The cups-deviced helper program runs each\n       CUPS backend(7) with no arguments in order to discover the available\n       printers.\n\n       The cups-driverd helper program lists all available printer drivers, a\n       subset of \"matching\" printer drivers, or a copy of a specific driver\n       PPD file.\n\n       The cups-exec helper program runs backends, filters, and other\n       programs. On macOS these programs are run in a secure sandbox.\n\nFILES\n       The cups-driverd program looks for PPD and driver information files in\n       the following directories:"
