A timestamp of when the first network traffic was\n\t      observed is also shown. By default, only applications will be\n\t      shown unless the -p flag is provided.\n\n\n\t      -p       Show a list that includes the combination of\n\t\t       applications and processes.\n\n\n\t      -r       Force a database refresh before showing the list.\n\n\n\t      -n name  Only show the application or process matching name.\n\n\n\t      -s sortorder\n\t\t       Sort the list according the following available sort\n\t\t       orders:\n\n\n\t\t       t\tSort by total network usage.

When an update occurs,\n\t\t       the usage value for the application or process that\n\t\t       generated network traffic will appear emphasized. You\n\t\t       can use the following commands to interact with the\n\t\t       table.\n\n\n\t\t       q\tQuit\n\n\t\t       p\tToggles the values between showing raw bytes\n\t\t\t\tand unitized format\n\n\t\t       s\tChange the sort order of the columns\n\n\t\t       r\tRedraw the screen\n\n\t\t       h\tShow help\n\n\t\t       Arrow Keys\n\t\t\t\tScroll the list\n\n\n\t      --interval seconds\n\t\t       Set the periodic refresh interval to the specified\n\t\t       number of seconds. The minimum value is 5 seconds, and\n\t\t       the default interval is 15 seconds. (Only valid in\n\t\t       interactive mode)\n\n\nMANAGEMENT COMMANDS\n     These commands are used to manage and reset the collected network traffic\n     usage statistics."
