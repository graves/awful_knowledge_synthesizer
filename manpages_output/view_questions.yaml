It can be used\n       to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful for editing\n       programs.\n\n       There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi\n       windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing,\n       filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..  See \":help\n       vi_diff.txt\" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.\n\n       While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help\n       system, with the \":help\" command.

The first one will be the current\n\t\t   file and read into the buffer.

To edit a file\n\t\t   that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with \"--\".\n\n       -\t   The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read\n\t\t   from stderr, which should be a tty.\n\n       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on\n\t\t   a \"tag\", a sort of goto label.  {tag} is looked up in the\n\t\t   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and\n\t\t   the associated command is executed.\tMostly this is used\n\t\t   for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a function\n\t\t   name.  The effect is that the file containing that function\n\t\t   becomes the current file and the cursor is positioned on\n\t\t   the start of the function.  See \":help tag-commands\"."
