Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       execsnoop [-a|-A|-ejhsvZ] [-c command]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       execsnoop prints details of new processes as they are executed.\n       Details such as UID, PID and argument listing are printed out.\n\n       This program is very useful to examine short lived processes that would\n       not normally appear in a prstat or \"ps -ef\" listing. Sometimes\n       applications will run hundreds of short lived processes in their normal\n       startup cycle, a behaviour that is easily monitored with execsnoop.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a     print all data\n\n       -A     dump all data, space delimited\n\n       -e     safe output, parseable. This prevents the ARGS field containing\n\t      \"\\n\"s, to assist postprocessing.\n\n       -j     print project ID\n\n       -s     print start time, us\n\n       -v     print start time, string\n\n       -Z     print zonename\n\n       -c command\n\t      command name to snoop\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Default output, print processes as they are executed,\n\t      # execsnoop\n\n       Print human readable timestamps,\n\t      # execsnoop -v\n\n       Print zonename,\n\t      # execsnoop -Z\n\n       Snoop this command only,\n\t      # execsnoop -c ls\n\nFIELDS\n       UID    User ID\n\n       PID    Process ID\n\n       PPID   Parent Process ID\n\n       COMM   command name for the process\n\n       ARGS   argument listing for the process\n\n       ZONE   zonename\n\n       PROJ   project ID\n\n       TIME   timestamp for the exec event, us\n\n       STRTIME\n\t      timestamp for the exec event, string\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       execsnoop will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dtrace(1M), truss(1)"
