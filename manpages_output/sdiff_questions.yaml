See the -o option for an explanation.\n\n     The options are:\n\n     -l --left-column\n\t     Only print the left column for identical lines.\n\n     -o --output outfile\n\t     Interactively merge file1 and file2 into outfile.\tIn this mode,\n\t     the user is prompted for each set of differences.\tSee EDITOR and\n\t     VISUAL, below, for details of which editor, if any, is invoked.\n\n\t     The commands are as follows:\n\n\t     l | 1   Choose left set of diffs.\n\n\t     r | 2   Choose right set of diffs."
