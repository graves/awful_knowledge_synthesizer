Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the listbox such as its colors, font,\n       text, and relief.  The listbox command returns its pathName argument.\n       At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window\n       named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A listbox is a widget that displays a list of strings, one per line.\n       When first created, a new listbox has no elements.  Elements may be\n       added or deleted using widget commands described below.\tIn addition,\n       one or more elements may be selected as described below.  If a listbox\n       is exporting its selection (see exportSelection option), then it will\n       observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.  Listbox\n       selections are available as type STRING; the value of the selection\n       will be the text of the selected elements, with newlines separating the\n       elements."

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `listbox`.



    Manpage text:

    If the selection mode is multiple or extended, any number of elements
           may be selected at once, including discontiguous ranges.  In multiple
           mode, clicking button 1 on an element toggles its selection state
           without affecting any other elements.  In extended mode, pressing
           button 1 on an element selects it, deselects everything else, and sets
           the anchor to the element under the mouse;  dragging the mouse with
           button 1 down extends the selection to include all the elements between
           the anchor and the element under the mouse, inclusive.

           Most people will probably want to use browse mode for single selections
           and extended mode for multiple selections; the other modes appear to be
           useful only in special situations.

           Any time the selection changes in the listbox, the virtual event
           <<ListboxSelect>> will be generated.  It is easiest to bind to this
           event to be made aware of any changes to listbox selection.
