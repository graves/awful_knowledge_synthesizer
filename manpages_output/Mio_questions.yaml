By default, Mio will issue read\n       requests, with a -w option required for writes.\n\n       Upon completion, Mio will print a summary of I/O performance for each\n       stream as well as the aggregate performance off all streams.  Because\n       the aggregate performance is the performance of all streams over the\n       test run time, it may not reflect the sum of the individual streams."
