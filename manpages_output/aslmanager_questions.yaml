It is started automatically at various times by syslogd.\tIt may\n     also be invoked from the command line by the superuser (root).  It\n     manages the life-cycle of data in the ASL database, rotated log files,\n     and ASL directory data stores.  Configuration information for aslmanager\n     comes from the /etc/asl.conf configuration file, any ASL output module\n     configuration files in the /etc/asl directory, and from command-line\n     options that may be specified to override some settings found in the\n     configuration files.  In normal operation, it first checks the ASL\n     database in /var/log/asl, then it checks the files and directories\n     specified by /etc/asl.conf and each ASL output module."

Data files that are older than\n     the time-to-live for the database are either archived or removed.\tFiles\n     that contain messages with explicit expire times are removed or archived\n     monthly after all their contents expire.  The default 7 day time-to-live\n     value may be overridden by the setting of the “store_ttl” parameter in\n     asl.conf or by supplying a value following the -store_ttl flag or the\n     -ttl flag (which overrides the time-to-live for both the ASL database and\n     for all ASL modules).  A time-to-live value of zero allows files to\n     remain in the store with no time limit."

    ASL OUTPUT MODULE MANAGEMENT
         For each ASL output module, or a single module specified as an argument
         following -module, aslmanager first locates all checkpoint files produced
         by syslogd for that module.  aslmanager checks all ASL directory data
         stores and all rotated log files - those with a “rotate” option in the
         module's configuration rules.  Checkpoint files are renamed if necessary
         to conform to the naming style specified for the file by a “style” option
         in the module's configuration file.  aslmanager will compress the file if
         directed by a “compress” option, and it will move the file to a
         destination directory if a “dest” option is specified for the file.
         Following this, aslmanager will delete expired files.  The time-to-live
         for files is 7 days by default, but may be specified using the “ttl”
         option for the file in the module's configuration rules.  If -module_ttl
         or -ttl are specified command line, then value specified as an argument
         is used as a time-to-live instead.  -module_ttl specifies time-to-live
         for module processing.  -ttl specifies time-to-live for both the ASL
         database and for modules.

When processing ASL directory data stores, aslmanager will\n     similarly delete data files after the expiry of their time-to-live, and\n     will delete data files (oldest first) to limit the total size as\n     specified by “all_max”.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     syslogd(8), syslog(1), asl(3), asl.conf(5), syslog(3).\n\nHISTORY\n     The aslmanager utility appeared in Mac OS X 10.6.\tSupport for log file\n     and ASL directory life-cycle management was added in OS X 10.9.\n\nMac OS X\t\t       December 7, 2007 \t\t      Mac OS X"
