Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package provides commands to work with the serializations of\n       parsing expressions as managed by the Parser Tools, and specified in\n       section PE serialization format.\n\n       This is a supporting package in the Core Layer of Parser Tools.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_support\n\nAPI\n       ::pt::pe verify serial ?canonvar?\n\t      This command verifies that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      serialization of a parsing expression and will throw an error if\n\t      that is not the case. The result of the command is the empty\n\t      string.\n\n\t      If the argument canonvar is specified it is interpreted as the\n\t      name of a variable in the calling context. This variable will be\n\t      written to if and only if serial is a valid regular\n\t      serialization. Its value will be a boolean, with True indicating\n\t      that the serialization is not only valid, but also canonical.\n\t      False will be written for a valid, but non-canonical\n\t      serialization.\n\n\t      For the specification of serializations see the section PE\n\t      serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::pe verify-as-canonical serial\n\t      This command verifies that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      canonical serialization of a parsing expression and will throw\n\t      an error if that is not the case. The result of the command is\n\t      the empty string.\n\n\t      For the specification of canonical serializations see the\n\t      section PE serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::pe canonicalize serial\n\t      This command assumes that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      regular serialization of a parsing expression and will throw an\n\t      error if that is not the case.\n\n\t      It will then convert the input into the canonical serialization\n\t      of this parsing expression and return it as its result. If the\n\t      input is already canonical it will be returned unchanged.\n\n\t      For the specification of regular and canonical serializations\n\t      see the section PE serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::pe print serial\n\t      This command assumes that the argument serial contains a valid\n\t      serialization of a parsing expression and returns a string\n\t      containing that PE in a human readable form.\n\n\t      The exact format of this form is not specified and cannot be\n\t      relied on for parsing or other machine-based activities.\n\n\t      For the specification of serializations see the section PE\n\t      serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::pe bottomup cmdprefix pe\n\t      This command walks the parsing expression pe from the bottom up\n\t      to the root, invoking the command prefix cmdprefix for each\n\t      partial expression. This implies that the children of a parsing\n\t      expression PE are handled before PE.\n\n\t      The command prefix has the signature\n\n\t      cmdprefix pe op arguments\n\t\t     I.e. it is invoked with the parsing expression pe the\n\t\t     walk is currently at, the op'erator in the pe, and the\n\t\t     operator's arguments.\n\n\t\t     The result returned by the command prefix replaces pe in\n\t\t     the parsing expression it was a child of, allowing\n\t\t     transformations of the expression tree.\n\n\t\t     This also means that for all inner parsing expressions\n\t\t     the contents of arguments are the results of the command\n\t\t     prefix invoked for the children of this inner parsing\n\t\t     expression.\n\n       ::pt::pe topdown cmdprefix pe\n\t      This command walks the parsing expression pe from the root down\n\t      to the leaves, invoking the command prefix cmdprefix for each\n\t      partial expression. This implies that the children of a parsing\n\t      expression PE are handled after PE.\n\n\t      The command prefix has the same signature as for bottomup, see\n\t      above.\n\n\t      The result returned by the command prefix is ignored.\n\n       ::pt::pe equal seriala serialb\n\t      This command tests the two parsing expressions seriala and\n\t      serialb for structural equality. The result of the command is a\n\t      boolean value. It will be set to true if the expressions are\n\t      identical, and false otherwise.\n\n\t      String equality is usable only if we can assume that the two\n\t      parsing expressions are pure Tcl lists.\n\n       ::pt::pe epsilon\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for\n\t      epsilon.\n\n       ::pt::pe dot\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for dot.\n\n       ::pt::pe alnum\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for alnum.\n\n       ::pt::pe alpha\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for alpha.\n\n       ::pt::pe ascii\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for ascii.\n\n       ::pt::pe control\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for\n\t      control.\n\n       ::pt::pe digit\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for digit.\n\n       ::pt::pe graph\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for graph.\n\n       ::pt::pe lower\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for lower.\n\n       ::pt::pe print\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for print.\n\n       ::pt::pe punct\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for punct.\n\n       ::pt::pe space\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for space.\n\n       ::pt::pe upper\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for upper.\n\n       ::pt::pe wordchar\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for\n\t      wordchar.\n\n       ::pt::pe xdigit\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for\n\t      xdigit.\n\n       ::pt::pe ddigit\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for\n\t      ddigit.\n\n       ::pt::pe terminal t\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for the\n\t      terminal symbol t.\n\n       ::pt::pe range ta tb\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for the\n\t      range of terminal symbols ta ... tb.\n\n       ::pt::pe nonterminal nt\n\t      This command constructs the atomic parsing expression for the\n\t      nonterminal symbol nt.\n\n       ::pt::pe choice pe...\n\t      This command constructs the parsing expression representing the\n\t      ordered or prioritized choice between the argument parsing\n\t      expressions. The first argument has the highest priority.\n\n       ::pt::pe sequence pe...\n\t      This command constructs the parsing expression representing the\n\t      sequence of the argument parsing expression. The first argument\n\t      is the first element of the sequence.\n\n       ::pt::pe repeat0 pe\n\t      This command constructs the parsing expression representing the\n\t      zero or more repetition of the argument parsing expression pe,\n\t      also known as the kleene closure.\n\n       ::pt::pe repeat1 pe\n\t      This command constructs the parsing expression representing the\n\t      one or more repetition of the argument parsing expression pe,\n\t      also known as the positive kleene closure.\n\n       ::pt::pe optional pe\n\t      This command constructs the parsing expression representing the\n\t      optionality of the argument parsing expression pe.\n\n       ::pt::pe ahead pe\n\t      This command constructs the parsing expression representing the\n\t      positive lookahead of the argument parsing expression pe.\n\n       ::pt::pe notahead pe\n\t      This command constructs the parsing expression representing the\n\t      negative lookahead of the argument parsing expression pe.\n\nPE SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize\n       Parsing Expressions as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       parsing expression may have more than one regular serialization only\n       exactly one of them will be canonical.\n\n       Regular serialization\n\n\t      Atomic Parsing Expressions\n\n\t\t     [1]    The string epsilon is an atomic parsing\n\t\t\t    expression.
