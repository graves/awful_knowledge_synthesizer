In this\n     case, the largest digit number of arguments are discarded for each\n     execution of command.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -#      Normally arguments are taken singly; the optional number #\n\t     specifies the number of arguments to be passed to command.  If\n\t     the number is zero, command is run, without arguments, once for\n\t     each argument.\n\n\t     If any sequences of “%d” occur in command, the -# option is\n\t     ignored.\n\n     -a c    The use of the character ‘%’ as a magic character may be changed\n\t     with the -a option.\n\n     -d      Display the commands that would have been executed, but do not\n\t     actually execute them."
