If this command contains \"%n\", it is replaced with the\n\t      name of the desired node.  In its simpilest form it should\n\t      return the children of the given node as a list which will be\n\t      depicted in the display.\tSince the names of the children are\n\t      used as tags in the underlying text widget, each child must be\n\t      unique in the hierarchy.\tDue to the unique requirement, the\n\t      nodes shall be reffered to as uids or uid in the singular sense.\n\t      The format of returned list is\n\n\t\t{uid [uid ...]}\n\n\t\twhere uid is a unique id and primary key for the hierarchy\n\t      entry\n\n\t      Should the unique requirement pose a problem, the list returned\n\t      can take on another more extended form which enables the\n\t      association of text to be displayed with the uids.  The uid must\n\t      still be unique, but the text does not have to obey the unique\n\t      rule.  In addition, the format also allows the specification of\n\t      additional tags to be used on the same entry in the hierarchy as\n\t      the uid and additional icons to be displayed just before the\n\t      node.  The tags and icons are considered to be the property of\n\t      the user in that the hierarchy widget will not depend on any of\n\t      their values.  The extended format is\n\n\t\t{{uid [text [tags [icons]]]} {uid [text [tags [icons]]]} ...}\n\n\t\twhere uid is a unique id and primary key for the hierarchy\n\t      entry\n\t\t      text is the text to be displayed for this uid\n\t\t      tags is a list of user tags to be applied to the entry\n\t\t      icons is a list of icons to be displayed in front of the\n\t      text\n\n\t      The hierarchy widget does a look ahead from each node to\n\t      determine if the node has a children.  This can be cost some\n\t      performace with large hierarchies.  User's can avoid this by\n\t      providing a hint in the user tags.  A tag of \"leaf\" or \"branch\"\n\t      tells the hierarchy widget the information it needs to know\n\t      thereby avoiding the look ahead operation.\n\n       Name:\t       hscrollMode\n       Class:\t       ScrollMode\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -hscrollmode\n\n\t      Specifies the the display mode to be used for the horizontal\n\t      scrollbar: static, dynamic, or none.  In static mode, the scroll\n\t      bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the scroll\n\t      bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The\n\t      default is static.\n\n       Name:\t       sbWidth\n       Class:\t       Width\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -sbwidth\n\n\t      Specifies the width of the scrollbar in any of the forms\n\t      acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\n\n       Name:\t       scrollMargin\n       Class:\t       Margin\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -scrollmargin\n\n\t      Specifies the distance between the text portion of the hierarchy\n\t      and the scrollbars in any of the forms acceptable to\n\t      Tk_GetPixels.  The default is 3 pixels.\n\n       Name:\t       selectCommand\n       Class:\t       Command\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -selectcommand\n\n\t      Specifies a Tcl command to be evaluated when you select a node\n\t      in the hierarchy via left mouse click.  If \"%n\" is included in\n\t      the command, it is substituted with the node name.  Similarly,\n\t      \"%s\" is substituted with the node's current selection status: 1\n\t      for selected, 0 otherwise.\n\n       Name:\t       textBackground Class:\t      Background Command-Line\n       Switch:\t       -textbackground\n\n\t      Specifies the background color for the text portion of the\n\t      hierarchy in any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetColor.\n\n       Name:\t       textFont\n       Class:\t       Font\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -textfont\n\n\t      Specifies the font to be used in the text portion of the\n\t      hierarchy.\n\n       Name:\t       textMenuLoadCommand\n       Class:\t       Command\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -textmenuloadcommand\n\n\t      Specifies a command to be executed upon user selection via mouse\n\t      button three, that will dynamically load the itemMenu for the\n\t      widget.\n\n       Name:\t       visibleitems\n       Class:\t       VisibleItems\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -visibleitems\n\n\t      Specifies the widthxheight in characters and lines for the\n\t      hierarchy.  This option is only administered if the width and\n\t      height options are both set to zero, otherwise they take\n\t      precedence.  The default value is 80x24.\tWith the visibleitems\n\t      option engaged, geometry constraints are maintained only on the\n\t      text portion of the hierarchy.  The size of the other components\n\t      such as labels, margins, and scroll bars, are additive and\n\t      independent, effecting the overall size of the hierarchy.  In\n\t      contrast, should the width and height options have non zero\n\t      values, they are applied to the hierarchy as a whole.

In static mode, the scroll\n\t      bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the scroll\n\t      bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The\n\t      default is static.\n\n       Name:\t       width\n       Class:\t       Width\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -width\n\n\t      Specifies the width of the hierarchy as an entire unit.  The\n\t      value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to\n\t      Tk_GetPixels.  Any additional space needed to display the other\n\t      components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the\n\t      text portion of the hierarchy to be compressed.  A value of zero\n\t      along with the same value for the height causes the value given\n\t      for the visibleitems option to be applied which administers\n\t      geometry constraints in a different manner.

Individual nodes can be highlighted.\n       Clicking with the right mouse button on any item brings up a special\n       item menu.  Clicking on the background area brings up a different popup\n       menu.  Options exist to provide user control over the loading of the\n       nodes and actions associated with node selection.  Since the hierarchy\n       is based on the scrolledtext widget, it includes options to control the\n       method in which the scrollbars are displayed, i.e. statically or\n       dynamically.  Options also exist for adding a label to the hierarchy\n       and controlling its position.\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::hierarchy command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget.\tIt has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for hierarchy widgets:\n\nASSOCIATED METHODS\n       bbox\t       compare\t      debug\t      delete\n       dlineinfo       dump\t      get\t      index\n       insert\t       scan\t      search\t      see\n       tag\t       window\t      xview\t      yview\n\n       See the \"text\" manual entry for details on the standard methods."
