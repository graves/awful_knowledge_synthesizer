EFI-based systems also support a “blessed”\n     system file, which is the primary mechanism of specifying the booter for\n     a volume for those systems. In Folder Mode, if you are operating on an\n     HFS+ volume, the HFS+ Volume Header is updated to reflect the\n     files/directories given, which persists even if the volume is moved to\n     another system or NVRAM is cleared.\n\n     Mount Mode does not make permanent modifications to the filesystem, but\n     rather set the system firmware to boot from the specified volume,\n     assuming it has been properly blessed. This is a subset of the\n     functionality of Folder Mode with the --setBoot option, but is convenient\n     when you don't want to change or interrogate the filesystem for its\n     blessed status."

    Manpage text:

    Device Mode is similar to Mount Mode, but allows selection of unmounted
         filesystems, for instance while in single user mode. It can also perform
         certain offline modifications to the filesystem, but is not generally
         recommended.

         NetBoot Mode sets the system firmware to boot from the network, using a
         URL syntax to specify the protocol and server.  bless only sets the local
         system to go into NetBoot mode, and does not communicate to the server
         what image should be used, if there are multiple images. Some other
         mechanism, such as using Startup Disk, should be used to select that.

         Info Mode will print out the currently-blessed directory of a volume, or
         if no mountpoint is specified, the active boot device that the firmware
         is set to boot from.

         Unbless Mode complements Folder Mode, and clears the persistent blessed
         folder and file information on HFS+ volumes.

         NOTE: bless must be run as the root user.

         Additionally, --help can be used to display the command-line usage
         summary.
