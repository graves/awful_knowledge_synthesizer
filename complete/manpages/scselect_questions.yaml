When invoked with no arguments, scselect\n     displays the names and associated identifiers for each defined \"location\"\n     and indicates which is currently active.  scselect also allows the user\n     to select or change the active \"location\" by specifying its name or\n     identifier.  Changing the \"location\" causes an immediate system re-\n     configuration, unless the -n option is supplied.\n\n     At present, the majority of preferences associated with a \"location\"\n     relate to the system's network configuration.\n\n     The command line options are as follows:\n\n     -n  Delay changing the system's \"location\" until the next system boot (or\n\t the next time that the system configuration preferences are changed)."
