Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This document describes two APIs. First the API shared by all packages\n       for the conversion of Parsing Expression Grammars into some other\n       format, and then the API shared by the packages which implement the\n       export plugins sitting on top of the conversion packages.\n\n       Its intended audience are people who wish to create their own converter\n       for some type of output, and/or an export plugin for their or some\n       other converter.\n\n       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_export\n\nCONVERTER API\n       Any (grammar) export converter has to follow the rules set out below:\n\n       [1]    A converter is a package. Its name is arbitrary, however it is\n\t      recommended to put it under the ::pt::peg::to namespace.\n\n       [2]    The package provides either a single Tcl command following the\n\t      API outlined below, or a class command whose instances follow\n\t      the same API. The commands which follow the API are called\n\t      converter commands.\n\n       [3]    A converter command has to provide the following three methods\n\t      with the given signatures and semantics. Converter commands are\n\t      allowed to provide more methods of their own, but not less, and\n\t      they may not provide different semantics for the standardized\n\t      methods.\n\n\t      CONVERTER reset\n\t\t     This method has to reset the configuration of the\n\t\t     converter to its default settings. The result of the\n\t\t     method has to be the empty string.\n\n\t      CONVERTER configure\n\t\t     This method, in this form, has to return a dictionary\n\t\t     containing the current configuration of the converter.\n\n\t      CONVERTER configure option\n\t\t     This method, in this form, has to return the current\n\t\t     value of the specified configuration option of the\n\t\t     converter.\n\n\t\t     Please read the section Options for the set of standard\n\t\t     options any converter has to accept.  Any other options\n\t\t     accepted by a specific converter will be described in its\n\t\t     manpage.\n\n\t      CONVERTER configure option value...\n\t\t     This command, in this form, sets the specified options of\n\t\t     the converter to the given values.\n\n\t\t     Please read the section Options for the set of standard\n\t\t     options a converter has to accept.  Any other options\n\t\t     accepted by a specific converter will be described in its\n\t\t     manpage.\n\n\t      CONVERTER convert serial\n\t\t     This method has to accept the canonical serialization of\n\t\t     a parsing expression grammar, as specified in section PEG\n\t\t     serialization format, and contained in serial.  The\n\t\t     result of the method has to be the result of converting\n\t\t     the input grammar into whatever the converter is for, per\n\t\t     its configuration.\n\nPLUGIN API\n       Any (grammar) export plugin has to follow the rules set out below:\n\n       [1]    A plugin is a package.\n\n       [2]    The name of a plugin package has the form pt::peg::export::FOO,\n\t      where FOO is the name of the format the plugin will generate\n\t      output for.\n\n       [3]    The plugin can expect that the package pt::peg::export::plugin\n\t      is present, as indicator that it was invoked from a genuine\n\t      plugin manager.\n\n\t      It is recommended that a plugin does check for the presence of\n\t      this package.\n\n       [4]    A plugin has to provide a single command, in the global\n\t      namespace, with the signature shown below. Plugins are allowed\n\t      to provide more command of their own, but not less, and they may\n\t      not provide different semantics for the standardized command.\n\n\t      ::export serial configuration\n\t\t     This command has to accept the canonical serialization of\n\t\t     a parsing expression grammar and the configuration for\n\t\t     the converter invoked by the plugin. The result of the\n\t\t     command has to be the result of the converter invoked by\n\t\t     the plugin for th input grammar and configuration.\n\n\t\t     string serial\n\t\t\t    This argument will contain the canonical\n\t\t\t    serialization of the parsing expression grammar\n\t\t\t    for which to generate the output.  The\n\t\t\t    specification of what a canonical serialization is\n\t\t\t    can be found in the section PEG serialization\n\t\t\t    format.\n\n\t\t     dictionary configuration\n\t\t\t    This argument will contain the configuration to\n\t\t\t    configure the converter with before invoking it,\n\t\t\t    as a dictionary mapping from options to values.\n\n\t\t\t    Please read the section Options for the set of\n\t\t\t    standard options any converter has to accept, and\n\t\t\t    thus any plugin as well.  Any other options\n\t\t\t    accepted by a specific plugin will be described in\n\t\t\t    its manpage.\n\n       [5]    A single usage cycle of a plugin consists of an invokation of\n\t      the command export. This call has to leave the plugin in a state\n\t      where another usage cycle can be run without problems.\n\nOPTIONS\n       Each export converter and plugin for an export converter has to accept\n       the options below in their configure method. Converters are allowed to\n       ignore the contents of these options when performing a conversion, but\n       they must not reject them. Plugins are expected to pass the options\n       given to them to the converter they are invoking.\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\nUSAGE\n       To use a converter do\n\n\t   # Get the converter (single command here, not class)\n\t   package require the-converter-package\n\n\t   # Provide a configuration\n\t   theconverter configure ...\n\n\t   # Perform the conversion\n\t   set result [theconverter convert $thegrammarserial]\n\n\t   ... process the result ...\n\n       To use a plugin FOO do\n\n\t   # Get an export plugin manager\n\t   package require pt::peg::export\n\t   pt::peg::export E\n\n\t   # Provide a configuration\n\t   E configuration set ...\n\n\t   # Run the plugin, and the converter inside.\n\t   set result [E export serial $grammarserial FOO]\n\n\t   ... process the result ..."
