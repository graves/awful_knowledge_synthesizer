If no\n       fileId argument is given then pid returns the process identifier of the\n       current process.  All process identifiers are returned as decimal\n       strings.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       Print process information about the processes in a pipeline using the\n       SysV ps program before reading the output of that pipeline:\n\n\t      set pipeline [open \"| zcat somefile.gz | grep foobar | sort -u\"]\n\t      # Print process information\n\t      exec ps -fp [pid $pipeline] >@stdout\n\t      # Print a separator and then the output of the pipeline\n\t      puts [string repeat - 70]\n\t      puts [read $pipeline]\n\t      close $pipeline"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the pid command in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the pid command to retrieve the process identifiers of all processes in a pipeline created with the open command?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the pid command to get the process identifier of the current Tcl script execution?
