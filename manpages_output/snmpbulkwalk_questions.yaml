This OID\n       specifies which portion of the object identifier space will be searched\n       using GETBULK requests.\tAll variables in the subtree below the given\n       OID are queried and their values presented to the user.\tEach variable\n       name is given in the format specified in variables(5).  If no OID\n       argument is present, snmpbulkwalk will search MIB-2.\n\n       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an\n       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to\n       pinpoint why the request was malformed."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snmpbulkwalk`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the end of the MIB,\n       the message \"End of MIB\" will be displayed.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -Cc     Do not check whether the returned OIDs are increasing.  Some\n\t       agents (LaserJets are an example) return OIDs out of order, but\n\t       can complete the walk anyway.  Other agents return OIDs that\n\t       are out of order and can cause snmpbulkwalk to loop\n\t       indefinitely.  By default, snmpbulkwalk tries to detect this\n\t       behavior and warns you when it hits an agent acting illegally.\n\t       Use -Cc to turn off this behaviour.\n\n       -Ci     Include the given OID in the search range.  Normally\n\t       snmpbulkwalk uses GETBULK requests starting with the OID you\n\t       specified and returns all results in the MIB tree after that\n\t       OID.  Sometimes, you may wish to include the OID specified on\n\t       the command line in the printed results if it is a valid OID in\n\t       the tree itself.  This option lets you do this.\n\n       -Cn<NUM>\n\t       Set the non-repeaters field in the GETBULK PDUs.  This\n\t       specifies the number of supplied variables that should not be\n\t       iterated over.  The default is 0."
