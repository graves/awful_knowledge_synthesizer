The substitutions are performed in exactly\n       the same way as for Tcl commands.  As a result, the string argument is\n       actually substituted twice, once by the Tcl parser in the usual fashion\n       for Tcl commands, and again by the subst command.\n\n       If any of the -nobackslashes, -nocommands, or -novariables are\n       specified, then the corresponding substitutions are not performed.  For\n       example, if -nocommands is specified, command substitution is not\n       performed:  open and close brackets are treated as ordinary characters\n       with no special interpretation."

    Manpage text:

    Note that the substitution of one kind can include substitution of
           other kinds.  For example, even when the -novariables option is
           specified, command substitution is performed without restriction.  This
           means that any variable substitution necessary to complete the command
           substitution will still take place.  Likewise, any command substitution
           necessary to complete a variable substitution will take place, even
           when -nocommands is specified.  See the EXAMPLES below.

           If an error occurs during substitution, then subst will return that
           error.  If a break exception occurs during command or variable
           substitution, the result of the whole substitution will be the string
           (as substituted) up to the start of the substitution that raised the
           exception.  If a continue exception occurs during the evaluation of a
           command or variable substitution, an empty string will be substituted
           for that entire command or variable substitution (as long as it is
           well-formed Tcl.)  If a return exception occurs, or any other return
           code is returned during command or variable substitution, then the
           returned value is substituted for that substitution.  See the EXAMPLES
           below.  In this way, all exceptional return codes are “caught” by
           subst.  The subst command itself will either return an error, or will
           complete successfully.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `subst`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nEXAMPLES\n       When it performs its substitutions, subst does not give any special\n       treatment to double quotes or curly braces (except within command\n       substitutions) so the script\n\t      set a 44\n\t      subst {xyz {$a}}\n       returns “xyz {44}”, not “xyz {$a}” and the script\n\t      set a \"p\\} q \\{r\"\n\t      subst {xyz {$a}}\n       returns “xyz {p} q {r}”, not “xyz {p\\} q \\{r}”.\n\n       When command substitution is performed, it includes any variable\n       substitution necessary to evaluate the script.\n\t      set a 44\n\t      subst -novariables {$a [format $a]}\n       returns “$a 44”, not “$a $a”.  Similarly, when variable substitution is\n       performed, it includes any command substitution necessary to retrieve\n       the value of the variable.\n\t      proc b {} {return c}\n\t      array set a {c c [b] tricky}\n\t      subst -nocommands {[b] $a([b])}\n       returns “[b] c”, not “[b] tricky”.\n\n       The continue and break exceptions allow command substitutions to\n       prevent substitution of the rest of the command substitution and the\n       rest of string respectively, giving script authors more options when\n       processing text using subst.  For example, the script\n\t      subst {abc,[break],def}\n       returns “abc,”, not “abc,,def” and the script\n\t      subst {abc,[continue;expr {1+2}],def}\n       returns “abc,,def”, not “abc,3,def”."
