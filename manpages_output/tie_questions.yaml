It should be noted that the provided mechanism is\n       generic enough to also allow its usage for the distribution of the\n       contents of Tcl arrays over multiple threads and processes, i.e.\n       communication.\n\n       This, persistence and communication, is accomplished by tying) a Tcl\n       array variable to a data source. Examples of data sources are other Tcl\n       arrays and files.\n\n       It should be noted that a single Tcl array variable can be tied to more\n       than one data source. It is this feature which allows the framework to\n       be used for communication as well. Just tie several Tcl arrays in many\n       client processes to a Tcl array in a server and all changes to any of\n       them will be distributed to all. Less centralized variants of this are\n       of course possible as well.\n\nUSING TIES\n   TIE API\n       This section describes the basic API used to establish and remove ties\n       between Tcl array variables and data sources. This interface is the\n       only one a casual user has to be concerned about. The following\n       sections about the various internal interfaces can be safely skipped.\n\n       ::tie::tie arrayvarname options... dstype dsname...\n\t      This command establishes a tie between the Tcl array whose name\n\t      is provided by the argument arrayvarname and the data source\n\t      identified by the dstype and its series of dsname arguments. All\n\t      changes made to the Tcl array after this command returns will be\n\t      saved to the data source for safekeeping (or distribution).\n\n\t      The result of the command is always a token which identifies the\n\t      new tie. This token can be used later to destroy this specific\n\t      tie.\n\n\t      varname arrayvarname (in)\n\t\t     The name of the Tcl array variable to connect the new tie\n\t\t     to.\n\n\t      name|command dstype (in)\n\t\t     This argument specifies the type of the data source we\n\t\t     wish to access.  The dstype can be one of log, array,\n\t\t     remotearray, file, growfile, or dsource; in addition, the\n\t\t     programmer can register additional data source types.\n\t\t     Each dstype is followed by one or more arguments that\n\t\t     identify the data source to which the array is to be\n\t\t     tied.\n\n\t      string dsname (in)\n\t\t     The series of dsname arguments coming after the dstype\n\t\t     identifies the data source we wish to connect to, and has\n\t\t     to be appropriate for the chosen type.\n\n       The command understands a number of additional options which guide the\n       process of setting up the connection between Tcl array and data source."

It does not accept any identifying arguments. All\n\t      changes are simply logged to stdout.\n\n       array  This data source uses a regular Tcl array as the origin of the\n\t      persistent data. It accepts a single identifying argument, the\n\t      name of this Tcl array. All changes are mirrored to that array.\n\n       remotearray\n\t      This data source is similar to array. The difference is that the\n\t      Tcl array to which we are mirroring is not directly accessible,\n\t      but through a send-like command.\n\n\t      It accepts three identifying arguments, the name of the other\n\t      Tcl array, the command prefix for the send-like accessor\n\t      command, and an identifier for the remote entity hosting the\n\t      array, in this order. All changes are mirrored to that array,\n\t      via the command prefix. All commands will be executed in the\n\t      context of the global namespace.\n\n\t      send-like means that the command prefix has to have send syntax\n\t      and semantics.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tie`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nfile   This data source uses a single file as origin of the persistent\n\t      data. It accepts a single identifying argument, the path to this\n\t      file. The file has to be both readable and writable. It may not\n\t      exist, the data source will create it in that case. This (and\n\t      only this) situation will require that the directory for the\n\t      file exists and is writable as well.\n\n\t      All changes are saved in the file, as proper Tcl commands, one\n\t      command per operation. In other words, the file will always\n\t      contain a proper Tcl script.\n\n\t      If the file exists when the tie using it is set up, then it will\n\t      be compacted, i.e. superfluous operations are removed, if the\n\t      operations log stored in it contains either at least one\n\t      operation clearing the whole array, or at least 1.5 times more\n\t      operations than entries in the loaded array.\n\n       growfile\n\t      This data source is like file in terms of the storage medium for\n\t      the array data, and how it is configured. In constrast to the\n\t      former it however assumes and ensures that the tied array will\n\t      never shrink. I.e. the creation of new array entries, and the\n\t      modification of existing entries is allowed, but the deletion of\n\t      entries is not, and causes the data source to throw errors.\n\n\t      This restriction allows us to simplify both file format and\n\t      access to the file radically. For one, the file is read only\n\t      once and the internal cache cannot be invalidated. Second,\n\t      writing data is reduced to a simple append, and no compaction\n\t      step is necessary. The format of the contents is the string\n\t      representation of a dictionary which can be incrementally\n\t      extended forever at the end.\n\n       dsource\n\t      This data source uses an explicitly specified data source object\n\t      as the source for the persistent data. It accepts a single\n\t      identifying argument, the command prefix, i.e. object command.\n\n\t      To use this type it is necessary to know how the framework\n\t      manages ties and what data source objects are.\n\n\t      All changes are delegated to the specified object.\n\nCREATING NEW DATA SOURCES\n       This section is of no interest to the casual user of ties. Only\n       developers wishing to create new data sources have to know the\n       information provided herein.\n\n   DATA SOURCE OBJECTS\n       All ties are represented internally by an in-memory object which\n       mediates between the tie framework and the specific data source, like\n       an array, file, etc.  This is the data source object.\n\n       Its class, the data source class is not generic, but specific to the\n       type of the data source. Writing a new data source requires us to write\n       such a class, and then registering it with the framework as a new type.\n\n       The following subsections describe the various APIs a data source class\n       and the objects it generates will have to follow to be compatible with\n       the tie framework.\n\n       Data source objects are normally automatically created and destroyed by\n       the framework when a tie is created, or removed. This management can be\n       explicitly bypassed through the usage of the \"dsource\" type.  The data\n       source for this type is a data source object itself, and this object is\n       outside of the scope of the tie framework and not managed by it.  In\n       other words, this type allows the creation of ties which talk to pre-\n       existing data source objects, and these objects will survive the\n       removal of the ties using them as well.\n\n   REGISTERING A NEW DATA SOURCE CLASS\n       After a data source class has been written it is necessary to register\n       it as a new type with the framework.\n\n       ::tie::register dsclasscmd as dstype\n\t      Using this command causes the tie framework to remember the\n\t      class command dsclasscmd of a data source class under the type\n\t      name dstype.\n\n\t      After the call the argument dstype of the basic user command\n\t      ::tie::tie will accept dstype as a type name and translate it\n\t      internally to the appropriate class command for the creation of\n\t      data source objects for the new data source.\n\n   DATA SOURCE CLASS\n       Each data source class is represented by a single command, also called\n       the class command, or object creation command. Its syntax is\n\n       dsclasscmd objname ?dsname...?\n\t      The first argument of the class command is the name of the data\n\t      source object to create.\tThe framework itself will always\n\t      supply the string %AUTO%, to signal that the class command has\n\t      to generate not only the object, but the object name as well.\n\n\t      This is followed by a series of arguments identifying the data\n\t      source the new object is for. These are the same dsname\n\t      arguments which are given to the basic user command ::tie::tie.\n\t      Their actual meaning is dependent on the data source class.\n\n\t      The result of the class command has to be the fully-qualified\n\t      name of the new data source object, i.e. the name of the object\n\t      command.\tThe interface this command has to follow is described\n\t      in the section DATA SOURCE OBJECT API\n\n   DATA SOURCE OBJECT API\n       Please read the section DATA SOURCE CLASS first, to know how to\n       generate new object commands.\n\n       Each object command for a data source object has to provide at least\n       the methods listed below for proper inter-operation with the tie\n       framework. Note that the names of most of the methods match the\n       subcommands of the builtin array command.\n\n       ds destroy\n\t      This method is called when the object ds is destroyed. It now\n\t      has to release all its internal resources associated with the\n\t      external data source.\n\n       ds names\n\t      This command has to return a list containing the names of all\n\t      keys found in the data source the object talks to. This is\n\t      equivalent to array names.\n\n       ds size\n\t      This command has to return an integer number specifying the\n\t      number of keys found in the data source the object talks to.\n\t      This is equivalent to array size.\n\n       ds get This command has to return a dictionary containing the data\n\t      found in the data source the object talks to. This is equivalent\n\t      to array get.\n\n       ds set dict\n\t      This command takes a dictionary and adds its contents to the\n\t      data source the object talks to. This is equivalent to array\n\t      set.\n\n       ds unset ?pattern?\n\t      This command takes a pattern and removes all elements whose keys\n\t      matching it from the data source. If no pattern is specified it\n\t      defaults to *, causing the removal of all elements. This is\n\t      nearly equivalent to array unset.\n\n       ds setv index value\n\t      This command has to save the value in the data source the object\n\t      talks to, under the key index.\n\n\t      The result of the command is ignored. If an error is thrown then\n\t      this error will show up as error of the set operation which\n\t      caused the method call.\n\n       ds unsetv index\n\t      This command has to remove the value under the key index from\n\t      the data source the object talks to.\n\n\t      The result of the command is ignored. If an error is thrown then\n\t      this error will show up as error of the unset operation which\n\t      caused the method call.\n\n       ds getv index\n\t      This command has to return the value for the key index in the\n\t      data source the object talks to.\n\n       And here a small table comparing the data source methods to the regular\n       Tcl commands for accessing an array."
