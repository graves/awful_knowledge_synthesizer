It is far\n       from complete and probably contains many errors.  Please refer any\n       questions or comments to the author below.\n\nVariables\n   Datatypes\n       Perl has three typedefs that handle Perl's three main data types:\n\n\t   SV  Scalar Value\n\t   AV  Array Value\n\t   HV  Hash Value\n\n       Each typedef has specific routines that manipulate the various data\n       types.\n\n   What is an \"IV\"?\n       Perl uses a special typedef IV which is a simple signed integer type\n       that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold a pointer (as well as an\n       integer).  Additionally, there is the UV, which is simply an unsigned\n       IV.\n\n       Perl also uses several special typedefs to declare variables to hold\n       integers of (at least) a given size.  Use I8, I16, I32, and I64 to\n       declare a signed integer variable which has at least as many bits as\n       the number in its name.\tThese all evaluate to the native C type that\n       is closest to the given number of bits, but no smaller than that\n       number.\tFor example, on many platforms, a \"short\" is 16 bits long, and\n       if so, I16 will evaluate to a \"short\".  But on platforms where a\n       \"short\" isn't exactly 16 bits, Perl will use the smallest type that\n       contains 16 bits or more."

    Manpage text:

    U8, U16, U32, and U64 are to declare the corresponding unsigned integer
           types.

           If the platform doesn't support 64-bit integers, both I64 and U64 will
           be undefined.  Use IV and UV to declare the largest practicable, and
           ""WIDEST_UTYPE" in perlapi" for the absolute maximum unsigned, but
           which may not be usable in all circumstances.

           A numeric constant can be specified with ""INT16_C"" in perlapi,
           ""UINTMAX_C"" in perlapi, and similar.

       Working with SVs
           An SV can be created and loaded with one command.  There are five types
           of values that can be loaded: an integer value (IV), an unsigned
           integer value (UV), a double (NV), a string (PV), and another scalar
           (SV).  ("PV" stands for "Pointer Value".  You might think that it is
           misnamed because it is described as pointing only to strings.  However,
           it is possible to have it point to other things.  For example, it could
           point to an array of UVs.  But, using it for non-strings requires care,
           as the underlying assumption of much of the internals is that PVs are
           just for strings.  Often, for example, a trailing "NUL" is tacked on
           automatically.  The non-string use is documented only in this
           paragraph.)

    Notice that you can choose to specify the length of the string to be
           assigned by using "sv_setpvn", "newSVpvn", or "newSVpv", or you may
           allow Perl to calculate the length by using "sv_setpv" or by specifying
           0 as the second argument to "newSVpv".  Be warned, though, that Perl
           will determine the string's length by using "strlen", which depends on
           the string terminating with a "NUL" character, and not otherwise
           containing NULs.

           The arguments of "sv_setpvf" are processed like "sprintf", and the
           formatted output becomes the value.

           "sv_vsetpvfn" is an analogue of "vsprintf", but it allows you to
           specify either a pointer to a variable argument list or the address and
           length of an array of SVs.  The last argument points to a boolean; on
           return, if that boolean is true, then locale-specific information has
           been used to format the string, and the string's contents are therefore
           untrustworthy (see perlsec).  This pointer may be NULL if that
           information is not important.  Note that this function requires you to

    Manpage text:

    An xV that is visible at the Perl level should not become unreferenced
           and thus be destroyed.  Normally, an object will only become
           unreferenced when it is no longer visible, often by the same means that
           makes it invisible.  For example, a Perl reference value (RV) owns a
           reference to its referent, so if the RV is overwritten that reference
           gets destroyed, and the no-longer-reachable referent may be destroyed
           as a result.

           Many functions have some kind of reference manipulation as part of
           their purpose.  Sometimes this is documented in terms of ownership of
           references, and sometimes it is (less helpfully) documented in terms of
           changes to reference counts.  For example, the newRV_inc() function is
           documented to create a new RV (with reference count 1) and increment
           the reference count of the referent that was supplied by the caller.
           This is best understood as creating a new reference to the referent,
           which is owned by the created RV, and returning to the caller ownership
           of the sole reference to the RV. The newRV_noinc() function instead
           does not increment the reference count of the referent, but the RV
           nevertheless ends up owning a reference to the referent.  It is
           therefore implied that the caller of "newRV_noinc()" is relinquishing a
           reference to the referent, making this conceptually a more complicated
           operation even though it does less to the data structures.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlguts`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nFor example, imagine you want to return a reference from an XSUB\n       function.  Inside the XSUB routine, you create an SV which initially\n       has just a single reference, owned by the XSUB routine.\tThis reference\n       needs to be disposed of before the routine is complete, otherwise it\n       will leak, preventing the SV from ever being destroyed.\tSo to create\n       an RV referencing the SV, it is most convenient to pass the SV to\n       \"newRV_noinc()\", which consumes that reference.\tNow the XSUB routine\n       no longer owns a reference to the SV, but does own a reference to the\n       RV, which in turn owns a reference to the SV.  The ownership of the\n       reference to the RV is then transferred by the process of returning the\n       RV from the XSUB.\n\n       There are some convenience functions available that can help with the\n       destruction of xVs.  These functions introduce the concept of\n       \"mortality\".  Much documentation speaks of an xV itself being mortal,\n       but this is misleading.\tIt is really a reference to an xV that is\n       mortal, and it is possible for there to be more than one mortal\n       reference to a single xV.  For a reference to be mortal means that it\n       is owned by the temps stack, one of perl's many internal stacks, which\n       will destroy that reference \"a short time later\".  Usually the \"short\n       time later\" is the end of the current Perl statement.  However, it gets\n       more complicated around dynamic scopes: there can be multiple sets of\n       mortal references hanging around at the same time, with different death\n       dates.  Internally, the actual determinant for when mortal xV\n       references are destroyed depends on two macros, SAVETMPS and FREETMPS.\n       See perlcall and perlxs and \"Temporaries Stack\" below for more details\n       on these macros."

    Manpage text:

    Mortal references are mainly used for xVs that are placed on perl's
           main stack.  The stack is problematic for reference tracking, because
           it contains a lot of xV references, but doesn't own those references:
           they are not counted.  Currently, there are many bugs resulting from
           xVs being destroyed while referenced by the stack, because the stack's
           uncounted references aren't enough to keep the xVs alive.  So when
           putting an (uncounted) reference on the stack, it is vitally important
           to ensure that there will be a counted reference to the same xV that
           will last at least as long as the uncounted reference.  But it's also
           important that that counted reference be cleaned up at an appropriate
           time, and not unduly prolong the xV's life.  For there to be a mortal
           reference is often the best way to satisfy this requirement, especially
           if the xV was created especially to be put on the stack and would
           otherwise be unreferenced.

    Manpage text:

    When an uppercase and lowercase letter both exist in the table, then
           the uppercase letter is typically used to represent some kind of
           composite type (a list or a hash), and the lowercase letter is used to
           represent an element of that composite type.  Some internals code makes
           use of this case relationship.  However, 'v' and 'V' (vec and v-string)
           are in no way related.

           The "PERL_MAGIC_ext" and "PERL_MAGIC_uvar" magic types are defined
           specifically for use by extensions and will not be used by perl itself.
           Extensions can use "PERL_MAGIC_ext" magic to 'attach' private
           information to variables (typically objects).  This is especially
           useful because there is no way for normal perl code to corrupt this
           private information (unlike using extra elements of a hash object).

           Similarly, "PERL_MAGIC_uvar" magic can be used much like tie() to call
           a C function any time a scalar's value is used or changed.  The
           "MAGIC"'s "mg_ptr" field points to a "ufuncs" structure:

    WARNING: As of the 5.004 release, proper usage of the array and hash
           access functions requires understanding a few caveats.  Some of these
           caveats are actually considered bugs in the API, to be fixed in later
           releases, and are bracketed with [MAYCHANGE] below.  If you find
           yourself actually applying such information in this section, be aware
           that the behavior may change in the future, umm, without warning.

           The perl tie function associates a variable with an object that
           implements the various GET, SET, etc methods.  To perform the
           equivalent of the perl tie function from an XSUB, you must mimic this
           behaviour.  The code below carries out the necessary steps -- firstly
           it creates a new hash, and then creates a second hash which it blesses
           into the class which will implement the tie methods.  Lastly it ties
           the two hashes together, and returns a reference to the new tied hash.
           Note that the code below does NOT call the TIEHASH method in the MyTie
           class - see "Calling Perl Routines from within C Programs" for details
           on how to do this.

    Manpage text:

    Currently (as of perl version 5.004), use of the hash and array access
           functions requires the user to be aware of whether they are operating
           on "normal" hashes and arrays, or on their tied variants.  The API may
           be changed to provide more transparent access to both tied and normal
           data types in future versions.  [/MAYCHANGE]

           You would do well to understand that the TIEARRAY and TIEHASH
           interfaces are mere sugar to invoke some perl method calls while using
           the uniform hash and array syntax.  The use of this sugar imposes some
           overhead (typically about two to four extra opcodes per FETCH/STORE
           operation, in addition to the creation of all the mortal variables
           required to invoke the methods).  This overhead will be comparatively
           small if the TIE methods are themselves substantial, but if they are
           only a few statements long, the overhead will not be insignificant.

The following code will not do what you think:\n\n\t   XPUSHi(10);\n\t   XPUSHi(20);\n\n       This translates as \"set \"TARG\" to 10, push a pointer to \"TARG\" onto the\n       stack; set \"TARG\" to 20, push a pointer to \"TARG\" onto the stack\".  At\n       the end of the operation, the stack does not contain the values 10 and\n       20, but actually contains two pointers to \"TARG\", which we have set to\n       20.\n\n       If you need to push multiple different values then you should either\n       use the \"(X)PUSHs\" macros, or else use the new \"m(X)PUSH[iunp]\" macros,\n       none of which make use of \"TARG\".  The \"(X)PUSHs\" macros simply push an\n       SV* on the stack, which, as noted under \"XSUBs and the Argument Stack\",\n       will often need to be \"mortal\".\tThe new \"m(X)PUSH[iunp]\" macros make\n       this a little easier to achieve by creating a new mortal for you (via\n       \"(X)PUSHmortal\"), pushing that onto the stack (extending it if\n       necessary in the case of the \"mXPUSH[iunp]\" macros), and then setting\n       its value.

See also \"dTARGET\"\n       and \"dXSTARG\".\n\n   Scratchpads\n       The question remains on when the SVs which are targets for opcodes are\n       created.  The answer is that they are created when the current unit--a\n       subroutine or a file (for opcodes for statements outside of\n       subroutines)--is compiled.  During this time a special anonymous Perl\n       array is created, which is called a scratchpad for the current unit.\n\n       A scratchpad keeps SVs which are lexicals for the current unit and are\n       targets for opcodes.  A previous version of this document stated that\n       one can deduce that an SV lives on a scratchpad by looking on its\n       flags: lexicals have \"SVs_PADMY\" set, and targets have \"SVs_PADTMP\"\n       set.  But this has never been fully true.  \"SVs_PADMY\" could be set on\n       a variable that no longer resides in any pad.  While targets do have\n       \"SVs_PADTMP\" set, it can also be set on variables that have never\n       resided in a pad, but nonetheless act like targets.  As of perl 5.21.5,\n       the \"SVs_PADMY\" flag is no longer used and is defined as 0.\n       \"SvPADMY()\" now returns true for anything without \"SVs_PADTMP\"."

In fact it contains a pointer to an AV of\n       (initially) one element, and this element is the scratchpad AV.\tWhy do\n       we need an extra level of indirection?\n\n       The answer is recursion, and maybe threads.

    There are also some other op types: a "PMOP" holds a regular
           expression, and has no children, and a "LOOP" may or may not have
           children.  If the "op_children" field is non-zero, it behaves like a
           "LISTOP".  To complicate matters, if a "UNOP" is actually a "null" op
           after optimization (see "Compile pass 2: context propagation") it will
           still have children in accordance with its former type.

           Finally, there is a "LOGOP", or logic op. Like a "LISTOP", this has one
           or more children, but it doesn't have an "op_last" field: so you have
           to follow "op_first" and then the "OpSIBLING" chain itself to find the
           last child. Instead it has an "op_other" field, which is comparable to
           the "op_next" field described below, and represents an alternate
           execution path. Operators like "and", "or" and "?" are "LOGOP"s. Note
           that in general, "op_other" may not point to any of the direct children
           of the "LOGOP".

           Starting in version 5.21.2, perls built with the experimental define
           "-DPERL_OP_PARENT" add an extra boolean flag for each op, "op_moresib".
           When not set, this indicates that this is the last op in an "OpSIBLING"
           chain. This frees up the "op_sibling" field on the last sibling to
           point back to the parent op. Under this build, that field is also
           renamed "op_sibparent" to reflect its joint role. The macro
           OpSIBLING(o) wraps this special behaviour, and always returns NULL on
           the last sibling.  With this build the op_parent(o) function can be
           used to find the parent of any op. Thus for forward compatibility, you
           should always use the OpSIBLING(o) macro rather than accessing
           "op_sibling" directly.

    Another way to examine the tree is to use a compiler back-end module,
           such as B::Concise.

       Compile pass 1: check routines
           The tree is created by the compiler while yacc code feeds it the
           constructions it recognizes.  Since yacc works bottom-up, so does the
           first pass of perl compilation.

           What makes this pass interesting for perl developers is that some
           optimization may be performed on this pass.  This is optimization by
           so-called "check routines".  The correspondence between node names and
           corresponding check routines is described in opcode.pl (do not forget
           to run "make regen_headers" if you modify this file).

           A check routine is called when the node is fully constructed except for
           the execution-order thread.  Since at this time there are no back-links
           to the currently constructed node, one can do most any operation to the
           top-level node, including freeing it and/or creating new nodes
           above/below it.

    All this obviously requires a way for the Perl internal functions to be
           either subroutines taking some kind of structure as the first argument,
           or subroutines taking nothing as the first argument.  To enable these
           two very different ways of building the interpreter, the Perl source
           (as it does in so many other situations) makes heavy use of macros and
           subroutine naming conventions.

           First problem: deciding which functions will be public API functions
           and which will be private.  All functions whose names begin "S_" are
           private (think "S" for "secret" or "static").  All other functions
           begin with "Perl_", but just because a function begins with "Perl_"
           does not mean it is part of the API.  (See "Internal Functions".)  The
           easiest way to be sure a function is part of the API is to find its
           entry in perlapi.  If it exists in perlapi, it's part of the API.  If
           it doesn't, and you think it should be (i.e., you need it for your
           extension), submit an issue at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>

    So what happened to dTHR?
           "dTHR" was introduced in perl 5.005 to support the older thread model.
           The older thread model now uses the "THX" mechanism to pass context
           pointers around, so "dTHR" is not useful any more.  Perl 5.6.0 and
           later still have it for backward source compatibility, but it is
           defined to be a no-op.

       How do I use all this in extensions?
           When Perl is built with PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT, extensions that call any
           functions in the Perl API will need to pass the initial context
           argument somehow.  The kicker is that you will need to write it in such
           a way that the extension still compiles when Perl hasn't been built
           with PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT enabled.

           There are three ways to do this.  First, the easy but inefficient way,
           which is also the default, in order to maintain source compatibility
           with extensions: whenever XSUB.h is #included, it redefines the aTHX
           and aTHX_ macros to call a function that will return the context.
           Thus, something like:

           functions or functions used in a program in which Perl is embedded.
           Similarly, all global variables begin with "PL_".  (By convention,
           static functions start with "S_".)

           Inside the Perl core ("PERL_CORE" defined), you can get at the
           functions either with or without the "Perl_" prefix, thanks to a bunch
           of defines that live in embed.h.  Note that extension code should not
           set "PERL_CORE"; this exposes the full perl internals, and is likely to
           cause breakage of the XS in each new perl release.

           The file embed.h is generated automatically from embed.pl and
           embed.fnc.  embed.pl also creates the prototyping header files for the
           internal functions, generates the documentation and a lot of other bits
           and pieces.  It's important that when you add a new function to the
           core or change an existing one, you change the data in the table in
           embed.fnc as well.  Here's a sample entry from that table:

    Manpage text:

    In general, you either have to know what you're dealing with, or you
           have to guess.  The API function "is_utf8_string" can help; it'll tell
           you if a string contains only valid UTF-8 characters, and the chances
           of a non-UTF-8 string looking like valid UTF-8 become very small very
           quickly with increasing string length.  On a character-by-character
           basis, "isUTF8_CHAR" will tell you whether the current character in a
           string is valid UTF-8.

       How does UTF-8 represent Unicode characters?
           As mentioned above, UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes to store a
           character.  Characters with values 0...127 are stored in one byte, just
           like good ol' ASCII.  Character 128 is stored as "v194.128"; this
           continues up to character 191, which is "v194.191".  Now we've run out
           of bits (191 is binary 10111111) so we move on; character 192 is
           "v195.128".  And so it goes on, moving to three bytes at character
           2048.  "Unicode Encodings" in perlunicode has pictures of how this
           works.

    How do I pass a Perl string to a C library?
           A Perl string, conceptually, is an opaque sequence of code points.
           Many C libraries expect their inputs to be "classical" C strings, which
           are arrays of octets 1-255, terminated with a NUL byte. Your job when
           writing an interface between Perl and a C library is to define the
           mapping between Perl and that library.

           Generally speaking, "SvPVbyte" and related macros suit this task well.
           These assume that your Perl string is a "byte string", i.e., is either
           raw, undecoded input into Perl or is pre-encoded to, e.g., UTF-8.

           Alternatively, if your C library expects UTF-8 text, you can use
           "SvPVutf8" and related macros. This has the same effect as encoding to
           UTF-8 then calling the corresponding "SvPVbyte"-related macro.

           Some C libraries may expect other encodings (e.g., UTF-16LE). To give
           Perl strings to such libraries you must either do that encoding in Perl
           then use "SvPVbyte", or use an intermediary C library to convert from
           however Perl stores the string to the desired encoding.

If possible, give the string's length to the C library; if\n       that's not possible, consider rejecting strings that contain NUL bytes.\n\n       What about \"SvPV\", \"SvPV_nolen\", etc.?\n\n       Consider a 3-character Perl string \"$foo = \"\\x64\\x78\\x8c\"\".  Perl can\n       store these 3 characters either of two ways:\n\n       •   bytes: 0x64 0x78 0x8c\n\n       •   UTF-8: 0x64 0x78 0xc2 0x8c\n\n       Now let's say you convert $foo to a C string thus:\n\n\t   STRLEN strlen;\n\t   char *str = SvPV(foo_sv, strlen);\n\n       At this point \"str\" could point to a 3-byte C string or a 4-byte one.\n\n       Generally speaking, we want \"str\" to be the same regardless of how Perl\n       stores $foo, so the ambiguity here is undesirable. \"SvPVbyte\" and\n       \"SvPVutf8\" solve that by giving predictable output: use \"SvPVbyte\" if\n       your C library expects byte strings, or \"SvPVutf8\" if it expects UTF-8.\n\n       If your C library happens to support both encodings, then\n       \"SvPV\"--always in tandem with lookups to \"SvUTF8\"!--may be safe and\n       (slightly) more efficient."

When\n       otherwise unqualified, \"the stack\" usually refers to the value stack.\n\n       The various stacks have different purposes, and operate in slightly\n       different ways. Their differences are noted below.\n\n   Value Stack\n       This stack stores the values that regular perl code is operating on,\n       usually intermediate values of expressions within a statement. The\n       stack itself is formed of an array of SV pointers.\n\n       The base of this stack is pointed to by the interpreter variable\n       \"PL_stack_base\", of type \"SV **\".\n\n       The head of the stack is \"PL_stack_sp\", and points to the most\n       recently-pushed item.\n\n       Items are pushed to the stack by using the \"PUSHs()\" macro or its\n       variants described above; \"XPUSHs()\", \"mPUSHs()\", \"mXPUSHs()\" and the\n       typed versions. Note carefully that the non-\"X\" versions of these\n       macros do not check the size of the stack and assume it to be big\n       enough. These must be paired with a suitable check of the stack's size,\n       such as the \"EXTEND\" macro to ensure it is large enough. For example\n\n\t   EXTEND(SP, 4);\n\t   mPUSHi(10);\n\t   mPUSHi(20);\n\t   mPUSHi(30);\n\t   mPUSHi(40);\n\n       This is slightly more performant than making four separate checks in\n       four separate \"mXPUSHi()\" calls.\n\n       As a further performance optimisation, the various \"PUSH\" macros all\n       operate using a local variable \"SP\", rather than the interpreter-global\n       variable \"PL_stack_sp\". This variable is declared by the \"dSP\" macro -\n       though it is normally implied by XSUBs and similar so it is rare you\n       have to consider it directly. Once declared, the \"PUSH\" macros will\n       operate only on this local variable, so before invoking any other perl\n       core functions you must use the \"PUTBACK\" macro to return the value\n       from the local \"SP\" variable back to the interpreter variable.\n       Similarly, after calling a perl core function which may have had reason\n       to move the stack or push/pop values to it, you must use the \"SPAGAIN\"\n       macro which refreshes the local \"SP\" value back from the interpreter\n       one.\n\n       Items are popped from the stack by using the \"POPs\" macro or its typed\n       versions, There is also a macro \"TOPs\" that inspects the topmost item\n       without removing it.\n\n       Note specifically that SV pointers on the value stack do not contribute\n       to the overall reference count of the xVs being referred to. If newly-\n       created xVs are being pushed to the stack you must arrange for them to\n       be destroyed at a suitable time; usually by using one of the \"mPUSH*\"\n       macros or \"sv_2mortal()\" to mortalise the xV.\n\n   Mark Stack\n       The value stack stores individual perl scalar values as temporaries\n       between expressions. Some perl expressions operate on entire lists; for\n       that purpose we need to know where on the stack each list begins. This\n       is the purpose of the mark stack.\n\n       The mark stack stores integers as I32 values, which are the height of\n       the value stack at the time before the list began; thus the mark itself\n       actually points to the value stack entry one before the list. The list\n       itself starts at \"mark + 1\".\n\n       The base of this stack is pointed to by the interpreter variable\n       \"PL_markstack\", of type \"I32 *\".\n\n       The head of the stack is \"PL_markstack_ptr\", and points to the most\n       recently-pushed item.\n\n       Items are pushed to the stack by using the \"PUSHMARK()\" macro. Even\n       though the stack itself stores (value) stack indices as integers, the\n       \"PUSHMARK\" macro should be given a stack pointer directly; it will\n       calculate the index offset by comparing to the \"PL_stack_sp\" variable.\n       Thus almost always the code to perform this is\n\n\t   PUSHMARK(SP);\n\n       Items are popped from the stack by the \"POPMARK\" macro. There is also a\n       macro \"TOPMARK\" that inspects the topmost item without removing it.\n       These macros return I32 index values directly. There is also the\n       \"dMARK\" macro which declares a new SV double-pointer variable, called\n       \"mark\", which points at the marked stack slot; this is the usual macro\n       that C code will use when operating on lists given on the stack.\n\n       As noted above, the \"mark\" variable itself will point at the most\n       recently pushed value on the value stack before the list begins, and so\n       the list itself starts at \"mark + 1\". The values of the list may be\n       iterated by code such as\n\n\t   for(SV **svp = mark + 1; svp <= PL_stack_sp; svp++) {\n\t     SV *item = *svp;\n\t     ...\n\t   }\n\n       Note specifically in the case that the list is already empty, \"mark\"\n       will equal \"PL_stack_sp\".\n\n       Because the \"mark\" variable is converted to a pointer on the value\n       stack, extra care must be taken if \"EXTEND\" or any of the \"XPUSH\"\n       macros are invoked within the function, because the stack may need to\n       be moved to extend it and so the existing pointer will now be invalid.\n       If this may be a problem, a possible solution is to track the mark\n       offset as an integer and track the mark itself later on after the stack\n       had been moved.\n\n\t   I32 markoff = POPMARK;\n\n\t   ...\n\n\t   SP **mark = PL_stack_base + markoff;\n\n   Temporaries Stack\n       As noted above, xV references on the main value stack do not contribute\n       to the reference count of an xV, and so another mechanism is used to\n       track when temporary values which live on the stack must be released.\n       This is the job of the temporaries stack.\n\n       The temporaries stack stores pointers to xVs whose reference counts\n       will be decremented soon.\n\n       The base of this stack is pointed to by the interpreter variable\n       \"PL_tmps_stack\", of type \"SV **\".\n\n       The head of the stack is indexed by \"PL_tmps_ix\", an integer which\n       stores the index in the array of the most recently-pushed item.\n\n       There is no public API to directly push items to the temporaries stack.\n       Instead, the API function \"sv_2mortal()\" is used to mortalize an xV,\n       adding its address to the temporaries stack.\n\n       Likewise, there is no public API to read values from the temporaries\n       stack.  Instead, the macros \"SAVETMPS\" and \"FREETMPS\" are used. The\n       \"SAVETMPS\" macro establishes the base levels of the temporaries stack,\n       by capturing the current value of \"PL_tmps_ix\" into \"PL_tmps_floor\" and\n       saving the previous value to the save stack. Thereafter, whenever\n       \"FREETMPS\" is invoked all of the temporaries that have been pushed\n       since that level are reclaimed.\n\n       While it is common to see these two macros in pairs within an \"ENTER\"/\n       \"LEAVE\" pair, it is not necessary to match them. It is permitted to\n       invoke \"FREETMPS\" multiple times since the most recent \"SAVETMPS\"; for\n       example in a loop iterating over elements of a list. While you can\n       invoke \"SAVETMPS\" multiple times within a scope pair, it is unlikely to\n       be useful. Subsequent invocations will move the temporaries floor\n       further up, thus effectively trapping the existing temporaries to only\n       be released at the end of the scope.\n\n   Save Stack\n       The save stack is used by perl to implement the \"local\" keyword and\n       other similar behaviours; any cleanup operations that need to be\n       performed when leaving the current scope. Items pushed to this stack\n       generally capture the current value of some internal variable or state,\n       which will be restored when the scope is unwound due to leaving,\n       \"return\", \"die\", \"goto\" or other reasons.\n\n       Whereas other perl internal stacks store individual items all of the\n       same type (usually SV pointers or integers), the items pushed to the\n       save stack are formed of many different types, having multiple fields\n       to them. For example, the \"SAVEt_INT\" type needs to store both the\n       address of the \"int\" variable to restore, and the value to restore it\n       to. This information could have been stored using fields of a \"struct\",\n       but would have to be large enough to store three pointers in the\n       largest case, which would waste a lot of space in most of the smaller\n       cases.\n\n       Instead, the stack stores information in a variable-length encoding of\n       \"ANY\" structures. The final value pushed is stored in the \"UV\" field\n       which encodes the kind of item held by the preceeding items; the count\n       and types of which will depend on what kind of item is being stored.\n       The kind field is pushed last because that will be the first field to\n       be popped when unwinding items from the stack.\n\n       The base of this stack is pointed to by the interpreter variable\n       \"PL_savestack\", of type \"ANY *\".\n\n       The head of the stack is indexed by \"PL_savestack_ix\", an integer which\n       stores the index in the array at which the next item should be pushed.\n       (Note that this is different to most other stacks, which reference the\n       most recently-pushed item).\n\n       Items are pushed to the save stack by using the various \"SAVE...()\"\n       macros.\tMany of these macros take a variable and store both its\n       address and current value on the save stack, ensuring that value gets\n       restored on scope exit.\n\n\t   SAVEI8(i8)\n\t   SAVEI16(i16)\n\t   SAVEI32(i32)\n\t   SAVEINT(i)\n\t   ...\n\n       There are also a variety of other special-purpose macros which save\n       particular types or values of interest. \"SAVETMPS\" has already been\n       mentioned above.  Others include \"SAVEFREEPV\" which arranges for a PV\n       (i.e. a string buffer) to be freed, or \"SAVEDESTRUCTOR\" which arranges\n       for a given function pointer to be invoked on scope exit. A full list\n       of such macros can be found in scope.h.\n\n       There is no public API for popping individual values or items from the\n       save stack. Instead, via the scope stack, the \"ENTER\" and \"LEAVE\" pair\n       form a way to start and stop nested scopes. Leaving a nested scope via\n       \"LEAVE\" will restore all of the saved values that had been pushed since\n       the most recent \"ENTER\".\n\n   Scope Stack\n       As with the mark stack to the value stack, the scope stack forms a pair\n       with the save stack. The scope stack stores the height of the save\n       stack at which nested scopes begin, and allows the save stack to be\n       unwound back to that point when the scope is left.\n\n       When perl is built with debugging enabled, there is a second part to\n       this stack storing human-readable string names describing the type of\n       stack context. Each push operation saves the name as well as the height\n       of the save stack, and each pop operation checks the topmost name with\n       what is expected, causing an assertion failure if the name does not\n       match.\n\n       The base of this stack is pointed to by the interpreter variable\n       \"PL_scopestack\", of type \"I32 *\". If enabled, the scope stack names are\n       stored in a separate array pointed to by \"PL_scopestack_name\", of type\n       \"const char **\".\n\n       The head of the stack is indexed by \"PL_scopestack_ix\", an integer\n       which stores the index of the array or arrays at which the next item\n       should be pushed. (Note that this is different to most other stacks,\n       which reference the most recently-pushed item).\n\n       Values are pushed to the scope stack using the \"ENTER\" macro, which\n       begins a new nested scope. Any items pushed to the save stack are then\n       restored at the next nested invocation of the \"LEAVE\" macro.\n\nDynamic Scope and the Context Stack\n       Note: this section describes a non-public internal API that is subject\n       to change without notice.\n\n   Introduction to the context stack\n       In Perl, dynamic scoping refers to the runtime nesting of things like\n       subroutine calls, evals etc, as well as the entering and exiting of\n       block scopes. For example, the restoring of a \"local\"ised variable is\n       determined by the dynamic scope.\n\n       Perl tracks the dynamic scope by a data structure called the context\n       stack, which is an array of \"PERL_CONTEXT\" structures, and which is\n       itself a big union for all the types of context. Whenever a new scope\n       is entered (such as a block, a \"for\" loop, or a subroutine call), a new\n       context entry is pushed onto the stack. Similarly when leaving a block\n       or returning from a subroutine call etc. a context is popped. Since the\n       context stack represents the current dynamic scope, it can be searched.\n       For example, \"next LABEL\" searches back through the stack looking for a\n       loop context that matches the label; \"return\" pops contexts until it\n       finds a sub or eval context or similar; \"caller\" examines sub contexts\n       on the stack.\n\n       Each context entry is labelled with a context type, \"cx_type\". Typical\n       context types are \"CXt_SUB\", \"CXt_EVAL\" etc., as well as \"CXt_BLOCK\"\n       and \"CXt_NULL\" which represent a basic scope (as pushed by \"pp_enter\")\n       and a sort block. The type determines which part of the context union\n       are valid.\n\n       The main division in the context struct is between a substitution scope\n       (\"CXt_SUBST\") and block scopes, which are everything else. The former\n       is just used while executing \"s///e\", and won't be discussed further\n       here.\n\n       All the block scope types share a common base, which corresponds to\n       \"CXt_BLOCK\". This stores the old values of various scope-related\n       variables like \"PL_curpm\", as well as information about the current\n       scope, such as \"gimme\". On scope exit, the old variables are restored.\n\n       Particular block scope types store extra per-type information. For\n       example, \"CXt_SUB\" stores the currently executing CV, while the various\n       for loop types might hold the original loop variable SV. On scope exit,\n       the per-type data is processed; for example the CV has its reference\n       count decremented, and the original loop variable is restored.\n\n       The macro \"cxstack\" returns the base of the current context stack,\n       while \"cxstack_ix\" is the index of the current frame within that stack.\n\n       In fact, the context stack is actually part of a stack-of-stacks\n       system; whenever something unusual is done such as calling a \"DESTROY\"\n       or tie handler, a new stack is pushed, then popped at the end.\n\n       Note that the API described here changed considerably in perl 5.24;\n       prior to that, big macros like \"PUSHBLOCK\" and \"POPSUB\" were used; in\n       5.24 they were replaced by the inline static functions described below.\n       In addition, the ordering and detail of how these macros/function work\n       changed in many ways, often subtly. In particular they didn't handle\n       saving the savestack and temps stack positions, and required additional\n       \"ENTER\", \"SAVETMPS\" and \"LEAVE\" compared to the new functions. The old-\n       style macros will not be described further.\n\n   Pushing contexts\n       For pushing a new context, the two basic functions are \"cx =\n       cx_pushblock()\", which pushes a new basic context block and returns its\n       address, and a family of similar functions with names like\n       \"cx_pushsub(cx)\" which populate the additional type-dependent fields in\n       the \"cx\" struct. Note that \"CXt_NULL\" and \"CXt_BLOCK\" don't have their\n       own push functions, as they don't store any data beyond that pushed by\n       \"cx_pushblock\".\n\n       The fields of the context struct and the arguments to the \"cx_*\"\n       functions are subject to change between perl releases, representing\n       whatever is convenient or efficient for that release.\n\n       A typical context stack pushing can be found in \"pp_entersub\"; the\n       following shows a simplified and stripped-down example of a non-XS\n       call, along with comments showing roughly what each function does.\n\n\tdMARK;\n\tU8 gimme      = GIMME_V;\n\tbool hasargs  = cBOOL(PL_op->op_flags & OPf_STACKED);\n\tOP *retop     = PL_op->op_next;\n\tI32 old_ss_ix = PL_savestack_ix;\n\tCV *cv\t      = ....;\n\n\t/* ... make mortal copies of stack args which are PADTMPs here ... */\n\n\t/* ... do any additional savestack pushes here ... */\n\n\t/* Now push a new context entry of type 'CXt_SUB'; initially just\n\t * doing the actions common to all block types: */\n\n\tcx = cx_pushblock(CXt_SUB, gimme, MARK, old_ss_ix);\n\n\t    /* this does (approximately):\n\t\tCXINC;\t\t    /* cxstack_ix++ (grow if necessary) */\n\t\tcx = CX_CUR();\t    /* and get the address of new frame */\n\t\tcx->cx_type\t   = CXt_SUB;\n\t\tcx->blk_gimme\t   = gimme;\n\t\tcx->blk_oldsp\t   = MARK - PL_stack_base;\n\t\tcx->blk_oldsaveix  = old_ss_ix;\n\t\tcx->blk_oldcop\t   = PL_curcop;\n\t\tcx->blk_oldmarksp  = PL_markstack_ptr - PL_markstack;\n\t\tcx->blk_oldscopesp = PL_scopestack_ix;\n\t\tcx->blk_oldpm\t   = PL_curpm;\n\t\tcx->blk_old_tmpsfloor = PL_tmps_floor;\n\n\t\tPL_tmps_floor\t     = PL_tmps_ix;\n\t    */"

    Manpage text:

    Most callers of "cx_pushblock" simply set the new args stack floor to
           the top of the previous stack frame, but for "CXt_LOOP_LIST" it stores
           the items being iterated over on the stack, and so sets "blk_oldsp" to
           the top of these items instead. Note that, contrary to its name,
           "blk_oldsp" doesn't always represent the value to restore "PL_stack_sp"
           to on scope exit.

           Note the early capture of "PL_savestack_ix" to "old_ss_ix", which is
           later passed as an arg to "cx_pushblock". In the case of "pp_entersub",
           this is because, although most values needing saving are stored in
           fields of the context struct, an extra value needs saving only when the
           debugger is running, and it doesn't make sense to bloat the struct for
           this rare case. So instead it is saved on the savestack. Since this
           value gets calculated and saved before the context is pushed, it is
           necessary to pass the old value of "PL_savestack_ix" to "cx_pushblock",
           to ensure that the saved value gets freed during scope exit.  For most
           users of "cx_pushblock", where nothing needs pushing on the save stack,
           "PL_savestack_ix" is just passed directly as an arg to "cx_pushblock".

    Note that where possible, values should be saved in the context struct
           rather than on the save stack; it's much faster that way.

           Normally "cx_pushblock" should be immediately followed by the
           appropriate "cx_pushfoo", with nothing between them; this is because if
           code in-between could die (e.g. a warning upgraded to fatal), then the
           context stack unwinding code in "dounwind" would see (in the example
           above) a "CXt_SUB" context frame, but without all the subroutine-
           specific fields set, and crashes would soon ensue.

           Where the two must be separate, initially set the type to "CXt_NULL" or
           "CXt_BLOCK", and later change it to "CXt_foo" when doing the
           "cx_pushfoo". This is exactly what "pp_enteriter" does, once it's
           determined which type of loop it's pushing.

       Popping contexts
           Contexts are popped using "cx_popsub()" etc. and "cx_popblock()". Note
           however, that unlike "cx_pushblock", neither of these functions
           actually decrement the current context stack index; this is done
           separately using "CX_POP()".

    Manpage text:

    In void context no args are returned, so it's more efficient to skip
           calling "leave_adjust_stacks()". Also in void context, a "nextstate" op
           is likely to be imminently called which will do a "FREETMPS", so
           there's no need to do that either.

           The next step is to pop savestack entries: "CX_LEAVE_SCOPE(cx)" is just
           defined as "LEAVE_SCOPE(cx->blk_oldsaveix)". Note that during the
           popping, it's possible for perl to call destructors, call "STORE" to
           undo localisations of tied vars, and so on. Any of these can die or
           call "exit()". In this case, "dounwind()" will be called, and the
           current context stack frame will be re-processed. Thus it is vital that
           all steps in popping a context are done in such a way to support
           reentrancy.  The other alternative, of decrementing "cxstack_ix" before
           processing the frame, would lead to leaks and the like if something
           died halfway through, or overwriting of the current frame.

    Note that it doesn't restore "PL_stack_sp"; as mentioned earlier, which
           value to restore it to depends on the context type (specifically "for

           have been sorted out earlier by "leave_adjust_stacks()".

           Finally, the context stack pointer is actually decremented by
           "CX_POP(cx)".  After this point, it's possible that that the current
           context frame could be overwritten by other contexts being pushed.
           Although things like ties and "DESTROY" are supposed to work within a
           new context stack, it's best not to assume this. Indeed on debugging
           builds, "CX_POP(cx)" deliberately sets "cx" to null to detect code that
           is still relying on the field values in that context frame. Note in the
           "pp_leavesub()" example above, we grab "blk_sub.retop" before calling
           "CX_POP".

       Redoing contexts
           Finally, there is "cx_topblock(cx)", which acts like a
           super-"nextstate" as regards to resetting various vars to their base
           values. It is used in places like "pp_next", "pp_redo" and "pp_goto"
           where rather than exiting a scope, we want to re-initialise the scope.
           As well as resetting "PL_stack_sp" like "nextstate", it also resets
           "PL_markstack_ptr", "PL_scopestack_ix" and "PL_curpm". Note that it

    Slab-based operator allocation
           Note: this section describes a non-public internal API that is subject
           to change without notice.

           Perl's internal error-handling mechanisms implement "die" (and its
           internal equivalents) using longjmp. If this occurs during lexing,
           parsing or compilation, we must ensure that any ops allocated as part
           of the compilation process are freed. (Older Perl versions did not
           adequately handle this situation: when failing a parse, they would leak
           ops that were stored in C "auto" variables and not linked anywhere
           else.)

           To handle this situation, Perl uses op slabs that are attached to the
           currently-compiling CV. A slab is a chunk of allocated memory. New ops
           are allocated as regions of the slab. If the slab fills up, a new one
           is created (and linked from the previous one). When an error occurs and
           the CV is freed, any ops remaining are freed.

           Each op is preceded by two pointers: one points to the next op in the
           slab, and the other points to the slab that owns it. The next-op
           pointer is needed so that Perl can iterate over a slab and free all its
           ops. (Op structures are of different sizes, so the slab's ops can't
           merely be treated as a dense array.)  The slab pointer is needed for
           accessing a reference count on the slab: when the last op on a slab is
           freed, the slab itself is freed.

    Manpage text:

    The slab allocator puts the ops at the end of the slab first. This will
           tend to allocate the leaves of the op tree first, and the layout will
           therefore hopefully be cache-friendly. In addition, this means that
           there's no need to store the size of the slab (see below on why slabs
           vary in size), because Perl can follow pointers to find the last op.

           It might seem possible to eliminate slab reference counts altogether,
           by having all ops implicitly attached to "PL_compcv" when allocated and
           freed when the CV is freed. That would also allow "op_free" to skip
           "FreeOp" altogether, and thus free ops faster. But that doesn't work in
           those cases where ops need to survive beyond their CVs, such as re-
           evals.

           The CV also has to have a reference count on the slab. Sometimes the
           first op created is immediately freed. If the reference count of the
           slab reaches 0, then it will be freed with the CV still pointing to it.

    Manpage text:

    CVs use the "CVf_SLABBED" flag to indicate that the CV has a reference
           count on the slab. When this flag is set, the slab is accessible via
           "CvSTART" when "CvROOT" is not set, or by subtracting two pointers
           "(2*sizeof(I32 *))" from "CvROOT" when it is set. The alternative to
           this approach of sneaking the slab into "CvSTART" during compilation
           would be to enlarge the "xpvcv" struct by another pointer. But that
           would make all CVs larger, even though slab-based op freeing is
           typically of benefit only for programs that make significant use of
           string eval.

           When the "CVf_SLABBED" flag is set, the CV takes responsibility for
           freeing the slab. If "CvROOT" is not set when the CV is freed or
           undeffed, it is assumed that a compilation error has occurred, so the
           op slab is traversed and all the ops are freed.

           Under normal circumstances, the CV forgets about its slab (decrementing
           the reference count) when the root is attached. So the slab reference
           counting that happens when ops are freed takes care of freeing the
           slab. In some cases, the CV is told to forget about the slab
           ("cv_forget_slab") precisely so that the ops can survive after the CV
           is done away with.

    Manpage text:

    Forgetting the slab when the root is attached is not strictly
           necessary, but avoids potential problems with "CvROOT" being written
           over. There is code all over the place, both in core and on CPAN, that
           does things with "CvROOT", so forgetting the slab makes things more
           robust and avoids potential problems.

           Since the CV takes ownership of its slab when flagged, that flag is
           never copied when a CV is cloned, as one CV could free a slab that
           another CV still points to, since forced freeing of ops ignores the
           reference count (but asserts that it looks right).

           To avoid slab fragmentation, freed ops are marked as freed and attached
           to the slab's freed chain (an idea stolen from DBM::Deep). Those freed
           ops are reused when possible. Not reusing freed ops would be simpler,
           but it would result in significantly higher memory usage for programs
           with large "if (DEBUG) {...}" blocks.

           "SAVEFREEOP" is slightly problematic under this scheme. Sometimes it
           can cause an op to be freed after its CV. If the CV has forcibly freed
           the ops on its slab and the slab itself, then we will be fiddling with
           a freed slab. Making "SAVEFREEOP" a no-op doesn't help, as sometimes an
           op can be savefreed when there is no compilation error, so the op would
           never be freed. It holds a reference count on the slab, so the whole
           slab would leak. So "SAVEFREEOP" now sets a special flag on the op
           ("->op_savefree"). The forced freeing of ops after a compilation error
           won't free any ops thus marked.

    Manpage text:

    Since many pieces of code create tiny subroutines consisting of only a
           few ops, and since a huge slab would be quite a bit of baggage for
           those to carry around, the first slab is always very small. To avoid
           allocating too many slabs for a single CV, each subsequent slab is
           twice the size of the previous.

           Smartmatch expects to be able to allocate an op at run time, run it,
           and then throw it away. For that to work the op is simply malloced when
           PL_compcv hasn't been set up. So all slab-allocated ops are marked as
           such ("->op_slabbed"), to distinguish them from malloced ops.
