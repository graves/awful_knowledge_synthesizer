This prevents Postfix from\n\t\t     appending the local domain to spam from poorly written\n\t\t     remote clients.\n\n       resolve sender address\n\t      Resolve the address to a (transport, nexthop, recipient, flags)\n\t      quadruple. The meaning of the results is as follows:\n\n\t      transport\n\t\t     The delivery agent to use. This is the first field of an\n\t\t     entry in the master.cf file.\n\n\t      nexthop\n\t\t     The host to send to and optional delivery method\n\t\t     information.\n\n\t      recipient\n\t\t     The envelope recipient address that is passed on to\n\t\t     nexthop.\n\n\t      flags  The address class, whether the address requires relaying,\n\t\t     whether the address has problems, and whether the request\n\t\t     failed.\n\n       verify sender address\n\t      Resolve the address for address verification purposes.\n\nSERVER PROCESS MANAGEMENT\n       The trivial-rewrite(8) servers run under control by the Postfix master\n       server.\tEach server can handle multiple simultaneous connections.\n       When all servers are busy while a client connects, the master creates a\n       new server process, provided that the trivial-rewrite server process\n       limit is not exceeded.  Each trivial-rewrite server terminates after\n       serving at least $max_use clients of after $max_idle seconds of idle\n       time.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       None. The command does not interact with the outside world.\n\nSECURITY\n       The trivial-rewrite(8) daemon is not security sensitive.  By default,\n       this daemon does not talk to remote or local users.  It can run at a\n       fixed low privilege in a chrooted environment.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       On busy mail systems a long time may pass before a main.cf change\n       affecting trivial-rewrite(8) is picked up. Use the command \"postfix\n       reload\" to speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY CONTROLS\n\n       resolve_dequoted_address (yes)\n\t      Resolve a recipient address safely instead of correctly, by\n\t      looking inside quotes.\n\n       Available with Postfix version 2.1 and later:\n\n       resolve_null_domain (no)\n\t      Resolve an address that ends in the \"@\" null domain as if the\n\t      local hostname were specified, instead of rejecting the address\n\t      as invalid.\n\n       Available with Postfix version 2.3 and later:\n\n       resolve_numeric_domain (no)\n\t      Resolve \"user@ipaddress\" as \"user@[ipaddress]\", instead of\n\t      rejecting the address as invalid.\n\n       Available with Postfix version 2.5 and later:\n\n       allow_min_user (no)\n\t      Allow a sender or recipient address to have `-' as the first\n\t      character.\n\nADDRESS REWRITING CONTROLS\n\n       myorigin ($myhostname)\n\t      The domain name that locally-posted mail appears to come from,\n\t      and that locally posted mail is delivered to.\n\n       allow_percent_hack (yes)\n\t      Enable the rewriting of the form \"user%domain\" to \"user@domain\".\n\n       append_at_myorigin (yes)\n\t      With locally submitted mail, append the string \"@$myorigin\" to\n\t      mail addresses without domain information.\n\n       append_dot_mydomain (Postfix >= 3.0: no, Postfix < 3.0: yes)\n\t      With locally submitted mail, append the string \".$mydomain\" to\n\t      addresses that have no \".domain\" information.\n\n       recipient_delimiter (empty)\n\t      The set of characters that can separate a user name from its\n\t      extension (example: user+foo), or a .forward file name from its\n\t      extension (example: .forward+foo).\n\n       swap_bangpath (yes)\n\t      Enable the rewriting of \"site!user\" into \"user@site\".\n\n       Available in Postfix 2.2 and later:\n\n       remote_header_rewrite_domain (empty)\n\t      Don't rewrite message headers from remote clients at all when\n\t      this parameter is empty; otherwise, rewrite message headers and\n\t      append the specified domain name to incomplete addresses.\n\nROUTING CONTROLS\n       The following is applicable to Postfix version 2.0 and later.  Earlier\n       versions do not have support for: virtual_transport, relay_transport,\n       virtual_alias_domains, virtual_mailbox_domains or proxy_interfaces.\n\n       local_transport (local:$myhostname)\n\t      The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for\n\t      final delivery to domains listed with mydestination, and for\n\t      [ipaddress] destinations that match $inet_interfaces or\n\t      $proxy_interfaces.\n\n       virtual_transport (virtual)\n\t      The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for\n\t      final delivery to domains listed with $virtual_mailbox_domains.\n\n       relay_transport (relay)\n\t      The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for\n\t      remote delivery to domains listed with $relay_domains.\n\n       default_transport (smtp)\n\t      The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for\n\t      destinations that do not match $mydestination, $inet_interfaces,\n\t      $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains,\n\t      $virtual_mailbox_domains, or $relay_domains.\n\n       parent_domain_matches_subdomains (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      A list of Postfix features where the pattern \"example.com\" also\n\t      matches subdomains of example.com, instead of requiring an\n\t      explicit \".example.com\" pattern.\n\n       relayhost (empty)\n\t      The next-hop destination of non-local mail; overrides non-local\n\t      domains in recipient addresses.\n\n       transport_maps (empty)\n\t      Optional lookup tables with mappings from recipient address to\n\t      (message delivery transport, next-hop destination).\n\n       Available in Postfix version 2.3 and later:\n\n       sender_dependent_relayhost_maps (empty)\n\t      A sender-dependent override for the global relayhost parameter\n\t      setting.\n\n       Available in Postfix version 2.5 and later:\n\n       empty_address_relayhost_maps_lookup_key (<>)\n\t      The sender_dependent_relayhost_maps search string that will be\n\t      used instead of the null sender address.\n\n       Available in Postfix version 2.7 and later:\n\n       empty_address_default_transport_maps_lookup_key (<>)\n\t      The sender_dependent_default_transport_maps search string that\n\t      will be used instead of the null sender address.\n\n       sender_dependent_default_transport_maps (empty)\n\t      A sender-dependent override for the global default_transport\n\t      parameter setting.\n\nADDRESS VERIFICATION CONTROLS\n       Postfix version 2.1 introduces sender and recipient address\n       verification.  This feature is implemented by sending probe email\n       messages that are not actually delivered.  By default, address\n       verification probes use the same route as regular mail.
