    Terminology
         In PAM parlance, the application that uses PAM to authenticate a user is
         the server, and is identified for configuration purposes by a service
         name, which is often (but not necessarily) the program name.

         The user requesting authentication is called the applicant, while the
         user (usually, root) charged with verifying his identity and granting him
         the requested credentials is called the arbitrator.

         The sequence of operations the server goes through to authenticate a user
         and perform whatever task he requested is a PAM transaction; the context
         within which the server performs the requested task is called a session.

         The functionality embodied by PAM is divided into six primitives grouped
         into four facilities: authentication, account management, session
         management and password management.

       Conversation
         The PAM library expects the application to provide a conversation
         callback which it can use to communicate with the user.  Some modules may
         use specialized conversation functions to communicate with special
         hardware such as cryptographic dongles or biometric devices.  See
         pam_conv(3) for details.

    Initialization and Cleanup
         The pam_start() function initializes the PAM library and returns a handle
         which must be provided in all subsequent function calls.  The transaction
         state is contained entirely within the structure identified by this
         handle, so it is possible to conduct multiple transactions in parallel.

         The pam_end() function releases all resources associated with the
         specified context, and can be called at any time to terminate a PAM
         transaction.

       Storage
         The pam_set_item() and pam_get_item() functions set and retrieve a number
         of predefined items, including the service name, the names of the
         requesting and target users, the conversation function, and prompts.

         The pam_set_data() and pam_get_data() functions manage named chunks of
         free-form data, generally used by modules to store state from one
         invocation to another.

       Authentication
         There are two authentication primitives: pam_authenticate() and
         pam_setcred().  The former authenticates the user, while the latter
         manages his credentials.
