A\n     directory file is differentiated from a plain file by a flag in its\n     inode(5) entry.  It consists of records (directory entries) each of which\n     contains information about a file and a pointer to the file itself.\n     Directory entries may contain other directories as well as plain files;\n     such nested directories are refered to as subdirectories.\tA hierarchy of\n     directories and files is formed in this manner and is called a file\n     system (or referred to as a file system tree).\n\n     Each directory file contains two special directory entries; one is a\n     pointer to the directory itself called dot ‘.’ and the other a pointer to\n     its parent directory called dot-dot ‘..’.\tDot and dot-dot are valid\n     pathnames, however, the system root directory ‘/’, has no parent and dot-\n     dot points to itself like dot."
