The volume Foreign Servers\n       provide Xsan File System Services (FSS) to computers that do not belong\n       to the Xsan cluster of the nodes acting as Foreign Servers.  A\n       fsforeignservers file is not required, and can be used in place of or\n       in addition to the fsnameservers file.  A Foreign Server will present\n       only those file systems that are hosted locally on the Foreign Server.\n\n       Note:  Instead of using fsforeignservers, you may now configure\n       multiple clusters.  This is a more efficient and flexible way of\n       configuring groups of file systems.  Clients can now configure access\n       to multiple clusters by putting the addresses and cluster names of the\n       NSS coordinators for all clusters into the fsnameservers file.  See the\n       man page for fsnameservers."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `fsforeignservers`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nA Foreign Client is a computer that is accessing a Xsan File System via\n       a Foreign Server.  Foreign Clients do not belong to the Xsan cluster\n       per se, meaning that they cannot activate a file system or vote in\n       elections.\n\n       Typically, a fsforeignservers file entry is created on the client to\n       provide the client computer access to a specific Xsan File System on a\n       specific host.  This connection is limited to the Xsan File Systems\n       local to that host.  If additional Xsan access is desired, an entry for\n       the machine(s) hosting the desired file system must be added to the\n       fsforeignservers file.  For failover configurations, both primary and\n       secondary systems must be specified.  This file is needed only on the\n       Foreign Client, it is not needed on the Foreign Server.\tTo determine\n       what Xsan services are available, use the cvadmin(8) command with the\n       -H host option to view active file systems for each host specified in\n       the fsforeignservers file."

A fsforeignservers file\n       contains one entry per line.  It contains the IP address or hostname to\n       use as a Foreign Server.  The use of IP addresses is preferred to avoid\n       problems associated with lookup system (eg., DNS or NIS) failures. The\n       format of an fsforeignservers line is:\n\n\t  IP address\n\n       or\n\n\t  HostName\n\n       Where HostName is a host name or IP address of a host that can service\n       queries for File System Services for file systems hosted directly on\n       that host.\n\n       Lines that contain white space only or that contain the comment token\n       as the first non-white space character are ignored.\n\nFILES\n       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsforeignservers\n\nSEE ALSO\n       cvadmin(8), cvfs(8), dpserver(4), fsm(8), fsmpm(8), fsnameservers(4),\n       mount_acfs(8)"
