A patch for FreeBSD libc\n       is available (see\n       <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=misc/30631> ) which has\n       been integrated into FreeBSD 4.6.\n\n   $^X doesn't always contain a full path in FreeBSD\n       perl sets $^X where possible to a full path by asking the operating\n       system. On FreeBSD the full path of the perl interpreter is found by\n       using \"sysctl\" with \"KERN_PROC_PATHNAME\" if that is supported, else by\n       reading the symlink /proc/curproc/file. FreeBSD 7 and earlier has a bug\n       where either approach sometimes returns an incorrect value (see\n       <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=35703> ).  In these cases\n       perl will fall back to the old behaviour of using C's \"argv[0]\" value\n       for $^X.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Nicholas Clark <nick@ccl4.org>, collating wisdom supplied by Slaven\n       Rezic and Tim Bunce.\n\n       Please report any errors, updates, or suggestions to\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t\tPERLFREEBSD(1)"
