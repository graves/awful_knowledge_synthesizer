All\n\t      invokations of this method will delegate the actual work to the\n\t      remote location identified by the comm channel comm and the\n\t      endpoint id.\n\n\t      The name of the remote method invoked by the delegator is\n\t      identical to the name of the method itself.\n\n\t      Normally the generated method marshalls the arguments, and\n\t      returns the result from the remote method as its own result. If\n\t      however the option -async was specified then the generated\n\t      method will not wait for a result and return immediately.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category interp of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       comm, delegation, interpreter, method, snit\n\nCATEGORY\n       Programming tools\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2006 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the deleg_method command in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use deleg_method to create a delegated method that calls a remote procedure via a comm channel?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using deleg_method with the -async option to create a non-blocking delegated method?
