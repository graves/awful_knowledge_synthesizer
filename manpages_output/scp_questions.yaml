Local file names can be made explicit\n     using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names\n     containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.\n\n     When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used, a port\n     cannot be specified on the target if the -R option is used."
