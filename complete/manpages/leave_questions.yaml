You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the\n     actual time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.  When you log off,\n     leave exits just before it would have printed the next message.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     hhmm    The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in hours\n\t     (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and mm are minutes.  All times are\n\t     converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12\n\t     hours.\n\n     +\t     If the time is preceded by ‘+’, the alarm will go off in hours\n\t     and minutes from the current time.\n\n     If no argument is given, leave prompts with \"When do you have to leave?\".\n     A reply of newline causes leave to exit, otherwise the reply is assumed\n     to be a time.  This form is suitable for inclusion in a .login or\n     .profile."
