The interface is similar to a traditional FTP\n       client (e.g. the ftp command itself, see ftp(1)), but as it is entirely\n       done within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing\n       features, and so on, are present, and macros are particularly simple to\n       write as they are just ordinary shell functions.\n\n       The prerequisite is that the zftp command, as described in\n       zshmodules(1) , must be available in the version of zsh installed at\n       your site.  If the shell is configured to load new commands at run\n       time, it probably is: typing `zmodload zsh/zftp' will make sure (if\n       that runs silently, it has worked).  If this is not the case, it is\n       possible zftp was linked into the shell anyway: to test this, type\n       `which zftp' and if zftp is available you will get the message `zftp:\n       shell built-in command'."

    Remote globbing
           The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename generation
           (globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing the
           option -G to each of the commands.  Normally this operates by
           retrieving a complete list of files for the directory in question, then
           matching these locally against the pattern supplied.  This has the
           advantage that the full range of zsh patterns (respecting the setting
           of the option EXTENDED_GLOB) can be used.  However, it means that the
           directory part of a filename will not be expanded and must be given
           exactly.  If the remote server does not support the UNIX directory
           semantics, directory handling is problematic and it is recommended that
           globbing only be used within the current directory.  The list of files
           in the current directory, if retrieved, will be cached, so that
           subsequent globs in the same directory without an intervening zfcd are
           much faster.
