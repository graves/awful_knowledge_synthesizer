For each protocol a single line should be\n     present with the following information:\n\n\t   official protocol name\n\t   protocol number\n\t   aliases\n\n     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A\n     ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of\n     the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.\n\n     Protocol names may contain any printable character other than a field\n     delimiter, newline, or comment character.\n\nINTERACTION WITH DIRECTORY SERVICES\n     Processes generally find protocol records using one of the getprotoent(3)\n     family of functions.  On Mac OS X, these functions interact with the\n     DirectoryService(8) daemon, which reads the /etc/protocols file as well\n     as searching other directory information services to determine protocol\n     name and number information."
