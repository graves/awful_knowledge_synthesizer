Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       fddist [-r|-w]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This prints distributions for read and write events by file descriptor,\n       by process. This can be used to determine which file descriptor a\n       process is doing the most I/O with.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -r     reads only\n\n       -w     writes only\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Sample both read and write activity,\n\t      # fddist\n\n       Sample reads only,\n\t      # fddist -r\n\nFIELDS\n       EXEC   process name\n\n       PID    process ID\n\n       value  file descriptor\n\n       count  number of events\n\nBASED ON\n       /usr/demo/dtrace/lquantize.d\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       DTrace Guide \"Aggregations\" chapter (docs.sun.com)\n\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       fddist will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dtrace(1M)"
