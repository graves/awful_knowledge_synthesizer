    Manpage text:

    A remote source or directory has the syntax host:path for connecting via
         ssh(1), or rsync://host/path or host::path for connecting to a remote
         daemon.  Subsequent to the first remote source, the host may be dropped
         to become just :path or ::path.

         For connecting to a remote daemon with rsync://host or host::path, the
         first path component is interpreted as a "module": host::module/path.
         This only applies to the first source invocation; subsequent to that, the
         module should not be specified.

         By default, new destination files and directories are given the current
         time and the source file permissions.  Updated files retain their
         existing permissions.  It is an error if updated files have their file
         types change (e.g., updating a directory with a file).

         At this time, source may only consist of regular files, directories (only
         with -r), or symbolic links (only with -l).  The destination directory
         must be a directory and is created if not found.
