If no printer\n       is specified using the -p option, the default printer is used as\n       described in lp(1).\n\n       If no -l, -o, or -r options are specified, the current options are\n       reported on the standard output.\n\n       Options set with the lpoptions command are used by the lp(1) and lpr(1)\n       commands when submitting jobs.\n\n       When run by the root user, lpoptions gets and sets default options and\n       instances for all users in the /etc/cups/lpoptions file.  Otherwise,\n       the per-user defaults are managed in the ~/.cups/lpoptions file."
