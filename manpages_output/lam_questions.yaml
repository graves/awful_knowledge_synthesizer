The n-th input lines from the input files are considered\n     fragments of the single long n-th output line into which they are\n     assembled.  The name `-' means the standard input, and may be repeated.\n\n     -f min.max, -F min.max\n\t     Print line fragments according to the format string min.max,\n\t     where min is the minimum field width and max the maximum field\n\t     width.  If min begins with a zero, zeros will be added to make up\n\t     the field width, and if it begins with a `-', the fragment will\n\t     be left-adjusted within the field.  Using -f applies only to the\n\t     next file while -F applies to all subsequent files until it\n\t     appears again uncapitalized.\n\n     -p min.max, -P min.max\n\t     Like -f, but pad this file's field when end-of-file is reached\n\t     and other files are still active.\tUsing -p applies only to the\n\t     next file while -P applies to all subsequent files until it\n\t     appears again uncapitalized."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the lam command to concatenate multiple files by columns, with each column being padded to a width of 5 characters?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the effect of using the -F option with lam, and how would you apply it to a specific file in a sequence of files being processed?

This option may appear after the last file.  Using -s\n\t     applies only to the next file while -S applies to all subsequent\n\t     files until it appears again uncapitalized.\n\n     -t c, -T c\n\t     The input line terminator is c instead of a newline.  The newline\n\t     normally appended to each output line is omitted.\tUsing -t\n\t     applies only to the next file while -T applies to all subsequent\n\t     files until it appears again uncapitalized.\n\n     To print files simultaneously for easy viewing use pr(1).\n\nEXAMPLES\n     The command\n\n     lam file1 file2 file3 file4\n\n     joins 4 files together along each line.  To merge the lines from four\n     different files use\n\n     lam file1 -S \"\\\n     \" file2 file3 file4\n\n     Every 2 lines of a file may be joined on one line with\n\n     lam - - < file\n\n     and a form letter with substitutions keyed by `@' can be done with\n\n     lam -t @ letter changes"
