    You may also specify where you want the output to go with the -o option;
         if that file already exists, it is backed up first.

       Notes For Patch Senders
         There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going to be
         sending out patches:

         First, you can save people a lot of grief by keeping a patchlevel.h file
         which is patched to increment the patch level as the first diff in the
         patch file you send out.  If you put a "Prereq": line in with the patch,
         it will not let them apply patches out of order without some warning.

         Second, make sure you have specified the file names right, either in a
         context diff header, or with an "Index": line.  If you are patching
         something in a subdirectory, be sure to tell the patch user to specify a
         -p option as needed.

         Third, you can create a file by sending out a diff that compares a null
         file to the file you want to create.  If the file you want to create
         already exists in the target directory when the diff is applied, then
         patch will identify the patch as potentially reversed and offer to
         reverse the patch.

    AUTHORS
         Larry Wall with many other contributors.

    CAVEATS
         patch cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an ed script, and can
         only detect bad line numbers in a normal diff when it finds a "change" or
         a "delete" command.  A context diff using fuzz factor 3 may have the same
         problem.  Until a suitable interactive interface is added, you should
         probably do a context diff in these cases to see if the changes made
         sense.  Of course, compiling without errors is a pretty good indication
         that the patch worked, but not always.

         patch usually produces the correct results, even when it has to do a lot
         of guessing.  However, the results are guaranteed to be correct only when
         the patch is applied to exactly the same version of the file that the
         patch was generated from.

    BUGS
         Could be smarter about partial matches, excessively deviant offsets and
         swapped code, but that would take an extra pass.

         Check patch mode (-C) will fail if you try to check several patches in
         succession that build on each other.  The entire patch code would have to
         be restructured to keep temporary files around so that it can handle this
         situation.
