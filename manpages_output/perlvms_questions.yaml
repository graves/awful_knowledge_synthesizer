    NAME
           perlvms - VMS-specific documentation for Perl

    DESCRIPTION
           Gathered below are notes describing details of Perl 5's behavior on
           VMS.  They are a supplement to the regular Perl 5 documentation, so we
           have focussed on the ways in which Perl 5 functions differently under
           VMS than it does under Unix, and on the interactions between Perl and
           the rest of the operating system.  We haven't tried to duplicate
           complete descriptions of Perl features from the main Perl
           documentation, which can be found in the [.pod] subdirectory of the
           Perl distribution.

           We hope these notes will save you from confusion and lost sleep when
           writing Perl scripts on VMS.  If you find we've missed something you
           think should appear here, please don't hesitate to drop a line to
           vmsperl@perl.org.

    Installation
           Directions for building and installing Perl 5 can be found in the file
           README.vms in the main source directory of the Perl distribution.

    Organization of Perl Images
       Core Images
           During the build process, three Perl images are produced.  Miniperl.Exe
           is an executable image which contains all of the basic functionality of
           Perl, but cannot take advantage of Perl XS extensions and has a hard-
           wired list of library locations for loading pure-Perl modules.  It is
           used extensively to build and test Perl and various extensions, but is
           not installed.

           Most of the complete Perl resides in the shareable image PerlShr.Exe,
           which provides a core to which the Perl executable image and all Perl
           extensions are linked. It is generally located via the logical name
           PERLSHR.  While it's possible to put the image in SYS$SHARE to make it
           loadable, that's not recommended. And while you may wish to INSTALL the
           image for performance reasons, you should not install it with
           privileges; if you do, the result will not be what you expect as image
           privileges are disabled during Perl start-up.

    Manpage text:

    Finally, Perl.Exe is an executable image containing the main entry
           point for Perl, as well as some initialization code.  It should be
           placed in a public directory, and made world executable.  In order to
           run Perl with command line arguments, you should define a foreign
           command to invoke this image.

       Perl Extensions
           Perl extensions are packages which provide both XS and Perl code to add
           new functionality to perl.  (XS is a meta-language which simplifies
           writing C code which interacts with Perl, see perlxs for more details.)
           The Perl code for an extension is treated like any other library module
           - it's made available in your script through the appropriate "use" or
           "require" statement, and usually defines a Perl package containing the
           extension.

           The portion of the extension provided by the XS code may be connected
           to the rest of Perl in either of two ways.  In the static
           configuration, the object code for the extension is linked directly
           into PerlShr.Exe, and is initialized whenever Perl is invoked.  In the
           dynamic configuration, the extension's machine code is placed into a
           separate shareable image, which is mapped by Perl's DynaLoader when the
           extension is "use"d or "require"d in your script.  This allows you to
           maintain the extension as a separate entity, at the cost of keeping
           track of the additional shareable image.  Most extensions can be set up
           as either static or dynamic.

    We've tried to minimize the dependence of Perl library modules on Unix
           syntax, but you may find that some of these, as well as some scripts
           written for Unix systems, will require that you use Unix syntax, since
           they will assume that '/' is the directory separator, etc.  If you find
           instances of this in the Perl distribution itself, please let us know,
           so we can try to work around them.

           Also when working on Perl programs on VMS, if you need a syntax in a
           specific operating system format, then you need either to check the
           appropriate DECC$ feature logical, or call a conversion routine to
           force it to that format.

           The feature logical name DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT modifies traditional
           Perl behavior in the conversion of file specifications from Unix to VMS
           format in order to follow the extended character handling rules now
           expected by the CRTL.  Specifically, when this feature is in effect,
           the "./.../" in a Unix path is now translated to "[.^.^.^.]" instead of
           the traditional VMS "[...]".  To be compatible with what MakeMaker
           expects, if a VMS path cannot be translated to a Unix path, it is
           passed through unchanged, so "unixify("[...]")" will return "[...]".

    Filename Case
           Perl enables DECC$EFS_CASE_PRESERVE and DECC$ARGV_PARSE_STYLE by
           default.  Note that the latter only takes effect when extended parse is
           set in the process in which Perl is running.  When these features are
           explicitly disabled in the environment or the CRTL does not support
           them, Perl follows the traditional CRTL behavior of downcasing command-
           line arguments and returning file specifications in lower case only.

           N. B.  It is very easy to get tripped up using a mixture of other
           programs, external utilities, and Perl scripts that are in varying
           states of being able to handle case preservation.  For example, a file
           created by an older version of an archive utility or a build utility
           such as MMK or MMS may generate a filename in all upper case even on an
           ODS-5 volume.  If this filename is later retrieved by a Perl script or
           module in a case preserving environment, that upper case name may not
           match the mixed-case or lower-case expectations of the Perl code.  Your
           best bet is to follow an all-or-nothing approach to case preservation:
           either don't use it at all, or make sure your entire toolchain and
           application environment support and use it.

    OpenVMS Alpha v7.3-1 and later and all version of OpenVMS I64 support
           case sensitivity as a process setting (see "SET PROCESS
           /CASE_LOOKUP=SENSITIVE"). Perl does not currently support case
           sensitivity on VMS, but it may in the future, so Perl programs should
           use the "File::Spec->case_tolerant" method to determine the state, and
           not the $^O variable.

       Symbolic Links
           When built on an ODS-5 volume with symbolic links enabled, Perl by
           default supports symbolic links when the requisite support is available
           in the filesystem and CRTL (generally 64-bit OpenVMS v8.3 and later).
           There are a number of limitations and caveats to be aware of when
           working with symbolic links on VMS.  Most notably, the target of a
           valid symbolic link must be expressed as a Unix-style path and it must
           exist on a volume visible from your POSIX root (see the "SHOW ROOT"
           command in DCL help).  For further details on symbolic link
           capabilities and requirements, see chapter 12 of the CRTL manual that

       Pipes
           Input and output pipes to Perl filehandles are supported; the "file
           name" is passed to lib$spawn() for asynchronous execution.  You should
           be careful to close any pipes you have opened in a Perl script, lest
           you leave any "orphaned" subprocesses around when Perl exits.

           You may also use backticks to invoke a DCL subprocess, whose output is
           used as the return value of the expression.  The string between the
           backticks is handled as if it were the argument to the "system"
           operator (see below).  In this case, Perl will wait for the subprocess
           to complete before continuing.

           The mailbox (MBX) that perl can create to communicate with a pipe
           defaults to a buffer size of 8192 on 64-bit systems, 512 on VAX.  The

    PERL5LIB and PERLLIB
           The PERL5LIB and PERLLIB environment elements work as documented in

           The Perl forked debugger places the debugger commands and output in a
           separate X-11 terminal window so that commands and output from multiple
           processes are not mixed together.

           Perl on VMS supports an emulation of the forked debugger when Perl is
           run on a VMS system that has X11 support installed.

           To use the forked debugger, you need to have the default display set to
           an X-11 Server and some environment variables set that Unix expects.

    •   ">file" writes stdout to "file",

           •   ">>file" appends stdout to "file",

           •   "2>file" writes stderr to "file",

           •   "2>>file" appends stderr to "file", and

           •   "2>&1" redirects stderr to stdout.

           In addition, output may be piped to a subprocess, using the character
           '|'.  Anything after this character on the command line is passed to a
           subprocess for execution; the subprocess takes the output of Perl as
           its input.

           Finally, if the command line ends with '&', the entire command is run
           in the background as an asynchronous subprocess.

       Command line switches
           The following command line switches behave differently under VMS than
           described in perlrun.  Note also that in order to pass uppercase
           switches to Perl, you need to enclose them in double-quotes on the
           command line, since the CRTL downcases all unquoted strings.

           On newer 64 bit versions of OpenVMS, a process setting now controls if
           the quoting is needed to preserve the case of command line arguments.
