Any time an entry with a specific objectClass is being returned,\n       the LDAP URI-valued occurrences of a specific attribute are expanded\n       into the corresponding entries, and the values of the attributes listed\n       in the URI are added to the original entry.  No recursion is allowed,\n       to avoid potential infinite loops.  The resulting entry must comply\n       with the LDAP data model, so constraints are enforced.  For example, if\n       a SINGLE-VALUE attribute is listed, only the first value results in the\n       final entry.  The above described behavior is disabled when the\n       manageDSAit control (RFC 3296) is used.\tIn that case, the contents of\n       the dynamic group entry is returned; namely, the URLs are returned\n       instead of being expanded."

It may have multiple occurrences, and it must appear after the\n       overlay directive.\n\n       dynlist-attrset <group-oc> [<URI>] <URL-ad> [[<mapped-ad>:]<member-ad>\n       ...]   The value group-oc is the name of the objectClass that triggers\n\t      the dynamic expansion of the data.\n\n\t      The optional URI restricts expansion only to entries matching\n\t      the DN, the scope and the filter portions of the URI.\n\n\t      The value URL-ad is the name of the attributeDescription that\n\t      contains the URI that is expanded by the overlay; if none is\n\t      present, no expansion occurs.  If the intersection of the\n\t      attributes requested by the search operation (or the asserted\n\t      attribute for compares) and the attributes listed in the URI is\n\t      empty, no expansion occurs for that specific URI.  It must be a\n\t      subtype of labeledURI.\n\n\t      The value member-ad is optional; if present, the overlay behaves\n\t      as a dynamic group: this attribute will list the DN of the\n\t      entries resulting from the internal search.  In this case, the\n\t      attrs portion of the URIs in the URL-ad attribute must be\n\t      absent, and the DNs of all the entries resulting from the\n\t      expansion of the URIs are listed as values of this attribute.\n\t      Compares that assert the value of the member-ad attribute of\n\t      entries with group-oc objectClass apply as if the DN of the\n\t      entries resulting from the expansion of the URI were present in\n\t      the group-oc entry as values of the member-ad attribute.\n\n\t      Alternatively, mapped-ad can be used to remap attributes\n\t      obtained through expansion.  member-ad attributes are not filled\n\t      by expanded DN, but are remapped as mapped-ad attributes.\n\t      Multiple mapping statements can be used."

In case the URI\n       expansion is very resource-intensive and occurs frequently with well-\n       defined patterns, one should consider adding a proxycache later on in\n       the overlay stack.\n\n\nAUTHORIZATION\n       By default the expansions are performed using the identity of the\n       current LDAP user.  This identity may be overridden by setting the\n       dgIdentity attribute in the group's entry to the DN of another LDAP\n       user.  In that case the dgIdentity will be used when expanding the URIs\n       in the object.  Setting the dgIdentity to a zero-length string will\n       cause the expansions to be performed anonymously.  Note that the\n       dgIdentity attribute is defined in the dyngroup schema, and this schema\n       must be loaded before the dgIdentity authorization feature may be used.\n       If the dgAuthz attribute is also present in the group's entry, its\n       values are used to determine what identities are authorized to use the\n       dgIdentity to expand the group.\tValues of the dgAuthz attribute must\n       conform to the (experimental) OpenLDAP authz syntax."
