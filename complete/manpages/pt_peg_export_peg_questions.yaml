Write PEG format\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       package require Tcl  8.5\n\n       package require pt::peg::export::peg  ?1?\n\n       package require pt::peg::to::peg\n\n       export serial configuration\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package implements the parsing expression grammar export plugin\n       for the generation of PEG markup.\n\n       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools and\n       is intended to be used by pt::peg::export, the export manager, sitting\n       between it and the corresponding core conversion functionality provided\n       by pt::peg::to::peg.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins\n\n       While the direct use of this package with a regular interpreter is\n       possible, this is strongly disrecommended and requires a number of\n       contortions to provide the expected environment.  The proper way to use\n       this functionality depends on the situation:\n\n       [1]    In an untrusted environment the proper access is through the\n\t      package pt::peg::export and the export manager objects it\n\t      provides.\n\n       [2]    In a trusted environment however simply use the package\n\t      pt::peg::to::peg and access the core conversion functionality\n\t      directly.\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       Plugin API found in the Parser Tools Export API specification.\n\n       export serial configuration\n\t      This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing\n\t      expression grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization\n\t      format, and contained in serial, the configuration, a\n\t      dictionary, and generates PEG markup encoding the grammar.  The\n\t      created string is then returned as the result of the command.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       The PEG export plugin recognizes the following configuration variables\n       and changes its behaviour as they specify.\n\n       string template\n\t      If this configuration variable is set it is assumed to contain a\n\t      string into which to put the generated text and other\n\t      configuration data. The various locations are expected to be\n\t      specified with the following placeholders:\n\n\t      @user@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration\n\t\t     variable user.\n\n\t      @format@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the the constant PEG.\n\n\t      @file@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration\n\t\t     variable file.\n\n\t      @name@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration\n\t\t     variable name.\n\n\t      @code@ To be replaced with the generated text.\n\n       If this configuration variable is not set, or empty, then the plugin\n       falls back to a standard template, which is defined as \"@code@\".\n\n       Note that this plugin may ignore the standard configuration variables\n       user, format, file, and their values, depending on the chosen template.\n\n       The content of the standard configuration variable name, if set, is\n       used as name of the grammar in the output. Otherwise the plugin falls\n       back to the default name a_pe_grammar.\n\nPEG SPECIFICATION LANGUAGE\n       peg, a language for the specification of parsing expression grammars is\n       meant to be human readable, and writable as well, yet strict enough to\n       allow its processing by machine. Like any computer language. It was\n       defined to make writing the specification of a grammar easy, something\n       the other formats found in the Parser Tools do not lend themselves too.\n\n       It is formally specified by the grammar shown below, written in itself.\n       For a tutorial / introduction to the language please go and read the\n       PEG Language Tutorial."

This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized\n\t\t\t    choice.\n\n\t\t     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of\n\t\t\t    [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as\n\t\t\t    well.  This is the sequence.\n\n\t\t     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list *\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    kleene closure, describing zero or more\n\t\t\t    repetitions.\n\n\t\t     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list +\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    positive kleene closure, describing one or more\n\t\t\t    repetitions.\n\n\t\t     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list &\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    and lookahead predicate.\n\n\t\t     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list !\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    not lookahead predicate.\n\n\t\t     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ?\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    optional input.\n\n       Canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the\n\t      format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally\n\t      satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all\n\t      the possible serializations of this parsing expression.\n\n\t      [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical\n\t\t     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not\n\t\t     contain superfluous whitespace.\n\n\t      [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end\n\t\t     of the range are identical).\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the\n       rule"
