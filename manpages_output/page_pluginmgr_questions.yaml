    DESCRIPTION
           This package provides the plugin manager central to the page
           application. It manages the various reader, writer, configuration, and
           transformation plugins which actually process the text (read,
           transform, and write).

           All plugins are loaded into slave interpreters specially prepared for
           them. While implemented using packages they need this special
           environment and are not usable in a plain interpreter, like tclsh.
           Because of that they are only described in general terms in section
           PREDEFINED PLUGINS, and not documented as regular packages. It is
           expected that they follow the APIs specified in the sections
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the page_pluginmgr resource?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use page_pluginmgr to configure a plugin with the option 'output-format' set to 'HTML'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using page_pluginmgr to run a plugin that processes text and outputs it to a specified channel?

Each piece of location data, if provided,\n\t      is a 2-element list containing line and column numbers.\n\n       page_log_info text\n\t      Invoked to report some internal information.\n\n       page_log_warning text\n\t      Invoked to report an internal warning.\n\n       page_log_error text\n\t      Invoked to report an internal error.\n\n       It is expected that a writer plugin FOO is implemented by the package\n       page::writer::FOO.\n\n       Writer plugins are loaded by the command ::page::pluginmgr::writer. At\n       most one writer plugin can be kept in memory.\n\nTRANSFORM PLUGIN API page::transform::*\n       Transformation plugins are expected to provide the following commands,\n       described below.\n\n       page_tfeature\n\t      This command takes a feature name and returns a boolean flag\n\t      indicating whether the feature is supported by the plugin, or\n\t      not.  The result has to be true if the feature is supported, and\n\t      false otherwise.\n\n\t      See section FEATURES for the possible features the plugin\n\t      manager will ask for.\n\n       page_ttime\n\t      This command is invoked to activate the collection of timing\n\t      statistics.\n\n       page_tgettime\n\t      This command is invoked to retrieve the collected timing\n\t      statistics.\n\n       page_tlabel\n\t      This command is invoked to retrieve a human-readable label for\n\t      the plugin.\n\n       page_thelp\n\t      This command is invoked to retrieve a help text for plugin. The\n\t      text is expected to be in doctools format.\n\n       page_toptions\n\t      This command is invoked to retrieve the options understood by\n\t      the plugin.\n\n       page_tconfigure option value\n\t      This command is invoked to reconfigure the plugin, specifically\n\t      the given option is set to the new value.\n\n       page_trun chan data\n\t      This command is invoked to process the specified data and write\n\t      it to the output stream chan. The latter is a Tcl channel handle\n\t      opened for writing. The result of the command is the empty\n\t      string.\n\n       Transformation plugins expect the environment to provide the following\n       special commands.\n\n       page_info text ?from ?to??\n\t      Invoked to report some information to the user. May indicate a\n\t      location or range in the input. Each piece of location data, if\n\t      provided, is a 2-element list containing line and column\n\t      numbers.\n\n       page_warning text ?from ?to??\n\t      Invoked to report a warning to the user. May indicate a location\n\t      or range in the input. Each piece of location data, if provided,\n\t      is a 2-element list containing line and column numbers.\n\n       page_error text ?from ?to??\n\t      Invoked to report an error to the user. May indicate a location\n\t      or range in the input. Each piece of location data, if provided,\n\t      is a 2-element list containing line and column numbers.\n\n       page_log_info text\n\t      Invoked to report some internal information.\n\n       page_log_warning text\n\t      Invoked to report an internal warning.\n\n       page_log_error text\n\t      Invoked to report an internal error.\n\n       It is expected that a transformation plugin FOO is implemented by the\n       package page::transform::FOO.\n\n       Transformation plugins are loaded by the command\n       ::page::pluginmgr::transform. More than one transformation plugin can\n       be kept in memory.\n\nPREDEFINED PLUGINS\n       The following predefined plugins are known, i.e. provided by the page\n       module.\n\n       Configuration\n\n\t      peg    Returns a set of options to configure the page\n\t\t     application for the processing of a PEG grammar and the\n\t\t     generation of ME code. See the packages grammar_peg,\n\t\t     grammar_me and relations for more details.\n\n       Reader\n\n\t      hb     Expects a so-called half-baked PEG container as input and\n\t\t     returns the equivalent abstract syntax tree. See the\n\t\t     writer plugin hb for the plugin generating this type of\n\t\t     input.\n\n\t      lemon  Expects a grammar specification as understood by Richar\n\t\t     Hipp's LEMON parser generator and returns an abstract\n\t\t     syntax tree for it.\n\n\t      peg    Expects a grammar specification in the form of a parsing\n\t\t     expression grammar (PEG) and returns an abstract syntax\n\t\t     tree for it.\n\n\t      ser    Expect the serialized form of a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar as generated by the package grammar::peg as\n\t\t     input, converts it into an equivalent abstract syntax\n\t\t     tree and returns that.\n\n\t      treeser\n\t\t     Expects the serialized form of a tree as generated by the\n\t\t     package struct::tree as input and returns it, after\n\t\t     validation.\n\n       Writer\n\n\t      hb     Expects an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar as input and writes it out in the form of a so-\n\t\t     called half-baked PEG container.\n\n\t      identity\n\t\t     Takes any input and writes it as is.\n\n\t      mecpu  Expects symbolic assembler code for the MatchEngine CPU\n\t\t     (See the package grammar::me::cpu and relatives) and\n\t\t     writes it out as Tcl code for a parser.\n\n\t      me     Expects an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar as input and writes it out as Tcl code for the\n\t\t     MatchEngine (See the package grammar::me and relatives)\n\t\t     which parses input in that grammar.\n\n\t      null   Takes any input and writes nothing. The logical\n\t\t     equivalent of /dev/null.\n\n\t      peg    Expects an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar as input and writes it out in the form of a\n\t\t     canonical PEG which can be read by the reader plugin peg.\n\n\t      ser    Expects an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar as input and writes it out as a serialized PEG\n\t\t     container which can be read by the reader plugin ser.\n\n\t      tpc    Expects an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammar as input and writes it out as Tcl code\n\t\t     initializing a PEG container as provided by the package\n\t\t     grammar::peg.\n\n\t      tree   Takes any serialized tree (per package struct::tree) as\n\t\t     input and writes it out in a generic indented format.\n\n       Transformation\n\n\t      mecpu  Takes an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammer as input, generates symbolic assembler code for\n\t\t     the MatchEngine CPU, and returns that as its result (See\n\t\t     the package grammar::me::cpu and relatives).\n\n\t      reachable\n\t\t     Takes an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammer as input, performs a reachability analysis, and\n\t\t     returns the modified and annotated tree.\n\n\t      realizable\n\t\t     Takes an abstract syntax tree for a parsing expression\n\t\t     grammer as input, performs an analysis of realizability,\n\t\t     and returns the modified and annotated tree.\n\nFEATURES\n       The plugin manager currently checks the plugins for only one feature,\n       timeable. A plugin supporting this feature is assumed to be able to\n       collect timing statistics on request.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.\n       Please report such in the category page of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       page, parser generator, text processing\n\nCATEGORY\n       Page Parser Generator\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
