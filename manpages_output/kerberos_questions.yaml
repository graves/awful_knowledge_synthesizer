Its purpose is to securely\n     authenticate users and services in an insecure network environment.\n\n     This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a trusted third party,\n     keeping a database with secret keys for all users and services\n     (collectively called principals).\n\n     Each principal belongs to exactly one realm, which is the administrative\n     domain in Kerberos. A realm usually corresponds to an organisation, and\n     the realm should normally be derived from that organisation's domain\n     name. A realm is served by one or more Kerberos servers.\n\n     The authentication process involves exchange of ‘tickets’ and\n     ‘authenticators’ which together prove the principal's identity.\n\n     When you login to the Kerberos system, either through the normal system\n     login or with the kinit(1) program, you acquire a ticket granting ticket\n     which allows you to get new tickets for other services, such as telnet or\n     ftp, without giving your password."

    HISTORY
         The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late 1980's as
         part of the Athena Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
         Versions one through three never reached outside MIT, but version 4 was
         (and still is) quite popular, especially in the academic community, but
         is also used in commercial products like the AFS filesystem.

         The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the code
         was not too well written (since it had been developed over a long time),
         and it has a number of known security problems. To resolve many of these
         issues work on version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC 1510 in
         1993. IETF RFC 1510 was obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120, also known
         as Kerberos clarifications. With the arrival of IETF RFC 4120, the work
         on adding extensibility and internationalization have started (Kerberos
         extensions), and a new RFC will hopefully appear soon.
