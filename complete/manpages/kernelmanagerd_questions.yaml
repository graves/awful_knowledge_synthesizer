It runs as a standalone\n       launchd(8) daemon to handle requests from the kernel, and from other\n       user-space processes to load kernel extensions (kexts) if they are\n       available in a loaded kext collection (see kmutil(8)).  If a kext is\n       requested for load that is not yet available for loading,\n       kernelmanagerd will build the kext into the auxiliary kext collection\n       for use on the next reboot.  It is also responsible for launching\n       driver extensions on the system.\n\n       The KernelManagement utility kmutil(8) can interact with kernelmanagerd\n       for requesting loads and unloads of kernel extensions, and for querying\n       the daemon’s state.\n\n       kernelmanagerd watches the /Library/Extensions directory for changes,\n       to support installation and removal of kexts with installers.\n\nPATHS\n       /System/Library/KernelCollections\n\t      is the standard system repository of kext collections."
