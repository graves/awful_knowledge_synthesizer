The following\n       specific directives can be used to configure the retcode overlay:\n\n       retcode-parent <DN>\n\t      This directive defines the parent DN where dynamically generated\n\t      entries reside.  If not defined, the suffix of the database is\n\t      used.\n\n       retcode-item <RDN> <errCode> [op=<oplist>] [text=<message>]\n\t      [ref=<referral>] [sleeptime=<sec>] [matched=<DN>]\n\t      [unsolicited=<OID>[:<data>]]\n\t      [flags=[{pre|post}-]disconnect[,...]]\n\t      A dynamically generated entry, located below retcode-parent.\n\t      The errCode is the number of the response code; it can be in any\n\t      format supported by strtol(3).  The optional oplist is a list of\n\t      operations that cause response code generation; if absent, all\n\t      operations are affected.\tThe matched field is the matched DN\n\t      that is returned along with the error, while the text field is\n\t      an optional diagnostics message.\tThe ref field is only allowed\n\t      for the referral response code.  The sleeptime field causes\n\t      slapd(8) to sleep the specified number of seconds before\n\t      proceeding with the operation.  The unsolicited field can be\n\t      used to cause the return of an RFC 4511 unsolicited response\n\t      message; if OID is not \"0\", an extended response is generated,\n\t      with the optional data appended.\tIf flags contains disconnect,\n\t      or pre-disconnect, slapd(8) disconnects abruptly, without\n\t      notice; post-disconnect causes disconnection right after sending\n\t      response as appropriate.\n\n       retcode-indir\n\t      Enables exploitation of in-directory stored errAbsObject.  May\n\t      result in a lot of unnecessary overhead.\n\n       retcode-sleep [-]<n>\n\t      Defines a sleep time in seconds that is spent before actually\n\t      handling any operation.  If negative, a random time between 0\n\t      and the absolute value of the argument is used."
