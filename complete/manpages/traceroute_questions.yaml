Tracking the route one's packets follow\n     (or finding the miscreant gateway that's discarding your packets) can be\n     difficult.  traceroute utilizes the IP protocol `time to live' field and\n     attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along\n     the path to some host.\n\n     The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IP number.\n     The default probe datagram length is 40 bytes, but this may be increased\n     by specifying a packet size (in bytes) after the destination host name."

    This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
         management.  It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
         Because of the load it could impose on the network, it is unwise to use
         traceroute during normal operations or from automated scripts.

    AUTHOR
         Implemented by Van Jacobson from a suggestion by Steve Deering.  Debugged
         by a cast of thousands with particularly cogent suggestions or fixes from
         C. Philip Wood, Tim Seaver and Ken Adelman.

    BUGS
         When using protocols other than UDP, functionality is reduced.  In
         particular, the last packet will often appear to be lost, because even
         though it reaches the destination host, there's no way to know that
         because no ICMP message is sent back.

         The AS number capability reports information that may sometimes be
         inaccurate due to discrepancies between the contents of the routing
         database server and the current state of the Internet.
