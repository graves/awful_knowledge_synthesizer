As this document\n       is intended to be a reference the commands are listed in alphabetical\n       order, and the descriptions are relatively short.  A beginner should\n       read the much more informally written doctools language introduction\n       first.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       arg text\n\t      Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the argument of a\n\t      command. Main uses are the highlighting of command arguments in\n\t      free-form text, and for the argument parameters of the markup\n\t      commands call and usage.\n\n       arg_def type name ?mode?\n\t      Text structure. List element. Argument list. Automatically\n\t      closes the previous list element. Specifies the data-type of the\n\t      described argument of a command, its name and its i/o-mode. The\n\t      latter is optional.\n\n       bullet Deprecated. Text structure. List element. Itemized list. See\n\t      item for the canonical command to open a list item in an\n\t      itemized list.\n\n       call args\n\t      Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically\n\t      closes the previous list element. Defines the term as a command\n\t      and its arguments.  The first argument is the name of the\n\t      command described by the following free-form text, and all\n\t      arguments coming after that are descriptions of the command's\n\t      arguments.  It is expected that the arguments are marked up with\n\t      arg, method, option etc., as is appropriate, and that the\n\t      command itself is marked up with cmd.  It is expected that the\n\t      formatted term is not only printed in place, but also in the\n\t      table of contents of the document, or synopsis, depending on the\n\t      output format.\n\n       category text\n\t      Document information. Anywhere. This command registers its plain\n\t      text arguments as the category this document belongs to. If this\n\t      command is used multiple times the last value specified is used.\n\n       class text\n\t      Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a class.\n\t      The text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use\n\t      is the highlighting of class names in free-form text.\n\n       cmd text\n\t      Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the name of a Tcl\n\t      command. The text may have other markup already applied to it.\n\t      Main uses are the highlighting of commands in free-form text,\n\t      and for the command parameters of the markup commands call and\n\t      usage.\n\n       cmd_def command\n\t      Text structure. List element. Command list. Automatically closes\n\t      the previous list element. The argument specifies the name of\n\t      the Tcl command to be described by the list element. Expected to\n\t      be marked up in the output as if it had been formatted with cmd.\n\n       comment plaintext\n\t      Text markup. The argument text is marked up as a comment\n\t      standing outside of the actual text of the document. Main use is\n\t      in free-form text.\n\n       const text\n\t      Text markup. The argument is marked up as a constant value. The\n\t      text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is\n\t      the highlighting of constants in free-form text.\n\n       copyright text\n\t      Document information. Anywhere. The command registers the plain\n\t      text argument as a copyright assignment for the manpage. When\n\t      invoked more than once the assignments are accumulated.\n\n       def text\n\t      Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically\n\t      closes the previous list element. The argument text is the term\n\t      defined by the new list element. Text markup can be applied to\n\t      it.\n\n       description\n\t      Document structure. This command separates the header from the\n\t      document body.  Implicitly starts a section named \"DESCRIPTION\"\n\t      (See command section).\n\n       enum   Text structure. List element. Enumerated list. Automatically\n\t      closes the previous list element.\n\n       emph text\n\t      Text markup. The argument text is marked up as emphasized. Main\n\t      use is for general highlighting of pieces of free-form text\n\t      without attaching special meaning to the pieces.\n\n       example text\n\t      Text structure, Text markup. This command marks its argument up\n\t      as an example. Main use is the simple embedding of examples in\n\t      free-form text. It should be used if the example does not need\n\t      special markup of its own. Otherwise use a sequence of\n\t      example_begin ... example_end.\n\n       example_begin\n\t      Text structure. This commands starts an example. All text until\n\t      the next example_end belongs to the example. Line breaks,\n\t      spaces, and tabs have to be preserved literally. Examples cannot\n\t      be nested.\n\n       example_end\n\t      Text structure. This command closes the example started by the\n\t      last example_begin.\n\n       file text\n\t      Text markup. The argument is marked up as a file or directory,\n\t      i.e. in general a path. The text may have other markup already\n\t      applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of paths in free-\n\t      form text.\n\n       fun text\n\t      Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a\n\t      function. The text may have other markup already applied to it.\n\t      Main use is the highlighting of function names in free-form\n\t      text.\n\n       image name ?label?\n\t      Text markup. The argument is the symbolic name of an image and\n\t      replaced with the image itself, if a suitable variant is found\n\t      by the backend. The second argument, should it be present, will\n\t      be interpreted the human-readable description of the image, and\n\t      put into the output in a suitable position, if such is supported\n\t      by the format. The HTML format, for example, can place it into\n\t      the alt attribute of image references.\n\n       include filename\n\t      Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as\n\t      text written in the doctools markup and processed in the place\n\t      of the include command. The markup in the file has to be self-\n\t      contained. It is not possible for a markup command to cross the\n\t      file boundaries.\n\n       item   Text structure. List element. Itemized list. Automatically\n\t      closes the previous list element.\n\n       keywords args\n\t      Document information. Anywhere. This command registers all its\n\t      plain text arguments as keywords applying to this document. Each\n\t      argument is a single keyword. If this command is used multiple\n\t      times all the arguments accumulate.\n\n       lb     Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use in free-\n\t      form text.  Required to avoid interpretation of a left bracket\n\t      as the start of a markup command.\n\n       list_begin what\n\t      Text structure. This command starts a list. The exact nature of\n\t      the list is determined by the argument what of the command. This\n\t      further determines which commands are have to be used to start\n\t      the list elements. Lists can be nested, i.e. it is allowed to\n\t      start a new list within a list element.\n\n\t      The allowed types (and their associated item commands) are:\n\n\t      arguments\n\t\t     arg_def.\n\n\t      commands\n\t\t     cmd_def.\n\n\t      definitions\n\t\t     def and call.\n\n\t      enumerated\n\t\t     enum\n\n\t      itemized\n\t\t     item\n\n\t      options\n\t\t     opt_def\n\n\t      tkoptions\n\t\t     tkoption_def\n\n       Additionally the following names are recognized as shortcuts for some\n       of the regular types:\n\n\t      args   Short for arguments.\n\n\t      cmds   Short for commands.\n\n\t      enum   Short for enumerated.\n\n\t      item   Short for itemized.\n\n\t      opts   Short for options.\n\n       At last the following names are still recognized for backward\n       compatibility, but are otherwise considered to be deprecated.\n\n\t      arg    Deprecated. See arguments.\n\n\t      bullet Deprecated. See itemized.\n\n\t      cmd    Deprecated. See commands.\n\n\t      opt    Deprecated. See options.\n\n\t      tkoption\n\t\t     Deprecated. See tkoptions."

If no text is specified the title of the referenced section\n\t      is used in the output, otherwise text is used.\n\n       sectref-external text\n\t      Text markup. Like sectref, except that the section is assumed to\n\t      be in a different document and therefore doesn't need to be\n\t      identified, nor are any checks for existence made.

The argument is marked up as the name of a\n\t      variable.
