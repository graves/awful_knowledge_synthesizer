For\n     example, a valid address is:\n\n\t   eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU\n\n     Unlike some other forms of addressing, domains do not imply any routing.\n     Thus, although this address is specified as an Internet address, it might\n     travel by an alternate route if that were more convenient or efficient.\n     For example, at Berkeley, the associated message would probably go\n     directly to CS over the Ethernet rather than going via the Berkeley\n     Internet gateway.\n\n   Abbreviation.\n     Under certain circumstances it may not be necessary to type the entire\n     domain name.  In general, anything following the first dot may be omitted\n     if it is the same as the domain from which you are sending the message.\n     For example, a user on ``calder.berkeley.edu'' could send to ``eric@CS''\n     without adding the ``berkeley.edu'' since it is the same on both sending\n     and receiving hosts."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mailaddr`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n<@hosta,@hostb:user@hostc>\n\n     This specifies that the message should be sent to hosta, from there to\n     hostb, and finally to hostc.  This path is forced even if there is a more\n     efficient path to hostc.\n\n     Route-addrs occur frequently on return addresses, since these are\n     generally augmented by the software at each host.\tIt is generally\n     possible to ignore all but the ``user@hostc'' part of the address to\n     determine the actual sender.\n\n     [Note: the route-addr syntax is officially deprecated in RFC 1123 and\n     should not be used.]\n\n     Many sites also support the ``percent hack'' for simplistic routing:\n\n\t   user%hostc%hostb@hosta\n\n     is routed as indicated in the previous example.\n\n   Postmaster.\n     Every site is required to have a user or user alias designated\n     ``postmaster'' to which problems with the mail system may be addressed.\n\n   Other Networks.\n     Some other networks can be reached by giving the name of the network as\n     the last component of the domain.\tThis is not a standard feature and may\n     not be supported at all sites.  For example, messages to CSNET or BITNET\n     sites can often be sent to ``user@host.CSNET'' or ``user@host.BITNET''\n     respectively."
