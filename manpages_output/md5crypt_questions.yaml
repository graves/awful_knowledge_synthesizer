An\n       implementation of the closely related Apache MD5-crypt is also\n       available.  The output of these commands are compatible with the BSD\n       and OpenSSL implementation of md5crypt and the Apache 2 htpasswd\n       program.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::md5crypt::md5crypt password salt\n\t      Generate a BSD compatible md5-encoded password hash from the\n\t      plaintext password and a random salt (see SALT).\n\n       ::md5crypt::aprcrypt password salt\n\t      Generate an Apache compatible md5-encoded password hash from the\n\t      plaintext password and a random salt (see SALT).\n\n       ::md5crypt::salt ?length?\n\t      Generate a random salt string suitable for use with the md5crypt\n\t      and aprcrypt commands.\n\nSALT\n       The salt passed to either of the encryption schemes implemented here is\n       checked to see if it begins with the encryption scheme magic string\n       (either \"$1$\" for MD5-crypt or \"$apr1$\" for Apache crypt). If so, this\n       is removed. The remaining characters up to the next $ and up to a\n       maximum of 8 characters are then used as the salt. The salt text should\n       probably be restricted the set of ASCII alphanumeric characters plus\n       \"./\" (dot and forward-slash) - this is to preserve maximum\n       compatability with the unix password file format.\n\n       If a password is being generated rather than checked from a password\n       file then the salt command may be used to generate a random salt.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       % md5crypt::md5crypt password 01234567\n       $1$01234567$b5lh2mHyD2PdJjFfALlEz1"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the md5crypt tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use md5crypt to generate a BSD-compatible password hash for the password 'securepassword' with a salt of 'mysecretsalt', and what is the expected output format?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the md5crypt::salt command to generate a random salt string suitable for creating a password hash with the md5crypt command?
