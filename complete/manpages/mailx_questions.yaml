    Reading Mail
         In normal usage mail is given no arguments and checks your mail out of
         the post office, then prints out a one line header of each message found.
         The current message is initially the first message (numbered 1) and can
         be printed using the print command (which can be abbreviated p).  You can
         move among the messages much as you move between lines in ed(1), with the
         commands + and - moving backwards and forwards, and simple numbers.

       Disposing of Mail
         After examining a message you can delete (d) the message or reply (r) to
         it.  Deletion causes the mail program to forget about the message.  This
         is not irreversible; the message can be undeleted (u) by giving its
         number, or the mail session can be aborted by giving the exit (x)
         command.  Deleted messages will, however, usually disappear never to be
         seen again.

       Specifying Messages
         Commands such as print and delete can be given a list of message numbers
         as arguments to apply to a number of messages at once.  Thus “delete 1 2”
         deletes messages 1 and 2, while “delete 1-5” deletes messages 1 through
         5.  The special name ‘*’ addresses all messages, and ‘$’ addresses the
         last message; thus the command top which prints the first few lines of a
         message could be used in “top *” to print the first few lines of all
         messages.

Text you then type in, up to an\n     end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.\tWhile you are\n     composing a message, mail treats lines beginning with the character ‘~’\n     specially.  For instance, typing ~m (alone on a line) will place a copy\n     of the current message into the response right shifting it by a tabstop\n     (see indentprefix variable, below).  Other escapes will set up subject\n     fields, add and delete recipients to the message and allow you to escape\n     to an editor to revise the message or to a shell to run some commands.\n     (These options are given in the summary below.)\n\n   Ending a Mail Processing Session\n     You can end a mail session with the quit (q) command.  Messages which\n     have been examined go to your mbox file unless they have been deleted in\n     which case they are discarded.  Unexamined messages go back to the post\n     office.
