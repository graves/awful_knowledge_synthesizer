All CoreStorage objects are uniquely\n     identified by UUIDs.  This can be useful when copying an initial \"canned\n     image\" onto multiple machines to establish these as independent volumes.\n\n     The device parameter(s) should be path(s) to the \"raw\" (character\n     special) disk device(s) such as /dev/rdisk1s1 that constitute the\n     CoreStorage logical volume group.\tIf you specify a \"non-raw\" (block\n     special) path such as /dev/disk1s1, or just the disk name such as\n     disk1s1, it will automatically be converted to the corresponding raw disk\n     device (/dev/rdisk1s1).\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n\t   -v\t   Output verbose progress information of each step and the\n\t\t   UUID re-mappings."

  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using csunique to dry-run the UUID rewrite process on the raw device /dev/rdisk1s1?
