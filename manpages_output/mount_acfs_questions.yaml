This command is normally executed by mount(8) when\n       the -t acfs option is used.\n\n       Each client file system must communicate with a File System Manager\n       (FSM) running either locally or on a remote host.  The FSM manages all\n       the activity for the client in terms of storage allocation and\n       metadata. Data transfers go directly between disks and the client.\n\n       The mount_acfs command supports mounting file systems that are running\n       in a cluster other than your default cluster. Your default cluster is\n       defined with the fsmcluster(4) file or, if this doesn't exist, the\n       default is _cluster0/_addom0.  When mounting a file system in a non-\n       default cluster, the filesystem must be qualified with the correct\n       cluster information. The syntax is filesystem@<cluster>[/addom]."

Any\n\t      subsequent I/O will fail until the volume's disks are visible\n\t      through the Xsan portmapper.\n\n       diskproxy={client|server|both}\n\t      If the diskproxy option is set to client, then the mount may use\n\t      a  Proxy Server to do its data I/O. If the client host has SAN\n\t      connectivity to some or all of the disks in the file system,\n\t      then those disks will be accessed via the SAN connection, not\n\t      the network. This client is then referred to as a disk proxy\n\t      hybrid client.  When SAN connectivity is used, the server\n\t      license on the MDC will be charged for this mount. If it is\n\t      desired that this client use the network for the mount, then the\n\t      disks should be made unavailable to this host or the cvpaths\n\t      file should be configured to prevent StorNext from using the\n\t      directly attached disks. The who subcommand of cvadmin shows the\n\t      type of proxy mount.\n\n\t      If the diskproxy option is set to server, then this system will\n\t      become a Proxy Server for this file system.  A dpserver\n\t      configuration file must exist to define the operating parameters\n\t      for the Server.  See dpserver(4) and sndpscfg(8) for details.\n\n\t      A set of proxy servers may be configured in a sparse manner\n\t      where each server sees only a subset of the disks in the file\n\t      system. The servers make use of the \"diskless\" mount option. The\n\t      proxy client will issue disk i/o requests to the appropriate\n\t      server. No special configuration is needed on the client. A\n\t      proxy server configured this way will not be able to access\n\t      disks it does not see locally.\n\n\t      If the diskproxy option is set to both, then the host acts as\n\t      both a client and a server. This overcomes the issues of the\n\t      sparse proxy server configuration mentioned above. This option\n\t      is only supported on Linux.\n\n\t      Note: The diskproxy option is available only on Linux and OS X\n\t      systems, and the server option is available on Linux systems.\n\t      The diskproxy selection on Windows clients is made through the\n\t      Client Configuration utility.\n\n       proxypath={balance|rotate|sticky|filestickybalance|filestickyrotate}\n\t      Only used if the diskproxy option is set to client, controls the\n\t      algorithm used to balance I/O across Proxy Server connections.\n\n\t      The proxy client keeps track of bytes of I/O pending, bytes of\n\t      I/O completed and the elapsed time for each I/O request. It uses\n\t      these values and certain rules to determine the server that is\n\t      used for subsequent I/O requests. These collected counters are\n\t      decayed over time so that only the most recent (minute or so)\n\t      I/O requests are relevant.\n\n\t      There are two main components of the selection - the algorithm\n\t      itself and the use of file sticky behavior. The algorithms are\n\t      balance, rotate and sticky.\n\n\t      The balance algorithm attempts to keep the same amount of time's\n\t      worth of I/O outstanding on each connection. i.e. Faster links\n\t      will tend to get more of the I/O.  A link could be faster\n\t      because a given server is more efficient or less busy. It also\n\t      may be the case that network traffic over a given link uses\n\t      higher speed interconnects such as 10G ethernet.\n\n\t      The rotate algorithm attempts to keep the same number of bytes\n\t      of I/O pending on each Proxy Server connection.  This is similar\n\t      to balance in that servers which respond more quickly to I/O\n\t      requests will have the outstanding I/O bytes reduced at a more\n\t      rapid pace than slower servers and will thus be used more often\n\t      than slower links.\n\n\t      The difference between balance and rotate is that with balance,\n\t      higher speed links will have more bytes of I/O outstanding than\n\t      slower links.\n\n\t      In both balance and rotate, if more than one path has the best\n\t      score, a pseudo-random selection among the winning paths is made\n\t      to break the tie.\n\n\t      The sticky algorithm assigns I/O to specific luns to specific\n\t      Proxy Server connections.\n\n\t      Filesticky behavior attempts to assign I/O for a given file to a\n\t      specific proxy server. It does this by using the file's inode\n\t      number modulo the number of servers to select a server index.\n\t      Since all clients see the same inode number for a given file,\n\t      all clients will select the same server.\tIf there is more than\n\t      one path to that server, then the algorithm (balance or rotate)\n\t      will be used to select among the paths.\n\n\t      Filesticky behavior is controlled through a mount option.\n\n\t      When no proxypath mount option is specified, the balance option\n\t      is selected.\n\n\t      For mount options balance and rotate, filesticky is not\n\t      selected. For filestickybalance and filestickyrotate filesticky\n\t      is selected.\n\n\t      Note: The proxypath mount option is available only on Linux, OS\n\t      X, and Solaris systems.  The proxypath options are selected on\n\t      Windows clients through the Client Configuration utility.\n\n       proxyclient_max_conns=n\n\t      Only used if the diskproxy option is set to client.  This\n\t      parameter is used to limit the number of LAN client connections\n\t      made per gateway. It overrides the server_conn_count parameter\n\t      in the dpserver(4) file. However, it can only be used to\n\t      decrease the number of connections. If the value of\n\t      proxyclient_max_conns is equal to or larger than\n\t      server_conn_count, it has no effect.\n\n\t      The minimum value is 1 and the maximum is 16 which is also the\n\t      default.\n\n       proxyclient_rto=n\n\t      Only used if the diskproxy option is set to client.  Defines the\n\t      starting value in seconds to wait for a Proxy Client I/O read\n\t      request to complete before disconnecting from the Proxy Server\n\t      and resubmitting the request to a different Proxy Server. If\n\t      reads are completing but coming close to the configured timeout,\n\t      the timeout will be increased.\n\n\t      The minimum value is 1 second, maximum is 3600 and the default\n\t      value is 15.\n\n\t      Note: This option is available only on Linux, OS X, and Solaris\n\t      systems.\n\n       proxyclient_wto=n\n\t      Only used if the diskproxy option is set to client.  Defines the\n\t      starting value in seconds to wait for a Proxy Client I/O write\n\t      request to complete before disconnecting from the Proxy Server\n\t      and resubmitting the request to a different Proxy Server. If\n\t      writes are completing but coming close to the configured\n\t      timeout, the timeout will be increased.\n\n\t      The minimum value is 1 second, maximum is 3600 and the default\n\t      value is 30.\n\n\t      Note: This option is available only on Linux and Solaris\n\t      systems.\n\n       proxyclient_wrq=n\n\t      Only used if the diskproxy option is set to client.  Defines the\n\t      number of seconds to wait for lost write requests.  A lost write\n\t      request is an active write through a gateway and the connection\n\t      to that gateway is unexpectedly lost.  These writes may or may\n\t      not have been flushed to disk or even started at the time the\n\t      client notices the connection is lost.  The default behavior (0)\n\t      is that lost writes are immediately re-queued to an available\n\t      gateway.\tIf the connection to the gateway over which the lost\n\t      writes were sent is reactivated, the gateway will be queried if\n\t      any writes from this connection are still active. If there are\n\t      none, such as would be the case if the server unexpectedly re-\n\t      booted, the client will immediately requeue all lost writes from\n\t      the previous connection to this gateway.\tA value of -1\n\t      indicates that the client will never time out lost writes.\n\n\t      The minimum value is -1, maximum is 2147483647 and the default\n\t      is 0.\n\n\t      Note: This option is available only on Linux systems.\n\n       atimedelay={yes|no}\n\t      Default: no\n\n\t      Perform lazy atime updates. This option improves performance by\n\t      waiting until closing a file before updating the atime value of\n\t      the file. This reduces extra network traffic and latency linked\n\t      to atime updates.\n\n       nrtiotokenhold=n\n\t      Default: 60\n\n\t      The QOS Token Hold Time (nrtiotokenhold) parameter is only\n\t      applicable when using the Xsan Quality of Service (QOS) feature\n\t      for real-time I/O.  The parameter determines the number of\n\t      seconds that a client storage pool will hold on to a non-\n\t      realtime I/O token during periods of inactivity. If no I/O is\n\t      performed on a storage pool within the specified number of\n\t      seconds, the token will be released back to the FSM.\n\n\t      The parameter should be specified in five second increments; if\n\t      the parameter is not a multiple of five, it will be rounded up\n\t      automatically.\n\n       auto_concwrite={yes|no}\n\t      Default: no\n\n\t      When set to yes, allows multiple threads to write to files\n\t      concurrently.\n\n\t      Note: setting auto_concwrite=yes requires that sparse=no also be\n\t      specified.  Also, protect_alloc=yes is disallowed with\n\t      auto_concwrite=yes.\n\n       verbose={yes|no}\n\t      Default: no\n\n\t      When set to yes, mount_acfs will display configuration\n\t      information about the volume being mounted.\n\n       debug={yes|no}\n\t      Default: no\n\n\t      When set to yes, mount_acfs will display debugging information.\n\t      This can be useful in diagnosing configuration or disk problems.\n\n       mnt_retrans=n\n\t      Default: 1\n\n\t      Indicates the number of retransmission attempts the file system\n\t      will make during the execution of the mount(2) system call.\n\t      Until the volume is mounted, the kernel will only retransmit\n\t      messages to the FSM mnt_retrans times.  This parameter works in\n\t      conjunction with the mnt_recon parameter.  This can help reduce\n\t      the amount of time a mount command will hang during boot; see\n\t      the mnt_type option.\n\n       mnt_recon={hard|soft}\n\t      Default: soft\n\n\t      Controls whether after mnt_retrans attempts at contacting the\n\t      FSS during the mounting and unmounting of a volume, the kernel\n\t      will either give up or continue retrying forever. It is\n\t      advisable to leave this option at soft so that an unresponsive\n\t      FSS does not hang the client during boot.\n\n       mnt_type={bg|fg}\n\t      Default: fg (foreground)\n\n\t      Setting mnt_type to bg will cause the mount to run in the\n\t      background if the mount of the indicated volume fails.\n\t      mount_acfs will retry the mount mnt_retry number of times before\n\t      giving up.  Without this option, an unresponsive FSM could cause\n\t      a machine to hang during boot while attempting to mount Xsan\n\t      volumes.\n\n\t      During background mounts, all output is re-directed to\n\t      /var/adm/SYSLOG.\n\n       mnt_retry=n\n\t      Default: Depends on mnt_type. If mnt_type==fg, mnt_retry=5\n\t      otherwise mnt_retry=500.\n\n\t      If a mount attempt fails, retry the connection up to n times.\n\n       retrans=n\n\t      Default: 5\n\n\t      Indicates the number of attempts that the kernel will make to\n\t      transmit a message to the FSM. If no response to a transmitted\n\t      message arrives in the amount of time indicated by the timeout\n\t      parameter, the request will be retransmitted. If the volume was\n\t      mounted with the recon=soft parameter, the file system will give\n\t      up after retrans attempts at sending the message to the FSM and\n\t      will return an error to the user.\n\n       recon={hard|soft}\n\t      Default: hard\n\n\t      This option controls whether after retrans attempts at sending a\n\t      message to the FSM, the file system will give up or continue\n\t      retrying forever. For hard mounted volumes, the kernel will\n\t      retry the connection attempt forever, regardless of the value of\n\t      the retrans field.  For soft mounted volumes, the kernel will\n\t      only try retrans number of times before giving up and returning\n\t      an error of ETIME (62).\n\n       timeout=n\n\t      Default: 100 (ten seconds)\n\n\t      The timeout value, in tenths of a second (0.1 seconds) to use\n\t      when sending message to the FSM.\tIf no response is received\n\t      from the FSM in the indicated period the request is tried again.\n\t      On heavily loaded systems, you may want to adjust the timeout\n\t      value higher.\n\n       syslog={none|notice|info|debug}\n\t      Default: notice\n\n\t      During normal operations, certain messages will be logged to the\n\t      system console using the syslog facility. debug is the most\n\t      verbose, with notice being reserved for critical information.\n\t      It is important to note that the syslog level is global per\n\t      system, not unique to each volume. Changing the level for one\n\t      volume will affect all other Xsan volumes.\n\n       dircachesize=n\n\t      Default: 10 MB\n\n\t      This option sets the size of the directory cache. Directory\n\t      entries are cached on the client to reduce client-FSM\n\t      communications during directory reads.  Note: the directory\n\t      cache on a client is shared across all mounted Xsan volumes.  If\n\t      different values of dircachesize are specified for multiple file\n\t      systems, the maximum is used.  When applying this setting,\n\t      ensure that the system has sufficient kernel memory.\n\n\t      Can be specified in bytes (e.g. 2097152), kilobytes (e.g.\n\t      2048k), or megabytes (e.g. 2m).\n\n       cvnode_max=n\n\t      Default: varies by platform.\n\n\t      This option sets the maximum number of cvnode entries cached on\n\t      the client.  Caching cvnode entries improves performance by\n\t      reducing Client-FSM communication. However, each cached cvnode\n\t      entry must be maintained by the FSM as well. In environments\n\t      with many Xsan clients the FSM may be overloaded with cvnode\n\t      references. In this case reducing the size of the client cvnode\n\t      cache will alleviate this issue.\n\n       max_dma=n\n\t      LINUX ONLY\n\n\t      Default: varies by platform.\n\n\t      This option tells the kernel the maximum DMA size a user process\n\t      can issue. This can impact the number of concurrent I/Os the\n\t      file system issues to the driver for a user I/O. There are other\n\t      factors that can also limit the number of concurrent I/Os. The\n\t      default is 512m\n\t       on Linux.  WARNING: Incorrectly setting this value may degrade\n\t      performance or cause a crash/hang.\n\n       max_dev=n\n\t      LINUX ONLY\n\n\t      Default: Linux: 512M with Linux DM/Multipath. 512K with StorNext\n\t      multipath.\n\n\t      This option tells the kernel the maximum I/O size to use when\n\t      issuing I/Os to the underlying disk driver handling a LUN.  The\n\t      file system attempts to get the maximum I/O size using the\n\t      IOCINFO ioctl. Since the ioctl is not always reliable, this\n\t      mount option exists to override the ioctl return value.  Example\n\t      usage max_dev=1m or max_dev=256k.  WARNING: Incorrectly setting\n\t      this value may result in I/O failures or cause a crash/hang. For\n\t      Linux clients, only use when recommended by Quantum Support.\n\n       sparse={yes|no}\n\t      Default: yes.\n\n\t      Some utilities detect \"holes\" in a file and assume the file\n\t      system will fill the hole with zeroes. To ensure that Xsan\n\t      writes zeroes to allocated, but uninitialized areas on the disk,\n\t      set sparse=yes.\n\nDISK DEVICES\n       mount_acfs will query the local portmapper for the list of all\n       accessible Xsan disk devices. Xsan disks are recognized by their label.\n       This list is matched with the list of devices for each storage pool in\n       the volume. If any disk is missing, I/O will be prohibited, and you\n       will receive I/O errors.\n\nRECONNECT\n       A socket is maintained for each unique Xsan client file system for\n       sending and receiving commands to and from the FSM. If the socket\n       connection is lost for any reason, it must be reconnected.\n\n       There are two daemons involved in re-establishing the connection\n       between an Xsan client and the FSM. The first is the socket input\n       daemon, which is a dedicated daemon that handles all input from the\n       FSM. The second is the reconnect daemon, which handles the work of re-\n       establishing the logical connection with the FSM. Both of these daemons\n       appear as cvfsd in the output from ps.\n\n       Messages will be printed on the system console and to syslog during\n       reconnect processing; the verbosity of the messages displayed can be\n       controlled via the syslog= parameter and cvdb(8).\n\n       When the socket input daemon detects that the connection has been lost,\n       it will attempt to first connect to the fsm portmapper process,\n       fsmpm(8).  Once it has succeeded and has the port number of the fsm(8)\n\tto use, it attempts to create a new socket to the FSM using the port\n       number returned by fsmportmapper.\n\n       If no response is received from either the Xsan portmapper or the FSM,\n       the daemon will pend for the amount of time specified by the timeout=\n       parameter.  The socket input daemon will attempt to reconnect to the\n       FSM forever.\n\n       If any of the configuration parameters in the FSM configuration file\n       changed, then the connection will be terminated, and no further I/O\n       will be allowed. The only recourse will be to unmount and remount the\n       volumes.  See snfs_config(5) (part of the cvfs_server product) for more\n       information on configuring the FSM.\n\nINTERRUPTIBLE SLEEPS\n       Whenever a process must go to sleep in the Xsan file system, the sleep\n       is interruptible, meaning that the process can be sent a signal and the\n       operation will fail with an error (usually EINTR). The only exceptions\n       are when a process is executing the exit(2) system call and is closing\n       out all open files; due to Unix limitations, processes are immune to\n       signals at that point.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       To mount a volume that is described by the FSS configuration file\n       myvolume.cfg on that host:"
