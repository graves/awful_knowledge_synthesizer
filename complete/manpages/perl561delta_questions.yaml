    Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be
           enabled using the -Dusethreads Configure option (see win32/Makefile for
           how to enable it on Windows.)  The resulting perl executable will be
           functionally identical to one that was built with -Dmultiplicity, but
           the perl_clone() API call will only be available in the former.

           -Dusethreads enables the cpp macro USE_ITHREADS by default, which in
           turn enables Perl source code changes that provide a clear separation
           between the op tree and the data it operates with.  The former is
           immutable, and can therefore be shared between an interpreter and all
           of its clones, while the latter is considered local to each
           interpreter, and is therefore copied for each clone.

           Note that building Perl with the -Dusemultiplicity Configure option is
           adequate if you wish to run multiple independent interpreters
           concurrently in different threads.  -Dusethreads only provides the

    Manpage text:

    The v1.2.3 syntax is also now legal in Perl.  See "Support for strings
           represented as a vector of ordinals" for more on that.

           To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three
           significant digits for each version component, the method used for
           incrementing the subversion number has also changed slightly.  We
           assume that versions older than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the
           subversion component in multiples of 10.  Versions after v5.6.0 will
           increment them by 1.  Thus, using the new notation, 5.005_03 is the
           "same" as v5.5.30, and the first maintenance version following v5.6.0
           will be v5.6.1 (which should be read as being equivalent to a floating
           point value of 5.006_001 in the older format, stored in $]).

       New syntax for declaring subroutine attributes
           Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a method call or
           as requiring an automatic lock() when it is entered, you had to declare
           that with a "use attrs" pragma in the body of the subroutine.  That can
           now be accomplished with declaration syntax, like this:

       Some arrows may be omitted in calls through references
           Perl now allows the arrow to be omitted in many constructs involving
           subroutine calls through references.  For example, "$foo[10]->('foo')"
           may now be written "$foo[10]('foo')".  This is rather similar to how
           the arrow may be omitted from "$foo[10]->{'foo'}".  Note however, that
           the arrow is still required for "foo(10)->('bar')".

       Boolean assignment operators are legal lvalues
           Constructs such as "($a ||= 2) += 1" are now allowed.

       exists() is supported on subroutine names
           The exists() builtin now works on subroutine names.  A subroutine is
           considered to exist if it has been declared (even if implicitly).  See
           "exists" in perlfunc for examples.

       exists() and delete() are supported on array elements
           The exists() and delete() builtins now work on simple arrays as well.

    Manpage text:

    exists() can be used to check whether an array element has been
           initialized.  This avoids autovivifying array elements that don't
           exist.  If the array is tied, the EXISTS() method in the corresponding
           tied package will be invoked.

           delete() may be used to remove an element from the array and return it.
           The array element at that position returns to its uninitialized state,
           so that testing for the same element with exists() will return false.
           If the element happens to be the one at the end, the size of the array
           also shrinks up to the highest element that tests true for exists(), or
           0 if none such is found.  If the array is tied, the DELETE() method in
           the corresponding tied package will be invoked.

    Support for non-Unix platforms has been improved.

       perldoc
           "perldoc" has been reworked to avoid possible security holes.  It will
           not by default let itself be run as the superuser, but you may still
           use the -U switch to try to make it drop privileges first.

       The Perl Debugger
           Many bug fixes and enhancements were added to perl5db.pl, the Perl
           debugger.  The help documentation was rearranged.  New commands include
           "< ?", "> ?", and "{ ?" to list out current actions, "man docpage" to
           run your doc viewer on some perl docset, and support for quoted
           options.  The help information was rearranged, and should be viewable
           once again if you're using less as your pager.  A serious security hole
           was plugged--you should immediately remove all older versions of the
           Perl debugger as installed in previous releases, all the way back to
           perl3, from your system to avoid being bitten by this.

    Improved Documentation
           Many of the platform-specific README files are now part of the perl

    Optimized assignments to lexical variables
           Certain operations in the RHS of assignment statements have been
           optimized to directly set the lexical variable on the LHS, eliminating
           redundant copying overheads.

       Faster subroutine calls
           Minor changes in how subroutine calls are handled internally provide
           marginal improvements in performance.

       delete(), each(), values() and hash iteration are faster
           The hash values returned by delete(), each(), values() and hashes in a
           list context are the actual values in the hash, instead of copies.
           This results in significantly better performance, because it eliminates
           needless copying in most situations.

    Installation and Configuration Improvements
       -Dusethreads means something different
           The -Dusethreads flag now enables the experimental interpreter-based
           thread support by default.  To get the flavor of experimental threads
           that was in 5.005 instead, you need to run Configure with "-Dusethreads

    Long Doubles
           Some platforms have "long doubles", floating point numbers of even
           larger range than ordinary "doubles".  To enable using long doubles for
           Perl's scalars, use -Duselongdouble.

       -Dusemorebits
           You can enable both -Duse64bitint and -Duselongdouble with
           -Dusemorebits.  See also "64-bit support".

       -Duselargefiles
           Some platforms support system APIs that are capable of handling large
           files (typically, files larger than two gigabytes).  Perl will try to
           use these APIs if you ask for -Duselargefiles.

           See "Large file support" for more information.

       installusrbinperl
           You can use "Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl" which causes installperl to

           prefer not to modify /usr/bin for some reason or another but harmful
           because many scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.

           You can use "Configure -Dusesocks" which causes Perl to probe for the
           SOCKS proxy protocol library (v5, not v4).  For more information on

    The mechanism for reporting such errors has been reimplemented to queue
           compile-time errors and report them at the end of the compilation as
           true errors rather than as warnings.  This fixes cases where error
           messages leaked through in the form of warnings when code was compiled
           at run time using "eval STRING", and also allows such errors to be
           reliably trapped using "eval "..."".

       Implicitly closed filehandles are safer
           Sometimes implicitly closed filehandles (as when they are localized,
           and Perl automatically closes them on exiting the scope) could
           inadvertently set $? or $!.  This has been corrected.

       Behavior of list slices is more consistent
           When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice of an
           array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if the result
           happened to be composed of all undef values.

           The new behavior is to produce an empty list if (and only if) the

    Locale bugs fixed
           printf() and sprintf() previously reset the numeric locale back to the
           default "C" locale.  This has been fixed.

           Numbers formatted according to the local numeric locale (such as using
           a decimal comma instead of a decimal dot) caused "isn't numeric"
           warnings, even while the operations accessing those numbers produced
           correct results.  These warnings have been discontinued.

       Memory leaks
           The "eval 'return sub {...}'" construct could sometimes leak memory.
           This has been fixed.

           Operations that aren't filehandle constructors used to leak memory when
           used on invalid filehandles.  This has been fixed.

           Constructs that modified @_ could fail to deallocate values in @_ and
           thus leak memory.  This has been corrected.

       Spurious subroutine stubs after failed subroutine calls
           Perl could sometimes create empty subroutine stubs when a subroutine
           was not found in the package.  Such cases stopped later method lookups
           from progressing into base packages.  This has been corrected.
