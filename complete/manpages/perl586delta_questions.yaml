Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl586delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERL586DELTA(1)        Perl Programmers Reference Guide        PERL586DELTA(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perl586delta - what is new for perl v5.8.6\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This document describes differences between the 5.8.5 release and the\n       5.8.6 release.\n\nIncompatible Changes\n       There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.5.\n\nCore Enhancements\n       The perl interpreter is now more tolerant of UTF-16-encoded scripts.\n\n       On Win32, Perl can now use non-IFS compatible LSPs, which allows Perl\n       to work in conjunction with firewalls such as McAfee Guardian. For full\n       details see the file README.win32, particularly if you're running\n       Win95.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n       •   With the \"base\" pragma, an intermediate class with no fields used\n\t   to messes up private fields in the base class. This has been fixed.\n\n       •   Cwd upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of the new PathTools\n\t   distribution)\n\n       •   Devel::PPPort upgraded to version 3.03\n\n       •   File::Spec upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of the new PathTools\n\t   distribution)\n\n       •   Encode upgraded to version 2.08\n\n       •   ExtUtils::MakeMaker remains at version 6.17, as later stable\n\t   releases currently available on CPAN have some issues with core\n\t   modules on some core platforms.\n\n       •   I18N::LangTags upgraded to version 0.35\n\n       •   Math::BigInt upgraded to version 1.73\n\n       •   Math::BigRat upgraded to version 0.13\n\n       •   MIME::Base64 upgraded to version 3.05\n\n       •   POSIX::sigprocmask function can now retrieve the current signal\n\t   mask without also setting it.\n\n       •   Time::HiRes upgraded to version 1.65\n\nUtility Changes\n       Perl has a new -dt command-line flag, which enables threads support in\n       the debugger.\n\nPerformance Enhancements\n       \"reverse sort ...\" is now optimized to sort in reverse, avoiding the\n       generation of a temporary intermediate list.\n\n       \"for (reverse @foo)\" now iterates in reverse, avoiding the generation\n       of a temporary reversed list.\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       The regexp engine is now more robust when given invalid utf8 input, as\n       is sometimes generated by buggy XS modules.\n\n       \"foreach\" on threads::shared array used to be able to crash Perl. This\n       bug has now been fixed.\n\n       A regexp in \"STDOUT\"'s destructor used to coredump, because the regexp\n       pad was already freed. This has been fixed.\n\n       \"goto &\" is now more robust - bugs in deep recursion and chained \"goto\n       &\" have been fixed.\n\n       Using \"delete\" on an array no longer leaks memory. A \"pop\" of an item\n       from a shared array reference no longer causes a leak.\n\n       \"eval_sv()\" failing a taint test could corrupt the stack - this has\n       been fixed.\n\n       On platforms with 64 bit pointers numeric comparison operators used to\n       erroneously compare the addresses of references that are overloaded,\n       rather than using the overloaded values. This has been fixed.\n\n       \"read\" into a UTF8-encoded buffer with an offset off the end of the\n       buffer no longer mis-calculates buffer lengths.\n\n       Although Perl has promised since version 5.8 that \"sort()\" would be\n       stable, the two cases \"sort {$b cmp $a}\" and \"sort {$b <=> $a}\" could\n       produce non-stable sorts.   This is corrected in perl5.8.6.\n\n       Localising $^D no longer generates a diagnostic message about valid -D\n       flags.\n\nNew or Changed Diagnostics\n       For -t and -T,\n\t  Too late for \"-T\" option has been changed to the more informative\n\t  \"-T\" is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line\n\nChanged Internals\n       From now on all applications embedding perl will behave as if perl were\n       compiled with -DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV.  See \"Environment access\" in the\n       INSTALL file for details.\n\n       Most \"C\" source files now have comments at the top explaining their\n       purpose, which should help anyone wishing to get an overview of the\n       implementation.\n\nNew Tests\n       There are significantly more tests for the \"B\" suite of modules.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles\n       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug\n       database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be information at\n       http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at\n       http://bugs.perl.org/\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for exhaustive details on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t       PERL586DELTA(1)"
