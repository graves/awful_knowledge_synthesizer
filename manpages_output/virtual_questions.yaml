Originally based on the Postfix local(8) delivery agent, this\n       agent looks up recipients with map lookups of their full recipient\n       address, instead of using hard-coded unix password file lookups of the\n       address local part only.\n\n       This delivery agent only delivers mail.\tOther features such as mail\n       forwarding, out-of-office notifications, etc., must be configured via\n       virtual_alias maps or via similar lookup mechanisms.\n\nMAILBOX LOCATION\n       The mailbox location is controlled by the virtual_mailbox_base and\n       virtual_mailbox_maps configuration parameters (see below).  The\n       virtual_mailbox_maps table is indexed by the recipient address as\n       described under TABLE SEARCH ORDER below.\n\n       The mailbox pathname is constructed as follows:\n\n\t $virtual_mailbox_base/$virtual_mailbox_maps(recipient)\n\n       where recipient is the full recipient address.\n\nUNIX MAILBOX FORMAT\n       When the mailbox location does not end in /, the message is delivered\n       in UNIX mailbox format.\t This format stores multiple messages in one\n       textfile.\n\n       The virtual(8) delivery agent prepends a \"From sender time_stamp\"\n       envelope header to each message, prepends a Delivered-To: message\n       header with the envelope recipient address, prepends an X-Original-To:\n       header with the recipient address as given to Postfix, prepends a\n       Return-Path: message header with the envelope sender address, prepends\n       a > character to lines beginning with \"From \", and appends an empty\n       line.\n\n       The mailbox is locked for exclusive access while delivery is in\n       progress. In case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate the\n       mailbox to its original length.\n\nQMAIL MAILDIR FORMAT\n       When the mailbox location ends in /, the message is delivered in qmail\n       maildir format. This format stores one message per file.\n\n       The virtual(8) delivery agent prepends a Delivered-To: message header\n       with the final envelope recipient address, prepends an X-Original-To:\n       header with the recipient address as given to Postfix, and prepends a\n       Return-Path: message header with the envelope sender address.\n\n       By definition, maildir format does not require application-level file\n       locking during mail delivery or retrieval.\n\nMAILBOX OWNERSHIP\n       Mailbox ownership is controlled by the virtual_uid_maps and\n       virtual_gid_maps lookup tables, which are indexed with the full\n       recipient address. Each table provides a string with the numerical user\n       and group ID, respectively.\n\n       The virtual_minimum_uid parameter imposes a lower bound on numerical\n       user ID values that may be specified in any virtual_uid_maps.\n\nCASE FOLDING\n       All delivery decisions are made using the full recipient address,\n       folded to lower case. See also the next section for a few exceptions\n       with optional address extensions.\n\nTABLE SEARCH ORDER\n       Normally, a lookup table is specified as a text file that serves as\n       input to the postmap(1) command. The result, an indexed file in dbm or\n       db format, is used for fast searching by the mail system.\n\n       The search order is as follows. The search stops upon the first\n       successful lookup.\n\n       •      When the recipient has an optional address extension the\n\t      user+extension@domain.tld address is looked up first.\n\n\t      With Postfix versions before 2.1, the optional address extension\n\t      is always ignored.\n\n       •      The user@domain.tld address, without address extension, is\n\t      looked up next.\n\n       •      Finally, the recipient @domain is looked up.\n\n       When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP or SQL,\n       the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.\n\n       Alternatively, a table can be provided as a regular-expression map\n       where patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case, only the\n       full recipient address is given to the regular-expression map.\n\nSECURITY\n       The virtual(8) delivery agent is not security sensitive, provided that\n       the lookup tables with recipient user/group ID information are\n       adequately protected. This program is not designed to run chrooted.\n\n       The virtual(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution\n       of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open\n       a security hole.\n\n       The virtual(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the\n       proxymap(8) server. Instead it will open the table directly. Before\n       Postfix version 2.2, the virtual delivery agent will terminate with a\n       fatal error.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Mail bounces when the recipient has no mailbox or when the recipient is\n       over disk quota. In all other cases, mail for an existing recipient is\n       deferred and a warning is logged.\n\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message\n       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt\n       queue afterwards.\n\n       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the\n       postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.\n\nBUGS\n       This delivery agent supports address extensions in email addresses and\n       in lookup table keys, but does not propagate address extension\n       information to the result of table lookup.\n\n       Postfix should have lookup tables that can return multiple result\n       attributes. In order to avoid the inconvenience of maintaining three\n       tables, use an LDAP or MYSQL database.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as virtual(8) processes\n       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command \"postfix reload\"\n       to speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary.

local delivery\n       agent. Modifications mainly consisted of removing code that either was\n       not applicable or that was not safe in this context: aliases,\n       ~user/.forward files, delivery to \"|command\" or to /file/name.\n\n       The Delivered-To: message header appears in the qmail system by Daniel\n       Bernstein.\n\n       The maildir structure appears in the qmail system by Daniel Bernstein.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
