It also browses and scavenges names from the NetBIOS\n     network, making them available to the system through mDNSResponder.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -debug   The service will log extensive debug information and may perform\n\t      extra diagnostic checks. This option is typically only useful\n\t      for debugging.\n\n     -dump-packets\n\t      Pretty-print all sent and received NetBIOS packets to the output\n\t      log. This option is typically only useful for debugging.\n\n     -help    Prints a usage message and exits.\n\n     -max-refresh\n\t      Maximum time (in seconds) between searches to refresh the\n\t      workgroup list.\n\n     -min-refresh\n\t      Minimum time (in seconds) between searches to refresh the\n\t      workgroup list."
