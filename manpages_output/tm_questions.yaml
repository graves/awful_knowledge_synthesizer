    Manpage text:

    Given the above we allow the names for packages in Tcl modules to have
           mixed-case, but also require that there are no collisions when
           comparing names in a case-insensitive manner. In other words, if a
           package Foo is deployed in the form of a Tcl Module, packages like foo,
           fOo, etc. are not allowed anymore.

    DEFAULT PATHS
           The default list of paths on the module path is computed by a tclsh as
           follows, where X is the major version of the Tcl interpreter and y is
           less than or equal to the minor version of the Tcl interpreter.

           All the default paths are added to the module path, even those paths
           which do not exist. Non-existent paths are filtered out during actual
           searches. This enables a user to create one of the paths searched when
           needed and all running applications will automatically pick up any
           modules placed in them.

           The paths are added in the order as they are listed below, and for
           lists of paths defined by an environment variable in the order they are
           found in the variable.
