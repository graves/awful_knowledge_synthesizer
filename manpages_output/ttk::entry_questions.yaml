The value of the string may be linked\n       to a Tcl variable with the -textvariable option.  Entry widgets support\n       horizontal scrolling with the standard -xscrollcommand option and xview\n       widget command.\n\nSTANDARD OPTIONS\n       -class\t\t     -cursor\t\t  -style\n       -takefocus\t     -xscrollcommand\n\n       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS\n       [-exportselection exportSelection] A boolean value specifying whether\n       or not a selection in the widget should be linked to the X selection.\n       If the selection is exported, then selecting in the widget deselects\n       the current X selection, selecting outside the widget deselects any\n       widget selection, and the widget will respond to selection retrieval\n       requests when it has a selection.  [-invalidcommand invalidCommand] A\n       script template to evaluate whenever the validateCommand returns 0.\n       See VALIDATION below for more information.  [-justify justify]\n       Specifies how the text is aligned within the entry widget.  One of\n       left, center, or right.\t[-show show] If this option is specified, then\n       the true contents of the entry are not displayed in the window.\n       Instead, each character in the entry's value will be displayed as the\n       first character in the value of this option, such as “*” or a bullet.\n       This is useful, for example, if the entry is to be used to enter a\n       password.  If characters in the entry are selected and copied\n       elsewhere, the information copied will be what is displayed, not the\n       true contents of the entry.  [-state state] Compatibility option; see\n       ttk::widget(n) for details.  Specifies one of three states for the\n       entry, normal, disabled, or readonly.  See WIDGET STATES, below.\n       [-textvariable textVariable] Specifies the name of a variable whose\n       value is linked to the entry widget's contents.\tWhenever the variable\n       changes value, the widget's contents are updated, and vice versa.\n       [-validate validate] Specifies the mode in which validation should\n       operate: none, focus, focusin, focusout, key, or all.  Default is none,\n       meaning that validation is disabled.  See VALIDATION below.\n       [-validatecommand validateCommand] A script template to evaluate\n       whenever validation is triggered.  If set to the empty string (the\n       default), validation is disabled.  The script must return a boolean\n       value.  See VALIDATION below.  [-width width] Specifies an integer\n       value indicating the desired width of the entry window, in average-size\n       characters of the widget's font.\n\nNOTES\n       A portion of the entry may be selected as described below.  If an entry\n       is exporting its selection (see the exportSelection option), then it\n       will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection;\n       entry selections are available as type STRING.  Entries also observe\n       the standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus.\tWhen an entry\n       has the input focus it displays an insert cursor to indicate where new\n       characters will be inserted.\n\n       Entries are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit\n       entirely within the widget's window.  In this case, only a portion of\n       the string will be displayed;  commands described below may be used to\n       change the view in the window.  Entries use the standard xScrollCommand\n       mechanism for interacting with scrollbars (see the description of the\n       xScrollCommand option for details).\n\nINDICES\n       Many of the entry widget commands take one or more indices as\n       arguments.  An index specifies a particular character in the entry's\n       string, in any of the following ways:\n\n       number Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0\n\t      corresponds to the first character in the string.\n\n       @number\n\t      In this form, number is treated as an x-coordinate in the\n\t      entry's window;  the character spanning that x-coordinate is\n\t      used.  For example, “@0” indicates the left-most character in\n\t      the window.\n\n       end    Indicates the character just after the last one in the entry's\n\t      string.  This is equivalent to specifying a numerical index\n\t      equal to the length of the entry's string.\n\n       insert Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following\n\t      the insert cursor.\n\n       sel.first\n\t      Indicates the first character in the selection.  It is an error\n\t      to use this form if the selection is not in the entry window.\n\n       sel.last\n\t      Indicates the character just after the last one in the\n\t      selection.  It is an error to use this form if the selection is\n\t      not in the entry window.\n\n       Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g. “e” or\n       “sel.l”.  In general, out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to\n       the nearest legal value.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The following subcommands are possible for entry widgets:\n\n       pathName bbox index\n\t      Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of\n\t      the character given by index.  The first two elements of the\n\t      list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of\n\t      the screen area covered by the character (in pixels relative to\n\t      the widget) and the last two elements give the width and height\n\t      of the character, in pixels.  The bounding box may refer to a\n\t      region outside the visible area of the window.\n\n       pathName delete first ?last?\n\t      Delete one or more elements of the entry.  First is the index of\n\t      the first character to delete, and last is the index of the\n\t      character just after the last one to delete.  If last is not\n\t      specified it defaults to first+1, i.e. a single character is\n\t      deleted.\tThis command returns the empty string.\n\n       pathName get\n\t      Returns the entry's string.\n\n       pathName icursor index\n\t      Arrange for the insert cursor to be displayed just before the\n\t      character given by index.  Returns the empty string.\n\n       pathName index index\n\t      Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.\n\n       pathName insert index string\n\t      Insert string just before the character indicated by index.\n\t      Returns the empty string.\n\n       pathName selection option arg\n\t      This command is used to adjust the selection within an entry.\n\t      It has several forms, depending on option:\n\n\t      pathName selection clear\n\t\t     Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget.\n\t\t     If the selection is not in this widget then the command\n\t\t     has no effect.  Returns the empty string.\n\n\t      pathName selection present\n\t\t     Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the\n\t\t     entry, 0 if nothing is selected.\n\n\t      pathName selection range start end\n\t\t     Sets the selection to include the characters starting\n\t\t     with the one indexed by start and ending with the one\n\t\t     just before end.  If end refers to the same character as\n\t\t     start or an earlier one, then the entry's selection is\n\t\t     cleared.\n\n       pathName validate\n\t      Force revalidation, independent of the conditions specified by\n\t      the -validate option.  Returns 0 if validation fails, 1 if it\n\t      succeeds.  Sets or clears the invalid state accordingly.\tSee\n\t      VALIDATION below for more details.\n\n       pathName xview args\n\t      This command is used to query and change the horizontal position\n\t      of the text in the widget's window.  It can take any of the\n\t      following forms:\n\n\t      pathName xview\n\t\t     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is\n\t\t     a real fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe\n\t\t     the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For\n\t\t     example, if the first element is .2 and the second\n\t\t     element is .6, 20% of the entry's text is off-screen to\n\t\t     the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and\n\t\t     40% of the text is off-screen to the right.  These are\n\t\t     the same values passed to scrollbars via the\n\t\t     -xscrollcommand option.\n\n\t      pathName xview index\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character\n\t\t     given by index is displayed at the left edge of the\n\t\t     window.\n\n\t      pathName xview moveto fraction\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character\n\t\t     fraction of the way through the text appears at the left\n\t\t     edge of the window.  Fraction must be a fraction between\n\t\t     0 and 1.\n\n\t      pathName xview scroll number what\n\t\t     This command shifts the view in the window left or right\n\t\t     according to number and what.  Number must be an integer.\n\t\t     What must be either units or pages.  If what is units,\n\t\t     the view adjusts left or right by number average-width\n\t\t     characters on the display;  if it is pages then the view\n\t\t     adjusts by number screenfuls.  If number is negative then\n\t\t     characters farther to the left become visible;  if it is\n\t\t     positive then characters farther to the right become\n\t\t     visible.\n\n       The entry widget also supports the following generic ttk::widget widget\n       subcommands (see ttk::widget(n) for details):\n\n\t      cget\t\t    configure\t\t identify\n\t      instate\t\t    state"
