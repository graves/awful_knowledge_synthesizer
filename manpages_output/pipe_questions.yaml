Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pipe`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPIPE(8) \t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t       PIPE(8)\n\n\nNAME\n       pipe - Postfix delivery to external command\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       pipe [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The pipe(8) daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue manager to\n       deliver messages to external commands.  This program expects to be run\n       from the master(8) process manager.\n\n       Message attributes such as sender address, recipient address and\n       next-hop host name can be specified as command-line macros that are\n       expanded before the external command is executed.\n\n       The pipe(8) daemon updates queue files and marks recipients as\n       finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried\n       again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent to the\n       bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.\n\nSINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY\n       Some destinations cannot handle more than one recipient per delivery\n       request. Examples are pagers or fax machines.  In addition,\n       multi-recipient delivery is undesirable when prepending a Delivered-to:\n       or X-Original-To: message header.\n\n       To prevent Postfix from sending multiple recipients per delivery\n       request, specify\n\n\t   transport_destination_recipient_limit = 1\n\n       in the Postfix main.cf file, where transport is the name in the first\n       column of the Postfix master.cf entry for the pipe-based delivery\n       transport.\n\nCOMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX\n       The external command attributes are given in the master.cf file at the\n       end of a service definition.  The syntax is as follows:\n\n       chroot=pathname (optional)\n\t      Change the process root directory and working directory to the\n\t      named directory. This happens before switching to the privileges\n\t      specified with the user attribute, and before executing the\n\t      optional directory=pathname directive. Delivery is deferred in\n\t      case of failure.\n\n\t      This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.\n\n       directory=pathname (optional)\n\t      Change to the named directory before executing the external\n\t      command.\tThe directory must be accessible for the user\n\t      specified with the user attribute (see below).  The default\n\t      working directory is $queue_directory.  Delivery is deferred in\n\t      case of failure.\n\n\t      This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n       eol=string (optional, default: \\n)\n\t      The output record delimiter. Typically one would use either \\r\\n\n\t      or \\n. The usual C-style backslash escape sequences are\n\t      recognized: \\a \\b \\f \\n \\r \\t \\v \\ddd (up to three octal digits)\n\t      and \\\\.\n\n       flags=BDFORXhqu.> (optional)\n\t      Optional message processing flags. By default, a message is\n\t      copied unchanged.\n\n\t      B      Append a blank line at the end of each message. This is\n\t\t     required by some mail user agents that recognize \"From \"\n\t\t     lines only when preceded by a blank line.\n\n\t      D      Prepend a \"Delivered-To: recipient\" message header with\n\t\t     the envelope recipient address. Note: for this to work,\n\t\t     the transport_destination_recipient_limit must be 1 (see\n\t\t     SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).\n\n\t\t     The D flag also enforces loop detection (Postfix 2.5 and\n\t\t     later): if a message already contains a Delivered-To:\n\t\t     header with the same recipient address, then the message\n\t\t     is returned as undeliverable. The address comparison is\n\t\t     case insensitive.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.\n\n\t      F      Prepend a \"From sender time_stamp\" envelope header to the\n\t\t     message content.  This is expected by, for example, UUCP\n\t\t     software.\n\n\t      O      Prepend an \"X-Original-To: recipient\" message header with\n\t\t     the recipient address as given to Postfix. Note: for this\n\t\t     to work, the transport_destination_recipient_limit must\n\t\t     be 1 (see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.\n\n\t      R      Prepend a Return-Path: message header with the envelope\n\t\t     sender address.\n\n\t      X      Indicate that the external command performs final\n\t\t     delivery.\tThis flag affects the status reported in\n\t\t     \"success\" DSN (delivery status notification) messages,\n\t\t     and changes it from \"relayed\" into \"delivered\".\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.\n\n\t      h      Fold the command-line $original_recipient and $recipient\n\t\t     address domain part (text to the right of the right-most\n\t\t     @ character) to lower case; fold the entire command-line\n\t\t     $domain and $nexthop host or domain information to lower\n\t\t     case.  This is recommended for delivery via UUCP.\n\n\t      q      Quote white space and other special characters in the\n\t\t     command-line $sender, $original_recipient and $recipient\n\t\t     address localparts (text to the left of the right-most @\n\t\t     character), according to an 8-bit transparent version of\n\t\t     RFC 822.  This is recommended for delivery via UUCP or\n\t\t     BSMTP.\n\n\t\t     The result is compatible with the address parsing of\n\t\t     command-line recipients by the Postfix sendmail(1) mail\n\t\t     submission command.\n\n\t\t     The q flag affects only entire addresses, not the partial\n\t\t     address information from the $user, $extension or\n\t\t     $mailbox command-line macros.\n\n\t      u      Fold the command-line $original_recipient and $recipient\n\t\t     address localpart (text to the left of the right-most @\n\t\t     character) to lower case.\tThis is recommended for\n\t\t     delivery via UUCP.\n\n\t      .      Prepend \".\" to lines starting with \".\". This is needed\n\t\t     by, for example, BSMTP software.\n\n\t      >      Prepend \">\" to lines starting with \"From \". This is\n\t\t     expected by, for example, UUCP software.\n\n       null_sender=replacement (default: MAILER-DAEMON)\n\t      Replace the null sender address (typically used for delivery\n\t      status notifications) with the specified text when expanding the\n\t      $sender command-line macro, and when generating a From_ or\n\t      Return-Path: message header.\n\n\t      If the null sender replacement text is a non-empty string then\n\t      it is affected by the q flag for address quoting in command-line\n\t      arguments.\n\n\t      The null sender replacement text may be empty; this form is\n\t      recommended for content filters that feed mail back into\n\t      Postfix. The empty sender address is not affected by the q flag\n\t      for address quoting in command-line arguments.\n\n\t      Caution: a null sender address is easily mis-parsed by naive\n\t      software. For example, when the pipe(8) daemon executes a\n\t      command such as:\n\n\t\t  Wrong: command -f$sender -- $recipient\n\n\t      the command will mis-parse the -f option value when the sender\n\t      address is a null string.  For correct parsing, specify $sender\n\t      as an argument by itself:\n\n\t\t  Right: command -f $sender -- $recipient\n\n\t      This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.\n\n       size=size_limit (optional)\n\t      Don't deliver messages that exceed this size limit (in bytes);\n\t      return them to the sender instead.\n\n       user=username (required)\n\n       user=username:groupname\n\t      Execute the external command with the user ID and group ID of\n\t      the specified username.  The software refuses to execute\n\t      commands with root privileges, or with the privileges of the\n\t      mail system owner. If groupname is specified, the corresponding\n\t      group ID is used instead of the group ID of username.\n\n       argv=command... (required)\n\t      The command to be executed. This must be specified as the last\n\t      command attribute.  The command is executed directly, i.e.\n\t      without interpretation of shell meta characters by a shell\n\t      command interpreter.\n\n\t      Specify \"{\" and \"}\" around command arguments that contain\n\t      whitespace (Postfix 3.0 and later). Whitespace after \"{\" and\n\t      before \"}\" is ignored.\n\n\t      In the command argument vector, the following macros are\n\t      recognized and replaced with corresponding information from the\n\t      Postfix queue manager delivery request.\n\n\t      In addition to the form ${name}, the forms $name and the\n\t      deprecated form $(name) are also recognized.  Specify $$ where a\n\t      single $ is wanted.\n\n\t      ${client_address}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the remote client network address.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n\t      ${client_helo}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the remote client HELO command\n\t\t     parameter.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n\t      ${client_hostname}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the remote client hostname.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n\t      ${client_port}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the remote client TCP port number.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.\n\n\t      ${client_protocol}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the remote client protocol.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n\t      ${domain}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the domain portion of the recipient\n\t\t     address.  For example, with an address user+foo@domain\n\t\t     the domain is domain.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the h flag for case\n\t\t     folding.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.\n\n\t      ${extension}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the extension part of a recipient\n\t\t     address.  For example, with an address user+foo@domain\n\t\t     the extension is foo.\n\n\t\t     A command-line argument that contains ${extension}\n\t\t     expands into as many command-line arguments as there are\n\t\t     recipients.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the u flag for case\n\t\t     folding.\n\n\t      ${mailbox}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the complete local part of a\n\t\t     recipient address.  For example, with an address\n\t\t     user+foo@domain the mailbox is user+foo.\n\n\t\t     A command-line argument that contains ${mailbox} expands\n\t\t     to as many command-line arguments as there are\n\t\t     recipients.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the u flag for case\n\t\t     folding.\n\n\t      ${nexthop}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the next-hop hostname.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the h flag for case\n\t\t     folding.\n\n\t      ${original_recipient}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the complete recipient address\n\t\t     before any address rewriting or aliasing.\n\n\t\t     A command-line argument that contains\n\t\t     ${original_recipient} expands to as many command-line\n\t\t     arguments as there are recipients.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the hqu flags for quoting\n\t\t     and case folding.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.\n\n\t      ${queue_id}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the queue id.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.11.\n\n\t      ${recipient}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the complete recipient address.\n\n\t\t     A command-line argument that contains ${recipient}\n\t\t     expands to as many command-line arguments as there are\n\t\t     recipients.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the hqu flags for quoting\n\t\t     and case folding.\n\n\t      ${sasl_method}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the name of the SASL authentication\n\t\t     mechanism in the AUTH command when the Postfix SMTP\n\t\t     server received the message.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n\t      ${sasl_sender}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the SASL sender name (i.e. the\n\t\t     original submitter as per RFC 4954) in the MAIL FROM\n\t\t     command when the Postfix SMTP server received the\n\t\t     message.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n\t      ${sasl_username}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the SASL user name in the AUTH\n\t\t     command when the Postfix SMTP server received the\n\t\t     message.\n\n\t\t     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.\n\n\t      ${sender}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the envelope sender address. By\n\t\t     default, the null sender address expands to\n\t\t     MAILER-DAEMON; this can be changed with the null_sender\n\t\t     attribute, as described above.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the q flag for quoting.\n\n\t      ${size}\n\t\t     This macro expands to Postfix's idea of the message size,\n\t\t     which is an approximation of the size of the message as\n\t\t     delivered.\n\n\t      ${user}\n\t\t     This macro expands to the username part of a recipient\n\t\t     address.  For example, with an address user+foo@domain\n\t\t     the username part is user.\n\n\t\t     A command-line argument that contains ${user} expands\n\t\t     into as many command-line arguments as there are\n\t\t     recipients.\n\n\t\t     This information is modified by the u flag for case\n\t\t     folding.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Command exit status codes are expected to follow the conventions\n       defined in <sysexits.h>.  Exit status 0 means normal successful\n       completion.\n\n       In the case of a non-zero exit status, a limited amount of command\n       output is logged, and reported in a delivery status notification.  When\n       the output begins with a 4.X.X or 5.X.X enhanced status code, the\n       status code takes precedence over the non-zero exit status (Postfix\n       version 2.3 and later).\n\n       After successful delivery (zero exit status) a limited amount of\n       command output is logged, and reported in \"success\" delivery status\n       notifications (Postfix 3.0 and later).  This command output is not\n       examined for the presence of an enhanced status code.\n\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message\n       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt\n       queue for further inspection.\n\nSECURITY\n       This program needs a dual personality 1) to access the private Postfix\n       queue and IPC mechanisms, and 2) to execute external commands as the\n       specified user. It is therefore security sensitive.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically as pipe(8) processes run\n       for only a limited amount of time. Use the command \"postfix reload\" to\n       speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\nRESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS\n       In the text below, transport is the first field in a master.cf entry.\n\n       transport_destination_concurrency_limit\n       ($default_destination_concurrency_limit)\n\t      Limit the number of parallel deliveries to the same destination,\n\t      for delivery via the named transport.
