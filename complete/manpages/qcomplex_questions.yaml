    DESCRIPTION
           The mathematical module complexnumbers provides a straightforward
           implementation of complex numbers in pure Tcl. The philosophy is that
           the user knows he or she is dealing with complex numbers in an abstract
           way and wants as high a performance as can be had within the
           limitations of an interpreted language.

           Therefore the procedures defined in this package assume that the
           arguments are valid (representations of) "complex numbers", that is,
           lists of two numbers defining the real and imaginary part of a complex
           number (though this is a mere detail: rely on the complex command to
           construct a valid number.)

           Most procedures implement the basic arithmetic operations or elementary
           functions whereas several others convert to and from different
           representations:
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the math::complexnumbers package?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the math::complexnumbers package to add two complex numbers, (3+4i) and (1+2i)?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of converting a complex number (5+12i) to its polar form using the math::complexnumbers package?
