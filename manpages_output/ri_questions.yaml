You can\n     search and read the API reference for classes and methods with ri.\n\n     ri is a part of Ruby.\n\n     name can be:\n\n\t   Class | Module | Module::Class\n\t   Class::method | Class#method | Class.method | method\n\t   gem_name: | gem_name:README | gem_name:History\n\n     All class names may be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form.  If\n     a name is ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.\n\n     A ‘.’ matches either class or instance methods, while #method matches\n     only instance and ::method matches only class methods.\n\n     README and other files may be displayed by prefixing them with the gem\n     name they're contained in.  If the gem name is followed by a ‘:’ all\n     files in the gem will be shown.  The file name extension may be omitted\n     where it is unambiguous."
