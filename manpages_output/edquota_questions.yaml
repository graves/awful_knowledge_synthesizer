By default, or if the -u flag is specified,\n     one or more users may be specified on the command line.  For each user a\n     temporary file is created with an ASCII representation of the current\n     disk quotas for that user.  The list of filesystems with user quotas is\n     determined by scanning the mounted filesystems for a .quota.ops.user file\n     located at its root.  An editor is invoked on the ASCII file.  The editor\n     invoked is vi(1) unless the environment variable EDITOR specifies\n     otherwise.\n\n     The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.  Setting a quota\n     to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.  Setting a hard limit\n     to one indicates that no allocations should be permitted.\tSetting a soft\n     limit to one with a hard limit of zero indicates that allocations should\n     be permitted on only a temporary basis (see -t below).  The current usage\n     information in the file is for informational purposes; only the hard and\n     soft limits can be changed."

The binary quota file,\n     .quota.user is stored at the root of the filesystem.  The default\n     filename and root location for the user quotas cannot be overridden.\n\n     If the -p flag is specified, edquota will duplicate the quotas of the\n     prototypical user specified for each user specified.  This is the normal\n     mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.\n\n     If the -g flag is specified, edquota is invoked to edit the quotas of one\n     or more groups specified on the command line.  The list of filesystems\n     with group quotas is determined by scanning the mounted filesystems for a\n     .quota.ops.group file located at its root.  Similarly, the binary quota\n     file, .quota.group is stored at the root of the filesystem.  The default\n     filename and root location for group quotas cannot be overridden.\tThe -p\n     flag can be specified in conjunction with the -g flag to specify a\n     prototypical group to be duplicated among the listed set of groups."

Once the grace period has expired, the\n     soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.  The default grace period for a\n     filesystem is specified in /usr/include/sys/quota.h.  The -t flag can be\n     used to change the grace period.

Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the default grace\n     period should be imposed.\tSetting a grace period to one second indicates\n     that no grace period should be granted.\n\n     Only the super-user may edit quotas.\n\nFILES\n     Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the mounted\n     filesystem.
