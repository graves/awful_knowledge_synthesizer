These operations are\n     independent of the specific archive format, and support a wide variety of\n     different archive formats.  A list of supported archive formats can be\n     found under the description of the -x option."

    DIAGNOSTICS
         Whenever pax cannot create a file or a link when reading an archive or
         cannot find a file when writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user
         ID, group ID, or file mode when the -p option is specified, a diagnostic
         message is written to standard error and a non-zero exit status will be
         returned, but processing will continue.  In the case where pax cannot
         create a link to a file, pax will not create a second copy of the file.

         If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated by
         a signal or error, pax may have only partially extracted a file the user
         wanted.  Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and directories
         may have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times may
         be wrong.

         If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or
         error, pax may have only partially created the archive, which may violate
         the specific archive format specification.
