It can also be used to cancel or rejuvenate\n       requests made by uucp (1) or uux (1).\n\n       By default uustat displays all jobs queued up for the invoking user, as\n       if given the --user option with the appropriate argument.\n\n       If any of the -a, --all, -e, --executions, -s, --system, -S,\n       --not-system, -u, --user, -U, --not-user, -c, --command, -C,\n       --not-command, -o, --older-than, -y, --younger-than options are given,\n       then all jobs which match the combined specifications are displayed.\n\n       The -K or --kill-all option may be used to kill off a selected group of\n       jobs, such as all jobs more than 7 days old.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The following options may be given to uustat.\n\n       -a, --all\n\t    List all queued file transfer requests.\n\n       -e, --executions\n\t    List queued execution requests rather than queued file transfer\n\t    requests.  Queued execution requests are processed by uuxqt (8)\n\t    rather than uucico (8).  Queued execution requests may be waiting\n\t    for some file to be transferred from a remote system.  They are\n\t    created by an invocation of uux (1)."
