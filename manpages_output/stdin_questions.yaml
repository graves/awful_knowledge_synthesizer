- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `stdin`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nFD(4)\t\t\t     Device Drivers Manual\t\t\t FD(4)\n\nNAME\n     fd, stdin, stdout, stderr â€“ file descriptor files\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The files /dev/fd/0 through /dev/fd/# refer to file descriptors which can\n     be accessed through the file system.  If the file descriptor is open and\n     the mode the file is being opened with is a subset of the mode of the\n     existing descriptor, the call:\n\n\t   fd = open(\"/dev/fd/0\", mode);\n\n     and the call:\n\n\t   fd = fcntl(0, F_DUPFD, 0);\n\n     are equivalent.\n\n     Opening the files /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr is equivalent\n     to the following calls:\n\n\t   fd = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO,  F_DUPFD, 0);\n\t   fd = fcntl(STDOUT_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);\n\t   fd = fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);\n\n     Flags to the open(2) call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are\n     ignored.\n\nFILES\n     /dev/fd/#\n     /dev/stdin\n     /dev/stdout\n     /dev/stderr\n\nSEE ALSO\n     tty(4)\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\t June 9, 1993\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
