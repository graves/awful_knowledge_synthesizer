    Manpage text:

    The value of COMMAND_MODE is case insensitive and if it is unset or set
         to something other than legacy or unix2003 it behaves as if it were set
         to unix2003.

         Setting the environment variable SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT to 1 causes the
         system version to be reported as 10.16 when running on macOS 11 or later.

    COMPILATION
         Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will result in a compilation error.  This is no
         longer supported.

         Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _DARWIN_C_SOURCE causes library and kernel
         calls to conform to the SUSv3 standards even if doing so would alter the
         behavior of functions used in 10.3.  Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE also
         removes functions, types, and other interfaces that are not part of SUSv3
         from the normal C namespace, unless _DARWIN_C_SOURCE is also defined
         (i.e., _DARWIN_C_SOURCE is _POSIX_C_SOURCE with non-POSIX extensions).
         In any of these cases, the _DARWIN_FEATURE_UNIX_CONFORMANCE feature macro
         will be defined to the SUS conformance level (it is undefined otherwise).

    Manpage text:

    Starting in Mac OS X 10.5, if none of the macros _NONSTD_SOURCE,
         _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _DARWIN_C_SOURCE are defined, and the environment
         variable MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is either undefined or set to 10.5 or
         greater (or equivalently, the clang(1) option -mmacosx-version-min is
         either not specified or set to 10.5 or greater), then UNIX conformance
         will be on by default, and non-POSIX extensions will also be available
         (this is the equivalent of defining _DARWIN_C_SOURCE).

         In order to provide both legacy and conformance versions of functions,
         two versions of affected functions are provided.  Legacy variants have
         symbol names with no suffix in order to maintain ABI compatibility.
         Conformance versions have a $UNIX2003 suffix appended to their symbol
         name.  These $UNIX2003 suffixes are automatically appended by the
         compiler tool-chain and should not be used directly.

         All currently supported platforms only have conformance variants
         available and do not have the legacy $UNIX2003 suffix.
