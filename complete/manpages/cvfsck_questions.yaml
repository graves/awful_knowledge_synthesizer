This program also has the ability to list all of the existing\n       files and their pertinent statistics, such as inode number, size, file\n       type and location in the volume.\n\n       If the volume is active, it may only be checked in a Read-only mode. In\n       this mode, modifications are noted, but not committed. The -n option\n       may be used to perform a read only check as well.\n\n       The file system checking program must be run on the machine where the\n       File System Services are running.\n\n       cvfsck reads the configuration file and compares the configuration\n       against a saved copy that is stored in the metadata.  It is important\n       that the configuration file (see snfs_config(5)) accurately reflect the\n       current state of the volume.  If you need to change a parameter in a\n       current configuration, save a copy of the configuration first or make\n       sure /Library/Logs/Xsan/data/VolName/config_history/*.cfg.<TIMESTAMP>\n       already has a recent copy.  Once the configuration file has been\n       validated with the metadata version, if the configuration file is\n       different and cvfsck is not in read-only mode, the new configuration is\n       stored in the metadata and the previous version is written to\n       /Library/Logs/Xsan/data/VolName/config_history/*.cfg.<TIMESTAMP>.\n\n       After validating the configuration file, cvfsck reads all of the\n       metadata, checks it for any inconsistencies, and the volume is repaired\n       to resolve these issues or if in read-only mode, any problems are\n       reported.\n\n       By default, modifications are first written to a file in the local\n       volume instead of the Xsan disks.  All fixes are made to this local\n       file, including journal replay.\tWhen all problems are fixed and the\n       run is complete, the user is asked if the changes should be copied to\n       the actual Xsan disks.  If the user responds \"y\", the changes are made.\n       An answer of \"n\" indicates that the volume should not be changed.  This\n       allows the user to easily gauge the extent of problems with a volume\n       before committing to the repair.  The user can override this behavior\n       with the -n, -y, and --T options.\n\nOPTIONS\n       NOTE: If no action flags are specified (-e, -f, -g, -j, -F, -K, -M, -p,\n       -r, -s, -t, -w, -x, -q), then cvfsck runs in a verbose read-only mode\n       equivalent to -nv."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `cvfsck`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-4     If there are files with unconverted or partially converted xattr\n\t      chains that contain xattrs greater than 4KiB in length, destroy\n\t      the oversized xattrs so conversion can continue.\tUse with\n\t      caution.\n\n       -A     Scan directories for name collisions that would occur on a case-\n\t      insensitive file system. Note that the FSM must be stopped when\n\t      using this option.\n\n       -a     This option can only be used with -f and is used to tell cvfsck\n\t      to print totals (all).  When used, a line is printed after each\n\t      storage pool showing how many free space fragments exist for\n\t      that storage pool.  In addition, at the end of the run, this\n\t      options prints the grand total of free space fragments for all\n\t      storage pools.\n\n       -B separator\n\t      Use separator instead of comma (,) for the character used to\n\t      partition fields when the -x option is specified.\n\n       -c pathname\n\t      Provide a specific path to a configuration file that is to be\n\t      used, overriding the implicit location.  This option is used\n\t      when cvupdatefs invokes cvfsck as a sub-process to insure that\n\t      the volume meta data is consistent prior to doing a capacity or\n\t      stripegroup expansion.\n\n       -d     Internal debug use.  This option dumps a significant amount of\n\t      data to the standard output device.\n\n       -e     Report statistics for extents in each file.  This reporting\n\t      option enables all the same file statistics that the -r flag\n\t      enables. In addition, the -e flag enables statistic reporting\n\t      for each extent in a file. All extent data is displayed\n\t      immediately following the parent file's information. See the -r\n\t      flag description for file statistics output. The extent stats\n\t      are output in the following order; Extent#, Stripe group, File\n\t      relative block, Base block, End block No checking is done. This\n\t      flag implies -r and -n flags.  No tracing is enabled for this\n\t      report option.\n\n       -E     Erase i.e. \"scrub\" on disk free space.  Cvfsck will write zeros\n\t      over all free space on the disk.\tIt works in conjunction with\n\t      the -P option that reports the last block actually scrubbed in\n\t      case of a crash during a scrub operation. This is intended for\n\t      Linux.\n\n       -f     Report free space fragmentation.\tEach separate chunk of free\n\t      allocation blocks is tallied based on the chunk's size.  After\n\t      all free chunks are accounted for, a report is displayed showing\n\t      the counts for each unique sized free space chunk. Free space\n\t      fragmentation is reported separately for each storage pool. The\n\t      free space report is sorted from smallest contiguous allocation\n\t      chunk to largest. The \"Pct.\" column indicates percentage of the\n\t      storage pool space the given sized chunks make up. The \"(sum)\"\n\t      column indicates what percentage of the total storage pool space\n\t      is taken up by chunks smaller than, and equal to the given size.\n\t      The \"Chunk Size\" gives the chunk's size in volume blocks, and\n\t      the \"Chunk Count\" column displays how many instances of this\n\t      sized chunk are located in this storage pool's free space.  For\n\t      more information on fragmentation see the snfsdefrag(1) and\n\t      sgdefrag(8) pages.  No checking is done. Implies -n flag.  See\n\t      also -a that is used to get more output.\n\n       -F     This option causes cvfsck to make use of the compressed cache\n\t      even when the configured value of bufferCacheSize is less than\n\t      or equal to 1GB.\tIt also sizes the cache to hold all metadata\n\t      which can dramatically improve performance for aged file systems\n\t      having large file counts.  This option can cause cvfsck to use a\n\t      lot of memory, so it is advisable to first obtain an estimate\n\t      using the -q option.\n\n       -g     Print journal recovery log.  With this flag cvfsck reports\n\t      contents of the metadata journal. For debugging use only.\n\t      Implies -n flag.\n\n       -i     Print inode summary report.  With this flag cvfsck scans the\n\t      inode list and reports inode statistics information then exits.\n\t      This includes a breakdown of the count of inode types, hard\n\t      links, and size of the largest directory.  This is normally\n\t      reported as part of the 'Building Inode Index Database' phase\n\t      anyway but with this flag cvfsck exits after printing the inode\n\t      summary report and skips the rest of the operations.  This\n\t      allows the inode summary report to run pretty fast.  Implies -n\n\t      flag.\n\n       -j     Execute journal recovery and then exit. Running journal recovery\n\t      will ensure all operations have been committed to disk, and that\n\t      the metadata state is up to date. It is recommended that cvfsck\n\t      is run with the -j flag before any read-only checks or volume\n\t      reports are run.\n\n       -J     Dump raw journal to a file named jrnraw.dat and then exit. For\n\t      debugging use only.\n\n       -K     Forces the journal to be cleared and reset. WARNING: Resetting\n\t      the journal may introduce metadata inconsistency. After the\n\t      journal reset has been completed, run cvfsck to verify and\n\t      repair any metadata inconsistency. Use this option with extreme\n\t      caution.\n\n       -l     This option will log any problems to the system log.  This is\n\t      mainly used on system startup where a file system check may be\n\t      automatically started by the Xsan File System Services.\n\n       -L     This option forces all orphaned inodes (valid inodes which are\n\t      not linked in to the directory tree) to be reattached in the\n\t      lost+found directory.  If this option is not present, cvfsck\n\t      examines the RPL attribute on the inodes and tries to reattach\n\t      them to the directory that used to hold them.  In either usage,\n\t      it tries to name the inodes using the name in the RPL attribute.\n\t      If there is no RPL attribute, the inode number is used as a\n\t      name.  If that name already exists, the inode will be reattached\n\t      using that name followed by a dash and a random number.\n\n       -M     Performs simple checks that attempt to determine whether a new\n\t      metadata dump is needed.\tIf the checks find that a dump is\n\t      needed, cvfsck will exit with status 1 and print an explanation.\n\t      If the checks do not find that a dump is needed, cvfsck will\n\t      exit with status 0.  If an error occurs while performing the\n\t      checks, cvfsck will print an explanation and exit with status 2.\n\t      This option is useful only on managed file systems.  Note: these\n\t      checks are not exhaustive, and, in some cases, cvfsck will exit\n\t      with status 0 when a new dump is actually required.\n\n       -m size\n\t      This option is used to specify the amount of memory in bytes to\n\t      be used for the internal cache used to hold inode information.\n\t      For larger file systems, this can improve the performance of\n\t      cvfsck.  Note that the memory estimate produced using the -q\n\t      option will be increased by the amount specified with this\n\t      option.  The 'k', 'm', and 'g' extensions are recognized for\n\t      this option.  For example, -m 2g can be used to specify 2GB.\n\n       -n     This option allows a volume to be checked in a read-only mode.\n\t      Modifications are written to a file in the local volume instead\n\t      of the Xsan disks.  All fixes that would be made if cvfsck was\n\t      run without the -n option are made to this local file, including\n\t      journal replay.  When the run is complete, the local file is\n\t      thrown away.  The volume itself is never changed.\n\n       -O     If cvfsck is run on a file system while the FSM for that file\n\t      system is active, cvfsck runs in shared mode.  This means that\n\t      it runs in read-only mode and only a small subset of the usual\n\t      checking is performed.  This is because the FSM changing the\n\t      file system may confuse a full cvfsck and cause problems.  The\n\t      -O option causes cvfsck to perform full (read-only) checking\n\t      anyway.  Strange behavior may be observed.\n\n       -p StripeGroupName\n\t      This option provides a method for deleting all files that have\n\t      blocks allocated on the given stripe group. All files that have\n\t      at least one data extent on the given stripe group will be\n\t      deleted, even if they have extents on other stripe groups as\n\t      well.  WARNING: Use this option with extreme caution. This\n\t      option could remove files that the user did not intend to\n\t      remove, and there are no methods to recover files that have been\n\t      deleted with this option.\n\n       -q     This option causes cvfsck to generate and estimate for disk and\n\t      memory requirements and then exit.  Any other options that will\n\t      get used when performing the actual check should also be\n\t      specified to improve estimate accuracy.  For example, if the\n\t      intent is to run cvfsck -m2g -F VolName, then to generate the\n\t      estimate, run cvfsck -q -m2g -F VolName.\tNote that the base\n\t      memory requirements will typically be around 600MB, so this\n\t      should be taken into account when also using the -m option.\n\n       -Q     This option causes cvfsck to print qustat statistics just before\n\t      exiting.\n\n       -P     Report progress of an Erase operation.  This flag enables the\n\t      writing of a file in /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug of the last block\n\t      on a given strip group that has been scrubbed.  The files are\n\t      created on a stripe group by stripe group basis as\n\t      /Library/Logs/Xsan/data/cvfsck_<VolName>_sg<StripeGroupOrdinal>.\n\t      This is intended for Linux use.\n\n       -r     This report option shows information on file state. Information\n\t      for each file is output in the following order.  Inode#, Mode,\n\t      Size, Block count, Extent count, Storage pools, Affinity, Path\n\t      No tracing is enabled for this report option.\n\n       -R     This option helps repair a file system which had cvmkfs\n\t      accidentally run on it.  First, cvfsck restores file system\n\t      state which was saved by cvmkfs in\n\t      /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/VolName.cvmkfs.\tThen, it continues as\n\t      usual to fix any other problems it may encounter.  The COW layer\n\t      treats the restoration of saved state the same as any other file\n\t      system modification.  This option is only useful if the\n\t      accidental cvmkfs is detected before the file system is mounted\n\t      and changed.  Using it at any other time is not advised.\tIf\n\t      unsure, please contact customer support.\n\n       -s StripeGroupName\n\t      THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS ONLY SUPPORTED ON MANAGED FILE SYSTEMS\n\t      Provides a method for restoring data on the given storage pool\n\t      from a stored copy. cvfsck will truncate all files with data on\n\t      the given storage pool. As such, all data blocks on that storage\n\t      pool will be inaccessible and subsequent access of these files\n\t      will trigger data retrieval from a stored copy. All data will be\n\t      lost for files that do not have any stored copies. The cvfsck\n\t      output will indicate whether or not the ALL_COPIES_MADE flag is\n\t      set in the SNEA attribute for each truncated file.  Files\n\t      outside of all managed directories that have data on the given\n\t      storage pool will be deleted from the file system.  NOTE: Use\n\t      this option with extreme caution because it can result in\n\t      permanent data loss.\n\n       -T directory\n\t      This option specifies the directory where all temporary files\n\t      created by cvfsck will be placed. If this option is omitted all\n\t      temporary files will be placed in the system's default temporary\n\t      folder. NOTE: cvfsck does honor the use of TMPDIR/TEMP\n\t      environment variables.\n\n       -t     This option is used to check the work of the -U option on thin\n\t      provisioned devices in the given file system.  It causes cvfsck\n\t      to print in sn_dmap(1) -v format, from the file system's\n\t      perspective, an idea of what should be unmapped and mapped on\n\t      each thin provisioned device in the given file system.  One can\n\t      then somewhat compare the sn_dmap(1) output with the cvfsck -t\n\t      output as follows: any \"mapped\" space indicated by sn_dmap(1)\n\t      must also be mapped in the cvfsck output.  But, unmapped space\n\t      from sn_dmap(1) may show up as mapped in the cvfsck output since\n\t      the space has been allocated but not yet written.  Going the\n\t      other way, any mapped space from cvfsck may or may not be mapped\n\t      from sn_dmap, depending if the allocated space was actually\n\t      written.\tAny unmapped space (immediately after running cvfsck\n\t      -U) must also appear as unmapped from sn_dmap(1).  In addition,\n\t      this option verifies this final condition (checking ummapped\n\t      space) printing lines where unmapped space is incorrectly still\n\t      mapped.  If all is copacetic, the following output appears for\n\t      each device: checked NNN unmapped entries with 0 errors where\n\t      NNN is the number of unmapped pieces checked.  This currently\n\t      only works on Linux and is intended as a debugging tool for\n\t      quality assurance and development.\n\n       -U     This option is for use with thin provisioned devices in the\n\t      given file system.  It causes UNMAPS or TRIMs operations for all\n\t      file system free space.  Cvfsck will issue the appropriate\n\t      UNMAP/TRIM device operations for every free chunk in the file\n\t      system.  See also the -t option.\tThis currently only works on\n\t      Linux and only with Quantum QXS series storage.\n\n       -v     Use verbose reporting methods.\n\n       -w     This option specifies that cvfsck is allowed to make\n\t      modifications to the file system to correct any problems that\n\t      are found."

Windows\n       Security Descriptors with inconsistent CRC's are removed causing\n       affected files to inherit permissions from the parent folder.\n\n       Cvfsck limits the number of trace files to 100.\tIt starts removing the\n       oldest trace file if the max number of trace files in\n       /Library/Logs/Xsan/data/VolName/trace is exceeded before a new file is\n       created.\n\n       NOTE: On large file systems cvfsck may requires 100s of megabytes or\n       more of local system disk space for working files.\n\n       If the output of -x is to be used with Excel, consider the use of the\n       -z option so that lines having pathnames containing commas can be\n       parsed.\tIf the output of -x is to be used with Unix tools such as awk,\n       Perl, or Python, consider using the -B option with a field separator\n       such as '|' or similar that does not appear as a character in a\n       pathname."
