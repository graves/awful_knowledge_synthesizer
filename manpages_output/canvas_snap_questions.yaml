The result is the name\n\t      of a new Tk photo image containing the snapshot.\n\n\t      Note that this command has a side-effect. To avoid having white\n\t      rectangles where other windows may overlap the canvas this\n\t      command forces the toplevel window the canvas is in to the top\n\t      of the stacking order.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       canvas, image, photo, print screen, snapshot\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2004 George Petasis (http://wiki.tcl.tk/1404)\n       Copyright (c) 2010 Documentation, Andreas Kupries"
