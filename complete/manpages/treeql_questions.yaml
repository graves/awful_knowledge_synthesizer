It implements an ordered set of nodes (really a\n       list) which are generated and filtered through the application of\n       TreeQL operators to each node in turn.\n\nAPI\n   TREEQL CLASS API\n       The command treeql is a snit::type which implements the Treeql Query\n       Language. This means that it follows the API for class commands as\n       specified by the package snit.  Its general syntax is\n\n       treeql objectname -tree tree ?-query query? ?-nodes nodes? ?args...?\n\t      The command creates a new tree query object and returns the\n\t      fully qualified name of the object command as its result.  The\n\t      API the returned command is following is described in the\n\t      section TreeQL OBJECT API\n\n\t      Each query object is associated with a single tree object. This\n\t      is the object all queries will be run against.\n\n\t      If the option -nodes was specified then its argument is treated\n\t      as a list of nodes. This list is used to initialize the node\n\t      set. It defaults to the empty list.\n\n\t      If the option -query was specified then its argument will be\n\t      interpreted as an object, the parent query of this query. It\n\t      defaults to the object itself. All queries will be interpreted\n\t      in the environment of this object.\n\n\t      Any arguments coming after the options are treated as a query\n\t      and run immediately, after the node set has been initialized.\n\t      This uses the same syntax for the query as the method query.\n\n\t      The operations of the TreeQL available for this are explained in\n\t      the section about The Tree Query Language. This section also\n\t      explains the term node set used above.\n\n   TREEQL OBJECT API\n       As treeql has been implemented in snit all the standard methods of\n       snit-based classes are available to the user and therefore not listed\n       here. Please read the documentation for snit for what they are and what\n       functionality they provide\n\n       The methods provided by the package treeql itself are listed and\n       explained below.\n\n       qo query args...\n\t      This method interprets its arguments as a series of TreeQL\n\t      operators and interpretes them from the left to right (i.e.\n\t      first to last).  Note that the first operator uses the node set\n\t      currently known to the object to perform its actions.  In other\n\t      words, the node set is not cleared, or modified in other ways,\n\t      before the query is run. This allows the user to run several\n\t      queries one after the other and have each use the results of the\n\t      last. Any initialization has to be done by any query itself,\n\t      using TreeQL operators.  The result of the method is the node\n\t      set after the last operator of the query has been executed.\n\n\t      Note that uncaught errors will leave the node set of the object\n\t      in an intermediate state, per the TreeQL operators which were\n\t      executed successfully before the error occurred.\n\n\t      The above means in detail that:\n\n\t      [1]    The first argument is interpreted as the name of a query\n\t\t     operator, the number of arguments required by that\n\t\t     operator is then determined, and taken from the\n\t\t     immediately following arguments.\n\n\t\t     Because of this operators cannot have optional arguments,\n\t\t     all arguments have to be present as defined.  Failure to\n\t\t     do this will, at least, confuse the query interpreter,\n\t\t     but more likely cause errors.\n\n\t      [2]    The operator is applied to the current node set, yielding\n\t\t     a new node set, and/or manipulating the tree object the\n\t\t     query object is connected to.\n\n\t      [3]    The arguments used (i.e. operator name and arguments) are\n\t\t     removed from the list of method arguments, and then the\n\t\t     whole process is repeated from step [1], until the list\n\t\t     of arguments is empty or an error occurred."

This is followed by the specifications for\n       all the available query operators. They fall into eight categories, and\n       each category has its own section.\n\n       [1]    TreeQL Concepts\n\n       [2]    Structural generators\n\n       [3]    Attribute Filters\n\n       [4]    Attribute Mutators\n\n       [5]    Attribute String Accessors\n\n       [6]    Sub-queries\n\n       [7]    Node Set Operators\n\n       [8]    Node Set Iterators\n\n       [9]    Typed node support\n\n   TREEQL CONCEPTS\n       The main concept which has to be understood is that of the node set.\n       Each query object maintains exactly one such node set, and essentially\n       all operators use it and input argument and for their result.  This\n       structure simply contains the handles of all nodes which are currently\n       of interest to the query object.  To name it a set is a bit of a\n       misnomer, because\n\n       [1]    A node (handle) can occur in the structure more than once, and\n\n       [2]    the order of nodes in the structure is important as well.\n\t      Whenever an operator processes all nodes in the node set it will\n\t      do so in the order they occur in the structure.\n\n       Regarding the possible multiple occurrence of a node, consider a node\n       set containing two nodes A and B, both having node P as their immediate\n       parent. Application of the TreeQL operator \"parent\" will then add P to\n       the new node set twice, once per node it was parent of. I.e. the new\n       node set will then be {P P}.\n\n   STRUCTURAL GENERATORS\n       All tree-structural operators locate nodes in the tree based on a\n       structural relation ship to the nodes currently in the set and then\n       replace the current node set with the set of nodes found Nodes which\n       fulfill such a relationship multiple times are added to the result as\n       often as they fulfill the relationship.\n\n       It is important to note that the found nodes are collected in a\n       separate storage area while processing the node set, and are added to\n       (or replacing) the current node set only after the current node set has\n       been processed completely.  In other words, the new nodes are not\n       processed by the operator as well and do not affect the iteration.\n\n       When describing an operator the variable N will be used to refer to any\n       node in the node set.\n\n       ancestors\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the ancestors for all nodes N\n\t      in the node set, should N have a parent. In other words, nodes\n\t      without a parent do not contribute to the new node set. In other\n\t      words, uses all nodes on the path from node N to root, in this\n\t      order (root last), for all nodes N in the node set. This\n\t      includes the root, but not the node itself.\n\n       rootpath\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the ancestors for all nodes N\n\t      in the node set, should N have a parent. In other words, nodes\n\t      without a parent do not contribute to the new node set.  In\n\t      contrast to the operator ancestors the nodes are added in\n\t      reverse order however, i.e. the root node first.\n\n       parent Replaces the current node set with the parent of node N, for all\n\t      nodes N in the node set, should N have a parent. In other words,\n\t      nodes without a parent do not contribute to the new node set.\n\n       children\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the immediate children of\n\t      node N, for all nodes N in the node set, should N have children.\n\t      In other words, nodes without children do not contribute to the\n\t      new node set.\n\n       left   Replaces the current node set with the previous/left sibling for\n\t      all nodes N in the node set, should N have siblings to the left.\n\t      In other words, nodes without left siblings do not contribute to\n\t      the new node set.\n\n       right  Replaces the current node set with the next/right sibling for\n\t      all nodes N in the node set, should N have siblings to the\n\t      right. In other words, nodes without right siblings do not\n\t      contribute to the new node set.\n\n       prev   Replaces the current node set with all previous/left siblings of\n\t      node N, for all nodes N in the node set, should N have siblings\n\t      to the left. In other words, nodes without left siblings are\n\t      ignored. The left sibling adjacent to the node is added first,\n\t      and the leftmost sibling last (reverse tree order).\n\n       esib   Replaces the current node set with all previous/left siblings of\n\t      node N, for all nodes N in the node set, should N have siblings\n\t      to the left. In other words, nodes without left siblings are\n\t      ignored. The leftmost sibling is added first, and the left\n\t      sibling adjacent to the node last (tree order).\n\n\t      The method name is a shorthand for Earlier SIBling.\n\n       next   Replaces the current node set with all next/right siblings of\n\t      node N, for all nodes N in the node set, should N have siblings\n\t      to the right. In other words, nodes without right siblings do\n\t      not contribute to the new node set. The right sibling adjacent\n\t      to the node is added first, and the rightmost sibling last (tree\n\t      order).\n\n       root   Replaces the current node set with a node set containing a\n\t      single node, the root of the tree.\n\n       tree   Replaces the current node set with a node set containing all\n\t      nodes found in the tree. The nodes are added in pre-order\n\t      (parent first, then children, the latter from left to right,\n\t      first to last).\n\n       descendants\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the nodes in all subtrees\n\t      rooted at node N, for all nodes N in the node set, should N have\n\t      children. In other words, nodes without children do not\n\t      contribute to the new node set.\n\n\t      This is like the operator children, but covers the children of\n\t      children as well, i.e. all the proper descendants. \"Rooted at N\"\n\t      means that N itself is not added to the new set, which is also\n\t      implied by proper descendants.\n\n       subtree\n\t      Like operator descendants, but includes the node N. In other\n\t      words:\n\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the nodes of the subtree of\n\t      node N, for all nodes N in the node set, should N have children.\n\t      In other words, nodes without children do not contribute to the\n\t      new node set. I.e this is like the operator children, but covers\n\t      the children of children, etc. as well. \"Of N\" means that N\n\t      itself is added to the new set.\n\n       forward\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the nodes in the subtrees\n\t      rooted at the right siblings of node N, for all nodes N in the\n\t      node set, should N have right siblings, and they children. In\n\t      other words, nodes without right siblings, and them without\n\t      children are ignored.\n\n\t      This is equivalent to the operator sequence\n\t      next descendants\n\n       later  This is an alias for the operator forward.\n\n       backward\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the nodes in the flattened\n\t      previous subtrees, in reverse tree order.\n\n\t      This is nearly equivalent to the operator sequence\n\t      prev descendants\n\t      The only difference is that this uses the nodes in reverse\n\t      order.\n\n       earlier\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the nodes in the flattened\n\t      previous subtrees, in tree order.\n\n\t      This is equivalent to the operator sequence\n\t      prev subtree\n\n   ATTRIBUTE FILTERS\n       These operators filter the node set by reference to attributes of nodes\n       and their properties. Filter means that all nodes not fulfilling the\n       criteria are removed from the node set. In other words, the node set is\n       replaced by the set of nodes fulfilling the filter criteria.\n\n       hasatt attr\n\t      Reduces the node set to nodes which have an attribute named\n\t      attr.\n\n       withatt attr value\n\t      Reduces the node set to nodes which have an attribute named\n\t      attr, and where the value of that attribute is equal to value\n\t      (The \"==\" operator is string equal -nocase).\n\n       withatt! attr val\n\t      This is the same as withatt, but all nodes in the node set have\n\t      to have the attribute, and the \"==\" operator is string equal,\n\t      i.e. no -nocase.\tThe operator will fail with an error if they\n\t      don't have the attribute.\n\n       attof attr vals\n\t      Reduces the node set to nodes which which have an attribute\n\t      named attr and where the value of that attribute is contained in\n\t      the list vals of legal values. The contained-in operator used\n\t      here does glob matching (using the attribute value as pattern)\n\t      and ignores the case of the attribute value, but not for the\n\t      elements of vals.\n\n       attmatch attr match\n\t      Same as withatt, but string match is used as the \"==\" operator,\n\t      and match is the pattern checked for.\n\n\t      Note that match is a interpreted as a partial argument list for\n\t      string match. This means that it is interpreted as a list\n\t      containing the pattern, and the pattern element can be preceded\n\t      by options understand by string match, like -nocase.  This is\n\t      especially important should the pattern contain spaces. It has\n\t      to be wrapped into a list for correct interpretation by this\n\t      operator\n\n   ATTRIBUTE MUTATORS\n       These operators change node attributes within the underlying tree. In\n       other words, all these operators have side effects.\n\n       set attr val\n\t      Sets the attribute attr to the value val, for all nodes N in the\n\t      node set.  The operator will fail if a node does not have an\n\t      attribute named attr. The tree will be left in a partially\n\t      modified state.\n\n       unset attr\n\t      Unsets the attribute attr, for all nodes N in the node set.  The\n\t      operator will fail if a node does not have an attribute named\n\t      attr. The tree will be left in a partially modified state.\n\n   ATTRIBUTE STRING ACCESSORS\n       These operators retrieve the values of node attributes from the\n       underlying tree. The collected results are stored in the node set, but\n       are not actually nodes.\n\n       In other words, they redefine the semantics of the node set stored by\n       the query object to contain non-node data after their completion.\n\n       The query interpreter will terminate after it has finished processing\n       one of these operators, silently discarding any later query elements.\n       It also means that our talk about maintenance of a node set is not\n       quite true. It is a node set while the interpreter is processing\n       commands, but can be left as an attribute value set at the end of query\n       processing.\n\n       string op attr\n\t      Applies the string operator op to the attribute named attr, for\n\t      all nodes N in the node set, collects the results of that\n\t      application and places them into the node set.\n\n\t      The operator will fail if a node does not have an attribute\n\t      named attr.\n\n\t      The argument op is interpreted as partial argument list for the\n\t      builtin command string.  Its first word has to be any of the\n\t      sub-commands understood by string.  This has to be followed by\n\t      all arguments required for the subcommand, except the last.\n\t      that last argument is supplied by the attribute value.\n\n       get pattern\n\t      For all nodes N in the node set it determines all their\n\t      attributes with names matching the glob pattern, then the values\n\t      of these attributes, at last it replaces the node set with the\n\t      list of these attribute values.\n\n       attlist\n\t      This is a convenience definition for the operator getvals *. In\n\t      other words, it replaces the node set with a list of the\n\t      attribute values for all attributes for all nodes N in the node\n\t      set.\n\n       attrs glob\n\t      Replaces the current node set with a list of attribute lists,\n\t      one attribute list per for all nodes N in the node set.\n\n       attval attname\n\t      Reduces the current node set with the operator hasatt, and then\n\t      replaces it with a list containing the values of the attribute\n\t      named attname for all nodes N in the node set.\n\n   SUB-QUERIES\n       Sub-queries yield node sets which are then used to augment, reduce or\n       replace the current node set.\n\n       andq query\n\t      Replaces the node set with the set-intersection of the node set\n\t      generated by the sub-query query and itself.\n\n\t      The execution of the sub-query uses the current node set as its\n\t      own initial node set.\n\n       orq query\n\t      Replaces the node set with the set-union of the node set\n\t      generated by the sub-query query and itself. Duplicate nodes are\n\t      removed.\n\n\t      The execution of the sub-query uses the current node set as its\n\t      own initial node set.\n\n       notq query\n\t      Replaces the node set with the set of nodes generated by the\n\t      sub-query query which are also not in the current node set. In\n\t      other word the set difference of itself and the node set\n\t      generated by the sub-query.\n\n\t      The execution of the sub-query uses the current node set as its\n\t      own initial node set.\n\n   NODE SET OPERATORS\n       These operators change the node set directly, without referring to the\n       tree.\n\n       unique Removes duplicate nodes from the node set, preserving order. In\n\t      other words, the earliest occurrence of a node handle is\n\t      preserved, every other occurrence is removed.\n\n       select Replaces the current node set with a node set containing only\n\t      the first node from the current node set\n\n       transform query var body\n\t      First it interprets the sub-query query, using the current node\n\t      set as its initial node set.  Then it iterates over the result\n\t      of that query, binding the handle of each node to the variable\n\t      named in var, and executing the script body.  The collected\n\t      results of these executions is made the new node set, replacing\n\t      the current one.\n\n\t      The script body is executed in the context of the caller.\n\n       map var body\n\t      Iterates over the current node set, binding the handle of each\n\t      node to the variable named in var, and executing the script\n\t      body.  The collected results of these executions is made the new\n\t      node set, replacing the current one.\n\n\t      The script body is executed in the context of the caller.\n\n       quote val\n\t      Appends the literal value val to the current node set.\n\n       replace val\n\t      Replaces the current node set with the literal list value val.\n\n   NODE SET ITERATORS\n       foreach query var body\n\t      Interprets the sub-query query, then performs the equivalent of\n\t      operator over on the nodes in the node set created by that\n\t      query. The current node set is not changed, except through side\n\t      effects from the script body.\n\n\t      The script body is executed in the context of the caller.\n\n       with query body\n\t      Interprets the query, then runs the script body on the node set\n\t      generated by the query. At last it restores the current node set\n\t      as it was before the execution of the query.\n\n\t      The script body is executed in the context of the caller.\n\n       over var body\n\t      Executes the script body for each node in the node set, with the\n\t      variable named by var bound to the name of the current node.\n\t      The script body is executed in the context of the caller.\n\n\t      This is like the builtin foreach, with the node set as the\n\t      source of the list to iterate over.\n\n\t      The results of executing the body are ignored.\n\n       delete Deletes all the nodes contained in the current node set from the\n\t      tree.\n\n   TYPED NODE SUPPORT\n       These filters and accessors assume the existence of an attribute called\n       @type, and are short-hand forms useful for cost-like tree query, html\n       tree editing, and so on.\n\n       nodetype\n\t      Returns the node type of nodes.  Attribute string accessor. This\n\t      is equivalent to\n\t      get @type\n\n       oftype t\n\t      Reduces the node set to nodes whose type is equal to t, with\n\t      letter case ignored.\n\n       nottype t\n\t      Reduces the node set to nodes whose type is not equal to t, with\n\t      letter case ignored.\n\n       oftypes attrs\n\t      Reduces set to nodes whose @type is an element in the list attrs\n\t      of types. The value of @type is used as a glob pattern, and\n\t      letter case is relevant.\n\nEXAMPLES\nREFERENCES\n       [1]    COST [http://wiki.tcl.tk/COST] on the Tcler's Wiki.\n\n       [2]    TreeQL [http://wiki.tcl.tk/treeql] on the Tcler's Wiki.
