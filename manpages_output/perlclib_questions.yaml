This is because\n       Perl tends to reimplement or abstract standard library functions, so\n       that we know exactly how they're going to operate.\n\n       This is a reference card for people who are familiar with the C library\n       and who want to do things the Perl way; to tell them which functions\n       they ought to use instead of the more normal C functions.\n\n   Conventions\n       In the following tables:\n\n       \"t\"\n\t  is a type.\n\n       \"p\"\n\t  is a pointer.\n\n       \"n\"\n\t  is a number.\n\n       \"s\"\n\t  is a string.\n\n       \"sv\", \"av\", \"hv\", etc. represent variables of their respective types.\n\n   File Operations\n       Instead of the stdio.h functions, you should use the Perl abstraction\n       layer. Instead of \"FILE*\" types, you need to be handling \"PerlIO*\"\n       types.  Don't forget that with the new PerlIO layered I/O abstraction\n       \"FILE*\" types may not even be available. See also the \"perlapio\"\n       documentation for more information about the following functions:\n\n\tInstead Of:\t\t    Use:\n\n\tstdin\t\t\t    PerlIO_stdin()\n\tstdout\t\t\t    PerlIO_stdout()\n\tstderr\t\t\t    PerlIO_stderr()\n\n\tfopen(fn, mode) \t    PerlIO_open(fn, mode)\n\tfreopen(fn, mode, stream)   PerlIO_reopen(fn, mode, perlio) (Dep-\n\t\t\t\t      recated)\n\tfflush(stream)\t\t    PerlIO_flush(perlio)\n\tfclose(stream)\t\t    PerlIO_close(perlio)\n\n   File Input and Output\n\tInstead Of:\t\t    Use:\n\n\tfprintf(stream, fmt, ...)

This means writing a bit pattern\n       into it that should be illegal as pointers (and floating point\n       numbers), and also hopefully surprising enough as integers, so that any\n       code attempting to use the data without forethought will break sooner\n       rather than later.  Poisoning can be done using the Poison() macros,\n       which have similar arguments to Zero():\n\n\tPoisonWith(dst, n, t, b)    scribble memory with byte b\n\tPoisonNew(dst, n, t)\t    equal to PoisonWith(dst, n, t, 0xAB)\n\tPoisonFree(dst, n, t)\t    equal to PoisonWith(dst, n, t, 0xEF)\n\tPoison(dst, n, t)\t    equal to PoisonFree(dst, n, t)\n\n   Character Class Tests\n       There are several types of character class tests that Perl implements.\n       The only ones described here are those that directly correspond to C\n       library functions that operate on 8-bit characters, but there are\n       equivalents that operate on wide characters, and UTF-8 encoded strings.\n       All are more fully described in \"Character classification\" in perlapi\n       and \"Character case changing\" in perlapi.\n\n       The C library routines listed in the table below return values based on\n       the current locale.  Use the entries in the final column for that\n       functionality.  The other two columns always assume a POSIX (or C)\n       locale.\tThe entries in the ASCII column are only meaningful for ASCII\n       inputs, returning FALSE for anything else.  Use these only when you\n       know that is what you want.  The entries in the Latin1 column assume\n       that the non-ASCII 8-bit characters are as Unicode defines, them, the\n       same as ISO-8859-1, often called Latin 1.\n\n\tInstead Of:  Use for ASCII:   Use for Latin1:\t   Use for locale:\n\n\tisalnum(c)  isALPHANUMERIC(c) isALPHANUMERIC_L1(c) isALPHANUMERIC_LC(c)\n\tisalpha(c)  isALPHA(c)\t      isALPHA_L1(c)\t   isALPHA_LC(u )\n\tisascii(c)  isASCII(c)\t\t\t\t   isASCII_LC(c)\n\tisblank(c)  isBLANK(c)\t      isBLANK_L1(c)\t   isBLANK_LC(c)\n\tiscntrl(c)  isCNTRL(c)\t      isCNTRL_L1(c)\t   isCNTRL_LC(c)\n\tisdigit(c)  isDIGIT(c)\t      isDIGIT_L1(c)\t   isDIGIT_LC(c)\n\tisgraph(c)  isGRAPH(c)\t      isGRAPH_L1(c)\t   isGRAPH_LC(c)\n\tislower(c)  isLOWER(c)\t      isLOWER_L1(c)\t   isLOWER_LC(c)\n\tisprint(c)  isPRINT(c)\t      isPRINT_L1(c)\t   isPRINT_LC(c)\n\tispunct(c)  isPUNCT(c)\t      isPUNCT_L1(c)\t   isPUNCT_LC(c)\n\tisspace(c)  isSPACE(c)\t      isSPACE_L1(c)\t   isSPACE_LC(c)\n\tisupper(c)  isUPPER(c)\t      isUPPER_L1(c)\t   isUPPER_LC(c)\n\tisxdigit(c) isXDIGIT(c)       isXDIGIT_L1(c)\t   isXDIGIT_LC(c)\n\n\ttolower(c)  toLOWER(c)\t      toLOWER_L1(c)\n\ttoupper(c)  toUPPER(c)\n\n       To emphasize that you are operating only on ASCII characters, you can\n       append \"_A\" to each of the macros in the ASCII column: \"isALPHA_A\",\n       \"isDIGIT_A\", and so on.\n\n       (There is no entry in the Latin1 column for \"isascii\" even though there\n       is an \"isASCII_L1\", which is identical to \"isASCII\";  the latter name\n       is clearer.  There is no entry in the Latin1 column for \"toupper\"\n       because the result can be non-Latin1.  You have to use \"toUPPER_uvchr\",\n       as described in \"Character case changing\" in perlapi.)\n\n   stdlib.h functions\n\tInstead Of:\t\t    Use:\n\n\tatof(s) \t\t    Atof(s)\n\tatoi(s) \t\t    grok_atoUV(s, &uv, &e)\n\tatol(s) \t\t    grok_atoUV(s, &uv, &e)\n\tstrtod(s, &p)\t\t    Strtod(s, &p)\n\tstrtol(s, &p, n)\t    Strtol(s, &p, b)\n\tstrtoul(s, &p, n)\t    Strtoul(s, &p, b)\n\n       Typical use is to do range checks on \"uv\" before casting:\n\n\t int i; UV uv;\n\t char* end_ptr = input_end;\n\t if (grok_atoUV(input, &uv, &end_ptr)\n\t     && uv <= INT_MAX)\n\t   i = (int)uv;\n\t   ... /* continue parsing from end_ptr */\n\t } else {\n\t   ... /* parse error: not a decimal integer in range 0 .. MAX_IV */\n\t }\n\n       Notice also the \"grok_bin\", \"grok_hex\", and \"grok_oct\" functions in\n       numeric.c for converting strings representing numbers in the respective\n       bases into \"NV\"s.  Note that grok_atoUV() doesn't handle negative\n       inputs, or leading whitespace (being purposefully strict).\n\n       Note that strtol() and strtoul() may be disguised as Strtol(),\n       Strtoul(), Atol(), Atoul().  Avoid those, too.\n\n       In theory \"Strtol\" and \"Strtoul\" may not be defined if the machine perl\n       is built on doesn't actually have strtol and strtoul. But as those 2\n       functions are part of the 1989 ANSI C spec we suspect you'll find them\n       everywhere by now.\n\n\tint rand()\t\t    double Drand01()\n\tsrand(n)\t\t    { seedDrand01((Rand_seed_t)n);\n\t\t\t\t      PL_srand_called = TRUE; }\n\n\texit(n) \t\t    my_exit(n)\n\tsystem(s)\t\t    Don't.
