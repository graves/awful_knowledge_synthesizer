  manpageQuestion2: How would you use encode_keychange to generate a KeyChange string using the MD5 hash type with passphrases provided from standard input?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using encode_keychange with the SHA1 hash type to generate a KeyChange string from passphrases stored in the $HOME/.snmp/passphrase.ek file?
