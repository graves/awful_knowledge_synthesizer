These are\n     generally ANSI C symbols that are non-object-oriented items such as\n     constants, enumerations, structures, and functions but can also include\n     some additional information about classes, methods, and informal\n     protocols.\n\n     BridgeSupport files are a major component of the Objective-C bridges\n     (PyObjC) supported in Mac OS X for scripting languages such as Python.\n\n     gen_bridge_metadata(1) is the tool used to generate BridgeSupport files\n     for particular frameworks or libraries.\n\n     To understand the following discussion you should know what “element” and\n     “attribute” mean in XML markup. You should also be familiar with\n     Objective-C and with concepts related to the Objective-C runtime, such as\n     the type-encoding constants."
