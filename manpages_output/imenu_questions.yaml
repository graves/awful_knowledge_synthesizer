Its API is:\n\n       term::interact::menu object dict ?options...?\n\t      This command creates a new menu object with the name object,\n\t      initializes it, and returns the fully qualified name of the\n\t      object command as its result.\n\n\t      The argument is the menu to show, possibly followed by\n\t      configuration options and their values. The options are\n\t      explained in the section Configuration. The menu is a dictionary\n\t      maping labels to symbolic action codes.\n\nOBJECT API\n       The objects created by the class command provide the methods listed\n       below:\n\n       object interact\n\t      Shows the menu in the screen at the configured location and\n\t      starts interacting with it. This opens its own event loop for\n\t      the processing of incoming characters. The method returns when\n\t      the interaction has completed. See section Interaction for a\n\t      description of the possible interaction.\n\n\t      The method returns the symbolic action of the menu item selected\n\t      by the user at the end of the interaction.\n\n       object done\n\t      This method can be used by user supplied actions to terminate\n\t      the interaction with the object.\n\n       object clear\n\t      This method can be used by user supplied actions to remove the\n\t      menu from the terminal.\n\n       object configure\n\n       object configure option\n\n       object configure option value...\n\n       object cget option\n\t      Standard methods to retrieve and configure the options of the\n\t      menu.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       A menu instance recognizes the following options:\n\n       -in chan\n\t      Specifies the channel to read character sequences from. Defaults\n\t      to stdin.\n\n       -out chan\n\t      Specifies the channel to write the menu contents to. Defaults to\n\t      stdout.\n\n       -column int\n\t      Specifies the column of the terminal where the left margin of\n\t      the menu display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the left-\n\t      most column.\n\n       -line int\n\t      Specifies the line of the terminal where the top margin of the\n\t      menu display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the top-most\n\t      line.\n\n       -height int\n\t      Specifies the number of lines of text to show at most in the\n\t      display. Defaults to 25.\n\n       -actions dict\n\t      Specifies a dictionary containing additional actions, using\n\t      character sequences as keys. Note that these sequences cannot\n\t      override the hardwired sequences described in section\n\t      Interaction.\n\n       -hilitleft int\n\n       -hilitright int\n\t      By default the entire selected menu entry is highlighted in\n\t      revers output. However, when present these two options restrict\n\t      revers dispay to the specified sub-range of the entry.\n\n       -framed bool\n\t      By default the menu is shown using only header and footer out of\n\t      characters box graphics. If this flag is set the menu is fully\n\t      enclosed in a box.\n\nINTERACTION\n       A menu object recognizes the control sequences listed below and acts as\n       described. The user can supply more control sequences to act on via the\n       configuration, but is not able to overide these defaults.\n\n       Cursor Up\n\t      The selection is moved up one entry, except if the first entry\n\t      of the menu is already selected.\n\n       Cursor Down\n\t      The selection is moved down one entry, except if the last entry\n\t      of the menu is already selected.\n\n       Enter/Return\n\t      The interaction with the object is terminated.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category term of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
