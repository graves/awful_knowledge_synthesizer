Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lo`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nLO(4)\t\t\t     Device Drivers Manual\t\t\t LO(4)\n\nNAME\n     lo â€“ software loopback network interface\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     pseudo-device\n     loop\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The loop interface is a software loopback mechanism which may be used for\n     performance analysis, software testing, and/or local communication.  As\n     with other network interfaces, the loopback interface must have network\n     addresses assigned for each address family with which it is to be used.\n     These addresses may be set or changed with the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2).  The\n     loopback interface should be the last interface configured, as protocols\n     may use the order of configuration as an indication of priority.  The\n     loopback should never be configured first unless no hardware interfaces\n     exist.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n     lo%d: can't handle af%d.  The interface was handed a message with\n     addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family; the packet was\n     dropped.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     inet(4), intro(4), ns(4)\n\nHISTORY\n     The lo device appeared in 4.2BSD."

Use of that\n     address is now discouraged; a reserved host address for the local network\n     should be used instead.\n\nBSD 4.2 \t\t\t June 5, 1993\t\t\t       BSD 4.2"
