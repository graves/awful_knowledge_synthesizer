Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `upsshutdown`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nUPSSHUTDOWN(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\tUPSSHUTDOWN(8)\n\nNAME\n     upsshutdown â€“ UPS emergency low power shutdown script\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     upsshutdown is a script that runs automatically when the system performs\n     an emergency UPS low power shutdown.  The script is run before\n     shutdown(8) is invoked.  upsshutdown only runs if one of the three\n     shutdown rules is enabled and true: \"percentage remaining,\" \"time\n     remaining,\" or \"time since loss of power.\"  These settings can be changed\n     using pmset(1) or Energy Saver in System Preferences.\n\n     The system administrator may modify upsshutdown.  The script should only\n     contain commands that must run in the case of an emergency UPS shutdown.\n     It should not contain any commands that would otherwise be executed\n     during a normal shutdown since the normal shutdown procedure follows\n     invocation of upsshutdown.\n\nLOCATION\n     /usr/libexec/upsshutdown\n\nSEE ALSO\n     pmset(1), ioupsd(8)\n\nDarwin\t\t\t       October 25, 2005 \t\t\tDarwin"
