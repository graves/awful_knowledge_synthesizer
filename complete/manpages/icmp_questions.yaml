The proto parameter to the\n     socket call to create an ICMP socket is obtained from getprotobyname(3).\n     ICMP sockets are connectionless, and are normally used with the sendto\n     and recvfrom calls, though the connect(2) call may also be used to fix\n     the destination for future packets (in which case the read(2) or recv(2)\n     and write(2) or send(2) system calls may be used).\n\n     Outgoing packets automatically have an IP header prepended to them (based\n     on the destination address).  Incoming packets are received with the IP\n     header and options intact.  Note that the ip_off and ip_len fields are in\n     host byte order.  For more information about the IP header structure, see\n     ip(4)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `icmp`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nNon-privileged ICMP\n     ICMP sockets can be opened with the SOCK_DGRAM socket type without\n     requiring root privileges. The synopsis is the following:\n\n     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_ICMP)\n\n     Datagram oriented ICMP sockets offer a subset of the functionality\n     available to raw ICMP sockets. Only IMCP request messages of the\n     following types can be sent: ICMP_ECHO, ICMP_TSTAMP or ICMP_MASKREQ.  The\n     code field must be the value zero (0).  The minimal length of an ICMP\n     message request is eight (8) octets.\n\n     The advantage of using datagram oriented ICMP sockets is that even a non-\n     privileged process can use ICMP echo requests to gauge the quality of the\n     connectivity to a host, or to receive ICMP destination unreachable\n     message for path MTU discovery, or to receive time exceeded messages for\n     traceroute.\n\n     The following IP level option can be used with datagram oriented ICMP\n     sockets:\n\n\t IP_OPTIONS\n\t IP_HDRINCL\n\t IP_TOS\n\t IP_TTL\n\t IP_RECVOPTS\n\t IP_RECVRETOPTS\n\t IP_RECVDSTADDR\n\t IP_RETOPTS\n\t IP_MULTICAST_IF\n\t IP_MULTICAST_TTL\n\t IP_MULTICAST_LOOP\n\t IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP\n\t IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP\n\t IP_MULTICAST_VIF\n\t IP_PORTRANGE\n\t IP_RECVIF\n\t IP_IPSEC_POLICY\n\t IP_STRIPHDR"
