It takes a subcommand and a number of\n       options, some of which are common to multiple commands.\n\n       kmutil interacts with the KernelManagement subsystem for loading,\n       unloading, and diagnosing kexts.  It can also be used for inspecting\n       the contents of a kext collection, interacting with the kernel to query\n       load information, finding kexts and kext dependencies on disk, creating\n       new collections of kexts, and displaying other diagnostic information.\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n       Starting in macOS 11, kernel extensions are found in 3 different\n       artifacts on disk.  Each artifact is loaded exactly once at boot, and a\n       kext must be linked into one of the three artifacts before it can be\n       used."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `kmutil`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n• The boot kext collection contains the kernel and all system kexts\n\t necessary for starting and bootstrapping the operating system.  It is\n\t an immutable artifact in /System/Library/KernelCollections.  On Apple\n\t Silicon Macs, this artifact is kept exclusively in the Preboot\n\t volume.\n\n       • The system kext collection, if used, contains all remaining system\n\t kexts required by the operating system, and is loaded after boot.  It\n\t is prelinked against the boot kext collection, and is also an\n\t immutable artifact in /System/Library/KernelCollections.  Note that\n\t on Apple Silicon Macs, there is no system kext collection.\n\n       • The auxiliary kext collection, if built, contains kexts placed in\n\t /Library/Extensions and any other third-party kexts installed on the\n\t system.  It is dynamically built by kernelmanagerd(8) and prelinked\n\t against the boot kext collection and, if present, the system kext\n\t collection.  On Apple Silicon Macs, the auxiliary kext collection is\n\t located in the Preboot volume.  For more information on installing\n\t third-party kexts into the auxiliary kext collection, see INSTALLING.\n\nINSTALLING\n       As of macOS 11, a kext is only loadable once it has been built into the\n       auxiliary kext collection by kernelmanagerd(8), and the system has\n       rebooted.  At boot, kernelmanagerd(8) will load this collection into\n       the kernel, which allows all of the kexts in the collection to match\n       and load.  If kmutil load, kextload(8), or any invocation of a\n       KextManager function attempts to load a kext that is not yet loadable,\n       kernelmanagerd(8) will stage the kext into a protected location,\n       validate it, and prompt the user to approve a rebuild of the auxiliary\n       kext collection.  If the validation and rebuild are successful, the\n       kext will be available on the next boot.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       Commands and their specific options are listed below.  For other\n       options common to most commands, see OPTIONS.\n\n       • create: Create a new kext collection according to the options\n\t provided.  This command should only be used by developers\n\t investigating custom kernels or replacing the contents of the boot\n\t kext collection or system kext collection.  As of macOS 13.0, a KDK\n\t is required to create a new boot or system kext collection.  To load\n\t or unload kexts already in a collection see the load and unload\n\t subcommands.\n\n\t -n, --new <boot|sys|aux>\n\t\tSpecify one or more of boot, sys, or aux to build one or more\n\t\tcollections at a time.\n\n\t -L, --no-system-collection\n\t\tIf building an auxiliary collection, don’t look for or\n\t\tgenerate a system kext collection.\n\n\t -s, --strip\n\t\tSpecify none, all, or allkexts (default: none) to strip symbol\n\t\tinformation after a kext has been built into a collection.\n\n\t -k, --kernel\n\t\tWhen building the boot kext collection, specify the path to\n\t\tthe kernel.  If -V is specified, kmutil will append the\n\t\tvariant extension.\n\n\t -x, --explicit-only\n\t\tOnly consider the bundle identifiers and paths explicitly\n\t\tspecified, along with their dependencies.\n\n\t --compress\n\t\tCompress results using the LZFSE algorithm.\n\n\t --img4-encode\n\t\tEncode the collection in an img4 payload.\n\n       • inspect: Inspect & display the contents of a kext collection\n\t according to the options provided.\n\n\t --show-mach-header\n\t\tPrint the mach header(s) in the collection(s).\tUse with\n\t\t--verbose to also display contents of inner fileset entries.\n\n\t --show-fileset-entries\n\t\tOnly print mach header information present in fileset\n\t\tsubentries.  This is useful for determining prelink addresses\n\t\tand other load information about a kext in a collection.\n\n\t --show-kext-load-addresses\n\t\tWhen displaying the default output, include the load addresses\n\t\tof the kexts inline.\n\n\t --show-kext-uuids\n\t\tInclude the UUIDs of each kext in the output.\n\n\t --show-kernel-uuid\n\t\tPrint the UUID (and version) of the kernel if present in the\n\t\tcollection.  This will output nothing if a kernel is not found\n\t\tin the specified collection(s).\n\n\t --show-kernel-uuid-only\n\t\tPrint the UUID of the kernel if present in the collection, and\n\t\tsuppress default kext information.\n\n\t --show-prelink-info\n\t\tDump the raw __PRELINK_INFO segment of the collection(s).\n\n\t --show-collection-metadata\n\t\tPrint the metadata of the collection(s), such as their prelink\n\t\tuuids, the uuids of collections they link against, and the\n\t\tbuild version that produced the collection.\n\n\t --show-mach-boot-properties\n\t\tPrint derived Mach-O boot properties of the collection(s).\n\n\t --json Output the section layout as JSON.\n\n       • load: Load the extension(s) specified with -b or -p.  If the\n\t extension is not already in the auxiliary kext collection, the\n\t collection will be dynamically rebuilt by kernelmanagerd(8) for use\n\t on the next reboot.  For more information, see INSTALLING.  For kexts\n\t already contained in the boot, system, or auxiliary kext collection,\n\t the load subcommand will start the kext if it has not already been\n\t started.\n\n\t For most kexts, the load subcommand must run as the superuser (root).\n\t Kexts installed under /System/ with an OSBundleAllowUserLoad property\n\t set to true may be loaded via the load subcommand by non-root users.\n\n\t macOS 10.6 introduced C functions for loading kexts,\n\t KextManagerLoadKextWithIdentifier() and KextManagerLoadKextWithURL(),\n\t which are described in Apple’s developer documentation.  These\n\t functions continue to be supported as of macOS 11.\n\n\t -P, --personality-name\n\t\tIf this kext is already loaded, send the named personality to\n\t\tthe catalog.\n\n\t -e, --no-default-repositories\n\t\tDon’t use the default repositories for kexts.  If you use this\n\t\toption, you will have to explicitly specify all dependencies\n\t\tof the kext being loaded, or otherwise worked on using the\n\t\t--repository option.\n\n\t --load-style\n\t\tControl the load style of the request to load extension.\n\t\tValid options:\n\n\t\t• start-and-match: Start the kernel extension and also begin\n\t\t  matching on any accompanying personalities.  (default)\n\n\t\t• start-only: Start any specified kernel extensions but do not\n\t\t  begin matching against any personalities provided by those\n\t\t  extensions (unless matching has already started for them).\n\n\t\t• match-only: Do not explictly start any of the given kernel\n\t\t  extensions but do begin matching on IOKit personalities\n\t\t  provided by them.  This is useful to allow extensions that\n\t\t  were previous loaded with start-only to now begin matching.\n\n       • unload: Unload the extension(s) specified with -b or -p.  The\n\t extension must have been previously linked into a kext collection and\n\t loaded by the KernelManagement system.  A successfull call to the\n\t unload subcommand will invoke the kext’s stop function and end the\n\t kext’s IOKit lifecycle, however the kext remains in kernel memory as\n\t part of the kext collection from which it was loaded.\tThe extension\n\t will not be removed from any collection, including the auxiliary kext\n\t collection, and will still be available for loading without requiring\n\t a reboot.\n\n\t If another loaded kext has a dependency on the kext being unloaded,\n\t the unload will fail.\tYou can determine whether a kext has\n\t dependents using the showloaded subcommand.\n\n\t -c, --class-name <class-name>\n\t\tTerminate all instances of the IOService class, but do not\n\t\tunload its kext or unload its personalities.\n\n\t -P, --personalities-only\n\t\tTerminate services and remove personalities only; do not\n\t\tunload kexts.\n\n       • libraries: Search for library kexts in the boot kext collection and\n\t the system kext collection (if available) that define symbols needed\n\t for linking the specified kexts, printing their bundle identifiers\n\t and versions.\tInformation on symbols not found are printed after the\n\t library kext information for each architecture.\n\n\t A handy use of the libraries subcommand is to run it with just the\n\t --xml flag and pipe the output to pbcopy(1).  If the exit status is\n\t zero (indicating no undefined or multiply-defined symbols), you can\n\t open your kext’s Info.plist file in a text editor and paste the\n\t library declarations over the OSBundleLibraries property.\n\n\t You can specify other collections with the libraries subcommand to\n\t look for dependencies in other collections as well.\n\n\t --all-symbols\n\t\tList all symbols; found, not found, or found more than once.\n\n\t --onedef-symbols\n\t\tList all symbols found, with the library kext they were found\n\t\tin.\n\n\t --multdef-symbols\n\t\tList all symbols found more than once, with their library\n\t\tkexts.\n\n\t --undef-symbols\n\t\tList all symbols not found in any library.\n\n\t --unsupported\n\t\tLook in unsupported kexts for symbols.\n\n\t -c, --compatible-versions\n\t\tUse library kext compatible versions rather than current\n\t\tversions.\n\n\t --xml\tPrint XML fragment suitable for pasting.\n\n       • showloaded: Display the status/information of loaded kernel\n\t extensions on the system, according to the options provided.  By\n\t default, the following is shown for each kext:\n\n\t Index\tThe load index of the kext (used to track linkage references).\n\t\tGaps in the list indicate kexts that have been unloaded.\n\n\t Refs\tThe number of references to this kext by others.  If nonzero,\n\t\tthe kext cannot be unloaded.\n\n\t Address\n\t\tThe address in kernel space where the kext has been loaded.\n\n\t Size\tThe number of bytes of kernel memory that the kext occupies.\n\t\tIf this is zero, the kext is a built-in part of the kernel\n\t\tthat has an entry as a kext for resolving dependencies among\n\t\tkexts.\n\n\t Wired\tThe number of wired bytes of kernel memory that the kext\n\t\toccupies.\n\n\t Architecture\n\t\tThe architecture of the kext, displayed only if using the\n\t\t--arch-info option.\n\n\t Name\tThe CFBundleIdentifier of the kext.\n\n\t Version\n\t\tThe CFBundleVersion of the kext.\n\n\t <Linked Against>\n\t\tThe index numbers of all other kexts that this kext has a\n\t\treference to.\n\n\t The following options are available for the showloaded command:\n\n\t --show-mach-headers\n\t\tShow the mach headers of the loaded extensions and/or kernel,\n\t\tif --show-kernel is specified.\n\n\t --show <loaded|unloaded|all>\n\t\tRestrict output to a specific load state.\n\n\t --collection <boot|sys|aux|codeless>\n\t\tRestrict the load information to a particular kind.  Defaults\n\t\tto all non-codeless kexts if unspecified.  To display\n\t\tinformation about codeless kexts and dexts that the kernel\n\t\tknows about, use --collection codeless --show all.\n\n\t --sort Sort the output by load address of each extension, instead of\n\t\tby index.\n\n\t --list-only\n\t\tPrint the list of extensions only, omitting the header on the\n\t\tfirst line.\n\n\t --arch-info\n\t\tInclude the architecture info in output.\n\n\t --no-kernel-components\n\t\tDo not show kernel components in output.\n\n\t --show-kernel\n\t\tShow load information about the kernel in the output.  Use\n\t\twith --show-mach-headers to view the kernel mach header.\n\n       • dumpstate: Display diagnostic information about the state of\n\t kernelmanagerd(8).\n\n       • find: Locate and print paths of kexts (or kexts in collections)\n\t matching the filter criteria.\tFor more information on filtering, see\n\t FILTERING OPTIONS.  Searches are performed using the same kext\n\t management logic used elsewhere in kmutil, by which only kexts\n\t specified with the repository or bundle options are eligible; this is\n\t specifically not an exhaustive, recursive filesystem search.\n\n       • check: Check that load information and/or kext collections on the\n\t system are consistent.\n\n\t --collection-linkage\n\t\tCheck to see that the collections on the system are properly\n\t\tlinked together by inspecting the UUID metadata in the prelink\n\t\tinfo section of each collection on the system.\n\n\t --load-info\n\t\tCheck to see that the load information in the kernel properly\n\t\tmirrors the collections on disk.  This is the default action\n\t\tif no other options are specified.\n\n\t --kernel-only\n\t\tIf checking load info, just check that the kernel matches, and\n\t\tno other kexts.\n\n\t --collection <boot|sys|aux>:\n\t\tRestrict consistency check to one (or more) of the specified\n\t\tcollection types.  If unspecified, check all by default.\n\n       • log: Display logging information about the kext management subsystem.\n\t This is a wrapper around the system log(1) command with a pre-defined\n\t predicate to show only logs from kernelmanagerd and kmutil.\n\n       • print-diagnostics: Perform all possible tests on one or more kexts,\n\t and indicate whether or not the kext can be successfully built into a\n\t collection.  If there are issues found with the kext, diagnostic\n\t information is reported which can help to isolate and resolve the\n\t problem.  Note that some tests require root.  Note that custom\n\t collections, variants, and architectures can be specified with the\n\t GENERIC and COLLECTION kmutil options.\n\n\t -p, --bundle-path\n\t\tPrint diagnostics for the bundle specified at this path (can\n\t\tbe specified more than once).\n\n\t -Z --no-resolve-dependencies\n\t\tDon’t resolve kext dependencies\n\n\t -D --diagnose-dependencies\n\t\tRecursively diagnose all kext dependencies of each kext\n\t\tspecified with -p.  Ignored when -Z is present.\n\n\t --plugins\n\t\tDiagnose each kext found in the PlugIns directory of kexts\n\t\tspecified with -p.\n\n\t --do-staging\n\t\tPerform kext staging to the SIP protected location.  This test\n\t\trequires root privileges.\n\n       • clear-staging: Clear the staging directory managed by\n\t kernelmanagerd(8) and kmutil(8).\n\n       • migrate: System subcommand used during a software update.\n\n       • install: System subcommand used to update the Boot and System kext\n\t collections.\n\n       • rebuild: System subcommand used to attempt an Auxiliary kext\n\t collection rebuild.  This command evaluates the current Auxiliary\n\t kext collection for changes, which may add newly approved third-party\n\t kexts and remove kexts that were previously installed and have since\n\t been deleted or moved from their installed location.\n\n\t To uninstall a kext from the Auxiliary kext collection:\n\n\t 1. Delete or move the kext bundle(s) to be uninstalled from their\n\t    installed location.\n\n\t 2. Run “kmutil rebuild” from Terminal and confirm the Auxiliary kext\n\t    collection changes.\n\n\t 3. Authorize the Auxiliary kext collection rebuild.\n\n\t 4. Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.\n\nRECOVERY COMMANDS\n       The following commands can only be run in Recovery Mode.\n\n       • trigger-panic-medic: Remove the auxiliary kext collection and remove\n\t all kext approvals on the next boot.  This subcommand can only be\n\t used in Recovery Mode.  This command can be used to recover the\n\t system from a kext that causes a kernel panic.  After calling\n\t trigger-panic-medic, all previously installed kexts will prompt the\n\t user to re-approve them when they are loaded or installed.\n\n       • configure-boot: Configure a custom boot object policy.  This command\n\t can be used to install a custom mach-o file from which the system\n\t will boot.  In order to install custom boot objects, you must first\n\t enter Medium Security by using the Startup Disk utility in Recovery\n\t Mode.\tSetting a custom boot object will further lower the system\n\t security to Permissive Security, and you will be prompted to confirm\n\t this action.\n\n\t -c, --custom-boot-object\n\t\tThe Mach-O that the booter will load and start.  The file can\n\t\tbe optionally compressed and wrapped in an img4.\n\n\t -C, --compress\n\t\tCompress the custom boot object\n\n\t -v, --volume\n\t\tInstall the custom boot object for the specified volume\n\n\t --raw\tTreat custom boot object as a raw file to be installed.  The\n\t\tobject will be installed with custom Mach-O boot properties\n\t\tderived from –lowest-virtual-address and –entry-point\n\n\t --lowest-virtual-address\n\t\tLowest virtual memory address of the raw boot object.  (iBoot\n\t\twill map the raw boot object at this virtual address)\n\n\t --entry-point\n\t\tVirtual memory address of entry point into the raw boot object\n\nOPTIONS\n   GLOBAL OPTIONS\n       The following options are global to most kmutil subcommands.\n\n       -a, --arch\n\t      Specify the architecture to use for the extensions or\n\t      collections specified.  Defaults to the current running\n\t      architecture.\n\n       -V, --variant-suffix\n\t      Specify a variant, i.e., development, debug, or kasan, of\n\t      extensions or collections to prefer instead of the release\n\t      defaults.\n\n       -z, --no-authentication\n\t      Disable staging and validation of extensions when performing an\n\t      action.\n\n       -v, --verbose\n\t      Enable verbose output.\n\n       -r, --repository\n\t      Paths to directories containing extensions.
