An alternative name for this kind\n       of structure is merge-find.\n\n       Normally when dealing with sets and their elements the question is \"Is\n       this element E contained in this set S?\", with both E and S known.\n\n       Here the question is \"Which of several sets contains the element E?\".\n       I.e. while the element is known, the set is not, and we wish to find it\n       quickly. It is not quite the inverse of the original question, but\n       close.  Another operation which is often wanted is that of quickly\n       merging two sets into one, with the result still fast for finding\n       elements. Hence the alternative term merge-find for this.\n\n       Why now is this named a disjoint-set ?  Because another way of\n       describing the whole situation is that we have\n\n       •      a finite set S, containing\n\n       •      a number of elements E, split into\n\n       •      a set of partitions P. The latter term applies, because the\n\t      intersection of each pair P, P' of partitions is empty, with the\n\t      union of all partitions covering the whole set.\n\n       •      An alternative name for the partitions would be equvalence\n\t      classes, and all elements in the same class are considered as\n\t      equal.\n\n       Here is a pictorial representation of the concepts listed above:\n\n\t    +-----------------+ The outer lines are the boundaries of the set S.\n\t    |\t\t/     | The inner regions delineated by the skewed lines\n\t    |  *       /   *  | are the partitions P. The *'s denote the elements\n\t    |\t   *  / \\     | E in the set, each in a single partition, their\n\t    |*\t     /\t \\    | equivalence class.\n\t    |\t    /  *  \\   |\n\t    |\t   / *\t /    |\n\t    | *   /\\  * /     |\n\t    |\t /  \\  /      |\n\t    |\t/    \\/  *    |\n\t    |  / *    \\       |\n\t    | /     *  \\      |\n\t    +-----------------+"

This command may be used\n\t      to invoke various operations on the disjointset. It has the\n\t      following general form:\n\n\t      disjointsetName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     The option and the args determine the exact behavior of\n\t\t     the command. The following commands are possible for\n\t\t     disjointset objects:\n\n       disjointsetName add-partition elements\n\t      Creates a new partition in specified disjoint set, and fills it\n\t      with the values found in the set of elements. The command\n\t      maintains the integrity of the disjoint set, i.e. it verifies\n\t      that none of the elements are already part of the disjoint set\n\t      and throws an error otherwise."
