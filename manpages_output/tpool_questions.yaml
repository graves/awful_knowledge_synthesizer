It allows you\n       to post jobs to worker threads and wait for their completion. The\n       threadpool implementation is Tcl event-loop aware. That means that any\n       time a caller is forced to wait for an event (job being completed or a\n       worker thread becoming idle or initialized), the implementation will\n       enter the event loop and allow for servicing of other pending file or\n       timer (or any other supported) events.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       tpool::create ?options?\n\t      This command creates new threadpool. It accepts several options\n\t      as key-value pairs. Options are used to tune some threadpool\n\t      parameters.  The command returns the ID of the newly created\n\t      threadpool.\n\n\t      Following options are supported:\n\n\t      -minworkers number\n\t\t     Minimum number of worker threads needed for this\n\t\t     threadpool instance.  During threadpool creation, the\n\t\t     implementation will create somany worker threads upfront\n\t\t     and will keep at least number of them alive during the\n\t\t     lifetime of the threadpool instance.  Default value of\n\t\t     this parameter is 0 (zero). which means that a newly\n\t\t     threadpool will have no worker threads initialy. All\n\t\t     worker threads will be started on demand by callers\n\t\t     running tpool::post command and posting jobs to the job\n\t\t     queue.\n\n\t      -maxworkers number\n\t\t     Maximum number of worker threads allowed for this\n\t\t     threadpool instance.  If a new job is pending and there\n\t\t     are no idle worker threads available, the implementation\n\t\t     will try to create new worker thread. If the number of\n\t\t     available worker threads is lower than the given number,\n\t\t     new worker thread will start. The caller will\n\t\t     automatically enter the event loop and wait until the\n\t\t     worker thread has initialized. If. however, the number of\n\t\t     available worker threads is equal to the given number,\n\t\t     the caller will enter the event loop and wait for the\n\t\t     first worker thread to get idle, thus ready to run the\n\t\t     job.  Default value of this parameter is 4 (four), which\n\t\t     means that the threadpool instance will allow maximum of\n\t\t     4 worker threads running jobs or being idle waiting for\n\t\t     new jobs to get posted to the job queue.\n\n\t      -idletime seconds\n\t\t     Time in seconds an idle worker thread waits for the job\n\t\t     to get posted to the job queue. If no job arrives during\n\t\t     this interval and the time expires, the worker thread\n\t\t     will check the number of currently available worker\n\t\t     threads and if the number is higher than the number set\n\t\t     by the minthreads option, it will exit.  If an exitscript\n\t\t     has been defined, the exiting worker thread will first\n\t\t     run the script and then exit. Errors from the exit\n\t\t     script, if any, are ignored.\n\n\t\t     The idle worker thread is not servicing the event loop.\n\t\t     If you, however, put the worker thread into the event\n\t\t     loop, by evaluating the vwait or other related Tcl\n\t\t     commands, the worker thread will not be in the idle\n\t\t     state, hence the idle timer will not be taken into\n\t\t     account.  Default value for this option is unspecified,\n\t\t     hence, the Tcl interpreter of the worker thread will\n\t\t     contain just the initial set of Tcl commands.\n\n\t      -initcmd script\n\t\t     Sets a Tcl script used to initialize new worker thread.\n\t\t     This is usually used to load packages and commands in the\n\t\t     worker, set default variables, create namespaces, and\n\t\t     such. If the passed script runs into a Tcl error, the\n\t\t     worker will not be created and the initiating command\n\t\t     (either the tpool::create or tpool::post) will throw\n\t\t     error.  Default value for this option is unspecified,\n\t\t     hence, the Tcl interpreter of the worker thread will\n\t\t     contain just the initial set of Tcl commands.\n\n\t      -exitcmd script\n\t\t     Sets a Tcl script run when the idle worker thread exits.\n\t\t     This is normaly used to cleanup the state of the worker\n\t\t     thread, release reserved resources, cleanup memory and\n\t\t     such.  Default value for this option is unspecified, thus\n\t\t     no Tcl script will run on the worker thread exit."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tpool`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ntpool::preserve tpool\n\t      Each call to this command increments the reference counter of\n\t      the threadpool tpool by one (1). Command returns the value of\n\t      the reference counter after the increment.

When the reference\n\t      counter reaches zero (0), the threadpool tpool is marked for\n\t      termination.

A very simplistic model for building a server application would\n       be to create a new thread each time a request arrives and service the\n       request in the new thread. One of the disadvantages of this approach is\n       that the overhead of creating a new thread for each request is\n       significant; a server that created a new thread for each request would\n       spend more time and consume more system resources in creating and\n       destroying threads than in processing actual user requests. In addition\n       to the overhead of creating and destroying threads, active threads\n       consume system resources.  Creating too many threads can cause the\n       system to run out of memory or trash due to excessive memory\n       consumption."

By reusing threads\n       for multiple tasks, the thread-creation overhead is spread over many\n       tasks.  As a bonus, because the thread already exists when a request\n       arrives, the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated. Thus,\n       the request can be serviced immediately. Furthermore, by properly\n       tuning the number of threads in the thread pool, resource thrashing may\n       also be eliminated by forcing any request to wait until a thread is\n       available to process it.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       thread, tsv, ttrace\n\nKEYWORDS\n       thread, threadpool\n\nTcl Threading\t\t\t      2.6\t\t\t      tpool(n)"
