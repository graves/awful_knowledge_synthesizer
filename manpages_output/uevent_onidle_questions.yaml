The action to be run is configured during object\n       construction.\n\nAPI\n       The package exports a class, uevent::onidle, as specified below.\n\n       ::uevent::onidle objectName commandprefix\n\t      The command creates a new onidle object with an associated\n\t      global Tcl command whose name is objectName.  This command may\n\t      be used to invoke various operations on the object.\n\n\t      The commandprefix is the action to perform when the event loop\n\t      is idle and the user asked for it using the method request (See\n\t      below).\n\n       The object commands created by the class commands above have the form:\n\n       objectName request\n\t      This method requests the execution of the command prefix\n\t      specified during the construction of objectName the next time\n\t      the event loop is idle. Multiple requests are merged and cause\n\t      only one execution of the command prefix.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Examples of this type of deferal are buried in the (C-level)\n       implementations all the Tk widgets, defering geometry calculations and\n       window redraw activity in this manner.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category uevent of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       callback, deferal, event, idle, merge, on-idle\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2008 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the uevent::onidle package?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the uevent::onidle package to defer a Tcl command until the event loop is idle?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using uevent::onidle to merge multiple requests for executing a command when the system becomes idle?
