There are two columns in the table,\n     each containing a single structure: one column contains generic\n     information relevant to all interfaces, and the other contains\n     information specific to the particular class of interface.  (Generally\n     the latter will implement the SNMP MIB defined for that particular\n     interface class, if one exists and can be implemented in the kernel.)"

The manifest constants for each level in the sysctl(3)\n     name are defined in <net/if_mib.h>.  The index of the last row in the\n     table is given by “net.link.generic.system.ifcount” (or, using the\n     manifest constants, CTL_NET, PF_LINK, NETLINK_GENERIC, IFMIB_SYSTEM,\n     IFMIB_IFCOUNT).  A management application searching for a particular\n     interface should start with row 1 and continue through the table row-by-\n     row until the desired interface is found, or the interface count is\n     reached.  Note that the table may be sparse, i.e., a given row may not\n     exist, indicated by an errno of ENOENT.  Such an error should be ignored,\n     and the next row should be checked.\n\n     The generic interface information, common to all interfaces, can be\n     accessed via the following procedure:\n\n\t   int\n\t   get_ifmib_general(int row, struct ifmibdata *ifmd)\n\t   {\n\t\t   int name[6];\n\t\t   size_t len;"
