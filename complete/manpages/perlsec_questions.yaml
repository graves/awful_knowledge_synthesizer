Unlike most\n       command line shells, which are based on multiple substitution passes on\n       each line of the script, Perl uses a more conventional evaluation\n       scheme with fewer hidden snags.\tAdditionally, because the language has\n       more builtin functionality, it can rely less upon external (and\n       possibly untrustworthy) programs to accomplish its purposes.\n\nSECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\n       If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Perl\n       interpreter or modules maintained in the core Perl codebase, email the\n       details to perl-security@perl.org <mailto:perl-security@perl.org>.\n       This address is a closed membership mailing list monitored by the Perl\n       security team.\n\n       See perlsecpolicy for additional information.\n\nSECURITY MECHANISMS AND CONCERNS\n   Taint mode\n       Perl automatically enables a set of special security checks, called\n       taint mode, when it detects its program running with differing real and\n       effective user or group IDs.  The setuid bit in Unix permissions is\n       mode 04000, the setgid bit mode 02000; either or both may be set.  You\n       can also enable taint mode explicitly by using the -T command line\n       flag.  This flag is strongly suggested for server programs and any\n       program run on behalf of someone else, such as a CGI script.  Once\n       taint mode is on, it's on for the remainder of your script."

    Switches On the "#!" Line
           When you make a script executable, in order to make it usable as a
           command, the system will pass switches to perl from the script's #!
           line.  Perl checks that any command line switches given to a setuid (or
           setgid) script actually match the ones set on the #! line.  Some Unix
           and Unix-like environments impose a one-switch limit on the #!  line,
           so you may need to use something like "-wU" instead of "-w -U" under
           such systems.  (This issue should arise only in Unix or Unix-like
           environments that support #! and setuid or setgid scripts.)

       Taint mode and @INC
           When the taint mode ("-T") is in effect, the environment variables
           "PERL5LIB" and "PERLLIB" are ignored by Perl.  You can still adjust
           @INC from outside the program by using the "-I" command line option as
           explained in perlrun.  The two environment variables are ignored
           because they are obscured, and a user running a program could be
           unaware that they are set, whereas the "-I" option is clearly visible
           and therefore permitted.

This is a special\n       file already opened on the script, so that there can be no race\n       condition for evil scripts to exploit.  On these systems, Perl should\n       be compiled with \"-DSETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW\".  The Configure\n       program that builds Perl tries to figure this out for itself, so you\n       should never have to specify this yourself.  Most modern releases of\n       SysVr4 and BSD 4.4 use this approach to avoid the kernel race\n       condition.\n\n       If you don't have the safe version of set-id scripts, all is not lost.\n       Sometimes this kernel \"feature\" can be disabled, so that the kernel\n       either doesn't run set-id scripts with the set-id or doesn't run them\n       at all.\tEither way avoids the exploitability of the race condition,\n       but doesn't help in actually running scripts set-id."

    Some people mistakenly regard this as a security problem.  If your
           program does insecure things, and relies on people not knowing how to
           exploit those insecurities, it is not secure.  It is often possible for
           someone to determine the insecure things and exploit them without
           viewing the source.  Security through obscurity, the name for hiding
           your bugs instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.

           You can try using encryption via source filters (Filter::* from CPAN,
           or Filter::Util::Call and Filter::Simple since Perl 5.8).  But crackers
           might be able to decrypt it.  You can try using the byte code compiler
           and interpreter described below, but crackers might be able to de-
           compile it.  You can try using the native-code compiler described
           below, but crackers might be able to disassemble it.  These pose
           varying degrees of difficulty to people wanting to get at your code,
           but none can definitively conceal it (this is true of every language,
           not just Perl).
