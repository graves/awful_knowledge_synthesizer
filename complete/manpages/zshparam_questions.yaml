A name\n       may be any sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, or the\n       single characters `*', `@', `#', `?', `-', `$', or `!'.\tA parameter\n       whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore is also referred\n       to as a variable.\n\n       The attributes of a parameter determine the type of its value, often\n       referred to as the parameter type or variable type, and also control\n       other processing that may be applied to the value when it is\n       referenced.  The value type may be a scalar (a string, an integer, or a\n       floating point number), an array (indexed numerically), or an\n       associative array (an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by\n       name, also referred to as a hash).\n\n       Named scalar parameters may have the exported, -x, attribute, to copy\n       them into the process environment, which is then passed from the shell\n       to any new processes that it starts.  Exported parameters are called\n       environment variables. The shell also imports environment variables at\n       startup time and automatically marks the corresponding parameters as\n       exported.  Some environment variables are not imported for reasons of\n       security or because they would interfere with the correct operation of\n       other shell features."

    Array Subscripts
           Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript.  A
           subscript of the form `[exp]' selects the single element exp, where exp
           is an arithmetic expression which will be subject to arithmetic
           expansion as if it were surrounded by `$((...))'.  The elements are
           numbered beginning with 1, unless the KSH_ARRAYS option is set in which
           case they are numbered from zero.

           Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name,
           thus `${foo[2]}' is equivalent to `$foo[2]'.  If the KSH_ARRAYS option
           is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as bracketed
           expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts.

           If the KSH_ARRAYS option is not set, then by default accesses to an
           array element with a subscript that evaluates to zero return an empty
           string, while an attempt to write such an element is treated as an
           error.  For backward compatibility the KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT option can be
           set to cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see the
           description of the option in zshoptions(1).

However, unlike double\n       quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript expressions may appear\n       inside double-quoted strings or inside other subscript expressions (or\n       both!), so the rules have two important differences.\n\n       The first difference is that brackets (`[' and `]') must appear as\n       balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are preceded by a\n       backslash (`\\').  Therefore, within a subscript expression (and unlike\n       true double-quoting) the sequence `\\[' becomes `[', and similarly `\\]'\n       becomes `]'.  This applies even in cases where a backslash is not\n       normally required; for example, the pattern `[^[]' (to match any\n       character other than an open bracket) should be written `[^\\[]' in a\n       reverse-subscript pattern.  However, note that `\\[^\\[\\]' and even\n       `\\[^[]' mean the same thing, because backslashes are always stripped\n       when they appear before brackets!"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshparam`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nZLE_RPROMPT_INDENT <S>\n\t      If set, used to give the indentation between the right hand side\n\t      of the right prompt in the line editor as given by RPS1 or\n\t      RPROMPT and the right hand side of the screen.  If not set, the\n\t      value 1 is used.\n\n\t      Typically this will be used to set the value to 0 so that the\n\t      prompt appears flush with the right hand side of the screen.\n\t      This is not the default as many terminals do not handle this\n\t      correctly, in particular when the prompt appears at the extreme\n\t      bottom right of the screen.  Recent virtual terminals are more\n\t      likely to handle this case correctly.  Some experimentation is\n\t      necessary.\n\nzsh 5.9 \t\t\t May 14, 2022\t\t\t   ZSHPARAM(1)"
