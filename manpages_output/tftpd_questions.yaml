The TFTP server operates at the port\n     indicated in the ‘tftp’ service description; see services(5).  This\n     server should not be started manually; instead, it should be run using\n     launchd(8) using the plist /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist.  It\n     may be started using the launchctl(1) load command; refer to the\n     documentation for that utility for more information.\n\n     The use of tftp(1) does not require an account or password on the remote\n     system.  Due to the lack of authentication information, tftpd will allow\n     only publicly readable files to be accessed.  Files containing the string\n     “/../” or starting with “../” are not allowed.  Files may be written only\n     if they already exist and are publicly writable.  Note that this extends\n     the concept of “public” to include all users on all hosts that can be\n     reached through the network; this may not be appropriate on all systems,\n     and its implications should be considered before enabling tftp service.\n     The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tftpd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAccess to files may be restricted by invoking tftpd with a list of\n     directories by including up to 20 pathnames as server program arguments\n     in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist.  In this case access is\n     restricted to files whose names are prefixed by the one of the given\n     directories.  The given directories are also treated as a search path for\n     relative filename requests.\n\n     The -s option provides additional security by changing the root directory\n     of tftpd, thereby prohibiting accesses to outside of the specified\n     directory.  Because chroot(2) requires super-user privileges, tftpd must\n     be run as root.  However, after performing the chroot(2) call, tftpd will\n     set its user ID to that of the specified user, or “nobody” if no -u\n     option is specified.\n\n     The options are:\n\n     -c      Changes the default root directory of a connecting host via\n\t     chroot(2) based on the connecting IP address.  This prevents\n\t     multiple clients from writing to the same file at the same time.\n\t     If the directory does not exist, the client connection is\n\t     refused.  The -s option is required for -c and the specified\n\t     directory is used as a base."

    HISTORY
         The tftpd utility appeared in 4.2BSD; the -s option was introduced in
         FreeBSD 2.2, the -u option was introduced in FreeBSD 4.2, the -c option
         was introduced in FreeBSD 4.3, and the -F and -W options were introduced
         in FreeBSD 7.4.

         Support for Timeout Interval and Transfer Size Options (RFC2349) was
         introduced in FreeBSD 5.0, support for the TFTP Blocksize Option
         (RFC2348) and the blksize2 option was introduced in FreeBSD 7.4.

As a kludge, tftpd accepts a sequence of block number\n     which wrap to zero after 65535, even if the rollover option is not\n     specified.\n\n     Many tftp clients will not transfer files over 16,776,703 octets (32767\n     blocks), as they incorrectly count the block number using a signed rather\n     than unsigned 16-bit integer.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\t March 2, 2020\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
