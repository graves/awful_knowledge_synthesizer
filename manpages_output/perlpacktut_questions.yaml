    NAME
           perlpacktut - tutorial on "pack" and "unpack"

    DESCRIPTION
           "pack" and "unpack" are two functions for transforming data according
           to a user-defined template, between the guarded way Perl stores values
           and some well-defined representation as might be required in the
           environment of a Perl program. Unfortunately, they're also two of the
           most misunderstood and most often overlooked functions that Perl
           provides. This tutorial will demystify them for you.

    The Basic Principle
           Most programming languages don't shelter the memory where variables are
           stored. In C, for instance, you can take the address of some variable,
           and the "sizeof" operator tells you how many bytes are allocated to the
           variable. Using the address and the size, you may access the storage to
           your heart's content.

           In Perl, you just can't access memory at random, but the structural and
           representational conversion provided by "pack" and "unpack" is an
           excellent alternative. The "pack" function converts values to a byte
           sequence containing representations according to a given specification,
           the so-called "template" argument. "unpack" is the reverse process,
           deriving some values from the contents of a string of bytes. (Be
           cautioned, however, that not all that has been packed together can be
           neatly unpacked - a very common experience as seasoned travellers are
           likely to confirm.)

    Manpage text:

    Why, you may ask, would you need a chunk of memory containing some
           values in binary representation? One good reason is input and output
           accessing some file, a device, or a network connection, whereby this
           binary representation is either forced on you or will give you some
           benefit in processing. Another cause is passing data to some system
           call that is not available as a Perl function: "syscall" requires you
           to provide parameters stored in the way it happens in a C program. Even
           text processing (as shown in the next section) may be simplified with
           judicious usage of these two functions.

           To see how (un)packing works, we'll start with a simple template code
           where the conversion is in low gear: between the contents of a byte
           sequence and a string of hexadecimal digits. Let's use "unpack", since
           this is likely to remind you of a dump program, or some desperate last
           message unfortunate programs are wont to throw at you before they
           expire into the wild blue yonder. Assuming that the variable $mem holds
           a sequence of bytes that we'd like to inspect without assuming anything
           about its meaning, we can write

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlpacktut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nmy( $hex ) = unpack( 'H*', $mem );\n\t  print \"$hex\\n\";\n\n       whereupon we might see something like this, with each pair of hex\n       digits corresponding to a byte:\n\n\t  41204d414e204120504c414e20412043414e414c2050414e414d41\n\n       What was in this chunk of memory? Numbers, characters, or a mixture of\n       both? Assuming that we're on a computer where ASCII (or some similar)\n       encoding is used: hexadecimal values in the range 0x40 - 0x5A indicate\n       an uppercase letter, and 0x20 encodes a space. So we might assume it is\n       a piece of text, which some are able to read like a tabloid; but others\n       will have to get hold of an ASCII table and relive that firstgrader\n       feeling. Not caring too much about which way to read this, we note that\n       \"unpack\" with the template code \"H\" converts the contents of a sequence\n       of bytes into the customary hexadecimal notation. Since \"a sequence of\"\n       is a pretty vague indication of quantity, \"H\" has been defined to\n       convert just a single hexadecimal digit unless it is followed by a\n       repeat count. An asterisk for the repeat count means to use whatever\n       remains."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlpacktut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe inverse operation - packing byte contents from a string of\n       hexadecimal digits - is just as easily written. For instance:\n\n\t  my $s = pack( 'H2' x 10, 30..39 );\n\t  print \"$s\\n\";\n\n       Since we feed a list of ten 2-digit hexadecimal strings to \"pack\", the\n       pack template should contain ten pack codes. If this is run on a\n       computer with ASCII character coding, it will print 0123456789.\n\nPacking Text\n       Let's suppose you've got to read in a data file like this:\n\n\t   Date      |Description\t\t | Income|Expenditure\n\t   01/24/2001 Zed's Camel Emporium\t\t      1147.99\n\t   01/28/2001 Flea spray\t\t\t\t24.99\n\t   01/29/2001 Camel rides to tourists\t   235.00\n\n       How do we do it? You might think first to use \"split\"; however, since\n       \"split\" collapses blank fields, you'll never know whether a record was\n       income or expenditure. Oops. Well, you could always use \"substr\":\n\n\t   while (<>) {\n\t       my $date   = substr($_,\t0, 11);\n\t       my $desc   = substr($_, 12, 27);\n\t       my $income = substr($_, 40,  7);\n\t       my $expend = substr($_, 52,  7);\n\t       ...\n\t   }"

In fact, it's worse than it\n       may seem; the eagle-eyed may notice that the first field should only be\n       10 characters wide, and the error has propagated right through the\n       other numbers - which we've had to count by hand. So it's error-prone\n       as well as horribly unfriendly.\n\n       Or maybe we could use regular expressions:\n\n\t   while (<>) {\n\t       my($date, $desc, $income, $expend) =\n\t\t   m|(\\d\\d/\\d\\d/\\d{4}) (.{27}) (.{7})(.*)|;\n\t       ...\n\t   }\n\n       Urgh.

Well, it\n       does, if you use the right tools. \"pack\" and \"unpack\" are designed to\n       help you out when dealing with fixed-width data like the above. Let's\n       have a look at a solution with \"unpack\":\n\n\t   while (<>) {\n\t       my($date, $desc, $income, $expend) = unpack(\"A10xA27xA7A*\", $_);\n\t       ...\n\t   }\n\n       That looks a bit nicer; but we've got to take apart that weird\n       template.

The \"pack\"-ese for \"character\" is \"A\",\n       and ten of them are \"A10\". So if we just wanted to extract the dates,\n       we could say this:\n\n\t   my($date) = unpack(\"A10\", $_);\n\n       OK, what's next? Between the date and the description is a blank\n       column; we want to skip over that. The \"x\" template means \"skip\n       forward\", so we want one of those. Next, we have another batch of\n       characters, from 12 to 38. That's 27 more characters, hence \"A27\".\n       (Don't make the fencepost error - there are 27 characters between 12\n       and 38, not 26. Count 'em!)"

    Manpage text:

    16 bits won't get you too far with integers, but there is "l" and "L"
           for signed and unsigned 32-bit integers. And if this is not enough and
           your system supports 64 bit integers you can push the limits much
           closer to infinity with pack codes "q" and "Q". A notable exception is
           provided by pack codes "i" and "I" for signed and unsigned integers of
           the "local custom" variety: Such an integer will take up as many bytes
           as a local C compiler returns for "sizeof(int)", but it'll use at least
           32 bits.

           Each of the integer pack codes "sSlLqQ" results in a fixed number of
           bytes, no matter where you execute your program. This may be useful for
           some applications, but it does not provide for a portable way to pass
           data structures between Perl and C programs (bound to happen when you
           call XS extensions or the Perl function "syscall"), or when you read or
           write binary files. What you'll need in this case are template codes
           that depend on what your local C compiler compiles when you code
           "short" or "unsigned long", for instance. These codes and their
           corresponding byte lengths are shown in the table below.  Since the C
           standard leaves much leeway with respect to the relative sizes of these
           data types, actual values may vary, and that's why the values are given
           as expressions in C and Perl. (If you'd like to use values from %Config
           in your program you have to import it with "use Config".)

    (The clumsy construction of the template can be avoided - just read
           on!)

           We've taken some pains to construct the template so that it matches the
           contents of our frame buffer. Otherwise we'd either get undefined
           values, or "unpack" could not unpack all. If "pack" runs out of items,
           it will supply null strings (which are coerced into zeroes whenever the
           pack code says so).

       How to Eat an Egg on a Net
           The pack code for big-endian (high order byte at the lowest address) is
           "n" for 16 bit and "N" for 32 bit integers. You use these codes if you
           know that your data comes from a compliant architecture, but,
           surprisingly enough, you should also use these pack codes if you
           exchange binary data, across the network, with some system that you
           know next to nothing about. The simple reason is that this order has
           been chosen as the network order, and all standard-fearing programs
           ought to follow this convention. (This is, of course, a stern backing
           for one of the Lilliputian parties and may well influence the political
           development there.) So, if the protocol expects you to send a message
           by sending the length first, followed by just so many bytes, you could
           write:

           As you can see, the "big end" of the arrow touches the "s", which is a
           nice way to remember that ">" is the big-endian modifier. The same
           obviously works for "<", where the "little end" touches the code.

           You will probably find these modifiers even more useful if you have to
           deal with big- or little-endian C structures. Be sure to read "Packing
           and Unpacking C Structures" for more on that.

       Floating point Numbers
           For packing floating point numbers you have the choice between the pack
           codes "f", "d", "F" and "D". "f" and "d" pack into (or unpack from)
           single-precision or double-precision representation as it is provided
           by your system. If your systems supports it, "D" can be used to pack
           and unpack ("long double") values, which can offer even more resolution
           than "f" or "d".  Note that there are different long double formats.

           "F" packs an "NV", which is the floating point type used by Perl
           internally.

       Bit Strings
           Bits are the atoms in the memory world. Access to individual bits may
           have to be used either as a last resort or because it is the most
           convenient way to handle your data. Bit string (un)packing converts
           between strings containing a series of 0 and 1 characters and a
           sequence of bytes each containing a group of 8 bits. This is almost as
           simple as it sounds, except that there are two ways the contents of a

           Code "x" skips a byte, since we don't need the count yet. Code "n"
           takes care of the 16-bit big-endian integer address, and "C" unpacks
           the record type. Being at offset 4, where the data begins, we need the

           0.  Now we pick up the count, and zoom forth to offset 4, where we are
           now fully furnished to extract the exact number of data bytes, leaving

The moral of the story is that the\n       required alignment of a structure or array is propagated to the next\n       higher level where we have to consider padding at the end of each\n       component as well.

If the function you intend\n       to call expects a, say, \"void *\" value, you cannot simply take a\n       reference to a Perl variable. (Although that value certainly is a\n       memory address, it's not the address where the variable's contents are\n       stored.)"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlpacktut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTemplate code \"P\" promises to pack a \"pointer to a fixed length\n       string\".  Isn't this what we want? Let's try:\n\n\t   # allocate some storage and pack a pointer to it\n\t   my $memory = \"\\x00\" x $size;\n\t   my $memptr = pack( 'P', $memory );\n\n       But wait: doesn't \"pack\" just return a sequence of bytes? How can we\n       pass this string of bytes to some C code expecting a pointer which is,\n       after all, nothing but a number? The answer is simple: We have to\n       obtain the numeric address from the bytes returned by \"pack\".\n\n\t   my $ptr = unpack( 'L!', $memptr );\n\n       Obviously this assumes that it is possible to typecast a pointer to an\n       unsigned long and vice versa, which frequently works but should not be\n       taken as a universal law. - Now that we have this pointer the next\n       question is: How can we put it to good use? We need a call to some C\n       function where a pointer is expected. The read(2) system call comes to\n       mind:\n\n\t   ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);"

(Important note:\n       Perl's \"syscall\" does not require you to construct pointers in this\n       roundabout way. You simply pass a string variable, and Perl forwards\n       the address.)\n\n       How does \"unpack\" with \"P\" work? Imagine some pointer in the buffer\n       about to be unpacked: If it isn't the null pointer (which will smartly\n       produce the \"undef\" value) we have a start address - but then what?\n       Perl has no way of knowing how long this \"fixed length string\" is, so\n       it's up to you to specify the actual size as an explicit length after\n       \"P\"."

The\n       answer lies behind the simple fact that an \"unpack\" with \"p\" promises a\n       null-terminated string starting at the address taken from the buffer,\n       and that implies a length for the data item to be returned:\n\n\t  my $buf = pack( 'p', \"abc\\x00efhijklmn\" );\n\t  print unpack( 'p', $buf );\t# prints \"abc\"\n\n       Albeit this is apt to be confusing: As a consequence of the length\n       being implied by the string's length, a number after pack code \"p\" is a\n       repeat count, not a length as after \"P\".\n\n       Using \"pack(..., $x)\" with \"P\" or \"p\" to get the address where $x is\n       actually stored must be used with circumspection.
