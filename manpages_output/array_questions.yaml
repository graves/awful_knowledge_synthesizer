Unless otherwise specified for individual commands\n       below, arrayName must be the name of an existing array variable.  The\n       option argument determines what action is carried out by the command.\n       The legal options (which may be abbreviated) are:\n\n       array anymore arrayName searchId\n\t      Returns 1 if there are any more elements left to be processed in\n\t      an array search, 0 if all elements have already been returned.\n\t      SearchId indicates which search on arrayName to check, and must\n\t      have been the return value from a previous invocation of array\n\t      startsearch.  This option is particularly useful if an array has\n\t      an element with an empty name, since the return value from array\n\t      nextelement will not indicate whether the search has been\n\t      completed."

The first element\n\t      in each pair is the name of an element in arrayName and the\n\t      second element of each pair is the value of the array element.\n\t      The order of the pairs is undefined.
