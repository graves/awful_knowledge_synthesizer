It's a pattern\n       that matches certain strings and does not match others.\n\nDIFFERENT FLAVORS OF REs\n       Regular expressions (“RE”s), as defined by POSIX, come in two flavors:\n       extended REs (“ERE”s) and basic REs (“BRE”s).  EREs are roughly those\n       of the traditional egrep, while BREs are roughly those of the\n       traditional ed. This implementation adds a third flavor, advanced REs\n       (“ARE”s), basically EREs with some significant extensions.\n\n       This manual page primarily describes AREs. BREs mostly exist for\n       backward compatibility in some old programs; they will be discussed at\n       the end. POSIX EREs are almost an exact subset of AREs. Features of\n       AREs that are not present in EREs will be indicated."

The\n       quantifiers, and what a so-quantified atom matches, are:\n\n\t *     a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom\n\n\t +     a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom\n\n\t ?     a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom"

    To include a literal ] or - in the list, the simplest method is to
           enclose it in [. and .] to make it a collating element (see below).
           Alternatively, make it the first character (following a possible “^”),
           or (AREs only) precede it with “\”.  Alternatively, for “-”, make it
           the last character, or the second endpoint of a range. To use a literal
           - as the first endpoint of a range, make it a collating element or
           (AREs only) precede it with “\”.  With the exception of these, some
           combinations using [ (see next paragraphs), and escapes, all other
           special characters lose their special significance within a bracket
           expression.

       CHARACTER CLASSES
           Within a bracket expression, the name of a character class enclosed in
           [: and :] stands for the list of all characters (not all collating
           elements!) belonging to that class.  Standard character classes are:

           alpha   A letter.

The sequence is a\n       single element of the bracket expression's list. A bracket expression\n       in a locale that has multi-character collating elements can thus match\n       more than one character. So (insidiously), a bracket expression that\n       starts with ^ can match multi-character collating elements even if none\n       of them appear in the bracket expression!\n\n\t      (Note: Tcl has no multi-character collating elements. This\n\t      information is only for illustration.)\n\n       For example, assume the collating sequence includes a ch multi-\n       character collating element. Then the RE “[[.ch.]]*c” (zero or more\n       “chs” followed by “c”) matches the first five characters of “chchcc”.\n       Also, the RE “[^c]b” matches all of “chb” (because “[^c]” matches the\n       multi-character “ch”)."

    Manpage text:

    There is an inherent historical ambiguity between octal character-entry
           escapes and back references, which is resolved by heuristics, as hinted
           at above. A leading zero always indicates an octal escape. A single
           non-zero digit, not followed by another digit, is always taken as a
           back reference. A multi-digit sequence not starting with a zero is
           taken as a back reference if it comes after a suitable subexpression
           (i.e. the number is in the legal range for a back reference), and
           otherwise is taken as octal.

    METASYNTAX
           In addition to the main syntax described above, there are some special
           forms and miscellaneous syntactic facilities available.

           Normally the flavor of RE being used is specified by application-
           dependent means. However, this can be overridden by a director. If an
           RE of any flavor begins with “***:”, the rest of the RE is an ARE. If
           an RE of any flavor begins with “***=”, the rest of the RE is taken to
           be a literal string, with all characters considered ordinary
           characters.

    None of these metasyntax extensions is available if the application (or
           an initial “***=” director) has specified that the user's input be
           treated as a literal string rather than as an RE.

    MATCHING
           In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a given
           string, the RE matches the one starting earliest in the string. If the
           RE could match more than one substring starting at that point, its
           choice is determined by its preference: either the longest substring,
           or the shortest.

           Most atoms, and all constraints, have no preference. A parenthesized RE
           has the same preference (possibly none) as the RE. A quantified atom
           with quantifier {m} or {m}? has the same preference (possibly none) as
           the atom itself. A quantified atom with other normal quantifiers
           (including {m,n} with m equal to n) prefers longest match. A quantified
           atom with other non-greedy quantifiers (including {m,n}? with m equal
           to n) prefers shortest match. A branch has the same preference as the
           first quantified atom in it which has a preference. An RE consisting of
           two or more branches connected by the | operator prefers longest match.

    Manpage text:

    Subject to the constraints imposed by the rules for matching the whole
           RE, subexpressions also match the longest or shortest possible
           substrings, based on their preferences, with subexpressions starting
           earlier in the RE taking priority over ones starting later. Note that
           outer subexpressions thus take priority over their component
           subexpressions.

           Note that the quantifiers {1,1} and {1,1}? can be used to force longest
           and shortest preference, respectively, on a subexpression or a whole
           RE.

           Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating elements. An
           empty string is considered longer than no match at all. For example,
           “bb*” matches the three middle characters of “abbbc”,
           “(week|wee)(night|knights)” matches all ten characters of “weeknights”,
           when “(.*).*” is matched against “abc” the parenthesized subexpression
           matches all three characters, and when “(a*)*” is matched against “bc”
           both the whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression match an empty
           string.

    Manpage text:

    If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as if all
           case distinctions had vanished from the alphabet. When an alphabetic
           that exists in multiple cases appears as an ordinary character outside
           a bracket expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket
           expression containing both cases, so that x becomes “[xX]”.  When it
           appears inside a bracket expression, all case counterparts of it are
           added to the bracket expression, so that “[x]” becomes “[xX]” and
           “[^x]” becomes “[^xX]”.

           If newline-sensitive matching is specified, . and bracket expressions
           using ^ will never match the newline character (so that matches will
           never cross newlines unless the RE explicitly arranges it) and ^ and $
           will match the empty string after and before a newline respectively, in
           addition to matching at beginning and end of string respectively. ARE
           \A and \Z continue to match beginning or end of string only.

    Manpage text:

    If partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this affects . and
           bracket expressions as with newline-sensitive matching, but not ^ and
           $.

           If inverse partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this
           affects ^ and $ as with newline-sensitive matching, but not . and
           bracket expressions. This is not very useful but is provided for
           symmetry.

    LIMITS AND COMPATIBILITY
           No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs. Programs intended
           to be highly portable should not employ REs longer than 256 bytes, as a
           POSIX-compliant implementation can refuse to accept such REs.

           The only feature of AREs that is actually incompatible with POSIX EREs
           is that \ does not lose its special significance inside bracket
           expressions. All other ARE features use syntax which is illegal or has
           undefined or unspecified effects in POSIX EREs; the *** syntax of
           directors likewise is outside the POSIX syntax for both BREs and EREs.

    Many of the ARE extensions are borrowed from Perl, but some have been
           changed to clean them up, and a few Perl extensions are not present.
           Incompatibilities of note include “\b”, “\B”, the lack of special
           treatment for a trailing newline, the addition of complemented bracket
           expressions to the things affected by newline-sensitive matching, the
           restrictions on parentheses and back references in lookahead
           constraints, and the longest/shortest-match (rather than first-match)
           matching semantics.

           The matching rules for REs containing both normal and non-greedy
           quantifiers have changed since early beta-test versions of this
           package. (The new rules are much simpler and cleaner, but do not work
           as hard at guessing the user's real intentions.)

           Henry Spencer's original 1986 regexp package, still in widespread use
           (e.g., in pre-8.1 releases of Tcl), implemented an early version of
           today's EREs. There are four incompatibilities between regexp's near-
           EREs (“RREs” for short) and AREs. In roughly increasing order of
           significance:

    BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
           BREs differ from EREs in several respects.  “|”, “+”, and ? are
           ordinary characters and there is no equivalent for their functionality.
           The delimiters for bounds are \{ and “\}”, with { and } by themselves
           ordinary characters. The parentheses for nested subexpressions are \(
           and “\)”, with ( and ) by themselves ordinary characters. ^ is an
           ordinary character except at the beginning of the RE or the beginning
           of a parenthesized subexpression, $ is an ordinary character except at
           the end of the RE or the end of a parenthesized subexpression, and * is
           an ordinary character if it appears at the beginning of the RE or the
           beginning of a parenthesized subexpression (after a possible leading
           “^”).  Finally, single-digit back references are available, and \< and
           \> are synonyms for “[[:<:]]” and “[[:>:]]” respectively; no other
           escapes are available.
