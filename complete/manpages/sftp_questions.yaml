It may also use many\n     features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compression.\n\n     The destination may be specified either as [user@]host[:path] or as a URI\n     in the form sftp://[user@]host[:port][/path].\n\n     If the destination includes a path and it is not a directory, sftp will\n     retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive authentication method\n     is used; otherwise it will do so after successful interactive\n     authentication."

An optional trailing slash can be\n     used to force the path to be interpreted as a directory.\n\n     Since the destination formats use colon characters to delimit host names\n     from path names or port numbers, IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in\n     square brackets to avoid ambiguity.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -4      Forces sftp to use IPv4 addresses only.\n\n     -6      Forces sftp to use IPv6 addresses only.\n\n     -A      Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.
