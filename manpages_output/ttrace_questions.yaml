It\n       relies on the mechanics of Tcl command tracing and the Tcl unknown\n       command and mechanism.\n\n       The package requires Tcl threading extension but can be alternatively\n       used stand-alone within the AOLserver, a scalable webserver from\n       America Online.\n\n       In a nutshell, a short sample illustrating the usage of the ttrace with\n       the Tcl threading extension:\n\n\t   % package require Ttrace\n\t   2.6.5\n\n\t   % set t1 [thread::create {package require Ttrace; thread::wait}]\n\t   tid0x1802800\n\n\t   % ttrace::eval {proc test args {return test-[thread::id]}}\n\t   % thread::send $t1 test\n\t   test-tid0x1802800\n\n\t   % set t2 [thread::create {package require Ttrace; thread::wait}]\n\t   tid0x1804000\n\n\t   % thread::send $t2 test\n\t   test-tid0x1804000"

If the\n\t      command execution was ok, it takes necessary steps to\n\t      automatically propagate the trace epoch change to all threads in\n\t      the application.\tFor AOLserver, only newly created threads\n\t      actually receive the epoch change. For the Tcl threading\n\t      extension, all threads created by the extension are\n\t      automatically updated. If the command execution resulted in Tcl\n\t      error, no state propagation takes place."

By not actually\n       loading all necessary procedures (and other resources) in every thread\n       at the thread initialization time, but by deffering this to the time\n       the resource is actually referenced, significant improvements in both\n       memory consumption and thread initialization time can be achieved.
