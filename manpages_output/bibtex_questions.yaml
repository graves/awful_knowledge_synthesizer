Depending on the options used to invoke it it will\n\t      either return a token for the parser, or the parsed entries of\n\t      the input bibliography. Instead of performing an immediate parse\n\t      returning a predefined format the command can also enter an\n\t      event-based parsing style where all relevant entries in the\n\t      input are reported through callback commands, in the style of\n\t      SAX.\n\n       ::bibtex::parse text\n\t      In this form the command will assume that the specified text is\n\t      a bibliography in BibTeX format, parse it, and then return a\n\t      list containing one element per record found in the\n\t      bibliography. Note that comments, string definitions, preambles,\n\t      etc. will not show up in the result.  Each element will be a\n\t      list containing record type, bibliography key and record data,\n\t      in this order. The record data will be a dictionary, its keys\n\t      the keys of the record, with the associated values.\n\n       ::bibtex::parse ?-command cmd? -channel chan\n\t      In this form the command will reads the bibliography from the\n\t      specified Tcl channel chan and then returns the same data\n\t      structure as described above.\n\n\t      If however the option -command is specified the result will be a\n\t      handle for the parser instead and all processing will be\n\t      incremental and happen in the background. When the input has\n\t      been exhausted the callback cmd will be invoked with the result\n\t      of the parse. The exact definition for the callback is"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bibtex`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ncmd token parseresult\n\t\t     The parse result will have the structure explained above,\n\t\t     for the simpler forms of the parser.\n\n       Note that the parser will not close the channel after it has exhausted\n       it. This is still the responsibility of the user of the parser.\n\n       ::bibtex::parse ?-recordcommand\t recordcmd? ?-preamblecommand\n       preamblecmd? ?-stringcommand   stringcmd? ?-commentcommand  commentcmd?\n       ?-progresscommand progresscmd? (text | -channel chan)\n\t      This is the most low-level form for the parser. The returned\n\t      result will be a handle for the parser. During processing it\n\t      will invoke the invoke the specified callback commands for each\n\t      type of data found in the bibliography.\n\n\t      The processing will be incremental and happen in the background\n\t      if, and only if a Tcl channel chan is specified. For a text the\n\t      processing will happen immediately and all callbacks will be\n\t      invoked before the command itself returns.\n\n\t      The callbacks, i.e. *cmd, are all command prefixes and will be\n\t      invoked with additional arguments appended to them. The meaning\n\t      of the arguments depends on the callback and is explained below.\n\t      The first argument will however always be the handle of the\n\t      parser invoking the callback.\n\n\t      recordcmd token type key recorddict\n\t\t     This callback is invoked whenever the parser detects a\n\t\t     bibliography record in the input. Its arguments are the\n\t\t     record type, the bibliography key for the record, and a\n\t\t     dictionary containing the keys and values describing the\n\t\t     record. Any string macros known to the parser have\n\t\t     already been expanded.\n\n\t      preamblecmd token preambletext\n\t\t     This callback is invoked whenever the parser detects an\n\t\t     @preamble block in the input. The only additional\n\t\t     argument is the text found in the preamble block. By\n\t\t     default such entries are ignored.\n\n\t      stringcmd token stringdict\n\t\t     This callback is invoked whenever the parser detects an\n\t\t     @string-based macro definition in the input. The argument\n\t\t     is a dictionary with the macro names as keys and their\n\t\t     replacement strings as values. By default such\n\t\t     definitions are added to the parser state for use in\n\t\t     future bibliography records.\n\n\t      commentcmd token commenttext\n\t\t     This callback is invoked whenever the parser detects a\n\t\t     comment in the input. The only additional argument is the\n\t\t     comment text. By default such entries are ignored.\n\n\t      progresscmd token percent\n\t\t     This callback is invoked during processing to tell the\n\t\t     user about the progress which has been made. Its argument\n\t\t     is the percentage of data processed, as integer number\n\t\t     between 0 and 100.  In the case of incremental processing\n\t\t     the perecentage will always be -1 as the total number of\n\t\t     entries is not known beforehand."
