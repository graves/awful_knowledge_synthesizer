It can also be used for decoding DER, which is a\n       restricted subset of BER.\n\n       ASN.1 is a standard Abstract Syntax Notation, and BER are its Basic\n       Encoding Rules.\n\n       See http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/en/standards/index.htm for more\n       information about the standard.\n\n       Also see http://luca.ntop.org/Teaching/Appunti/asn1.html for A Layman's\n       Guide to a Subset of ASN.1, BER, and DER, an RSA Laboratories Technical\n       Note by Burton S. Kaliski Jr. (Revised November 1, 1993).

Raises an\n\t      error if the string contains characters other than decimal\n\t      numbers and space.\n\n       ::asn::asnPrintableString string\n\t      Returns the string encoding as ASN.1 PrintableString. Raises an\n\t      error if the string contains characters which are not allowed by\n\t      the Printable String datatype. The allowed characters are A-Z,\n\t      a-z, 0-9, space, apostrophe, colon, parentheses, plus, minus,\n\t      comma, period, forward slash, question mark, and the equals\n\t      sign.\n\n       ::asn::asnIA5String string\n\t      Returns the string encoded as ASN.1 IA5String.

Note that some legacy\n\t      applications such as Windows CryptoAPI do not like UTF8 strings.\n\t      Use BMPStrings if you are not sure.\n\n       ::asn::asnString string\n\t      Returns an encoded form of string, choosing the most restricted\n\t      ASN.1 string type possible. If the string contains non-ASCII\n\t      characters, then there is more than one string type which can be\n\t      used. See ::asn::defaultStringType.\n\n       ::asn::defaultStringType ?type?\n\t      Selects the string type to use for the encoding of non-ASCII\n\t      strings. Returns current default when called without argument.\n\t      If the argument type is supplied, it should be either UTF8 or\n\t      BMP to choose UTF8String or BMPString respectively.\n\n   DECODER\n       General notes:\n\n       [1]    Nearly all decoder commands take two arguments. These arguments\n\t      are variable names, except for ::asn::asnGetResponse. The first\n\t      variable contains the encoded ASN value to decode at the\n\t      beginning, and more, and the second variable is where the value\n\t      is stored to. The remainder of the input after the decoded value\n\t      is stored back into the datavariable.\n\n       [2]    After extraction the data variable is always modified first,\n\t      before by writing the extracted value to its variable. This\n\t      means that if both arguments refer to the same variable, it will\n\t      always contain the extracted value after the call, and not the\n\t      remainder of the input.\n\n       ::asn::asnPeekByte data_var byte_var\n\t      Retrieve the first byte of the data, without modifing data_var.\n\t      This can be used to check for implicit tags.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetLength data_var length_var\n\t      Decode the length information for a block of BER data. The tag\n\t      has already to be removed from the data.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetResponse chan data_var\n\t      Reads an encoded ASN sequence from the channel chan and stores\n\t      it into the variable named by data_var.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetInteger data_var int_var\n\t      Assumes that an encoded integer value is at the front of the\n\t      data stored in the variable named data_var, extracts and stores\n\t      it into the variable named by int_var. Additionally removes all\n\t      bytes associated with the value from the data for further\n\t      processing by the following decoder commands.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetEnumeration data_var enum_var\n\t      Assumes that an enumeration id is at the front of the data\n\t      stored in the variable named data_var, and stores it into the\n\t      variable named by enum_var.

Additionally removes all bytes associated with\n\t      the value from the data for further processing by the following\n\t      decoder commands.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetString data_var string_var ?type_var?\n\t      Decodes a user-readable string. This is a convenience function\n\t      which is able to automatically distinguish all supported ASN.1\n\t      string types and convert the input value appropriately.  See\n\t      ::asn::asnGetPrintableString, ::asnGetIA5String, etc.  below for\n\t      the type-specific conversion commands.\n\n\t      If the optional third argument type_var is supplied, then the\n\t      type of the incoming string is stored in the variable named by\n\t      it.\n\n\t      The function throws the error \"Invalid command name\n\t      asnGetSomeUnsupportedString\" if the unsupported string type\n\t      Unsupported is encountered. You can create the appropriate\n\t      function \"asn::asnGetSomeUnsupportedString\" in your application\n\t      if neccessary.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetNumericString data_var string_var\n\t      Assumes that a numeric string value is at the front of the data\n\t      stored in the variable named data_var, and stores it into the\n\t      variable named by string_var.

Additionally removes all bytes\n\t      associated with the value from the data for further processing\n\t      by the following decoder commands.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetUTF8String data_var string_var\n\t      Assumes that a UTF8 string value is at the front of the data\n\t      stored in the variable named data_var, and stores it into the\n\t      variable named by string_var, converting it into a proper Tcl\n\t      string.  Additionally removes all bytes associated with the\n\t      value from the data for further processing by the following\n\t      decoder commands.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetUTCTime data_var utc_var\n\t      Assumes that a UTC time value is at the front of the data stored\n\t      in the variable named data_var, and stores it into the variable\n\t      named by utc_var.

Additionally removes all bytes associated\n\t      with the value from the data for further processing by the\n\t      following decoder commands.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetNull data_var\n\t      Assumes that a NULL value is at the front of the data stored in\n\t      the variable named data_var and removes the bytes used to encode\n\t      it from the data.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetSequence data_var sequence_var\n\t      Assumes that an ASN sequence is at the front of the data stored\n\t      in the variable named data_var, and stores it into the variable\n\t      named by sequence_var. Additionally removes all bytes associated\n\t      with the value from the data for further processing by the\n\t      following decoder commands.\n\n\t      The data in sequence_var is encoded binary and has to be further\n\t      decoded according to the definition of the sequence, using the\n\t      decoder commands here.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetSet data_var set_var\n\t      Assumes that an ASN set is at the front of the data stored in\n\t      the variable named data_var, and stores it into the variable\n\t      named by set_var. Additionally removes all bytes associated with\n\t      the value from the data for further processing by the following\n\t      decoder commands.\n\n\t      The data in set_var is encoded binary and has to be further\n\t      decoded according to the definition of the set, using the\n\t      decoder commands here.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetApplication data_var appNumber_var ?content_var?\n       ?encodingType_var?\n\t      Assumes that an ASN application construct is at the front of the\n\t      data stored in the variable named data_var, and stores its id\n\t      into the variable named by appNumber_var. Additionally removes\n\t      all bytes associated with the value from the data for further\n\t      processing by the following decoder commands.  If a content_var\n\t      is specified, then the command places all data associated with\n\t      it into the named variable, in the binary form which can be\n\t      processed using the decoder commands of this package.  If a\n\t      encodingType_var is specified, then that var is set to 1 if the\n\t      encoding is constructed and 0 if it is primitive.\n\n\t      Otherwise it is the responsibility of the caller to decode the\n\t      remainder of the application construct based on the id retrieved\n\t      by this command, using the decoder commands of this package.\n\n       ::asn::asnGetContext data_var contextNumber_var ?content_var?\n       ?encodingType_var?\n\t      Assumes that an ASN context tag construct is at the front of the\n\t      data stored in the variable named data_var, and stores its id\n\t      into the variable named by contextNumber_var. Additionally\n\t      removes all bytes associated with the value from the data for\n\t      further processing by the following decoder commands.  If a\n\t      content_var is specified, then the command places all data\n\t      associated with it into the named variable, in the binary form\n\t      which can be processed using the decoder commands of this\n\t      package.\tIf a encodingType_var is specified, then that var is\n\t      set to 1 if the encoding is constructed and 0 if it is\n\t      primitive.\n\n\t      Otherwise it is the responsibility of the caller to decode the\n\t      remainder of the construct based on the id retrieved by this\n\t      command, using the decoder commands of this package.\n\n   HANDLING TAGS\n       Working with ASN.1 you often need to decode tagged values, which use a\n       tag thats different from the universal tag for a type. In those cases\n       you have to replace the tag with the universal tag used for the type,\n       to decode the value.  To decode a tagged value use the ::asn::asnRetag\n       to change the tag to the appropriate type to use one of the decoders\n       for primitive values.  To help with this the module contains three\n       functions:\n\n       ::asn::asnPeekTag data_var tag_var tagtype_var constr_var\n\t      The ::asn::asnPeekTag command can be used to take a peek at the\n\t      data and decode the tag value, without removing it from the\n\t      data. The tag_var gets set to the tag number, while the\n\t      tagtype_var gets set to the class of the tag. (Either UNIVERSAL,\n\t      CONTEXT, APPLICATION or PRIVATE). The constr_var is set to 1 if\n\t      the tag is for a constructed value, and to 0 for not\n\t      constructed. It returns the length of the tag.\n\n       ::asn::asnTag tagnumber ?class? ?tagstyle?\n\t      The ::asn::asnTag can be used to create a tag value. The\n\t      tagnumber gives the number of the tag, while the class gives one\n\t      of the classes (UNIVERSAL,CONTEXT,APPLICATION or PRIVATE). The\n\t      class may be abbreviated to just the first letter (U,C,A,P),\n\t      default is UNIVERSAL.  The tagstyle is either C for Constructed\n\t      encoding, or P for primitve encoding. It defaults to P. You can\n\t      also use 1 instead of C and 0 instead of P for direct use of the\n\t      values returned by ::asn::asnPeekTag.\n\n       ::asn::asnRetag data_var newTag\n\t      Replaces the tag in front of the data in data_var with newTag.\n\t      The new Tag can be created using the ::asn::asnTag command.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Examples for the usage of this package can be found in the\n       implementation of package ldap.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category asn of the\n       Tcllib SF Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].\n       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either\n       package and/or documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       asn, ber, cer, der, internet, protocol, x.208, x.209\n\nCATEGORY\n       Networking\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2004 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>\n       Copyright (c) 2004 Jochen Loewer <loewerj@web.de>\n       Copyright (c) 2004-2008 Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>"
