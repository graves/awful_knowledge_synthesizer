Internally each dispatcher is in\n       essence a deterministic finite automaton with tree structure.\n\nCLASS API\n       The package exports a single command, the class command, enabling the\n       creation of dispatcher instances. Its API is:\n\n       term::receive::bind object ?map?\n\t      This command creates a new dispatcher object with the name\n\t      object, initializes it, and returns the fully qualified name of\n\t      the object command as its result.\n\n\t      The argument is a dictionary mapping from strings, i.e.\n\t      character sequences to the command prefices to invoke when the\n\t      sequence is found in the input stream.\n\nOBJECT API\n       The objects created by the class command provide the methods listed\n       below:\n\n       object map str cmd\n\t      This method adds an additional mapping from the string str to\n\t      the action cmd. The mapping will take effect immediately should\n\t      the processor be in a prefix of str, or at the next reset\n\t      operation. The action is a command prefix and will be invoked\n\t      with one argument appended to it, the character sequence causing\n\t      the invokation. It is executed in the global namespace.\n\n       object default cmd\n\t      This method defines a default action cmd which will be invoked\n\t      whenever an unknown character sequence is encountered. The\n\t      command prefix is handled in the same as the regular action\n\t      defined via method map.\n\n       object listen ?chan?\n\t      This methods sets up a filevent listener for the channel with\n\t      handle chan and invokes the dispatcher object whenever\n\t      characters have been received, or EOF was reached.\n\n\t      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.\n\n       object unlisten ?chan?\n\t      This methods removes the filevent listener for the channel with\n\t      handle chan.\n\n\t      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.\n\n       object reset\n\t      This method resets the character processor to the beginning of\n\t      the tree.\n\n       object next char\n\t      This method causes the character processor to process the\n\t      character c. This may simply advance the internal state, or\n\t      invoke an associated action for a recognized sequence.\n\n       object process str\n\t      This method causes the character processor to process the\n\t      character sequence str, advancing the internal state and\n\t      invoking action as necessary. This is a callback for listen.\n\n       object eof\n\t      This method causes the character processor to handle EOF on the\n\t      input. This is currently no-op.  This is a callback for listen.\n\nNOTES\n       The simplicity of the DFA means that it is not possible to recognize a\n       character sequence with has a another recognized character sequence as\n       its prefix.\n\n       In other words, the set of recognized strings has to form a prefix\n       code.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category term of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       character input, control, dispatcher, listener, receiver, terminal\n\nCATEGORY\n       Terminal control\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2006 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
