    The REGEXP structure
           The REGEXP struct is defined in regexp.h.  All regex engines must be
           able to correctly build such a structure in their "comp" routine.

           The REGEXP structure contains all the data that Perl needs to be aware
           of to properly work with the regular expression.  It includes data
           about optimisations that Perl can use to determine if the regex engine
           should really be used, and various other control info that is needed to
           properly execute patterns in various contexts, such as if the pattern
           anchored in some way, or what flags were used during the compile, or if
           the program contains special constructs that Perl needs to be aware of.

           In addition it contains two fields that are intended for the private
           use of the regex engine that compiled the pattern.  These are the
           "intflags" and "pprivate" members.  "pprivate" is a void pointer to an
           arbitrary structure, whose use and management is the responsibility of
           the compiling engine.  Perl will never modify either of these values.

       "mother_re"
           TODO, see commit 28d8d7f41a.

       "extflags"
           This will be used by Perl to see what flags the regexp was compiled
           with, this will normally be set to the value of the flags parameter by
           the comp callback.  See the comp documentation for valid flags.

       "minlen" "minlenret"
           The minimum string length (in characters) required for the pattern to
           match.  This is used to prune the search space by not bothering to
           match any closer to the end of a string than would allow a match.  For
           instance there is no point in even starting the regex engine if the
           minlen is 10 but the string is only 5 characters long.  There is no way
           that the pattern can match.

           "minlenret" is the minimum length (in characters) of the string that
