The replica device provides to a process an\n     interface identical to that described in tty(4).  However, whereas all\n     other devices which provide the interface described in tty(4) have a\n     hardware device of some sort behind them, the replica device has,\n     instead, another process manipulating it through the primary half of the\n     pseudo terminal.  That is, anything written on the primary device is\n     given to the replica device as input and anything written on the replica\n     device is presented as input on the primary device.\n\n     In configuring, if an optional count is given in the specification, that\n     number of pseudo terminal pairs are configured; the default count is 32."
