Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perllinux`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERLLINUX(1)\t       Perl Programmers Reference Guide \t  PERLLINUX(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perllinux - Perl version 5 on Linux systems\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This document describes various features of Linux that will affect how\n       Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.\n\n   Deploying Perl on Linux\n       Normally one can install /usr/bin/perl on Linux using your\n       distribution's package manager (e.g: \"sudo apt-get install perl\", or\n       \"sudo dnf install perl\"). Note that sometimes one needs to install some\n       extra system packages in order to be able to use CPAN frontends, and\n       that messing with the system's perl is not always recommended. One can\n       use perlbrew <https://perlbrew.pl/> to avoid such issues.\n\n       Otherwise, perl should build fine on Linux using the mainstream\n       compilers GCC and clang, while following the usual instructions.\n\n   Experimental Support for Sun Studio Compilers for Linux OS\n       Sun Microsystems has released a port of their Sun Studio compilers for\n       Linux.  As of May 2019, the last stable release took place on 2017, and\n       one can buy support contracts for them.\n\n       There are some special instructions for building Perl with Sun Studio\n       on Linux.  Following the normal \"Configure\", you have to run make as\n       follows:\n\n\t   LDLOADLIBS=-lc make\n\n       \"LDLOADLIBS\" is an environment variable used by the linker to link\n       \"/ext\" modules to glibc.  Currently, that environment variable is not\n       getting populated by a combination of \"Config\" entries and\n       \"ExtUtil::MakeMaker\".  While there may be a bug somewhere in Perl's\n       configuration or \"ExtUtil::MakeMaker\" causing the problem, the most\n       likely cause is an incomplete understanding of Sun Studio by this\n       author.\tFurther investigation is needed to get this working better.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Steve Peters <steve@fisharerojo.org>\n\n       Please report any errors, updates, or suggestions to\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t\t  PERLLINUX(1)"
