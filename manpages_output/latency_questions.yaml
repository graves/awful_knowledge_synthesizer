This option\n\t     overrides the default location of the system call code file,\n\t     which is found in /usr/share/misc/trace.codes.\n\n     -h      Display high resolution interrupt latencies and write them to\n\t     latencies.csv (truncate existing file) upon exit.\n\n     -m      Display per-CPU interrupt latency statistics.\n\n     -it threshold\n\t     Set the interrupt latency threshold, expressed in microseconds.\n\t     If the latency exceeds this value, and a log file has been\n\t     specified, a record of what occurred during this time is\n\t     recorded."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the latency command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the latency command to monitor high-resolution interrupt latencies and save them to a CSV file?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the latency command to set a threshold for interrupt latency and log occurrences exceeding that threshold?

This option allows\n\t     you to specify an alternate booted kernel.\n\n     -p priority\n\t     Specifies the priority level to observe scheduler latencies for.\n\t     The default is realtime ( 97 ). A range of priorities to monitor\n\t     can also be provided, for example 31-47 or 0-127\n\n     -st threshold\n\t     Set the scheduler latency threshold in microseconds.  If latency\n\t     exceeds this, and a log file has been specified, a record of what\n\t     occurred during this time is recorded.\n\n     -R raw_file\n\t     Specifies a raw trace file to use as input.\n\n     The data columns displayed are as follows:\n\n     SCHEDULER\t\t       The number of context switches that fall within\n\t\t\t       the described delay.\n\n     INTERRUPTS \t       The number of interrupts that fall within the\n\t\t\t       described delay."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the latency command-line tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the latency tool to monitor scheduler latencies for priorities 31 through 47 with a threshold of 50 microseconds and log the results to a file named 'latency.log'?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to analyze a raw trace file called 'trace.raw' and display scheduler latency statistics?
