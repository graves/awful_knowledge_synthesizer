One or more object\n       identifiers (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each\n       variable name is given in the format specified in variables(5).\tFor\n       each one, the variable that is lexicographically \"next\" in the remote\n       entity's MIB will be returned.\n\n       For example:\n\n       snmpgetnext -c public zeus interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.1\n\n       will retrieve the variable interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2:\n\n       interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2 = softwareLoopback(24)\n\n       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an\n       error message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what way the\n       request was malformed."

The\n\t       only time this is really useful is if you specified a OID that\n\t       didn't exist in your request and you're using SNMPv1 which\n\t       requires \"all or nothing\" kinds of requests.\n\n       In addition to this option, snmpgetnext takes the common options\n       described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.  Note that snmpgetnext\n       REQUIRES an argument specifying the agent to query and at least one OID\n       argument, as described there.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       snmpcmd(1), snmpget(1), variables(5).\n\nV5.6.2.1\t\t\t  04 Mar 2002\t\t\tSNMPGETNEXT(1)"
