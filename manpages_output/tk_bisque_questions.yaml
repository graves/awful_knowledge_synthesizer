It does\n       this by modifying the colors of existing widgets and by changing the\n       option database so that future widgets will use the new color scheme.\n       If tk_setPalette is invoked with a single argument, the argument is the\n       name of a color to use as the normal background color;  tk_setPalette\n       will compute a complete color palette from this background color.\n       Alternatively, the arguments to tk_setPalette may consist of any number\n       of name-value pairs, where the first argument of the pair is the name\n       of an option in the Tk option database and the second argument is the\n       new value to use for that option.  The following database names are\n       currently supported:\n\n\t      activeBackground\t\t     foregroundselectColor\n\t      activeForeground\t\t     highlightBackgroundselectBackground\n\t      background      highlightColor selectForeground\n\t      disabledForeground\t     insertBackgroundtroughColor\n\n       tk_setPalette tries to compute reasonable defaults for any options that\n       you do not specify.  You can specify options other than the above ones\n       and Tk will change those options on widgets as well.  This feature may\n       be useful if you are using custom widgets with additional color\n       options.\n\n       Once it has computed the new value to use for each of the color\n       options, tk_setPalette scans the widget hierarchy to modify the options\n       of all existing widgets.  For each widget, it checks to see if any of\n       the above options is defined for the widget.  If so, and if the\n       option's current value is the default, then the value is changed;  if\n       the option has a value other than the default, tk_setPalette will not\n       change it.  The default for an option is the one provided by the widget\n       ([lindex [$w configure $option] 3]) unless tk_setPalette has been run\n       previously, in which case it is the value specified in the previous\n       invocation of tk_setPalette.\n\n       After modifying all the widgets in the application, tk_setPalette adds\n       options to the option database to change the defaults for widgets\n       created in the future.  The new options are added at priority\n       widgetDefault, so they will be overridden by options from the\n       .Xdefaults file or options specified on the command-line that creates a\n       widget.\n\n       The procedure tk_bisque is provided for backward compatibility: it\n       restores the application's colors to the light brown (“bisque”) color\n       scheme used in Tk 3.6 and earlier versions."
