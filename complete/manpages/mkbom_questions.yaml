You must specify\n     either a source as a directory, or a text file containing a file listing\n     as outputted by lsbom(8).\tmkbom will generate bill-of-materials\n     information based on that information.  Any existing bomfile will be\n     overwritten by the new bomfile.\n\n     Options:\n\n     -h \t\t   print full usage\n\n     -s \t\t   create a simplified bom containing only file paths\n\n     -i filelist\t   use the information in filelist, one entry per\n\t\t\t   line, to construct the bom file. The format of the\n\t\t\t   file should match lsbom(8) output with no\n\t\t\t   formatting options (the default). If -s is given to\n\t\t\t   mkbom, the input filelist should contain only\n\t\t\t   pathnames, as with lsbom -s.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     bom(5), ditto(8), mkbom(8)"
