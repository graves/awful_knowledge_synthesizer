Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `evim`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nEVIM(1) \t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t       EVIM(1)\n\nNAME\n       evim - easy Vim, edit a file with Vim and setup for modeless editing\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       evim [options] [file ..]\n       eview\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       eVim starts Vim and sets options to make it behave like a modeless\n       editor.\tThis is still Vim but used as a point-and-click editor.  This\n       feels a lot like using Notepad on MS-Windows.  eVim will always run in\n       the GUI, to enable the use of menus and toolbar.\n\n       Only to be used for people who really can't work with Vim in the normal\n       way.  Editing will be much less efficient.\n\n       eview is the same, but starts in read-only mode.  It works just like\n       evim -R.\n\n       See vim(1) for details about Vim, options, etc.\n\n       The 'insertmode' option is set to be able to type text directly.\n       Mappings are setup to make Copy and Paste work with the MS-Windows\n       keys.  CTRL-X cuts text, CTRL-C copies text and CTRL-V pastes text.\n       Use CTRL-Q to obtain the original meaning of CTRL-V."
