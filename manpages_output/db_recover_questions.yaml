This option will rarely\n       be used unless a DB_CONFIG file is present in the home directory. If a\n       DB_CONFIG file is not present, then the regions will be created with\n       default parameter values.\n\n     -h\n       Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the\n       current working directory is used.\n\n     -P\n       Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities\n       overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a\n       window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see\n       command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the\n       memory containing the command-line arguments."

    Manpage text:

    In the case of catastrophic recovery, an archival copy -- or snapshot --
         of all database files must be restored along with all of the log files
         written since the database file snapshot was made. (If disk space is a
         problem, log files may be referenced by symbolic links). For further
         information on creating a database snapshot, see Archival Procedures. For
         further information on performing recovery, see Recovery Procedures.

         If the failure was not catastrophic, the files present on the system at
         the time of failure are sufficient to perform recovery.

         If log files are missing, db_recover will identify the missing log
         file(s) and fail, in which case the missing log files need to be restored
         and recovery performed again.

         The db_recover utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for
         the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility
         was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to
         avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
         db_recover should always be given the chance to detach from the
         environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_recover to release all
         environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
         (SIGINT).
