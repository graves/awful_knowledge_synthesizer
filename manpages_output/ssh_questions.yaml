It is intended to provide secure\n     encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure\n     network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets\n     can also be forwarded over the secure channel.\n\n     ssh connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be\n     specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form\n     ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity to the\n     remote machine using one of several methods (see below)."

    Manpage text:

    When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server
         either executes the given command in a non-interactive session or, if no
         command has been specified, logs into the machine and gives the user a
         normal shell as an interactive session.  All communication with the
         remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.

         If an interactive session is requested, ssh by default will only request
         a pseudo-terminal (pty) for interactive sessions when the client has one.
         The flags -T and -t can be used to override this behaviour.

         If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the user may use the escape
         characters noted below.

         If no pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the session is transparent and
         can be used to reliably transfer binary data.  On most systems, setting
         the escape character to “none” will also make the session transparent
         even if a tty is used.

         The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine
         exits and all X11 and TCP connections have been closed.
