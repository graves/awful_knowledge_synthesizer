In the\n\t      latter case, name is displayed in the topic menu, and selecting\n\t      the name loads file.

The path of the link to be displayed is appended\n\t      before evaling the command. A suggested use might be to busy the\n\t      widget while a new page is being displayed.\n\n       Name:   afterlink\n       Class:  AfterLink\n       Command-Line Switch:    -afterlink\n\n\t      Specifies a command to be eval'ed after a new link is completely\n\t      displayed.  The path of the link that was displayed is appended\n\t      before evaling the command.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The iwidgets::hyperhelp command creates a shell window with a pulldown\n       menu showing a list of topics. The topics are displayed by importing a\n       HTML formatted file named helpdir/topic.html. For a list of supported\n       HTML tags, see scrolledhtml(n).\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::hyperhelp command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget.\tIt has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for dialog widgets:\n\nINHERITED METHODS\n       activate        center\t      childsite       deactivate\n\n       See the \"shell\" manual entry for details on the above inherited\n       methods.\n\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::hyperhelp command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::hyperhelp command.\n\n       pathName showtopic topic\n\t      Display html file helpdir/topic.html. Topic may optionally be of\n\t      the form topicname#anchorname. In this form, either topicname or\n\t      anchorname or both may be empty. If topicname is empty, the\n\t      current topic is assumed. If anchorname is empty, the top of the\n\t      document is assumed\n\n       pathName followlink href\n\t      Display html file href. Href may be optionally be of the form\n\t      filename#anchorname. In this form, either filename or anchorname\n\t      or both may be empty. If filename is empty, the current document\n\t      is assumed. If anchorname is empty, the top of the document is\n\t      assumed.\n\n       pathName forward\n\t      Display html file one forward in history list, if applicable.\n\n       pathName back\n\t      Display html file one back in history list, if applicable.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\t       package require Iwidgets 4.0\n\t       iwidgets::hyperhelp .h -topics { Intro Help } -helpdir ~/help\n\t       .h showtopic Intro"
