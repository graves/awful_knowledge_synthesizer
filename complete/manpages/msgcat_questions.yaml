By using the\n       --more-than option, greater commonality may be requested before\n       messages are printed.  Conversely, the --less-than option may be used\n       to specify less commonality before messages are printed (i.e.\n       --less-than=2 will only print the unique messages).  Translations,\n       comments, extracted comments, and file positions will be cumulated,\n       except that if --use-first is specified, they will be taken from the\n       first PO file to define them.\n\n       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options\n       too.\n\n   Input file location:\n       INPUTFILE ...\n\t      input files\n\n       -f, --files-from=FILE\n\t      get list of input files from FILE"
