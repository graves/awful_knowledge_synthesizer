Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `nbdst`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nNBDST(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t      NBDST(8)\n\nNAME\n     nbdst â€“ NetBoot deferred shadow tool\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     nbdst [-recycle | -preallocate size] devnode shadowfile\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     nbdst is used during NetBoot to associate a shadow file with the disk\n     image being used as the root device. After the shadow file is attached,\n     subsequent writes to the root device will be redirected to the shadow\n     file, which normally resides on local storage.  nbdst is invoked by\n     /etc/rc.netboot\n\nARGUMENTS\n     The following arguments must be specified:\n     devnode\t    The device node of the root device, in the form \"disk0\"\n     shadowfile     Path to a shadow file which will be created and associated\n\t\t    with the NetBoot root device\n\nOPTIONS\n     -recycle  If a shadow file already exists, reset it and use it again.\n\t       Otherwise, information written to an existing shadow file will\n\t       reappear.  Reusing a previous shadow file without resetting it\n\t       requires that the shadow file be created with the same base\n\t       image."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the nbdst command to associate a shadow file with a NetBoot root device, ensuring that any existing shadow file is reset before use?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the nbdst command to create a shadow file for a NetBoot root device located at 'disk0' with the shadow file saved to '/Volumes/NetBoot/shadow.img'?
