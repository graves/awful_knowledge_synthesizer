It is\n       configured simply by \"database dnssrv\" followed a suffix directive,\n       e.g. suffix \"\".\n\nACCESS CONTROL\n       The dnssrv backend does not honor all ACL semantics as described in\n       slapd.access(5).  In fact, this backend only implements the search\n       operation when the manageDSAit control (RFC 3296) is used, otherwise\n       for every operation a referral, whenever appropriate, or an error is\n       returned.  Currently, there is no means to condition the returning of\n       the referral by means of ACLs; no access control is implemented, except\n       for read (=r) access to the returned entries, which is actually\n       provided by the frontend.  Note, however, that the information returned\n       by this backend is collected through the DNS, so it is public by\n       definition."
