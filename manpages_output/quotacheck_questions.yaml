If any inconsistencies are detected, both the\n     quota file and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are\n     updated (the latter only occurs if an active filesystem is checked).  By\n     default both user and group quotas are checked.\n\n     Available options:\n\n     -a      If the -a flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,\n\t     quotacheck will check all the read-write filesystems with an\n\t     existing mount option file at its root.  The mount option file\n\t     specifies the types of quotas that are to be checked.\n\n     -g      Only group quotas are checked. The mount option file,\n\t     .quota.ops.group, must exist at the root of the filesystem."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use quotacheck to check all read-write filesystems for quota inconsistencies, focusing only on group quotas?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using quotacheck to check a specific filesystem for both user and group quotas?

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `quotacheck`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-u      Only user quotas are checked.  The mount option file,\n\t     .quota.ops.user, must exist at the root of the filesystem.\n\n     -v      quotacheck reports discrepancies between the calculated and\n\t     recorded disk quotas.\n\n     Specifying both -g and -u is equivalent to the default.  Parallel passes\n     are run on the filesystems required, in an identical fashion to fsck(8).\n\n     Normally quotacheck operates silently.\n\n     Quotacheck expects each filesystem being checked to have quota data files\n     named .quota.user and/or .quota.group located at the filesystem root.  If\n     a binary data file is not present, quotacheck will create it.  The\n     default filename and root location cannot be overridden.\n\n     Quotacheck is normally run at fsck time.\n\n     Quotacheck accesses the raw device in calculating the actual disk usage\n     for each user.  Thus, the filesystems checked should be quiescent while\n     quotacheck is running.\n\nFILES\n     Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the mounted\n     filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files whose existence\n     indicates that quotas are to be enabled for that filesystem. The binary\n     data files will be created by quotacheck, if they don't already exist."
