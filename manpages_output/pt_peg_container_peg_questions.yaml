Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package provides a sub-type of pt::peg::container which is\n       preloaded with a parsing expression grammar describing a textual format\n       for parsing expression grammars.\n\n       The sub-type provides the exact same API as pt::peg::container. Instead\n       of duplicating its contents the reader is asked to read the referenced\n       document.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category pt of the\n       Tcllib SF Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].\n       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either\n       package and/or documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       EBNF, LL(k), PEG, TDPL, context-free languages, expression, grammar,\n       matching, parser, parsing expression, parsing expression grammar, push\n       down automaton, recursive descent, state, top-down parsing languages,\n       transducer\n\nCATEGORY\n       Parsing and Grammars\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2009 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
