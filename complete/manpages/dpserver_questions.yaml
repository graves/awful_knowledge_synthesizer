This file is required in order to start\n       a Proxy Server and is consulted when a mount command specifies the\n       Proxy Server option.\n\n       The sndpscfg command is normally used to generate and maintain dpserver\n       files on non-Windows systems - see sndpscfg(8) for details.  To view\n       and adjust the Proxy Server settings on Windows systems, use the LAN\n       Client/Gateway tab in the Client Configuration tool instead.\n\nSYNTAX\n       At minimum, the dpserver file specifies the network interfaces to use\n       for Proxy Server.  It can also be used to override various Proxy Server\n       tuning parameters."

If a file-system-specific dpserver.VolName file\n       exists, it will be used in preference to the default dpserver file.\n\n       The format rules for a line in the dpserver file are:\n\n       Any line beginning with \"#\" is considered a comment line.\n\n       Blank/empty lines are ignored.\n\n       There are several keywords:\n\n\t      interface ifname [address ipaddr]\n\t      transfer_buffer_size_kb n\n\t      transfer_buffer_count n\n\t      server_buffer_count n\n\t      tcp_window_size_kb n\n\t      daemon_threads n\n\t      server_conn_count n\n\n       The keywords are interpreted as follows:\n\n       The interface keyword specifies the name of a network interface (e.g.,\n       eth0) to use for Proxy Client traffic.  If a NIC has been assigned only\n       one IP or IPv6 address, then only the interface name needs to be\n       specified. If the NIC has been assigned more than one address (multiple\n       IP addresses, multiple IPv6 addresses, or both IP and IPv6 addresses),\n       then the address keyword and one IP or IPv6 address should also be\n       specified.  If a single interface entry exists for the NIC and the\n       address is omitted, the \"main\" address assigned to the interface is\n       used and other assigned addresses are ignored.  Finally, if an\n       interface entry exists with the address omitted and another interface\n       entry exists for the same NIC containing an address, the specified\n       address is used."

Note that these values are propagated from the\n       Proxy Servers to the Proxy Clients , and thus can affect the behavior\n       of both.  Note also that not all tuning parameters affect all\n       platforms.\n\n       The optional transfer_buffer_size_kb keyword specifies the size in\n       Kilobytes of the socket transfer buffers used for Proxy Client I/O.\n       The default value is 256 and values between 32 and 4096 are allowed.\n\n       The optional transfer_buffer_count keyword specifies the number of\n       socket transfer buffers used per connection for Proxy Client I/O.  Note\n       that this parameter is not used on Linux Proxy Servers or Clients.\n       However, it is used by Windows Proxy Clients, and the value is passed\n       to them by Linux Proxy Servers.\tThe default value is 16 and values\n       between 4 and 128 are allowed."
