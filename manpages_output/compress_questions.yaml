Each file is renamed to the same name plus the extension .Z.  A\n     file argument with a .Z extension will be ignored except it will cause an\n     error exit after other arguments are processed.  If compression would not\n     reduce the size of a file, the file is ignored.\n\n     The uncompress utility restores compressed files to their original form,\n     renaming the files by deleting the .Z extensions.\tA file specification\n     need not include the file's .Z extension.\tIf a file's name in its file\n     system does not have a .Z extension, it will not be uncompressed and it\n     will cause an error exit after other arguments are processed."

    Manpage text:

    The -b option is unavailable for uncompress since the bits parameter
         specified during compression is encoded within the output, along with a
         magic number to ensure that neither decompression of random data nor
         recompression of compressed data is attempted.

         The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the
         number of bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings.
         Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%.
         Compression is generally much better than that achieved by Huffman coding
         (as used in the historical command pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (as
         used in the historical command compact), and takes less time to compute.

         If file is a soft or hard link compress will replace it with a compressed
         copy of the file pointed to by the link.  The link's target file is left
         uncompressed.

    EXIT STATUS
         The compress and uncompress utilities exit 0 on success, and >0 if an
         error occurs.

    HISTORY
         The compress command appeared in 4.3BSD.

    BUGS
         The program does not handle links well and has no link-handling options.

         Some of these might be considered otherwise-undocumented features.

         compress: If the utility does not compress a file because doing so would
         not reduce its size, and a file of the same name except with an .Z
         extension exists, the named file is not really ignored as stated above;
         it causes a prompt to confirm the overwriting of the file with the
         extension.  If the operation is confirmed, that file is deleted.

         uncompress: If an empty file is compressed (using -f), the resulting .Z
         file is also empty.  That seems right, but if uncompress is then used on
         that file, an error will occur.

         Both utilities: If a ‘-’ argument is used and the utility prompts the
         user, the standard input is taken as the user's reply to the prompt.

         Both utilities: If the specified file does not exist, but a similarly-
         named one with (for compress) or without (for uncompress) a .Z extension
         does exist, the utility will waste the user's time by not immediately
         emitting an error message about the missing file and continuing.
         Instead, it first asks for confirmation to overwrite the existing file
         and then does not overwrite it.
