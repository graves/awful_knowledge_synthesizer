These values are, in order:\n\n     tzh_ttisgmtcnt  The number of UTC/local indicators stored in the file.\n     tzh_ttisstdcnt  The number of standard/wall indicators stored in the\n\t\t     file.\n     tzh_leapcnt     The number of leap seconds for which data is stored in\n\t\t     the file.\n     tzh_timecnt     The number of ``transition times'' for which data is\n\t\t     stored in the file.\n     tzh_typecnt     The number of ``local time types'' for which data is\n\t\t     stored in the file (must not be zero).\n     tzh_charcnt     The number of characters of ``time zone abbreviation\n\t\t     strings'' stored in the file."

    Manpage text:

    Then there are tzh_leapcnt pairs of four-byte values, written in standard
         byte order; the first value of each pair gives the time (as returned by
         time(3)) at which a leap second occurs; the second gives the total number
         of leap seconds to be applied after the given time.  The pairs of values
         are sorted in ascending order by time.

         Then there are tzh_ttisstdcnt standard/wall indicators, each stored as a
         one-byte value; they tell whether the transition times associated with
         local time types were specified as standard time or wall clock time, and
         are used when a time zone file is used in handling POSIX-style time zone
         environment variables.

         Finally there are tzh_ttisgmtcnt UTC/local indicators, each stored as a
         one-byte value; they tell whether the transition times associated with
         local time types were specified as UTC or local time, and are used when a
         time zone file is used in handling POSIX-style time zone environment
         variables.
