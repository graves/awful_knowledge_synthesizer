The default port will be 110, which is the\n       port defined by the standard specified in RFC 1939 (http://www.rfc-\n       editor.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt).  After creating, configuring and starting\n       a the server object will listen for and accept connections on that port\n       and handle them according to the POP3 protocol.\n\n       Note: The server provided by this module will handle only the basic\n       protocol by itself. For the higher levels of user authentication and\n       handling of the actual mailbox contents callbacks will be invoked.\n\n       The following commands are possible for server objects:\n\n       serverName up\n\t      After this call the server will listen for connections on its\n\t      configured port.\n\n       serverName down\n\t      After this call the server will stop listening for connections.\n\t      This does not affect existing connections.\n\n       serverName destroy ?mode?\n\t      Destroys the server object. Currently open connections are\n\t      handled depending on the chosen mode.  The provided modes are:\n\n\t      kill   Destroys the server immediately, and forcefully closes\n\t\t     all currently open connections. This is the default mode.\n\n\t      defer  Stops the server from accepting new connections and will\n\t\t     actually destroy it only after the last of the currently\n\t\t     open connections for the server is closed.\n\n       serverName configure\n\t      Returns a list containing all options and their current values\n\t      in a format suitable for use by the command array set. The\n\t      options themselves are described in section Options.\n\n       serverName configure -option\n\t      Returns the current value of the specified option. This is an\n\t      alias for the method cget. The options themselves are described\n\t      in section Options.\n\n       serverName configure -option value...\n\t      Sets the specified option to the provided value. The options\n\t      themselves are described in section Options.\n\n       serverName cget -option\n\t      Returns the current value of the specified option. The options\n\t      themselves are described in section Options.\n\n       serverName conn list\n\t      Returns a list containing the ids of all connections currently\n\t      open.\n\n       serverName conn state id\n\t      Returns a list suitable for [array set] containing the state of\n\t      the connection referenced by id.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The following options are available to pop3 server objects.\n\n       -port port\n\t      Defines the port to listen on for new connections. Default is\n\t      110. This option is a bit special. If port is set to \"0\" the\n\t      server, or rather the operating system, will select a free port\n\t      on its own. When querying -port the id of this chosen port will\n\t      be returned. Changing the port while the server is up will\n\t      neither change the returned value, nor will it change on which\n\t      port the server is listening on. Only after resetting the server\n\t      via a call to down followed by a call to up will the new port\n\t      take effect. It is at that time that the value returned when\n\t      querying -port will change too.\n\n       -auth command\n\t      Defines a command prefix to call whenever the authentication of\n\t      a user is required. If no such command is specified the server\n\t      will reject all users. The interface which has to be provided by\n\t      the command prefix is described in section Authentication.\n\n       -storage command\n\t      Defines a command prefix to call whenever the handling of\n\t      mailbox contents is required. If no such command is specified\n\t      the server will claim that all mailboxes are empty. The\n\t      interface which has to be provided by the command prefix is\n\t      described in section Mailboxes.\n\n       -socket command\n\t      Defines a command prefix to call for opening the listening\n\t      socket.  This can be used to make the pop3 server listen on a\n\t      SSL socket as provided by the tls package, see the command\n\t      tls::socket.\n\nAUTHENTICATION\n       Here we describe the interface which has to be provided by the\n       authentication callback so that pop3 servers following the interface of\n       this module are able to use it.\n\n       authCmd exists name\n\t      This method is given a username and has to return a boolean\n\t      value telling whether or not the specified user exists.\n\n       authCmd lookup name\n\t      This method is given a username and has to return a two-element\n\t      list containing the password for this user and a storage\n\t      reference, in this order.\n\n\t      The storage reference is passed unchanged to the storage\n\t      callback, see sections Options and Mailboxes for either the\n\t      option defining it and or the interface to provide,\n\t      respectively.\n\nMAILBOXES\n       Here we describe the interface which has to be provided by the storage\n       callback so that pop3 servers following the interface of this module\n       are able to use it. The mbox argument is the storage reference as\n       returned by the lookup method of the authentication command, see\n       section Authentication.\n\n       storageCmd dele mbox msgList\n\t      ] Deletes the messages whose numeric ids are contained in the\n\t      msgList from the mailbox specified via mbox.\n\n       storageCmd lock mbox\n\t      This method locks the specified mailbox for use by a single\n\t      connection to the server. This is necessary to prevent havoc if\n\t      several connections to the same mailbox are open. The\n\t      complementary method is unlock. The command will return true if\n\t      the lock could be set successfully or false if not.\n\n       storageCmd unlock mbox\n\t      This is the complementary method to lock, it revokes the lock on\n\t      the specified mailbox.\n\n       storageCmd size mbox ?msgId?\n\t      Determines the size of the message specified through its id in\n\t      msgId, in bytes, and returns this number. The command will\n\t      return the size of the whole maildrop if no message id was\n\t      specified.\n\n       storageCmd stat mbox\n\t      Determines the number of messages in the specified mailbox and\n\t      returns this number.\n\n       storageCmd get mbox msgId\n\t      Returns a handle for the specified message. This handle is a\n\t      mime token following the interface described in the\n\t      documentation of package mime. The pop3 server will use the\n\t      functionality of the mime token to send the mail to the\n\t      requestor at the other end of a pop3 connection.\n\nSECURE MAIL TRANSFER\n       The option -socket (see Options) enables users of the package to\n       override how the server opens its listening socket.  The envisioned\n       main use is the specification of the tls::socket command, see package\n       tls, to secure the communication.\n\n\t    package require tls\n\t    tls::init \\\\\n\t\t ...\n\n\t    pop3d::new S -socket tls::socket\n\t    ..."
