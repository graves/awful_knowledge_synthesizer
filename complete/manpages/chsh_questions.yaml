    Manpage text:

    The gid field is the group that the user will be placed in at login.
         Since BSD supports multiple groups (see groups(1)) this field currently
         has little special meaning.  This field may be filled in with either a
         number or a group name (see group(5)).

         The generated uid field is the globally unique identifier (UUID) for the
         user.  The full name field contains the full name of the user.

         The user's home directory is the full UNIX path name where the user will
         be placed at login.

         The shell field is the command interpreter the user prefers.  If the
         shell field is empty, the Bourne shell, /bin/sh, is assumed.  When
         altering a login shell, and not the super-user, the user may not change
         from a non-standard shell or to a non-standard shell.  Non-standard is
         defined as a shell not found in /etc/shells.

         The picture field is the path to a picture to be displayed for the user.

    OPEN DIRECTORY
         User database entries are under the control of DirectoryService(8) and
         may be physically located in many different places, including the local
         Directory Service node, and remote LDAP servers.  This version of chpass
         uses Open Directory to change user database information.  It does not
         interact with the historic flat file database /etc/master.passwd
