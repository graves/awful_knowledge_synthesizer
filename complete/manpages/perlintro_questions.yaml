    What is Perl?
           Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for
           text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including
           system administration, web development, network programming, GUI
           development, and more.

           The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
           complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).  Its major
           features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and
           object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for
           text processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections
           of third-party modules.

           Different definitions of Perl are given in perl, perlfaq1 and no doubt
           other places.  From this we can determine that Perl is different things
           to different people, but that lots of people think it's at least worth
           writing about.
