The root cert is signed by the private\n       key generated during this command. The cert generated by this command\n       is totally untrustworthy and cannot be used in the \"real world\"; the\n       primary use of this command is to facilitate early development of SSL\n       server applications based on SecureTransport. In particular, \"real\n       world\" SSL clients (e.g., web browsers) will complain to varying\n       degrees when they attempt to connect to an SSL server which presents a\n       cert which is generated by this command. Some broswers, after a fair\n       amount of handholding, will allow you to conditionally \"trust\" this\n       cert.\n       # CertTool c [options]\n       The available options are:\n       k=keyChainName\n       Where \"keyChainName\" is the name of the keychain into which keys and\n       the cert will be added. The specified keychain must exist. If it\n       doesn't exist and you want the keychain created for you, specify the\n       'c' option. If no keychain is specified, keys and certs are added to\n       the default keychain.\n       c\n       Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created.\n       x=[aSsm]\n       Specifies an optional Extended Key Usage extension. Values are 'a' for\n       ExtendedKeyUseAny; 's' for SSL client (ClientAuth); 'S' for SSL server\n       (ServerAuth); and 'm' for S/MIME (EmailProtection).\n       a\n       Results the the private key being created with a default ACL.
