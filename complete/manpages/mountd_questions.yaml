This functionality has been moved into the NFS server daemon\n     nfsd(8).\n\n     Please refer to nfsd(8) for NFS server documenation.\n\n     The following is a list of former mountd options that are now available\n     as nfsd(8) options:\n\n\t   mountd option\tnfsd option\t       Description\n\t   -n\t\t\t-N\t\t       allow non-root mounts\n\t   -r\t\t\t-R\t\t       allow regular file\n\t\t\t\t\t\t       mounts\n\t   exportsfile\t\t-F exportsfile\t       alternate exports file\n\n     However, such configuration options are normally specified via\n     nfs.conf(5).\n\n     When the NFS server is started, it loads the export host addresses and\n     options into the kernel using the nfssvc(2) system call.  After changing\n     the list of exports (either directly or indirectly via a change in\n     netgroup membership), the administrator should send a hangup signal to\n     the nfsd daemon to get it to reload the export information:"
