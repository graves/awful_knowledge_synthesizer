    Preface
    
    Linguists have mapped the topography of language behavior in many languages in immaculate detail. However, to understand how the brain supports language function, it is necessary to bring the principles and regularities of neural function to the table. Mechanisms of neurolinguistic function cannot be inferred solely from observations of normal and impaired language. Our understanding of principles and regularities of neural function relevant to language stems predominantly from two sources: (1) knowledge of neuroanatomy and the neural systems that are based upon this anatomy and (2) knowledge of the patterns of behavior of neural networks composed of large numbers of highly interconnected units and supporting population-based (distributed) representations.
    
    The core neuroanatomy underlying language was largely subsumed in the Wernicke—Lichtheim model (Lichtheim 1885), and our knowledge of it has scarcely advanced beyond the principles laid out in Norman Geschwind's famous paper "Disconnexion Syndromes in Animals and Man" (Geschwind 1965). Functional imaging studies from the outset suggested a remarkable degree of bilateral engagement of the brain in language function, particularly in the perisylvian regions, but functional imaging is generally ill equipped to distinguish regions that are essential from those that are incidental. As it turns out, studies of aphasia, looked at from the right perspective, and with particular attention to the effect of lesions on both white and gray matter, provide us with fairly powerful evidence of the extent to which various components of language function are bilaterally represented, and even the extent to which this might vary from language to language. This aspect of aphasia studies,

    largely overlooked to date, will constitute one of the recurring themes of
    this book.
    The evolution of our understanding of neural systems over the past 20
    years has revealed the importance of systems dedicated to "keeping
    order in the house"—that is, maintaining coherent patterns of activity in
    the brain's 100 billion neurons such that all is not cacophony and
    adaptive behavior more or less consistently emerges. Key are systems
    underlying selective engagement of particular neural networks in
    particular ways (Nadeau and Crosson 1997), which support what
    Patricia Goldman-Rakic (1990) termed working memory. Working
    memory and its hippocampal complement, episodic memory (Shrager et
    al. 2008), play very substantial roles in language function, roles that we
    are beginning to understand and that will constitute another recurring
    theme of this book. Much less well understood are the mechanisms by
    which linguistic behavior is driven by systems underlying goal
    representations.
  - |-
    Our understanding of the population dynamics of neural network systems owes almost entirely to the study of parallel distributed processing (PDP), which was thrust so dramatically onto the world's scientific stage by David Rumelhart and Jay McClelland and their collaborators in their seminal two-volume text, published 25 years ago (McClelland, Rumelhart, and PDP Research Group 1986). The science of PDP has continued to evolve at a stunning pace ever since, enhancing our understanding of constraints governing neural network systems, demonstrating how powerful these systems can be, and demonstrating new ways in which neural networks might support particular functions. Before PDP was established as a field of research, behavioral neuroscientists could only hope that one day, the complex behaviors they were systematically studying could ultimately be related in a precise way to neural structure and function. In a flash, PDP research showed how this could be done, and, repeatedly, PDP simulations have shown the power of neural networks to account in a highly detailed way for behavior in normal and damaged brains.
    
    This book begins with the development of a comprehensive, neurally based, theoretical model of grammatic function, drawing on principles of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology and the PDP literature, together with cognitive psychological studies of normal language, functional imaging studies, and cognitive neuropsychological and psycholinguistic studies of subjects with language disorders due to stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The remarkably detailed understanding of semantic function that has emerged substantially from the 20-year effort of the Addenbrookes Hospital group (Hodges, Patterson, Lambon Ralph, Rogers, and their collaborators, most notably Jay McClelland) has proven to be particularly important. From this, we have a cogent theory of semantic instantiation and breakdown. Much of grammar (that not dependent on networks instantiating sequence knowledge) turns out to be semantics.
    
    Research on the neural foundation of semantics, coupled with the studies of many other investigators, has led to a conceptualization of verbs as the product of multicomponent frontal and postcentral distributed representations that engage and modify noun representations, even as they are engaged by noun representations. Equally important has been the development of a model of grammatical function that reflects the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological principles underlying the processing of syntax and semantics in the human brain. This model integrates findings from cognitive neuroscience, linguistics, and psychology to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how the brain processes language. The book also explores the implications of these findings for understanding language disorders and for developing more effective interventions and treatments. Through this interdisciplinary approach, the book aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models of language processing and empirical evidence from clinical studies, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie human language.

    been PDP work on the capacity for instantiation of sequence knowledge
    by certain neural networks, coupled with work by psycholinguists, most
    notably Thompson and her colleagues at Northwestern University, on
    sentence-level sequence breakdown in aphasia and patterns of
    reacquisition of this knowledge during speech—language therapy.
    Concept representations interfaced with sequence knowledge provide
    the intrinsic basis for the temporal dynamic of language.
    
    The second half of this book reviews the aphasia literature, most
    importantly including cross-linguistic studies, testing the model in its
    ability to account for the findings of empirical studies not considered in
    its development. The model fully accommodates the competition model
    of Bates and MacWhinney (1989), which provided an enormous
    advance in our understanding of the neural basis of grammatic function,
    and it extends the competition model. It accounts for perhaps the single
    most trenchant finding of cross-linguistic aphasia studies—that the most
    powerful determinant of patterns of language breakdown in aphasia is
    the premorbid language spoken by the subject ("You can't take the
    Turkish out of the Turk"). It does so by accounting for grammatic
    knowledge in terms of the statistical regularities of particular languages
    that are encoded in network connectivity. Only the most redundantly
    encoded regularities, or those that have significant bihemispheric
    representation, survive focal brain damage. The model provides a
    surprisingly good account for a large number of findings and
    unprecedented resolution of a number of controversial problems,
    including whether grammatic dysfunction reflects loss of knowledge or
    loss of access to knowledge; relative sparing of grammaticality
    judgment; the problem of verb past tense formation, including some of
    the wrinkles that have appeared in the course of cross-linguistic studies;
    cross-linguistic differences in patterns of syntactic breakdown; and the
    impact of inflectional richness on the resilience of phrase structure rules
    and grammatic morphology in the face of brain lesions. To the extent
    that the proposed model did not fully account for observed patterns of
    language breakdown, aphasia studies have provided the basis for
    elaborating the model in ways that are interesting and important, even as
    these elaborations are entirely consistent with the general principles of
    the original model and in no way involve ad hoc extensions.

    Ultimately, however, the model represents but a new beginning. I  
    have done my best, particularly in the concluding chapter, to delineate  
    possible directions for further research.

    pursue a career in neurology and behavioral neurology and taught me  
    the very powerful way of thinking about the brain that he developed so  
    brilliantly and that so honored his mentor, Norman Geschwind. The  
    substance of this book owes to the phenomenal work of the many  
    scientists of language who, over the past 150 years, have brought our  
    understanding of language and the brain from rudimentary beginnings to  
    a point where the multitude of threads from various lines of  
    investigation are beginning to come together in a quite marvelous way  
    and give us the first glimmerings of a comprehensive understanding. I

    helpful suggestions. I am indebted to John Richardson and George  
    Kelvin for the illustrations. Last but not least, I am indebted to my  
    editor, Ada Brunstein, whose enthusiasm and care for this book were so  
    instrumental in making it a reality.  
    
    Introduction  
    
    The goal of this book is to develop a neurologically plausible theory of  
    grammatic function. Given all that we now know about neuroanatomy  
    and principles of neural network function, it is no longer possible to  
    propose such a theory without taking this knowledge into account.  
    Linguists have been remarkably successful in mapping the regularities  
    of grammatic performance in exquisite detail, and any neurological  
    theory of language must be able to offer a logical and detailed  
    explanation for these regularities, as well as for the errors of grammatic  
    function that occur with slips of the tongue by normal subjects and in  
    aphasia in subjects with brain injury.
  - |-
    Linguists have also developed a sophisticated mathematics to account  
    for grammatic phenomenology, normal and abnormal, in an orderly way.  
    Unfortunately, they have not been successful in reconciling this  
    mathematics in all its various derivations with principles of  
    neurobiology. Linguistic theories of grammar (e.g., government and  
    binding theory) are discrete, hierarchical, deterministic, explicitly rule  
    defining, and essentially orthogonal to semantics. The brain supports  
    distributed functions; these functions are hierarchical only in the  
    Hughlings Jackson sense (higher systems supporting more complex  
    functions inhibit lower systems, which may become "released" with  
    damage to higher systems); brain order is chaotic rather than  
    deterministic; rules are not defined but instead emerge from network  
    behavior, constrained by network topography and within- and between-  
    network connectivity, which is acquired through experience and reflects  
    statistical regularities of experience; and grammar results from a process  
    involving parallel constraint satisfaction in which semantic knowledge,  
    semantic—phonologic/morphologic (lexical) knowledge, sequence  
    knowledge, skills in concept manipulation, and recall of what has  
    recently been said define the final product. However powerful and  
    heuristically useful linguistic theories are, their failure to accommodate  
    these cardinal principles of brain function constitutes a serious  
    shortcoming.
    
    The chapter and verse of this book consists of the enormous body of  
    work, principally from the fields of psycholinguistics and cognitive  
    neuropsychology, that enables us to infer how the normal brain produces  
    language from the aberrations in language function that follow brain  
    damage. However, the underlying themes of the book derive from  
    knowledge of neural systems, the well-established topography of  
    cerebral association cortices supporting language, patterns of white  
    matter connectivity between these cortices, the geographical and  
    neurological impact of the vascular lesions and degenerative diseases  
    that are the most common causes of aphasia, and the neural  
    representation of knowledge. Because of the very serious  
    methodological problems that have plagued functional imaging  
    methodology, it has made but a modest contribution to our  
    understanding of the neural architecture of grammar (see, e.g., reviews  
    by Crepaldi et al. 2011 and Démonet, Thierry, and Cardebat 2005), and  
    references to works in this field will be limited.
  - |-
    It has become clear that the fundamental unit of cortical function is  
    the neural network (Buonomano and Merzenich 1998), and a  
    paradigmatic leap achieved in the 1980s, which yielded the field of  
    parallel distributed processing (PDP; McClelland, Rumelhart, and PDP  
    Research Group 1986), now enables us to peer deeply into the  
    computational principles of neural network function and directly link  
    complex behaviors to neural network function. Thus, PDP constitutes  
    another major pillar of this book.
    
    PDP models can incorporate a large variety of model-specific  
    assumptions, including ones that are not neurologically plausible.  
    However, in this book, I will argue from the simplest, most limited set  
    of assumptions possible, all of which receive substantial if not  
    overwhelming support from neurobiological research. These are as  
    follows:
    
    • The fundamental unit of cerebral function is the neural network  
    (Buonomano and Merzenich 1998).
    
    • A neural network is comprised of a large number of relatively  
    simple units, each of which is heavily connected with many if not  
    all the other units in the network, hence the term connectionist  
    model.
    
    • The knowledge in a network (long-term memory) consists of the  
    pattern of connection strengths between units, corresponding to  
    synaptic strengths between neurons (an idea that likely originated  
    with Hebb 1949),
    
    • The principal operational currency of a network is the activity of  
    individual units (which corresponds to states of depolarization or  
    firing rates of neurons). Activity in some units will naturally  
    spread to other units, constrained by the pattern of connection  
    strengths.
    
    • Activation levels of units and the flow of activation between  
    units involve nonlinear functions.
  - |-
    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and presented verbatim:
    
    A cognitive representation consists of a specific pattern of activity of the units in a network (which defines working memory). Because this pattern involves a substantial portion of the units, the representation is referred to as distributed or population encoded (Rolls and Treves 1998).
    
    Networks are linked to each other by very large numbers of connections. I will presume that the pattern of the network linkages underlying language function reflects the known topography of cortical functions, as substantially defined by information-processing models, and that there is no intrinsic incompatibility between information-processing models and the PDP conceptualizations to be discussed.
    
    Learning consists of altering connection strengths.
    
    Links between networks enable transformation of a representation in one modality in one network into a different representation, corresponding to another modality, in the connected network.
    
    These simple properties enable a complex array of functions even as they strongly constrain the nature of processing that must occur. Much of this book will consist of elaboration of this statement in the domain of grammatical function. The surprisingly great functional capacity of networks defined by these principles has been repeatedly demonstrated in the ability of PDP simulations to account in precise quantitative fashion for a vast range of empirical phenomena in normal and brain-injured subjects. More generally, connectionist concepts are now deeply embedded in and receive enormous support from mainstream neuroscientific research (e.g., Rolls and Deco 2002; Rolls and Treves 1998).
  - |-
    Yusef Grodzinsky has been at once one of the scientists most knowledgeable about the aphasia literature and one of the stoutest defenders of a discrete, localized, domain-specific organ of grammar, presumably located in Broca's area. In his 2000 paper, he stated, "It is important to note that a theory is best ‘refuted' not by data ... but rather by an alternative proposal" (Grodzinsky 2000, p. 56). In this book I seek to provide such an alternative proposal: a theoretical model of language function based in neuroanatomy and connectionist principles that also accommodates the accumulated empirical findings of psycholinguistic and cognitive neuropsychological studies. Before proceeding to the details, it is worth asking how the reader should judge the model presented here. MacWhinney and Bates (Bates and MacWhinney 1989, p. 36) have said it just right:
    
    [A model] itself cannot be disconfirmed by any single experiment.... [It] must instead be evaluated in terms of (1) its overall coherence, (2) its heuristic value in inspiring further research, and (3) its performance compared with competing accounts. Components of a model are tested one at a time, and if predictions fail, modifications are made and new concepts are introduced. Ideally, these new concepts should have an independent motivation (i.e., they should not be added merely to save the model), and they should lead to new discoveries in their own right. But the framework as a whole will be rejected only if (1) it loses coherence, weighted down by circularities and ad hoc assumptions, (2) it loses its heuristic value, and/or (3) a better account of the same phenomena comes along.
  - |-
    One last apology: many of the conclusions in this book will be stated  
    with a degree of confidence that is not warranted by the limited data  
    available. To some extent this will be inadvertent. To a large extent,  
    however, it reflects a deliberate strategy to minimize the muddiness that  
    would be introduced by repeated qualifications and caveats. In any  
    event, the conclusions should always be viewed as testable hypotheses  
    rather than accepted facts. No systematic attempt has been made to  
    contrast theories presented in this book with existing linguistic or  
    cognitive neuropsychological theories for the simple reason that none of  
    these theories has been comprehensively related to neural structure.
    
    I begin the discussion of the model with a brief review of phonology  
    from a connectionist perspective. This review will serve to introduce the  
    basic concepts: the organization and operating principles of the  
    phonologic core of language, the neural basis for and the organization of  
    distributed semantic representations, and the neural network basis of  
    sequence knowledge. The intrinsic temporal dynamics of language  
    derive from the interplay between distributed concept representations  
    and different domains of sequence knowledge, hence the importance of  
    a clear understanding of these core principles from the outset. The flow  
    of concept representations corresponding to the flow of thought of  
    course provide an external source of temporal dynamic.
    
    A Parallel Distributed Processing Model of  
    Language: Phonologic, Semantic, and Semantic—
    
    Phonologic (Lexical) Processing
  - |-
    The Wernicke—Lichtheim (W-L) information-processing model of
    language function has played a dominant role in understanding aphasic
    syndromes (Lichtheim 1885) and has stood the test of time in defining
    the topographical relationship between the modular domains (acoustic
    representations, articulatory motor representations, and concept
    representations) underlying spoken language function. Unfortunately,
    the W-L information-processing model does not specify the
    characteristics of the representations within these domains and how they
    might be stored in the brain. It also does not address the means by which
    these domains might interact. I have proposed a PDP model that uses the
    same general topography as the W-L model (Nadeau 2001; Roth et al.
    2006) but also specifies how representations are generated in the
    modular domains and how knowledge is represented in the links
    between these domains (see figure 2.1). Though not tested in
    simulations, this model is neurally plausible and provides a cogent
    explanation for a broad range of psycholinguistic phenomena in normal
    subjects and subjects with aphasia.

    concept representations defines semantic knowledge. Connectivity within the acoustic—
    articulatory motor pattern associator defines phonologic sequence knowledge. Connectivity
    between the substrate for concept representations and the acoustic—articulatory motor
    pattern associator defines lexical knowledge (see text for details).
  - |-
    The PDP modification of the W-L model posits that the acoustic domain (akin to Wernicke's area) contains large numbers of units located in auditory association cortices that represent acoustic features of phonemes. The articulatory domain (analogous to Broca's area) contains units located predominantly in dominant frontal operculum that represent discrete articulatory features of speech, as opposed to continuously variable motor programs (e.g., phonemic distinctive features). The semantic or conceptual domain contains an array of units distributed throughout unimodal and polymodal association cortices that represent semantic features of concepts. For example, the representation of the concept of "house" might correspond to activation of units representing features of houses such as visual attributes, construction materials, contents (physical and human), and so on (each feature in turn a distributed representation over more primitive features). Each unit within a given domain is connected to many, if not most, of the other units in that same domain (symbolized by the small looping arrow appended to each domain in figure 2.1). Knowledge within each domain is represented as connection strengths between the units. Thus, semantic knowledge is represented as the pattern of connection strengths throughout the association cortices supporting this knowledge. Within any domain, a representation corresponds to a specific pattern of activity of all the units, hence the term distributed representation (a synonym for a population encoded representation). Each unit within each of these domains is connected via interposed hidden units to many, if not most, of the units in the other domains. During learning of a language, the strengths of the connections between the units are gradually adjusted so that a pattern of activity involving the units in one domain elicits the correct pattern of activity in the units of another domain. The entire set of connections between any two domains forms a pattern associator network. Hidden units are units whose activity cannot be directly interpreted in behavioral terms. The hidden-unit regions, in conjunction with nonlinear unit properties, enable the systematic association of representations in two connected domains that may be arbitrarily related to one another (e.g., word sound and word meaning). The model employs left-right position in acoustic and articulatory motor representations as a surrogate for temporal order in precisely the same way that left-right position is used in speech and language processing.

    way as the reading model of Plaut et al. (1996). Thus, acoustic and
    articulatory motor representations would feature positions for each
    output phoneme or distinctive feature, ordered as they are in the
    phonologic word form. The use of left to right sequential order in lieu of
    temporal order is a device of convenience, but there is evidence of this
    temporal—geographic transform in the brain (Cheung et al. 2001).
    During any type of language processing, initiated by input to any
    domain of the network, there will be almost instantaneous engagement
    of all domains of the network. Thus, linguistic behavior is best viewed
    as the emergent product of the entire network.
    
    I will now focus on particular components of the network in order to
    provide a more detailed understanding of how they work and the nature
    of the knowledge they support.
    
    Concept Representations
  - |-
    As [have noted, the Wernicke—Lichtheim information-processing model
    provides no insight into the nature of the representations in the various
    domains. The nature of concept representations (depicted in figure 2.1)
    can be best illustrated by a particularly illuminating model developed by
    David Rumelhart and his colleagues (Rumelhart et al. 1986). This
    "rooms in a house" model was comprised of 40 "feature" units, each
    corresponding to an article typically found in particular rooms or an
    aspect of particular rooms. Each unit was connected with all the other
    units in the network—an attribute that defines the model as an auto-
    associator network. Auto-associator networks have the capacity for
    "settling" into a particular state that defines a representation. Connection
    strengths were defined by the likelihood that any two features might
    appear in conjunction in a typical house. When one or more units was
    clamped into the "on" state (as if the network had been shown these
    particular features or articles), activation spread throughout the model
    and the model eventually settled into a steady state that implicitly
    defined a particular room in a house. Thus, clamping "oven" ultimately
    resulted in activation of all the items one would expect to find in a
    kitchen and thereby implicitly defined, via a distributed or population
    encoded representation, the concept of a kitchen. No kitchen unit per se
    was turned on. Rather, kitchen was defined by the pattern of feature
    units that were activated. The network contained the knowledge, in the
    totality of its connections, that enabled this representation to be
    generated. The 40-unit model actually had the capability of generating
    distributed representations of a number of different rooms in a house
    (e.g., bathroom, bedroom, living room, study), subcomponents of rooms
    (e.g., easy chair and floor lamp, desk and desk chair, window and
    drapes) and blends of rooms that were not anticipated in the
    programming of the model (e.g., clamping both bed and sofa led to a
    distributed representation of a large, fancy bedroom replete with a
    fireplace, television, and sofa).

    This auto-associator model, simple though it is, has the essential
    attributes of a network that might instantiate semantic knowledge and be
    capable of generating the distributed representations corresponding to
    concepts. The brain's semantic auto-associator obviously is comprised
    of vastly more than 40 features, and enables an enormous repertoire of
    distributed representations corresponding to the vast number of concepts
    we are capable of representing. This particular model network is not
    compartmentalized, but there is nothing inherent in PDP models that
    precludes a semantic representation comprised of two or more
    subnetworks (see, e.g., Farah and McCelland 1991). There is good
    evidence that in the brain, the meaning of a given word is distributed
    over a host of networks, depending in part upon the semantic features
    that are most essential to that meaning, an idea proposed by Lissauer
    over a century ago (Lissauer 1988) and elaborated by Wernicke (as cited
    in Eggert 1977). For example, visual information makes a particularly
    large contribution to the meaning of living things, and consequently,
    subjects with damage to visual association cortex due to herpes simplex
    encephalitis exhibit category-specific naming and recognition deficits
    for living things (Forde and Humphreys 1999; Warrington and Shallice
    1984). In this conceptualization, the distributed representation of the
    concept "dog" has a major component in visual association cortices
    made available by knowledge of the visual appearance of dogs in
    general, as well as particular dogs; a major component in auditory
    association cortices corresponding to the sounds that dogs
    characteristically make; a major component in the limbic system
    corresponding to one's feelings about dogs in general and specific dogs;
    a component in somatosensory cortex corresponding to the feel of dog
    fur, wet tongue, or cold nose; a predicative component involving frontal
    cortex that corresponds to our knowledge of what dogs do, hence a
    component of the semantic representation of a verb (to be considered in
    much detail below); a component in olfactory cortex, corresponding to
    the odors of dogs; and components in perisylvian language cortex that
    enable us to translate the semantic representation of dog into an
    articulatory motor representation (so we can say /dawg/) or an acoustic

    representation (so we can understand another person saying /dawg/; see figure 2.2a). Not all of these subnetworks need to be activated every time, or in exactly the same way by everyone. We can speak in terms of working memory—in this case a pattern of activity in particular subnetworks corresponding to dog, and we can speak in terms of working associations, meaning the elicitation of distributed concept representations in other connected subnetworks, either automatically or volitionally. Thus, nearly everyone would, when hearing /dawg/, develop visual and limbic distributed representations, each constituting a working memory, the two together comprising an automatic working association. However, the average person might need to volitionally develop the working association that brings in the olfactory component of the meaning of "dog." Glancing at a calculator may not be sufficient to evoke a poke component or pick-up gesture component to its distributed concept representation, but looking at a calculator in the context of an action paradigm is (Bub, Masson, and Cree 2008).

    This very old idea of Lissauer and Wernicke, because it is grounded
    in neuroanatomy, has always retained currency among neurologists,
    cognitive neuropsychologists, and others strongly guided by principles
    of strict functional—anatomic correlation, even as it has been repeatedly
    questioned by investigators, most notably cognitive psychologists, who
    have worked from models that do not take anatomy into account. In
    these models, concepts have been posited to be symbolic, amodal
    entities that somehow are mapped to or grounded in the real world.
    However, with the advancement of cognitive science, we are now
    beginning to see a universal recognition that neuroanatomic
    considerations are essential, and the concept of amodal processing in the
    brain is steadily being undermined (see, e.g., Barsalou 2008). The old
    theory of Lissauer and Wernicke has been resurrected as the embodied
    cognition framework (Buxbaum and Kalénine 2010; Fernandino and
    Iacoboni 2010; Spivey 2007). A very influential factor in this
    renaissance has been the discovery of mirror neurons by Rizzolati and
    colleagues (Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004), neurons in frontal cortex
    that receive projections from parietal cortex such that they respond to
    the perception of goal-directed movement—for example, firing in
    response to the perception of an investigator picking up a morsel of
    food. Such responses were entirely predictable from the landmark
    neuroanatomic paper of Chavis and Pandya (1976), which demonstrated
    that postcentral cortices hold no secrets from the frontal lobes because
    of a vast and intricately organized system of reciprocal frontal—
    postcentral connections (see, e.g., Evangeliou et al. 2009 and Raos,
    Evangeliou, and Savaki 2007). Indeed, it is this connectivity that
    provides the basis for the vast repertoire of daily activities we pursue
    more or less automatically (Nadeau and Heilman 2007).
    
    The Acoustic—Articulatory Motor Pattern Associator Network
  - |-
    The knowledge that allows a person to translate heard sound sequences into articulatory motor sequences, and thereby mediates repetition of both real words and nonwords, is contained in the network that connects the acoustic domain to the articulatory motor domain (the acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator, figure 2.1, pathway 7–3). Because this network has acquired, through experience, knowledge of the systematic relationships between acoustic sequences and articulatory sequences, it has learned the sound sequence regularities of the language: the phonemic sequences of joint phonemes, rhymes, syllables, affixes, morphemes, and words characteristic of the language (Nadeau 2001). Because the role of sequence knowledge will be a major theme of this book, it is important at this stage to have a clear understanding of how sequence might be encoded in a distributed neural network architecture. The reading model developed by Plaut and colleagues (Plaut et al. 1996; Seidenberg and McClelland 1989) provides a particularly clear illustration. I will therefore describe it in some detail even though reading per se represents somewhat of a digression.
  - |-
    This reading model fundamentally recapitulates the acoustic—articulatory motor pathway of figure 2.1, the major difference (inconsequential to this discussion) being that in place of acoustic representations, it incorporated orthographic representations. The model was composed of three layers: (1) an input layer of 105 grapheme units grouped into clusters, the first cluster including all possibilities for the one or more consonants of the onset, the second cluster including all the possible vowels in the nucleus, and the third cluster including all possibilities for the one or more consonants in the coda; (2) a hidden-unit layer of 100 units; and (3) an output layer of 61 phoneme units grouped into clusters including all the possibilities for onset, nucleus, and coda, respectively (as for the graphemes). Local representations were used for the graphemes and phonemes. There were one-way connections from each of the grapheme input units to each of the hidden units, and there were two-way connections between each of the hidden units and each of the phoneme output units. Every output unit was connected to every other output unit, providing the network the auto-associator capability for "settling into" the best solution (as opposed to its own approximate solution). The model was trained using a mathematical algorithm (backpropagation) that incrementally alters the strengths of connections in proportion to their contribution to the error, which was computed as the difference between the actual product of the network and the desired product of the network." The orthographic representations of 3,000 English single-syllable words and their corresponding phonologic forms were presented, one pair at a time, cycling repeatedly through the entire corpus. In this way, the model ultimately learned to produce the correct pronunciation of all the words it had read. One of the most striking things about the trained model is that it also was able to produce correct pronunciations of plausible English nonwords (i.e., orthographic sequences it had never encountered before). How was this possible?
  - |-
    One might have inferred that the model was simply learning the pronunciation of all the words by rote. If this had been the case, however, the model would have been incapable of applying what it had learned to novel words. In fact, what the model learned was the statistical relationships between sequences of graphemes and sequences of phonemes that are characteristic of the English language. To the extent that there is a limited repertoire of sequence types, the model was able to learn it and then apply that knowledge to novel forms that incorporated some of the sequential relationships in this repertoire.
    
    Certain sequences, those most commonly found in English single-syllable words, were more thoroughly etched in network connectivity. Thus, it was very fast with high-frequency words. It was also very fast with words that have an absolutely consistent orthographic-phonologic sequence relationship—for example, words ending in "ust," which are always pronounced /Ast/ (must, bust, trust, lust, crust, etc.). The model encountered difficulty (reflected in prolonged reading latency) only with low-frequency words, and only to the extent that it had learned different, competing pronunciations of the same orthographic sequence. Thus, it was slow to read "pint" because in every case but "pint," the sequence "int" is pronounced /nt/ (e.g., mint, tint, flint, lint). It was also slow, though not quite so slow, to read words like "shown" because there are two equally frequent alternatives to the pronunciation of "own" (gown, down, town vs. shown, blown, flown). It was very slow with words that are unique in their orthographic-phonologic sequence relationship (e.g., aisle, guide, and fugue). These behaviors precisely recapitulate the behavior of normal human subjects given reading tasks.
  - |-
    The knowledge the model acquires reflects competing effects of type frequency and token frequency. If a single word is sufficiently common (high token frequency), the model acquires enough experience with it that competing orthographic—phonologic sequential relationships have a negligible impact on naming latency. However, if a word is relatively uncommon (e.g., pint), its naming latency will be significantly affected by the knowledge of other words that, though equally uncommon, together belong to a competing type—an "enemy" (e.g., mint, flint, tint, sprint).
  - |-
    The implicit knowledge of various competing regularities captured by the model (and the brain) through experience defines quasi-regular domains. For example, in the case of words ending in "own," orthographic—phonologic regularity exists but it is only quasi-regular because there is not one but two alternatives (shown vs. gown), a particular alternative being determined by the onset cluster. Quasi-regular domains may be composed of more or less equally competing subdomains, each corresponding to a regularity, as in the case of "own" words, or a domain that is regular but for a single member (e.g., mint, tint, splint, etc. vs. pint). In some cases they may be fully regular (e.g., the "ust" words). The higher the frequency of a word, the more deeply its orthographic—phonologic connectivity becomes etched in neural connectivity, the less its production is influenced by similarity to neighbors, and the more it approaches a regular domain that has only one member. Whether or not linguistic forms belong to particular quasi-regular domains depends upon the particular regularities that the network is endowed to capture through experience. The term quasi-regular domains will be referred to repeatedly in this book because it succinctly characterizes patterns of knowledge that are directly related to neural instantiation and because aphasia can, to a substantial degree, be viewed as lesion-induced perturbation of the competition between regularities in quasi-regular domains in which the competitive strength of lower frequency or less typical representations is reduced. Grammatic function is driven by competition between regularities within quasi-regular domains of knowledge no less than the orthographic—phonologic translation discussed in this section. Grammatic function differs only in that a considerably larger number and variety of quasi-regular domains are in play at any given time. When a neural network supporting a quasi-regular domain settles into the wrong state, the result is a paraphasic error: phonemic, verbal, or semantic, but also morphologic (paragrammatic) or syntactic.
  - |-
    The capacity of the model of Plaut and colleagues to read nonwords reflects its ability to capture patterns in the sequential relationships between orthographic and articulatory word forms and to apply this knowledge to novel word forms. Plaut et al. (1996), as well as Seidenberg and McClelland (1989), in their earlier work on this reading model, focused on differences in rhyme components of single-syllable words because these are the major determinants of whether a word is orthographically regular (e.g., mint) or irregular (e.g., pint). However, as Seidenberg and McClelland pointed out, the network architecture in these models is capable of capturing any kind of regularity in the orthographic and phonologic sequences it is exposed to, limited only by the extent of exposure. Such regularities would include joint phonemes other than rhymes (e.g., "str" of stream, street, stray, and strum) and, in a multisyllabic version, syllables and morphemes (affixes and the root forms of nouns and verbs, as well as free grammatic morphology, e.g., articles, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, and prepositions). The simple architecture of the model of Plaut et al. provides adequate support for the orthographic phonologic sequence regularities discussed here to illustrate the basic idea of network instantiation of sequence knowledge. However, as we shall see, somewhat more complex networks are necessary to adequately support the sequence knowledge required of phonologic and grammatic processes (see chapter 3, "Sequence: The Basis of Syntax").
  - |-
    The acoustic—articulatory motor pathway in the model of figure 2.1  
    would capture analogous patterns in the sequential relationships  
    between acoustic and articulatory word forms. These sequential  
    relationship patterns (captured in part by measures of biphone  
    frequencies) potentially involve sequences of varying length, from  
    phoneme pairs (joint phonemes) and syllables up to and including whole  
    words and possibly, multiple word compounds. These patterns represent  
    the repository of knowledge about subword (sublexical) entities in  
    general, as well as our knowledge of phonotactic constraints (the rules  
    that determine whether or not a given phonologic sequence is  
    permissible in a particular language). This repository of sequence  
    knowledge is additionally influenced by "neighborhood" effects  
    (Vitevitch 1997). Any given phoneme sequence represented in the  
    acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator comprises part of one or  
    more words. These words define the phonologic neighborhood of that  
    sequence. They are engaged through bottom-up/top-down interactions  
    between the acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator and the  
    domains of concept representations (semantics). Thus, the final  
    production of a phoneme sequence is a reflection of the combined  
    effects of input (e.g., acoustic), phonotactic effects, neighborhood  
    effects, and noise in the system. Phonotactic frequency effects are seen  
    in tendencies to produce near miss errors that are off by a small number  
    of phonemic distinctive features (usually one or two)—for example,  
    /pat/ in lieu of /bat/. Phonologic neighborhood effects are seen in larger  
    errors that substantially reflect regularities in patterns of semantic—  
    phonologic knowledge, that is, lexical effects (e.g., /rat/ in lieu of /cat/).
    
    The effect of competing regularities in the acoustic—articulatory motor  
    pattern associator network is dramatically illustrated in the production of  
    past tense forms of verbs. The rich literature on this subject will be  
    discussed later in this book after I have had the opportunity to lay down  
    some additional essential groundwork.
  - |-
    Lexicons  
    Understanding the meaning of a word that is heard is achieved through the connections between the neural domain that contains the sound features of language and the neural domain that contains concept features (the acoustic—concepts representations pattern associator, figure 2.1, pathway 6—5). This pattern associator network corresponds to the cognitive neuropsychological concept of a phonologic input lexicon (Ellis and Young 1988). It contains neither knowledge of acoustics nor knowledge of semantics—it serves only to translate a representation in the acoustic domain into a representation in the concepts—semantics domain (where meaning is instantiated). This conceptualization of a lexicon as a vast number of connections between two network domains, though well accepted in the connectionist literature, is not intuitive and is strongly at odds with traditional conceptualizations of lexicons as repositories of abstract local representations of single words. However, all representations in the central nervous system are distributed (like the "kitchen" representation), not local, and the knowledge that underlies the capacity to generate a representation lies in connection strengths and is not a piece of data at a memory location (as in a digital computer).
  - |-
    The knowledge that enables a person to translate a concept into a spoken word (the phonologic output lexicon; Ellis and Young 1988) is contained in two different pattern associator networks that connect the concept representations domain to the articulatory motor domain (see figure 2.1, pathways I—2 and 4-3). These two interacting pattern associator networks support different forms of knowledge. The indirect concept representations—articulatory motor pathway (pathway 4-3) provides a robust basis for knowledge of sequences and sublexical entities because of the sequence knowledge stored in the acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator. However, the direct concept representations—articulatory motor pattern associator (pathway 1-2) does not contain much knowledge of sequences and sublexical entities because it translates spatially distributed patterns of activity corresponding to concepts into temporally distributed sequences of activity corresponding to articulated words. This spatial-temporal translation precludes significant acquisition of sequence knowledge and makes this substantially a whole word pathway. The existence of this direct, whole word naming route finds support in studies of subjects with repetition conduction aphasia: some appear to have lost most phonologic sequence knowledge (pathways 3, 4, and 7; resulting in a severe deficit in auditory verbal short-term memory) but can speak quite well, producing few if any phonologic paraphasic errors, can repeat real words (with evidence of influence by semantic attributes but little influence of word length), and are severely impaired in repeating nonwords and functors (Caramazza et al. 1981; Friedrich, Glenn, and Marin 1984; Saffran and Marin 1975; Warrington and Shallice 1969). It also finds some support in reports of subjects with conduction aphasia who are able to repeat words better than nonwords (Caramazza, Miceli, and Villa 1986; Friedrich, Glenn, and Marin 1984; McCarthy and Warrington 1984; Saffran and Marin 1975) and who are able to repeat words better when they are given in a sentence context than when given as a single word (thereby increasing the likelihood of engaging concept)

    representations; McCarthy and Warrington (1984). However, a model in which the only link from the concept representations domain to the articulatory motor domain is the direct one (pathway 1-2) cannot account for observations that normal subjects exhibit phonologic slips of the tongue, and aphasic subjects produce phonemic paraphasias in naming and internally generated spoken language quite comparable to those produced during repetition. To explain these observations, one must posit access from concept representations to phonologic sequence knowledge, as indicated in pathway 4–3 of the model. Thus, this PDP model predicts that there should be two pathways enabling naming of concepts.
  - |-
    Further evidence of two pathways supporting naming of concepts has been provided by a subject who, depending upon type of verbal cue provided, could be induced to use either the whole word (direct) naming route or the phonologic (indirect) naming route (Roth et al. 2006). This left-handed subject had a Broca's aphasia stemming from a massive infarct involving the entire left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. His language was largely limited to single words, which he produced quite readily and with good articulation. He tended to pursue a semantic conduite d'approche, which however was successful only about 10% of the time. He made very rare phonologic paraphasic errors. When he was asked to name an object—for example, a faucet—and given either no cue or a semantic cue, a typical response would be "dishes ... chairs ... dishwasher ... shut ... water ... ready to go ... water... shut ... hot... cold ... sink ... water ... heavy ... water ... heavy ... washer ... tub." However, when given the phonemic cue "faus," he replied: "fauwash ... fau ... fau ... fauswah ... thafaush ... fallshine ... fallsha ... fallshvine ... fallswash ... fallsh." These patterns of response to bedside testing suggested that he normally used a whole word route to confrontation naming (as well as in internally generated language; pathway 1-2; see figure 2.1) but that by providing him with a phonemic cue, we could induce him to employ a phonologic route—a route that engaged sublexical representations implicit in his stores of phonologic sequence knowledge (pathway 4—3; see figure 2.1). He actually was able to successfully name objects 30% of the time using this pathway, but at the cost of producing large numbers of relatively undesirable nonword errors. The dual-route naming hypothesis was further tested and validated with systematic cued naming studies.
  - |-
    As discussed, lexical knowledge corresponds to patterns of
    connectivity between the domains of concept representations and the
    acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator. Because of the critical
    but counterintuitive nature of this principle, I will consistently use the
    term semantic—phonologic (lexical) to refer to the knowledge encoded in
    this connectivity.
    
    The Representation of Knowledge in Auto-Associator and
    Pattern Associator Networks: Attractor Basins, Attractor
    Trenches, and Quasi-Regular Domains
    
    A major theme of later sections in this book will be the robustness or
    redundancy with which certain knowledge is represented in neural
    connectivity and hence the degree to which that knowledge is
    susceptible to lesion effects. It is therefore important to have a clear idea
    of how robustness of knowledge is instantiated in connectionist
    networks. Put most succinctly, robustness is instantiated in terms of the
    relative strength of connectivity representing that particular knowledge
    throughout the network. However, it may be worth enlarging on this
    point.
    
    Assuming for the moment that the semantic network is
    undifferentiated (rather than consisting of multiple separate components
    in various association cortices), then the activity pattern of the auto-
    associator neural network supporting semantic knowledge corresponds
    to a function in N-dimensional feature hyperspace. I will refer to a
    concept representation corresponding to a particular activity pattern in
    this unitary hyperspace as a "granular distributed concept
    representation" to signify its dependence on the activity of units
    corresponding to underlying features. Later, I will recapture the idea that
    a concept representation is distributed across multiple association
    cortices by using the term "multifocal granular distributed concept
    representation" (MFGDCR).
  - |-
    By taking a three-dimensional "slab" of the network activity function,  
    we can achieve some insight into the order in the patterns of activity  
    (Garrard et al. 2001; Woollams et al. 2008; O'Connor, Cree, and McRae  
    2009). Let us take a slab corresponding to mammal knowledge (see  
    figure 2.3). Because we are dealing with an auto-associator network,  
    network activity tends to settle into attractor basins, one corresponding  
    to mammals in general, the central, lowest energy point of which  
    corresponds to the "centroid" of mammal knowledge—the  
    representation of a creature that best defines our sense of mammalness.  
    Within the mammal basin there are innumerable attractor subbasins  
    corresponding to specific mammals. Very close to the centroid are  
    subbasins corresponding to mammals likely to be very close to the  
    centroid representation (e.g., dogs, cats, cows, horses, etc.). Distant from  
    this centroid are subbasins corresponding to mammals that are quite  
    atypical (e.g., platypuses and whales). Distance from the centroid is  
    defined by the degree of atypicality, which is defined by feature and  
    feature combination frequency within the semantic domain (mammals in  
    this example; Kiran, Ntourou, and Eubank 2007; Patterson 2007;  
    Woollams et al. 2008). Within any given subbasin, there may be sub-  
    subbasins—for example, corresponding to types of dogs. Within these  
    sub-subbasins may be sub-sub-subbasins corresponding to types within  
    types, or perhaps the Labrador that was our pet and generic Labradors.  
    The depth of a basin relative to that of its subbasins reflects the degree  
    to which features are shared by the subbasins within that basin. For  
    example, the mammal basin is deeper than the tool basin because  
    mammals, by and large, share many more features than tools.

    The topography of the semantic network activity function in the vicinity of the mammal attractor basin. Each point corresponds to an activity level of all features in an N-dimensional feature hyperspace, in mathematical terms, a state space. Because all features are connected to all other features (or some approximation thereof), the network supports a capacity for settling of the activity function into attractor basins, subbasins within basins, and sub-subbasins, as illustrated here. The point of maximal typicality is represented by the centroid of a basin. Distance from the centroid reflects degree of atypicality. The value of 0 defines the manner in which atypically is defined. For example, whales and platypuses are both atypical, but in very different ways.
  - |-
    The topography of the various attractor basins within the semantic field reflects regularities in the knowledge of the relationships between concepts. This knowledge, instantiated in neural connection strengths, reflects the impact of regularities in experience (e.g., the mammal attractor basin of an Australian is likely to be somewhat different from that of an American), frequency of exposure, and age of acquisition effects.
    
    The purpose of this metaphor of basins and subbasins is to provide insight into the constraints on the patterns of activity exhibited by all the units in the network. All other things being equal, the activity pattern of the network supporting semantics is more likely to "settle" into deep basins and basins situated near the centroid. However, the state of this network is quite dynamic. Its connectivity is susceptible to recent learning effects: for example, the behavior the network exhibits in settling may be somewhat different if we just spent the afternoon at the zoo. Its state of background activity, and to a minor extent, its connectivity, is susceptible to the influence of our current situation. For example, the network will likely behave a little differently if we are at an aquarium watching killer whales perform. And finally, most importantly, the network's settled activity state will be strongly influenced by the specific input features, which in most circumstances will absolutely define the subbasin or sub-subbasin into which the network settles (its position in state space), all the other factors exerting their major influence either on response latencies or the occasional errors. Errors will consist of slips into nearby subbasins. This settling in response to input features instantiates content-addressable memory. Some inputs, rather than leading to settlement into a particular subbasin, may serve to define broad subbasins within the mammal basin, corresponding, for example, to mammals of North America, mammals of the Kalahari, or mammals of particular classes.
  - |-
    The effect of lesions (focal or diffuse) will be to produce graceful degradation of network performance (Hodges et al. 1992; Shallice 1988; Warrington 1975; Warrington and Shallice 1984). Deep basins will become shallower, and subbasins, particularly those that are shallower and more distant from the centroid—corresponding to more atypical exemplars—will disappear (Woollams et al. 2008). The deeper and therefore more resilient basins are defined by knowledge that is represented in neural connectivity with the greatest degree of redundancy, as a result of stronger connection strengths, which reflect frequency, age of acquisition, and familiarity effects (Hinton and Shallice 1991; Hodges, Graham, and Patterson 1995; Rogers et al. 2004). As subbasins become shallow or disappear, responses will reflect the settling of the network into surviving neighbors located nearer the centroid—neighbors of higher typicality (yielding coordinate errors, e.g., horse in lieu of donkey), the parent basin (yielding superordinate errors, e.g., animal in lieu of donkey), or failure to settle at all, yielding omission errors, particularly likely to occur with more atypical exemplars that lack near neighbors. This is precisely what has been observed in semantic dementia (Woollams et al. 2008).

    Recent studies contrasting the behavior of subjects with semantic dementia with that of subjects with large strokes and global aphasia appear, at least at first, to raise some questions about this model. This is a serious matter because the model described represents one of the foundations of the theories discussed in this book. Expectably, in word—picture matching tests, subjects with semantic dementia are most accurate in matching superordinate names to pictures (e.g., animal), somewhat less accurate with category names (e.g., dog), and least accurate with subordinate names (e.g., Labrador; Crutch and Warrington 2008). This response pattern is entirely consistent with the effects of degradation of the substrate for semantic representations as discussed above. On the other hand, subjects with large strokes and global aphasia tend to respond with the most accuracy with subordinate names, with intermediate accuracy with category names, and with the least accuracy with superordinate names, notwithstanding that category names are less frequent and subordinate names least frequent (Crutch and Warrington 2008). Crutch and Warrington (2008) offered a number of potential explanations, but the most straightforward one that is fully congruent with the neuroanatomy is that in stroke, damage to white matter connectivity between the substrate for concept representations and perisylvian cortex supporting phonology makes the major contribution to language impairment and, to a varying degree, language is dependent on underdeveloped semantic—phonologic connectivity in the right hemisphere. These white matter connections reflect the frequency with which a particular person associates a particular phonologic word form with a particular concept—something referred to as the basic level effect, which reflects the impact of experience (and with it, expertise) on our choice of name for a given entity (Rogers and McClelland 2004). Many people, on seeing a dog, would call it a "dog." However, many would more often produce the name of the type of dog (e.g., "poodle" or "German shepherd"). Very few would respond "animal." Basic level names (e.g., "dog" or "poodle") do not bear a consistent relationship to frequency in word databases. This is because they are substantially defined by personal experience and expertise. The basic level terms

    employed by a veterinarian might involve, for example, specific types of
    poodles. Basic level effects are also strongly reflective of age of
    acquisition (see above; Lambon Ralph and Ehsan 2006). Basic level
    effects interact with the properties of the semantic system. Atypical
    exemplars (e.g., platypus) receive weak support from semantic attractor
    basin effects but might receive stronger support from basic level effects
    wired into semantic—phonologic (lexical) connectivity in someone
    whose favorite cuddly toy as a child was a platypus. On the other hand,
    with semantic network damage, superordinate categories (e.g., animals)
    will have an advantage and will be preserved even as semantic
    subcategories are lost, however strong the connectivity instantiating
    basic level effects. Basic level effects also represent, in part, properties
    of the semantic system. Expertise affects not just frequency of use of
    particular terms but also degree of differentiation in semantic networks.
    
    In the Crutch and Warrington study (2008), when there was damage
    to semantic—phonologic connectivity, the most redundantly represented
    connections linking the substrate for concepts to the substrate for
    category or subcategory name representations (high basic level effect)
    were more likely to survive than those linking concepts to superordinate
    names (lower basic level effect). Why the stroke subjects performed best
    when supplied subordinate names is less clear. Normal subjects show
    reliably faster reaction times for category names (e.g., dog) and slower
    responses to subordinate (e.g., Labrador) and superordinate names (e.g.,
    animal; Crutch and Warrington 2008). The faster response to category
    names relative to superordinate names is likely to represent patterns
    instantiated in semantic—phonologic connectivity (the basis for the basic
    level effect) whereas the faster response to category names relative to
    subordinate names likely reflects the implicitly hierarchical nature of
    semantic attractor basin representations. Thus, in the word—picture
    matching comprehension test, performance level reflects the interactions
    of regularities in semantic representations, regularities in semantic—
    phonologic connectivity, and lesion geography, and the results pose no
    threat to the auto-associator attractor basis conceptualization of
    semantics introduced above.
  - |-
    The attractor basin metaphor can also be applied to pattern associator networks incorporating auto-associator features, in which case the counterpart of an attractor basin is an attractor trench. For example, consider the pattern associator network of Plaut et al. (1996) supporting reading aloud. The network activity functional counterpart of "ust" words is a very simple trench, in effect a groove, linking "...ust" to /...Ast/. The attractor trench corresponding to "...int" words is more complicated as it corresponds to a quasi-regular domain and incorporates two rather unequal subtrenches, one corresponding to "...int'—/...Int/, and the other to "...int'—/...int/. The attractor trench corresponding to "...own" words includes two nearly equal subtrenches, one corresponding to words like grown, shown, and flown, the other to words like crown, gown, and down. Within the reading aloud pattern associator network activity function, there is a trench that includes subtrenches corresponding to tough, rough, and enough; cough and trough; though, dough, and borough; through and slough; plough; drought; and ought, fought, thought, bought, brought, sought, and wrought. To bring this conceptualization closer to the central themes of this book, there exists a complex attractor trench within the acoustic—articulatory pattern associator network corresponding to the past tense of English verbs. One subtrench, a particularly large one, corresponds to verbs that accept an "ed" to form the past tense (e.g., Jump—jumped, groom-groomed, and hate—hated). Others correspond to variously "irregular" verbs—for example, swim—swam, sing—sang, bleed—bled, Slide—slid, and go—went. The rich terrain of verb past tense formation has been studied extensively and will be the topic of a later section in this book (in chapter 4, "Disorders of Grammar in Aphasia," see the subsection "Verb Past Tense Formation" in the "Grammatic Morphology—Special Cases" section). Attractor trenches exist only to the extent that there are regularities in the pattern associator network domain (in

    pattern associators supporting orthogonal domains, trenches are reduced
    to grooves supporting single relationships, e.g., between word meaning
    and word sound).
    
    Attractor basins (e.g., mammals) and trenches (e.g., "int" words)
    constitute the neural network counterparts of quasi-regular domains (see
    figure 2.4). They are regular because the exemplars have many features
    in common. They are only quasi-regular to the extent that exemplars
    have features that distinguish them. Subbasins and subtrenches
    correspond to competing regularities within these domains.

    The general principles diagrammed in figure 2.4 presumably also
    characterize all the networks supporting grammatic function.
    Understood in this way, it becomes quite clear why the single most
    important influence on the pattern of language performance of an
    aphasic subject is the terrain of knowledge implicit in the connectivity
    of these networks that was established in the acquisition of his or her
    particular language. The locus and extent of the lesion have a somewhat
    more modest influence.
    
    Semantic—Phonologic (Lexical) and Phonologic Impairment in
    Aphasias
    
    Discussion of insights into the neural architecture of grammar that have
    been gained from studies of subjects with aphasia will generally be
    limited to chapter 4 ("Disorders of Grammar in Aphasia''). However, I
    will make a brief digression into aphasia at this point in order to link the
    model to brain anatomy and to introduce an important subtheme that
    will appear later in the book: the likely importance of the nondominant
    hemisphere in accounting for much aphasic phenomenology.
    
    Phonologic Paraphasic Errors
  - |-
    Phonologic paraphasic errors are generally thought to reflect damage to dominant-hemisphere networks supporting phonologic processing. In our model, this would correspond to the dominant-hemisphere acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator network (pathway 7–3; see figure 2.1)—the repository of phonologic sequence knowledge.
    
    Nonpropositional spoken language, which may be supported by the nondominant hemisphere (Speedie et al. 1993), does reflect sequence knowledge, but discrete phrasal, lexical, or sublexical elements of this knowledge cannot be selected at will as they can in propositional language processing. The subject described in the foregoing (Roth et al. 2006), who could be cued to use one or other of the two concept naming routes (pathways 1–2 or 4–3; see figure 2.1), provides new insight into the neural basis of phonologic paraphasic errors. His left hemisphere was nearly completely destroyed. Thus, he must have been speaking with his right hemisphere, which was undamaged, and his performance when naming after phonemic cueing suggests that he was using discretely accessible phonologic sequence knowledge represented in his right hemisphere. This suggests, in turn, that deficient development of networks instantiating this knowledge (as contrasted to damage to fully developed networks) can provide an alternative basis for phonologic paraphasic errors.
    
    Factors Influencing Phonologic and Lexical Errors in Internally Generated Aphasic Language
  - |-
    In the two route naming model I have introduced, three factors may influence the pattern of errors observed in internally generated spoken language in perisylvian aphasias, and whether this pattern is marked exclusively by impaired word retrieval or, additionally, by phonemic paraphasic errors. First, given the likely anatomic representation of the network shown in figure 2.1, most dominant perisylvian lesions probably damage both the whole word and the phonologic output routes (see figure 2.5), and the pattern of spoken output may reflect the relative degree to which these two pattern associator networks are affected. This would explain why subjects with Wernicke's or conduction aphasia apparently do not have the option of relying entirely on the whole word route. Second, these two output pattern associator networks are likely to be differentially represented in the two hemispheres, the phonologic pathway being more frequently better developed in the dominant hemisphere and the whole word pathway more equally developed in the two hemispheres. Subjects with dominant-hemisphere perisylvian lesions almost invariably demonstrate impaired if not completely absent phonologic sequence knowledge but often exhibit partial sparing of semantic—phonologic (lexical) knowledge. Studies of subjects with callosal disconnection demonstrate that the disconnected right hemisphere has a phonologic input lexicon and conceptual semantic knowledge but impoverished phonologic processing (Zaidel et al. 2003). Third, there may be individual variability in the degree to which connectivity is developed in these two output routes, and this individual variability may vary as a function of hemisphere. Thus, in order to fully understand language production following a left-hemisphere lesion, a bihemispheric language model that incorporates both developmental attributes and the impact of the lesion must be considered (see figure 2.6). This will be a recurring theme throughout this book.
    
    Figure 2.5
  - |-
    Illustration depicting the network of figure 2.1 mapped onto the brain. Shade coding is as in figure 2.1. Concept representations are assumed to be widely distributed across association cortices throughout the brain. In this illustration, only the region of presumed interface between concept representations and the remainder of the model is depicted. Given the paucity of information about the anatomic organization of the human perisylvian region, the mapping depicted here is, at best, approximate; the goal is primarily to demonstrate the feasibility of mapping a connectionist architecture of phonologic processing to cortical anatomy. However, recent magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging tractographic studies of deep white matter pathways are shedding some light on the anatomic details. Catani, Jones, and Fytche (2005) have delineated two dominant perisylvian pathways linking Wernicke's and Broca's areas, a direct one, corresponding to the arcuate fasciculus (possibly corresponding to pathway 3 in our model), and an indirect one, projecting from Wernicke's area to inferior parietal cortex (Brodmann's areas 39 and 40), with apparent relay to Broca's area via what is likely component III of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Makris et al. 2005; possibly corresponding to pathway 1-2 in our model). They concluded that the broad extent of origin and termination of these pathways and their large cross sections favored a connectionist account. (From Roth, H. L., S. E. Nadeau, A. L. Hollingsworth, A. M. Cimino-Knight, and K. M. Heilman. 2006. "Naming Concepts: Evidence of Two Routes." Neurocase 12:61—70.)
    
    Figure 2.6
  - |-
    Illustration depicting mapping of a bihemispheric model to the brain. This provides the basis for a fuller explanation of the results of left-hemisphere lesions on language output in terms of bihemispheric contributions, the effect of the lesion, and the degree to which various networks are developed in each hemisphere. Shade coding is as in figures 2.1 and 2.3. HU = hidden units. (From Roth, H. L., S. E. Nadeau, A. L. Hollingsworth, A. M. Cimino-Knight, and K. M. Heilman. 2006. "Naming Concepts: Evidence of Two Routes." Neurocase 12:61—70.)
    
    As the case of Roth et al. (2006) suggests, in the presence of an extensive left-hemisphere perisylvian lesion, deficient development of connectivity underlying nondominant-hemisphere concept representations may lead to the generation of anomia and semantic paraphasic errors, and deficient development of connectivity in the nondominant-hemisphere phonologic route may lead to the generation of phonemic paraphasic errors. The deficient development of both systems, particularly the phonologic one, may be a general characteristic of the right hemisphere, but deficient development of the phonologic route might also occur to one degree or another in the left hemisphere as a result of normal variability in phonologic network ontogenesis (Goodglass 1993; Plaut et al. 1996).
  - |-
    In summary, with any given left-hemisphere lesion, the actual pattern of internally generated spoken language may reflect three factors: effects of the lesion on the two output routes (phonologic and whole word), the degree to which one or both of these routes is represented in the right hemisphere, and the degree of development of connectivity in each of the two routes in each hemisphere. If both naming routes are involved and the combined effect of the three factors differentially impacts the phonologic routes, the net result will be output marked predominantly by word retrieval deficits (with or without semantic paraphasic errors) as whole word routes become the predominant means of language production (as in repetition conduction aphasia). If whole word routes are differentially impacted, the net result will be output marked by word retrieval deficits and a substantial incidence of phonemic paraphasic errors as damaged or inadequately developed phonologic routes become the predominant means of language production.

    Subjects with reproduction conduction or Wernicke's aphasia
    predominantly use damaged or inadequately developed phonologic
    pathways. Wernicke's aphasia may reflect more severe impairment,
    hence greater difficulty with word retrieval and more profuse phonemic
    paraphasic errors than with conduction aphasia. Subjects with
    Wernicke's aphasia may also have damage to acoustic representations or
    the acoustic representations—concept representations pathways that
    enable verbal comprehension. Naming difficulty may arise through
    mechanisms discussed in the preceding paragraph or in two additional
    ways. First, damage to Brodmann's areas 37 and 39 in the dominant
    hemisphere may be associated with word retrieval deficits (Chertkow et
    al. 1997; Hart and Gordon 1990; Raymer et al. 1997; Whatmough et al.
    2002). These areas may constitute the interface between association
    cortices throughout the brain supporting concept representations and the
    core language apparatus (proximal to the point at which the phonologic
    naming route provides differential access to sequence knowledge;
    Geschwind 1965). Second, dysfunction of conceptual (semantic)
    networks because of left-hemisphere damage and deficient development
    of right-hemisphere networks, as in the subject of Roth et al. (2006),
    would be expected to yield naming difficulty with production of
    semantic paraphasic errors.
    Grammar: The Model
    
    In this chapter, I will extend the model presented in this book to
    incorporate a basis for grammatic function. By way of introduction, I
    will summarize the broader model in quasi-mathematical terms in order
    to show, in compact form, how the pieces fit together. This dense
    formulation will serve as the anchor point for the discussions that
    follow, in which I will unpack the equations. It should be emphasized
    that the model to be developed, despite the quasi-mathematical
    formulations and the absolutely crucial PDP grounding, will be
    theoretical and conceptual. No actual simulations of the model have
    been conducted, and the complexity of the model precludes such
    simulations at this time.
    
    The major components of the model are defined in table 3.1. To start,
  - |-
    MFGDCR = f(semantic knowledge, perception, plan, value] selective
    engagement, episodic memory) (3.1)
    
    where MFGDCR = multifocal granular distributed concept
    representation. The starting point of language is concepts. As I have
    discussed, a given concept is population encoded, that is, it
    is represented as a pattern of activity involving a large number of feature
    representations. The term granular distributed representation is used
    here to emphasize the point that the representation is based on a large
    number of features defined by knowledge (connections) within a neural
    network (or network field, such as visual association cortex). As noted
    earlier, a concept representation is actually multifocal, consisting of
    several granular distributed representations in several different regions
    of the brain (as described earlier for dog): hence the term multifocal
    granular distributed concept representation. In later sections I will revert
    to the term distributed representation as a shorthand term for MFGDCR.
    
    Any given MFGDCR is a function, an emergent product, of what we
    know (semantic knowledge, table 3.1, item 1), what we are perceiving at
    the moment, our plans, and the value we attach to the configuration of
    the MFGDCR (referred to in table 3.1, item 2, as concept manipulation).
    However, this MFGDCR is constrained by the extent of ongoing neural
    activity that we are able to maintain online at any one time, and that
    depends on mechanisms of selective engagement, largely frontally
    mediated, that in common parlance, are substantially those of working
    memory (table 3.1, item 9). Finally, the MFGDCR is influenced by
    projections from the hippocampal system to the cerebral cortex that
    reflect episodic memory of recent events, most importantly, immediate
    prior statements by the speaker or his or her conversation partners (table
    3.1, item 10).

    where CS(t) = concept stream and where the superscripts A, PP, Cl, and  
    V refer to the fact that MFGDCRs, as they actually enter the language  
    stream, have been modified by adjective, prepositional phrase, clause,  
    and verb representations. The subscripts 1, 2 ... n recognize that,  
    typically, more than one concept is in play at any given time within a  
    sentence—three if there is a three-argument verb, perhaps more if there  
    are embedded clauses, if there is anaphora, if the concept stream is  
    destined to emerge as a compound sentence, or if it translates into two or  
    more sentences. The employment of the dot symbol (-) is not meant to  
    indicate that MFGDCRs are vectors that are simply multiplied to yield a  
    dot product. Rather, it is a symbol to indicate that because a MFGDCR  
    is modified, among other things, by verbs or prepositions, these same  
    verbs and prepositions in turn engage other MFGDCRs. By virtue of  
    this mechanism, MFGDCRs have their own intrinsic dynamic  
    independent of sentence-level sequence knowledge, narrative plan, or  
    value. To the extent that this dynamic governs the conceptual stream,  
    grammar is entirely semantic in origin. The term CS(t) explicitly  
    represents language as a dynamic entity, expressed in this equation as a  
    stream of concepts evolving over time. This dynamic is achieved by two  
    mechanisms. First and most crucially, concept representations are  
    interfaced with the neural representation of sentence-level sequence  
    knowledge (habits of concept sequencing and modification; table 3.1, item 3), thereby explicitly incorporating a time element. Second, this  
    process, as with MFGDCRs themselves, is subject to modification, on  
    the fly, according to its degree of fit with narrative plan and the value  
    that is attached to both the modified concept representations and the  
    sequence that are emerging (table 3.1, item 2, concept manipulation).  
    The pattern of neural activity corresponding to CS(t) elicits activity in  
    prefrontal cortex that enables determination of fit with plan (dorsolateral  
    prefrontal cortex) and assessment of value (the orbitofrontal—limbic  
    system).
    
    We can now conclude this introduction with the following:

    Language output (t) = h(CS(t)|lexical knowledge|morphologic sequence knowledge, phonologic sequence knowledge| plan, value) (3.3)
    For language to be produced, the concept stream, CS(t), must be converted via lexical knowledge, including that of grammatic morphemes (table 3.1, items 6, 7, and 8) into phonologic representations. The emerging product is constrained by knowledge of morphologic and phonologic sequence (table 3.1, items 4 and 5). It is also constrained, by virtue of bottom—up/top—down flow of activation in neural networks (most explicit in the phonologic neighborhood phenomenon) by narrative plan and the value attached to the emerging language stream: hence our propensity for self-correction as we speak.
    
    Equations 3.1—3.3 explicitly represent the role of frontal systems in determining MFGDCRs, concept stream, and language output over time. Frontal systems are also a major factor in selective engagement. The point is that language at every stage is shaped by frontal systems, and what emerges is the execution of a plan that optimizes subjective value and is constrained by neural architecture (auto-associator and sequence networks) so as to emerge as spoken language.
    
    I will now proceed, through the remainder of this chapter, to unpack this dense theoretical formulation. In the next chapter, we will see how the more fully fleshed-out model fares in accounting for a large spectrum of findings reported in the aphasia literature.

    For purposes of discussion, I will break grammatic function down
    into syntax and grammatic morphology. Syntax is knowledge of
    acceptable word order and sentence structure. Grammatic morphology
    refers both to the modifications of words that are made in their use in
    sentences (bound grammatic morphology, e.g., affixes conveying case,
    number, or tense) and to the use of individual words that, at least
    superficially, appear to primarily serve sentence composition rather than
    meaning (free grammatic morphemes, e.g., articles, auxiliary verbs,
    conjunctions, certain prepositions, complementizers). I will break syntax
    down into (1) sentence organization, which encompasses such things as
    the necessary relationships between verbs and nouns or noun phrases in
    a sentence (verb argument relationships), embedded clauses, and passive
    voice constructions, and (2) phrase structure rules, which constrain
    word order at the local level—for example, the rule that constrains
    articles to precede nouns. In Chomskian thinking, both these
    components of syntax are thought to arise from the operational
    principles of a grammar generator. In contrast, I will argue that
    principles of sentence organization follow directly from the way the
    brain instantiates and manipulates concept representations and from
    neural instantiation of the statistical regularities of sentence form. I will
    argue that phrase structure rules and rules of grammatic morphology
    (free or bound, in language-specific mixtures) are an emergent product
    of the pattern associator networks responsible for articulatory and
    inscriptional (written) output, which support sequence knowledge.
    Grammar, in this neural network formulation, is the emergent product of
    a number of systems and stores of knowledge, interacting with each
    other to produce behavior that implicitly honors language regularities
    (see table 3.1). The knowledge is acquired through language experience
    in ways that reflect the statistical regularities of that experience, which
    are specific to individual languages. What is innate is the neural network
    topography and connectivity that provide the scaffold for acquisition of
    this knowledge. My goal at this point is to elucidate the contributions
    that the various systems and stores of knowledge involved in grammatic
    function make to the ultimate product.
    
    Semantic Contributions to Syntax

    It is easy to conceive of spoken concrete nouns as the product of
    distributed representations of concepts that are linked, through pattern
    associator networks (pathways 1—2 and 4-3; see figure 2.1), to
    articulatory motor representations and, ultimately, to networks that
    support the sequences of oropharyngeal movements that actually
    produce the speech sounds of the noun as discussed in the section on
    phonology. The same cannot be said about other types of words, most
    particularly adjectives, verbs, and abstract nouns.
    
    Adjectives
    
    Adjectives represent the simplest case and therefore are a reasonable
    place to start. In principle, the distributed representations corresponding
    to noun concepts are infinitely malleable. We can easily modify the
    distributed representation of dog to capture any species of dog or any
    particular dog we have personally known. We can easily contemplate the
    most complicated, arbitrary, and nuanced of distributed concept
    representations—for example, "the obese, pockmarked, oily-haired,
    slovenly, unctuous, check-shirted, plaid-jacketed man with the striped
    pants, food-stained paisley tie, goatee, wire-rimmed glasses, bundle of
    pens in his pocket, and clipboard in his hand"—a sort of Uriah Heep
    cum used-car salesman. The process of pairing one or more adjectives or
    adjectival phrases with a noun corresponds to a modification of the
    distributed representation of the noun concept. Through the course of
    this book, it will become evident that any semantic representation,
    including semantic representations of verbs, is susceptible to nearly
    infinite nuance by adjectives, adverbs, the particular combination of
    nouns and verbs in the sentence, prepositional phrases, and clauses
    (hence MFGDCR* PP. CY in equation 3.2) and by working memory of
    the narrative context (see also Elman 2009). This capacity for
    malleability and nuance reflects a power of distributed representations.
    
    Verbs
  - |-
    Verbs are viewed as the work masters in traditional linguistic formulations because they specify the major participants in the action that is described by the verb, its arguments, thereby defining sentence structure. Arguments are usually noun phrases but may also be prepositional phrases, adjectival phrases, and sentential clauses. They fill argument positions (e.g., subject, object, and indirect object positions). Each argument is assigned a purpose in the sentence by the verb, referred to as its thematic role. For example, the agent is the perpetrator of the action (The man gave flowers to Mary), the theme is the object of the verb's action (flowers in the preceding sentence), and the patient is the recipient of the action (Mary). Verbs differ with respect to the arguments they specify—some require only an agent; some an agent and a theme; others an agent, theme, and patient; and many verbs allow some freedom in choosing whether or not to include a certain argument. They also differ with respect to the nature of the arguments they can specify (e.g., "knew" easily accommodates a sentential clause in the predicate, e.g., "He knew Mary would arrive soon," whereas "hit" does not) and to the ordering of arguments about the verb (e.g., John gave the book to Mary/John gave Mary the book; John donated the book to the library, but not John donated the library the book)—behaviors subsumed under the subcategorization requirements of the verb.
  - |-
    Does the argument specification property of verbs provide insight into the cerebral processing of verbs? How might a verb be represented in PDP terms? First, consider what might be the distributed representation of a verb—for example, the verb "to shoot." What features underlie this distributed representation? A problem is immediately apparent. Our conceptualization of shooting actually consists of the juxtaposition of two distributed concept representations: a person who is the shooter and a person who has been shot or is about to be shot. The sentence "The old man shot the burglar" generates two distributed concept representations, one of an old man appropriately altered to incorporate the act of shooting, the second of a burglar, appropriately altered to incorporate the fact of having been shot. This modification alters the character or flavor of its arguments—old man is moved from the centroid of old men to a subbasin corresponding to an old man holding a gun, recently fired, burglar to a subbasin corresponding to a man with blood expanding across his chest and his life slipping away. The modification, in the context of a rigid, subject-verb—object (SVO) language like English, is also associated with old man acquiring the property of agent and burglar the property of patient. Thus, "shot" achieves its meaning not primarily through the generation of its own distributed concept representation but rather through the elicitation of two reciprocally modified distributed representations ("old man shooter" and "shot burglar") that are in addition meaningfully linked, in effect constituting a composite, "superdistributed" representation that incorporates the entire shooting scene (see figure 2.2C). The two components of this composite representation are implicitly linked by their complementarity (shooter and shot; agent and patient) and their simultaneity. They become explicitly linked when this particular reciprocal pair of distributed representations generates a pattern of activation in the acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator network that will produce the sound sequence corresponding to the sentence. They may also become explicitly linked when a pattern of activity in acoustic cortex, generated by the sound of the sentence being produced by a speaker, leads to production of the reciprocal pair of distributed concept representations underlying "old man shooter" and "shot burglar."

    Intransitive verbs function in a fashion essentially identical to
    adjectives (e.g., "the soldier salutes"). A transitive verb functions as a
    sort of superadjective, reciprocally modifying the two or more
    distributed concept representations corresponding to the two or three
    nouns phrases in the sentence. Thus, in our new conceptualization, verbs
    are defined by the effect they have on the distributed representations of
    the nouns they modify (which constitutes both their grammatic and their
    semantic roles) and the effect they have on the pattern of activity in the
    phonologic processing network, which constitutes their semantic—
    phonologic (lexical) role.
    
    Any volitional (frontally mediated) alteration in distributed concept
    representations constitutes concept manipulation. Thus, even use of
    adjectives or intransitive verbs, which serve to modify a single
    distributed concept representation, can be usefully viewed as concept
    manipulation, and, as will be discussed below, will tend to be impaired
    in subjects with aphasias—for example, Broca's aphasia—that are
    associated with deficits in transitive verb use and argument structure.
    
    Production of the sentence "The old man shot the burglar" requires
    fairly symmetrical manipulations of two distributed concept
    representations. However, sentences employing adjunctive phrases—for
    example, "Jones slept in the park'—may demand highly asymmetrical
    manipulation of the two distributed concept representations. In this
    sentence, the "Jones" concept is the object of most of the modification,
    and the "park" concept is only very subtly modified. However, this
    asymmetry could be dramatically altered by contextual information—for
    example, "Jones was apprehended as the murderer of nighttime joggers.
    He slept in the park during the day"—in which case the distributed
    concept representation of park is substantially modified by its
    association with Jones the murderer. More generally, grammar, in its
    impact on meaning, is always dependent on context and never absolute.
    This phenomenon is readily accommodated by a neural architecture
    employing granular distributed (population-encoded) representations.
    
    Semantic Instantiation of Verbs
  - |-
    Ideas introduced in the previous section on verb representations can perhaps be clarified by looking at verbs from a somewhat different perspective, one that begins with the semantic representations of noun concepts and the semantic contribution that verbs make to these representations. Verbs modify concept representations in a way that is explicitly sustained in a dynamic way over a temporal epoch (in contrast to the static modification achieved by adjectives). This temporal feature can usefully be viewed as the predicative component of the MFGDCR (see figure 2.2A). One of the most fundamental attributes of connectionist models and the brain is that the knowledge represented in neural network connectivity both provides a source of information and defines the function of the network as a processor. Thus, for example, the knowledge in postcentral neural networks that enables perceptual processing can also provide a major contribution to verb and noun semantics. As for the distributed representations of a noun, the distributed representation of a verb is best understood as having multiple components (each a pattern of neural activity in a cortical region) that, in aggregate, instantiate the meaning of a verb (see figure 2.2B). Each component of a verb representation will, in turn, comprise a component of the MFGDCRs corresponding to the verb-modified arguments—recapitulating the theme of the beginning of this section (see also below). In analogy to the predicative component of nouns, verbs can be understood as having nominative components corresponding to the nouns they can modify.
  - |-
    The predicative component of a concept representation, which enables instantiation of the component of meaning that is explicitly sustained dynamically over time, constitutes the associative link to the semantic representation of verbs. Thus, in thinking of dogs, ideation of running, jumping, barking, and licking comes just as readily as ideation of physical attributes of dogs that are routinely denoted by adjectives. Empirical studies confirm that agents and patients prime verbs (McRae et al. 2005; see also Buxbaum and Kalénine 2010). On the other hand, engaging a feature of a concept representation enables us, through the facility of concept addressable memory that is intrinsic to PDP systems (Rumelhart et al. 1986), to access the concept. Thus, thinking of furry and affectionate readily engages the concept "dog," among others (and there is evidence that adjectives similarly engage noun representations and vice versa; Percy et al. 2009). To the extent that a given verb representation can be part of a MFGDCR, no less than features characterized by adjectives, ideation of the verb should also engage the noun concept (e.g., barking — dog). Empirical studies confirm that verbs do indeed prime eligible agents and patients (Ferretti, McRae, and Hatherell 2001). Because one noun concept may have a large number of predicative components available to its distributed representation (corresponding to verbs), and any one verb can be a feature, hence a predicative component of the meaning of many concepts (e.g., measure: surveyor, chef, carpenter, designer) and thereby any one verb can have many nominative components, it makes sense to invoke the idea of working associations. There are a very large number of accessible features to any particular concept, but only a particular combination of these feature representations, involving a multitude of association cortices, is engaged at any one time. For example, at a particular moment, we may conceptualize a running dog, in which case the distributed representation of dog we are currently supporting includes a particular visual instantiation of the dog concept representation that incorporates running features (a working memory instantiated in visual association cortices) and a particular thematic component of the dog.
  - |-
    Concept representation, agent or patient (a working memory likely instantiated, at least in part, in prefrontal cortex), the linked representations altering each other to constitute the working association that instantiates "running dog."
    
    This conceptualization of a verb as the potential predicative component of a noun concept, one that is actualized through the establishment of a working association between the MFGDCR of the noun and the multicomponent granular distributed representation of that particular verb, may be especially helpful in discerning what happens during comprehension. In the comprehension process, heard or read noun phrases elicit MFGDCRs. The verb adds a predicative component to each of these representations, a predicative component that also confers the agent, patient, or theme property. The reciprocity of the distributed representations, each now including the predicative features, then establishes the meaningful link between them. Hearing "The old man shot the burglar" generates distributed concept representations of old man and burglar, each of which has a very large number of possible predicative components. The appearance of the verb "shot," coupled with the word order of the sentence, creates working associations yielding actualization of that particular verb as the predicative component of both noun concept representations, and old man becomes "shooter old man" and burglar, "shot burglar." This will be true with other word orders, with the aid of grammatic morphology. Thus, in "The burglar was shot by the old man," "was shot" in this passive voice construction adds both shot and patient attributes to the distributed representation of burglar, and "shot by" adds both shooter and agent attributes to the distributed representation of old man. The temporal contiguity of these two modified distributed noun representations, their sharing of the verb representation of shot, and the reciprocity of agent and patient relationships links shooter old man and shot burglar to each other in an implication of causality.
    
    In this section, I merely alluded to the idea that verb representations, no less than noun representations, are multifocal. In the next section I will consider this multifocality in considerable detail.
    
    Verb Thematic, Implementational, and Flavor Representations
  - |-
    The range of semantic contributions to concept meaning that is achievable by verbs can be logically divided on a neuroanatomic basis into several dimensions (see figure 2.2B):
    
    1. Frontal
       a. Thematic
       b. Implementational
    
    2. Postcentral (posterior to central sulcus): Flavor (including manner and path)
    
       a. Modality specific: visual, auditory, somatosensory, and limbic
       b. Specialization within modality
    
       c. Complexity
    
    All verbs have a thematic representational component (because all have argument structures and all connote a plan sustained over time), and some (those involving movement of body parts) have an implementational component. All have one or more flavor components (detailed below).
    
    Frontal
    
    Thematic
    
    Prefrontal cortex enables volitional formulation of plans that are precisely tailored to the specific demands of the situation—a process that has been defined as intentional intention (Nadeau and Heilman 2007). Posterior portions of the hemisphere, through their connectivity with prefrontal and premotor cortex (Chavis and Pandya 1976), provide a repertoire of plans that have been learned through experience and may be released automatically in reactive fashion for execution (reactive intention). Whether intentional or reactive, the final common substrate of intention is prefrontal cortex. The temporal component implicit in plans provides a plausible substrate for dynamic time sense. The role of the frontal lobes in intention also implicitly provides a substrate for instantiation of thematic roles because intention requires the assumption of some role with respect to the action be taken. If you are planning or are engaged in the plans of the actors you are thinking about, then you are no longer an innocent bystander: you are imputing agency and consequence. Because of the potential role of the frontal lobes in providing substrates for both dynamic time sense and the instantiation of thematic roles, one might anticipate that verb production and comprehension would be differentially impaired by frontal lesions—precisely what has been observed (see chapter 4).
    
    Implementational

    Many verbs connote use of a body part in a very direct way (e.g., to speak, to hit, and to walk). Other verbs, characterizable as practic verbs (e.g., cut—with scissors or a knife) also implicitly connote use of a body part. Thus, as originally suggested by Damasio and Tranel (1993), it is plausible that these verb types might have a representational component in premotor and motor cortex. This has been borne out in a particularly elegant functional imaging study of verb meaning by Kemmerer et al. (2008) and finds further support in an extensive body of other work, including functional imaging (PET, functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], magnetoencephalography) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) mapping (Kemmerer et al. 2008; Kemmerer and Gonzalez-Castillo 2010; Fernandino and Iacoboni 2010). Behavioral studies also provide strong support for this hypothesis. Reading of sentence segments involving movement (either the verb or an adverb modifying the verb) is slowed when the motion conveyed conflicts with concurrently performed movement—for example, the verb of "he found a new light bulb which he screwed in rapidly," paired with counterclockwise rotation (Taylor and Zwaan 2008). Motor responses signaling sentence understanding are slowed when the action conveyed by the verb (e.g., requiring an open hand) is incompatible with the action employed in the response (e.g., a closed hand; Aravena et al. 2010). Responses in incompatible conditions are associated with enhanced N400 negativity (signaling semantic mismatch) and a reduced motor potential (signaling reduced engagement of motor cortex; Aravena et al. 2010), thus demonstrating that the interaction between the implementational component of verb meaning and other components is mutual. Movement kinematics are more disrupted when reaching movements are attempted during lexical decision tasks involving action verbs than during lexical decision tasks involving nouns (Boulenger et al. 2006). When subjects are tonically gripping a compressible cylinder between thumb and index finger while listening to concrete nouns without motor associations and verbs denoting action performed with

    The hand or arm, grip force is reduced in association with the verbs (Frak et al. 2010). The implementational component of the verb semantic representation is markedly attenuated when the meaning of a verb is changed from ongoing action to complete action (i.e., from progressive (1) to perfect (2) aspect; Bergen and Wheeler 2010)—for example,
    
    (1) "John is closing the drawer."
    (2) "John has closed the drawer."
    
    The implementational component of action verb representations is located at sites of relevant action knowledge. The implementational representation of action verbs in motor cortex appears to be somatotopic — verbs connoting lower extremity movement having a representational component more dorsal in the motor homunculus, in the leg area; verbs connoting upper extremity movement having a _ representational component more ventral, in the hand—arm knob of the precentral gyrus (Kemmerer et al. 2008; Kemmerer and Gonzalez-Castillo 2010; Raposo et al. 2009). By contrast, motion verbs employed idiomatically (e.g., "The old man kicked the bucket" or "Claire grabbed at the job opportunity") do not appear to have implementational components (Raposo et al. 2009). Kinematics of hand movement are slowed by semantic decisions on heard action verbs involving hand movement compared to verbs involving foot movement (Dalla Volta et al. 2009). In an fMRI study of left- and right-handers performing lexical decisions on verbs involving manual action, subjects differentially engaged premotor cortex contralateral to their preferred hand (Willems, Hagoort, and Casasanto 2010). Regions of engagement in lexical decision were not the same as in a motor imagery task, in which the same laterality relationships were observed but substantially nonoverlapping regions of cortex, including area 6 but also area 4, were engaged.
  - |-
    These results from studies of normal subjects have been borne out in studies of brain-injured populations. Subjects with Parkinson's disease exhibit robust masked priming! of both nouns and verbs when in the on-condition but prime only nouns when in the off-condition, during which they exhibit dysfunction of motor cortex as a result of noisy striatal input (Boulenger et al. 2008). Patients with corticobasal degeneration with prominent limb apraxia are more severely impaired in the naming of manipulation actions than in the naming of nonmanipulation actions ( Cotelli et al. 2006). Defective action knowledge in motor neuron disease correlates with degree of atrophy of motor cortex (Grossman et al. 2008).
    
    Research on what has been termed fictive motion, involving sentences employing figurative verbs, suggests that conceptualization of the implementational component of verbs as a distributed representation limited to motor and premotor cortex cannot be entirely correct. Sentences incorporating a figurative meaning of a verb employ a motion verb but describe no motion, for example,
    
    "The road goes through the desert."
    
    The speed with which judgments on the meaning of such sentences are made can be strongly influenced by context. Judgments are rendered significantly faster if made after reading stories about short- as opposed to long-distance travel, fast travel versus slow travel, and travel over easy terrain versus difficult terrain (Matlock 2004). This finding holds true even when the subject of the sentence does not predicate movement, for example,
    
    "The earthquake fault runs across the valley."
    
    Eye moments, reflective of engagement of frontal eye fields in the processing of fictive motion, are also influenced: participants make more eye scanning movements and take longer looking at pictures (e.g., of a road) when figurative verb sentences (e.g., The road goes through the valley) are preceded by a description of rough terrain compared to when the description is of smooth terrain (Richardson and Matlock 2007). No such differences are observed with sentences involving nonfigurative use of verbs (e.g., The road is in the valley).
  - |-
    Because in their figurative use, verbs do not represent actual motion,
    these findings suggest that in such cases, the implementational
    component of verb meaning can be only quasi-implementational and
    must be understood in terms of an implicit intention or plan or action
    that need not engage motor or premotor cortex. The attractor basin
    corresponding to this plan can be shaped by prior context, hence the
    effects of travel distance, travel speed, and terrain. I assume a prefrontal
    representation rather than a postcentral representation because prefrontal
    representations implicitly incorporate a time element and such
    intentional representations would be expected to engage frontal eye
    fields. It is more difficult to conceive of repeated eye movements
    occurring as a reflection of repeated orienting responses driven by
    postcentral verb path representations (see below).

    Verbs, in their linking of agents and objects, may instantiate a
    representation of directionality, even when they involve neither motion
    nor fictive motion and therefore lack an explicit or even quasi-
    implementational component or any overt spatial implications. This
    effect has to do with the direction of causality instantiated by the verb
    through its argument structure. It is thus unclear whether this aspect of
    verb meaning is best viewed as a part of the implementational
    component or part of the thematic component. Glenberg and Kaschak
    (2002) had normal subjects signal whether sentences made sense or not
    by lifting their hand from an initiate button (which triggered the
    appearance of the sentence) to press a "yes" button or a "no" button. In
    some trial blocks, the "yes" button was nearer and the "no" button
    farther than the initiate button, and in other blocks the order was
    reversed. Three types of sentence were tested: (1) imperative (e.g.,
    "Open the drawer"/"Close the drawer"), (2) double object construction
    (e.g., "Courtney handed you the notebook"/"You handed Courtney the
    notebook"), and (3) abstract (e.g., "Liz told you the story"/"You told Liz
    the story," or "The policeman radioed you the message"/"You radioed
    the message to the policeman"). For all three sentence types, there was a
    significant interaction between response direction and implied sentence
    direction. Reaction times were faster when the "yes" button was distal,
    whether the sentence was "Close the drawer," "You handed Courtney
    the notebook," or "You told Liz the story." The effect was similar when
    subjects had to use their left hand to respond. What seems to be at play
    is the egocentric spatial location of agent and patient. Requiring a
    subject to make a concurrent movement along a pathway from patient to
    agent delays response. The implicit directionality of causation between
    agent and patient could be instantiated in parietal "where" system cortex
    as posited below for verbs that explicitly incorporate path flavor
    information. However, it seems more likely that it is incorporated in
    prefrontal components of the "where" system, an explanation I favor
    given the extent to which this type of information is wrapped up in the
  - |-
    Thematic component of verb meaning. It may be that because of the intimate relationship of prefrontal and postcentral systems that derives from their extensive interconnectivity (Chavis and Pandya 1976), viewing this as an either/or situation represents an oversimplification.
    
    Normal English-speaking subjects also exhibit a left to right directional bias in the graphic depiction of events, tending to place the agent to the left and the patient to the right (Chatterjee, Maher, and Heilman 1995). This could reflect the acquisition of a bias in imputing direction of causality that develops in the course of acquiring other explicitly directional skills (e.g., reading from left to right).
    Alternatively it could reflect the fact that the left hemisphere is more likely to be engaged by linear, sequential tasks (e.g., syntax), even as the left hemisphere constitutively directs movements toward the right hemispace (Heilman, Watson, and Valenstein 2003).
    
    Postcentral: Verb Flavor
    
    Verbs have additional components of their multifocal distributed representations that account for aspects of their meaning that are not related to their thematic or implementational components. For want of a sufficiently encompassing term that has not already been co-opted to describe something more specific, I have coined the term flavor. The term flavor incorporates what are traditionally referred to as manner and path aspects of verb meaning, as well as emotional (limbicly represented) components. Verb flavor is modality specific. However, most is known about the visual modality, in part because of the extent of our knowledge of this system, in part because of the vast extent of human cerebral cortex that is dedicated to visual processing and incorporates visual knowledge. The latter attribute has provided an opportunity for study of differential lesion effects in experiments of nature and for functional imaging studies in normal subjects. Thus, this discussion will focus predominantly on the visual representational component.
  - |-
    The varieties of visual verb flavor have a direct correspondence to reasonably well-understood neuroanatomy. The most fundamental division of visual systems is into a ventral (largely inferior temporal) "what" system that processes form and color and subserves single-object recognition and a dorsal "where" system (lateral temporal and parietal) that processes location in space and movement (Mishkin, Ungerleider, and Macko 1983).
    
    Movement is of central interest here because the meaning of so many verbs has a movement component. The representation of movement, including movement components of verb meaning, is complex and logically dividable into several domains, each with a neuroanatomic counterpart. An object may be characterized by intrinsic motion (captured by many verbs) that has nothing to do with change in location (e.g., the ball is spinning) or that can occur without a change in location (e.g., he is running [on a treadmill]). Because this particular domain has attributes of an object quality, it is no surprise that it is primarily supported by convexity cortex in the ventral regions of the "where" trajectory that is immediately adjacent to "what" system visual object perception cortex on the undersurface of the temporal lobe: that is, posterolateral inferior temporal gyrus (Brodmann's areas 37 and 19), corresponding to middle temporal (MT)/medial superior temporal (MST) areas of the macaque. Deficits in movement perception (Gilmour et al. 1994; Zeki 1991; Zihl, Von Cramon, and Mai 1983), action recognition (Kalénine, Buxbaum, and Coslett 2010), and action naming (Tranel et al. 2001; Tranel et al. 2008) have been observed in subjects with lesions in this region. This region has also been implicated in motion perception and in the representation of meaning of verbs of motion in functional imaging studies of normal subjects (Kemmerer et al. 2008; Wu, Morganti, and Chatterjee 2008).
  - |-
    Another domain of movement perception involves movement in peripersonal space, that is, in the body centered spatial coordinates necessary to guide limb and eye movement. Many verbs directly (run, slap) or indirectly—as practic verbs—invoke this domain of movement representation. Because lesions causing persistent deficits in movement perception are typically large, behavioral studies have not yet provided much information on fragmentation of movement perception or on associated deficits in verb meaning. However, functional imaging studies have been quite successful in demonstrating selective engagement of cortex in the vicinity of the left inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus by verbs of these classes (Kemmerer et al. 2008; Tranel et al. 2008). Practic verbs are likely to be additionally associated with unique and more extensive patterns of engagement because they are associated with very precise, overlearned, somatosensory and motor processes that are linked to visual representations of the tool and the movement. This expectation is borne out in the complex but largely orderly patterns of engagement observed in functional imaging studies (Kemmerer et al. 2008).
    
    Components of verb representations that invoke either domains of intrinsic movement or movement in peripersonal space provide the basis for the linguistic component of verb meaning referred to as manner. Thus, amble, stroll, saunter, strut, and march all involve variations on the theme of walking, each conveying a particular style of walking. Manner information is characteristically directly encoded by verbs in manner incorporating languages (e.g., English, German, Russian, Swedish, Chinese; Kemmerer and Tranel 2003). Other languages, known as path-incorporating languages (e.g., modern Greek, Spanish, Japanese, Turkish, and Hindi) incorporate path information in the verb (e.g., in Greek: beno [move in], ugeno [move out], aneveno [move up], kateveno [move down]) while manner information is optionally incorporated via a prepositional phrase or gerund (Kemmerer and Tranel 2003) in analogy to the ways in which path is expressed in manner-incorporating languages. Studies suggesting a postcentral component to action verb meaning representing manner have been

     reviewed. It seems likely that the path component of verb representation
    in path-incorporating languages is similarly represented posteriorly, but
    more dorsally, in cortices supporting the spatial location components of
    the "where" system (see below).
    
    Location may also change in extrapersonal space, in which case the
    movement is defined in terms of environmental coordinates and the
    principal sensory modality that is brought to bear is vision (though
    hearing may make a contribution in some circumstances). This type of
    spatial perception is supported in dorsal occipital and parietal cortical
    regions (see, e.g., the functional imaging study by Wu, Morganti, and
    Chatterjee 2008). The rare subjects affected by lesions in these regions
    exhibit Balint's syndrome (Balint 1909) or difficulty aligning their
    personal coordinate system with the environmental coordinate system
    (Stark, Coslett, and Saffran 1996). Deficits of this type may be
    observable in subjects with the syndromes of posterior cortical atrophy
    and corticobasal degeneration. Verb meaning deriving from the
    knowledge represented in this perceptual system is exemplified by
    sentences such as the following:
    
    "The bird flew over the house."
    as contrasted with
    "The bird flew into the wind."
    
    The adjunctive phrase in the first sentence serves to modify "flew" in a
    way that incorporates a substantially locative element, whereas "flew"
    in the second sentence purely characterizes a movement pattern. These
    are two quite different verbs. The prepositional phrase is not just a
    locative adjunct: it also heavily seasons the flavor of the verb. Subjects
    with lesions of ventral visual cortex and temporal cortex should exhibit
    selective sparing in the comprehension and production of verbs (with or
    without adjunctive phrases) that connote location in space.
  - |-
    To this point, our focus has been on the nuances of visual verb flavor that are relatable to the ventral—dorsal organization of postcentral cortices supporting perception of various aspects of movement: object movement, movement in peripersonal space, and movement in extrapersonal space. Left out has been a perception that is implicit in the sudden transition of an object from one form to another, the knowledge substrate that supports the meaning of change of state verbs (e.g., break, shatter, and crumble, but also sprout, bloom, and wither). Logically, this knowledge should reside in "what" system networks in ventral temporal cortex. This has been borne out by functional imaging studies (Kemmerer et al. 2008). However, the concept of change of state verbs, at least as they are modified by sentential context, may need to be viewed somewhat more broadly. Zwaan et al. (2004) presented normal subjects with sentences such as "The shortstop hurled the softball at you," immediately followed by two pictures of a ball presented 175 milliseconds apart. Subjects were quicker to judge that the two pictures displayed the same object if the second ball was slightly larger than the first—as it would appear if indeed the ball were traveling toward you. Here, the change of state does not involve alteration in the fundamental concept representation of ball, only the evolution of subtle features of that representation.
  - |-
    The visual flavor of a verb may involve a distributed representation that incorporates two or more of the neural domains discussed above. Thus, verbs that incorporate elements of both intrinsic movement and movement in peripersonal space (e.g., hitting, slapping, and practic verbs) may engage both inferior posterolateral temporal cortex and the inferior parietal lobule (Kemmerer et al. 2008). Practic verbs (e.g., cutting) are often associated with a change of state of their associated objects and therefore engage inferior temporal cortex (Kemmerer et al. 2008). Furthermore, distinctions between verb flavors mapped in temporoparietal cortex are likely paralleled by corresponding distinctions mapped in motor and premotor cortex (e.g., the implementational representations of march, strut, shuffle, and sashay; Kemmerer and Gonzalez-Castillo 2010).
    
    Visual verb flavor may vary along a second, substantially orthogonal dimension that I will term complexity. To some extent this dimension may be conflated with attributes of intrinsic movement, movement in peripersonal space, and state changing, but it is likely to correspond anatomically to the antero—posterior location of the representation of verb meaning in temporal cortex. In this conceptualization, the flavor component of verbs connoting a simple action at a precise retinotopic location would be represented more posteriorly whereas the flavor component of verbs connoting complex actions with little retinotopic specificity would be represented more anteriorly (see Rolls and Deco 2002; Rolls and Treves 1998). For example, at the simplest end of the complexity dimension, presumably represented more posteriorly, we have a sentence like
    
    "He dotted the ‘1'."
    
    At the more complex end, presumably more anteriorly represented, we have
    
    "Michelangelo carved the David."
    
    "Carved" might be a complex practic verb, a state changing verb, or an abstract verb more akin to "create," depending on the context.
  - |-
    Visual verb flavor may vary along a third dimension: retinotopic location. In the trajectory of the visual system from primary visual cortex in the medial occipital lobes to ventral anterior temporal lobe, the receptive fields of neurons change from minute and precisely retinotopic to very large, even bilateral, and essentially not retinotopic—in parallel with a change in neural response properties from relatively simple in the primary visual cortex to complex and primarily related to object recognition in more anterior temporal visual association cortex. Thus, for verbs whose flavor component is related to visual perception of simple, highly localizable stimuli, there is the potential for a retinotopic effect, corresponding to engagement of very posterior portions of calcarine cortex (the macular representation) or their projection targets. For example, in
    
    "The jeweler pierced her ear"
    
    "pierced" connotes an action in the central (foveal) portion of vision. In contrast, in
    
    "The bullet glanced off the car"
    
    "glanced" connotes something that happened in the periphery, corresponding to engagement of relatively anterior portions of calcarine cortex or their projection targets. I assume engagement of "what" visual systems in these examples because it is the allocentric representation that is involved.
    
    Verbs connoting only intrinsic motion may engage a specific portion of visual cortex as if by imputation. For example, "the chair toppled" elicits engagement of visual cortices corresponding to the lower part of the visual field (Bergen et al. 2007).
    
    The same basic principles that I have detailed for visual flavor should hold for auditory and somatosensory flavors. For auditory representations, the most fundamental representational dimension may be pitch (related to sound frequency and perhaps the analog of color in the visual system), for example,
    
    "The bells tinkled."
    
    "The ship's horn boomed."
    
    However, even "tinkled" and "boomed" connote sounds that are far more complex than pure tones, and some verbs, in particular contexts, connote meaning sufficiently complex as to defy a pitch characterization, for example,
    
    "The orchestra played the Eroica."
  - |-
    Thus, there is a complexity dimension to acoustic representations just as for visual representations. Acoustic flavor, in some circumstances, may convey a dimension of movement, for example,
    
    ‘The train roared past us'
    
    in which "roared" connotes a Doppler effect implicating movement that is not present in the sentence
    
    "The lion roared."
    
    Somatosensory flavors may vary along dimensions of somatotopic location, complexity, and possibly movement. For example, in
    
    "She pricked her finger with the needle"
    
    the sensation connoted is both simple and highly localized. In contrast, in
    
    "He itched"
    
    the sensation connoted is complex and poorly localized. In the sentence
    
    "He stroked her arm"
    
    there is implicit somatosensory movement.
    
    Many verbs, most notably experiencer-theme verbs (e.g., love, confuse) do not have meaning latent in sensory association cortices. Presumably, for these verbs, flavor derives predominantly from meaning instantiated in the limbic system.
    
    Relations between Nouns and Verbs
    
    To this point, I have discussed the idea of verbs as a peculiar kind of adjective that modifies the flavor and conveys thematic role to the meaning of one or more noun concept representations corresponding to verb arguments (MFGDCR," - MFGDCR," - ... MFGDCR,,"). I have
    
    discussed the evidence that verb representations, no different from noun representations, are multifocal, as well as granular distributed. It is now appropriate to inquire into constraints that apply to verb modifications of noun representations. Two major constraints can be identified: featural plausibility and attractor basin compatibility (see Saffran, Schwartz, and Linebarger 1998). Featural plausibility refers to the extent to which a verb can add features to a noun concept representation. For example, in the sentence
    
    "The crash frightened the children"
    
    "frightened" can readily add features to the concept representation of children but not to that of crash. Consequently, the crash representation will be scarcely influenced by "frightened." Attractor basin compatibility refers to the extent to which a verb with featural plausibility distorts the natural attractor basin of the noun concept representations engaged by the phonologic form of the sentence. Thus, in the sentence
  - |-
    "The cute bunny attacked the pit bulls"
    
    The addition of the "attacked" feature would minimally modify the
    natural attractor basin of the pit bull concept but it would grossly distort
    the natural attractor basin of cute bunnies even though animals, however
    cute, can plausibly attack. As a result, semantic networks are far more
    likely to settle into pit bull agent and cute bunny patient attractor basins,
    and only the great force of SVO canonical order in English can
    overcome this tendency. Note also that the object of "attacked"
    expectably modifies the semantic representation of the verb (the
    relations between nouns and verbs are two-way streets). Without this
    modification, there might not be such great distortion of the cute bunny
    attractor basin (Contrast "The cute bunny attacked the carrot').
    
    To the degree that two noun concepts in a sentence have similar
    featural plausibility and attractor basin compatibility, one would expect
    competition for thematic role assignment (see Saffran, Schwartz, and
    Linebarger 1998). This competition may be augmented or reduced by
    grammatic factors, exemplifying the principle of parallel constraint
    satisfaction achievable in neural network architectures. One would also
    expect that with grammatic impairment, semantic influences would be
    exaggerated in language-specific fashion. This has been borne out
    repeatedly in studies of subjects with grammatic impairment, in whom,
    for example, animacy effects are exaggerated (see chapter 4,
    "Grammatic Morphology—Cross-Linguistic Aphasia Studies" section).
  - |-
    Attractor basin compatibility is a subtle affair. This has been extensively investigated as reflected in a now sizable literature on what has been termed affordances (see Borghi and Riggio 2009). This literature provides further evidence that in a sentence, verbs are engaged automatically as the predicative components of nouns, thereby creating a superdistributed representation and a modification of the noun concept (e.g., "shooter old man'). The concept of affordances includes both featural plausibility and attractor basin compatibility. Because a door handle affords opening by an adult, the implementational representation of grasping has both featural plausibility and attractor basin compatibility with both handle and adult person and thus would likely prime both. A door handle would not afford opening for a baby (babies can grasp but not door handles to open a door) or for a tree (which cannot grasp). Thus, grasp a door handle has featural plausibility but little attractor basin compatibility with baby, and it lacks featural plausibility for tree. An object representation, whether engaged bottom-up by seeing the object or top-down, engages a predicative component corresponding to a verb, which, in turn, can engage other objects, paralleling affordances. Affordances have been most extensively studied for verbs that have an implementational component (as in the examples above).
  - |-
    The subtlety and detail involved in the cascading semantic representations related to affordances is nicely illustrated in a series of experiments carried out by Borghi and Riggio (2009). Normal subjects were presented with short sentences such as "Look at/grasp the brush" followed by a picture of an object. The object could be the same as or different from the named object, and it could be shown in a typical (canonical) or atypical orientation. The dependent variable was response time (RT) to signal whether the named and the pictured object were the same. Borghi and Riggio found shorter RTs for action compared to observation verbs, presumably reflecting the power of the implementational component of the verb representation to prime the object representation. They found that RTs for canonical object representations were shorter, presumably reflecting the fact that the priming value of the implementational component of the named verb was maximal when this component was identical in orientation to the implementational component of the verb naturally predicated by the pictured object, that is, when orientation maximized attractor basin compatibility. In other words, the sentence engaged a particular modification of the implementational component of the verb, and RTs were shorter when that particular modification matched the canonical predicative representation of the pictured object. They found that different objects susceptible to precisely the same action in the same orientation were associated with particularly long RTs, presumably reflecting the fact that the implementational component of the verb primed two competing object representations. These results nicely demonstrate the exquisite contextual precision of the predication supplied by verbs and, in turn, the degree to which the meaning of words is always susceptible to influence by context, and they provide insight into why this is so. This is yet another phenomenon readily accommodated by architectures employing population encoding of representations.
    
    Abstract Nouns and Verbs
  - |-
    To this point, I have focused on semantic representations of concrete nouns and verbs and their interactions. In doing so, I have failed to address the representation of an enormous class of nouns and verbs that cannot readily be defined in terms of granular distributed representations over component features. This is a serious enough omission in and of itself. However, wrapped up in it is a failure to deal explicitly with a key principle of the cerebral representation of knowledge.

    In earlier discussion, transitive verb representations were posited to
    involve the creation of superdistributed representations that incorporated
    two or more noun concept representations, bound together and
    reciprocally modified by the verb representation. This process represents
    the ad hoc creation of a contextual association instantiating verb
    meaning. Is this process unique to transitive verbs, or is it exemplary of
    a general principle of cerebral operation? Emerging evidence from the
    comparative study of concrete and abstract words in normal and aphasic
    subjects favors the latter because it demonstrates the operation of a
    contextual association mechanism in the representation of another,
    completely different class of words—abstract nouns (Crutch, Connell,
    and Warrington 2009; Crutch and Warrington 2005, 2007). This research
    suggests that concrete words are related to the extent that they share
    features ("taxonomic similarity") whereas abstract words are related to
    the extent that they share contextual association. Thus, in an odd-one-
    out task, normal subjects are quicker to pick out the concrete word that
    differs substantially in semantic features (e.g., yacht, dinghy, bracelet,
    canoe, ferry, barge) than they are to pick out the concrete word that
    differs substantially in semantic association (e.g., garden, trellis, weed,
    rake, lawn, wallet; Crutch, Connell, and Warrington 2009). In contrast,
    normal subjects are quicker to pick out the abstract word that differs
    substantially in semantic association (e.g., gamble, casino, poker,
    chance, luck, public) than they are to pick out the abstract word that
    differs substantially in semantic features (e.g., attack, raid, strike,
    notice, invasion, assault). The same phenomenon is evident in subjects with
    aphasia. In subjects with semantic access refractory dysphasia, in whom
    there is an interference effect between related words processed in close
    temporal proximity, the interference is greater with contextually
    associated abstract words (e.g., theft, punishment), but it is greater with
    concrete words sharing semantic features (e.g., tractor, lorry; Crutch and
    Warrington 2005, but see Hamilton and Coslett 2008). Among subjects
    with aphasia who, in priming studies, show semantic facilitation (e.g.,

    Subjects with deep dyslexia), facilitation occurs with abstract words only when they are related by contextual association whereas facilitation occurs with concrete words only when they share semantic features (Crutch and Warrington 2007). Furthermore, semantic paralexias for concrete words in subjects with deep dyslexia often share semantic features (e.g., coast — seashore) whereas paralexias for abstract words
    
    more often involve contextual associates (e.g., evidence — police; Crutch 2006).
    
    Words whose meaning is distinguished from that of other words in terms of differences in semantic features (i.e., concrete words) can be represented within a single neural network (e.g., a dog within a network instantiating visual knowledge of animals). In contrast, words whose meaning is distinguished from that of other words in terms of differences in semantic association based on knowledge of contexts (i.e., abstract words) must be represented to a substantial degree through links between representations in different neural networks. Consequently, abstract word processing may be to a greater degree dependent on ability to form working associations (which might entail prefrontal mechanisms, in analogy to working memory) and may be more susceptible to white matter disease. In addition, the meaning of abstract words may be to a greater degree dependent on a limbic representational component (a subjective feeling about the meaning of the word); an element of theme (hence a prefrontal representation), as with words such as destiny and allegiance; or drawing of an inference, which might logically engage prefrontal mechanisms. The necessarily multifocal representation of knowledge supporting abstract words may make them more resistant to the effects of lesions that damage networks that are particularly crucial to meaning of particular classes of concrete words (so long as prefrontal cortex is spared), hence the reversed concreteness effect observed in subjects with semantic dementia (Breedin, Saffran, and Coslett 1994) in whom visual and auditory association cortices are particularly severely damaged.

    These differences in the neural instantiation of the meaning of concrete and abstract words account for another differential property of these word classes. Concrete words commonly have subordinate and superordinate exemplars, reflecting the intrinsically hierarchical nature of knowledge instantiated in auto-associator networks (see figure 2.3). By contrast, abstract words, while far less likely to have superordinate or subordinate exemplars, are far more likely to have associations grounded in contextual experience such as synonyms and antonyms (Crutch and Warrington 2005).
    
    These considerations suggest that the contextual association of noun concept representations as working associations reflects a fundamental brain process that subserves the production and comprehension of both verbs and abstract nouns.
    
    Lexical Instantiation of Verbs: The Relationship between Modified Concept Representations and Morphologic and Phonologic Sequence Representations
    
    Having sketched out the representation of verb meaning and its relationship to noun concept representations, it is now appropriate to delineate the relationship between the distributed representations of verb meaning and their corresponding phonologic representations—that is, the lexical representation of verbs—and more generally, the relationships between the superdistributed concept representations that lie at the heart of the concept stream (equation 3.2) and the domains of morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge that ultimately enable language output (equation 3.3; table 3.1).

    First, we will briefly consider the anatomy involved. The evidence, as discussed and to be further elaborated in chapter 4, is that concept representations are highly distributed throughout the association cortices of the brain. This is now widely known and accepted for noun semantic representations, but it is also true, as we have seen, for verb semantic representations, even though they serve only to predicate noun representations. This widely distributed representation of verbs, as for nouns, is linked to perisylvian cortices, particularly the left, via fan-like arrays of white matter originating broadly over convexity cortices and terminating in perisylvian regions, left more than right? These fan arrays, which instantiate lexical knowledge, may have multiple points of termination in perisylvian cortex (e.g., the two routes for naming concepts—figures 2.1 and 2.5—and verb past tense formation—see chapter 4). Similar, but likely somewhat more limited arrays probably provide the basis for instantiation of tense and aspect in grammatic morphology. The fan arrays also create a major potential for disconnection of semantic cortices from perisylvian cortices, creating semantic—morphologic/phonologic (lexical) deficits. The — spatial dispersion of the fan arrays creates susceptibility to the development of domain-specific deficits (e.g., deficits in production but not comprehension; deficits in spoken but not written language—also discussed in more detail below). Ischemic lesions due to MCA distribution infarction tend to be maximal in the perisylvian region—hence the particular vulnerability of phonology and morphology in perisylvian aphasias (Wernicke's, conduction, Broca's). However, these lesions are also particularly likely to damage perisylvian components of the fan arrays, yielding lexical deficits. Association cortices supporting semantic knowledge will be variably affected to the extent that the infarcts involve the hemispheric convexity. By contrast, dementias—Alzheimer's disease, progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia—maximally involve cortices supporting semantic knowledge, and both the white matter of the fan arrays and perisylvian cortices tend to be affected.

The text may contain formatting errors or misspellings, but the content itself seems to be referring to a comparison between two conditions—semantic dementia and PNFA (Progressive Non-Fluent Aphasia)—in terms of how certain aspects are "relatively spared."

    **"To be relatively spared (most in semantic dementia, least in PNFA)."**
    
    This sentence suggests that a particular cognitive or linguistic function is more preserved (i.e., less affected) in patients with semantic dementia compared to those with progressive non-fluent aphasia. If you have more context or additional text, I can help further clarify or correct it.

    Returning now to function, I have argued that a verb can be understood as a kind of adjective. Consistent with this idea, the lexicalization of verb-induced modifications of noun concept representations involves essentially the same processes as the lexicalization of adjectival modifications of noun concept representations. The concept representation of "dog" elicits, via connections between the substrate for the concept representations and the substrate for phonologic representations (which instantiates phonologic sequence knowledge), a single phonologic representation /dawg/. The connections between the concept representation substrate and the phonologic representation substrate instantiate semantic–phonologic (lexical) knowledge. In English, modification of "dog" to create the concept "dogs" elicits, through the interaction of the modified concept representation with phonologic sequence knowledge, a single phonologic sequence /dawgz/ that involves appendage of the suffix /z/. If the original concept were "man," now made plural, the interaction with the domain of phonologic sequence knowledge would yield the irregular phonologic form, /men/. Modification of the concept "dog," adding both plurality and the feature "blackness" generates two simultaneous phonologic forms /blek/ and /dawgz/, the temporal order of which is constrained by the interaction between the concept representation (which does not impute sequence) and the perisylvian domains of morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge (see table 3.1). In Spanish, the corresponding two-word sequence is /peros negros/, the interaction between the concept representation and the domain of morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge constraining /negros/ to follow /peros/, and the interaction between the concept representation "black dogs" and phonologic sequence knowledge yielding addition of the terminal affix /s/ to both words, thereby also instantiating agreement. Adjectival modification thus commonly results in transforming a single concept representation into two words. The addition of further specified features to the same concept representation may result in that representation's being represented phonologically by an almost arbitrarily large number of words, each corresponding to a separate added concept feature, as we saw in the Uriah Heep used-car salesman example. Many words may lie between the phonologic representation of the particular feature and the phonologic representation of the targeted
  - |-
    noun concept representation. As we shall see, all of these various  
    phenomena—one modified concept representation eliciting two or more  
    phonologic forms; modifications of a concept representation leading to a  
    different phonologic form (man — men); modifications leading to  
    suffixation of the phonologic form of the concept representation, and in  
    many languages, the phonologic forms corresponding to the added  
    features; constraints on suffixation that instantiate agreement; and  
    separation of the phonologic form of specified features and the  
    phonologic form of the core concept representation by one or more  
    intervening phonologic forms—all of these phenomena may also be  
    observed with verb modification of a core concept representation and by  
    similar means: interaction of the concept representations with the  
    substrates for morphologic sequence knowledge and phonologic  
    sequence knowledge.

    Verb modification of the concept representation of "dog" to add the feature "eats" results in a single modified concept representation that translates, via the substrate for semantic—phonologic (lexical) knowledge, to the substrate for phonologic sequence knowledge, to yield /dawg its/. Adding the plural feature leads, via the same mechanism, to /dawgz it/, that is, two suffixal modifications (reminiscent of perros negros in Spanish), instantiating the limited noun—verb person agreement of English and reflecting the interaction of the revised concept representation with the domains of morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge. Just as when adjectival features are added to noun concept representations, in some languages under some or all circumstances there must be agreement between the phonologic representations of the two, so too when concept representations are modified by verb features, yielding the instantiation of person marking of verbs. There are language-specific caveats, however: for example, person marking of the verb occurs in English only when the concept representation acquiring the verb feature also has the agentive feature.
    
    Just as adding an adjectival feature to a concept representation may lead to a different phonologic form (not simply affixation), so too can adding a verb feature to a concept representation, hence in Spanish (a "pro-drop" language), "he" modified to be eating becomes /kome/, a phonologic form that just happens to resemble that of the verb feature /komer/ much more than that of the concept, in this case /el/.
    
    Just as addition of adjectival features to concept representations may generate corresponding phonologic representations that are separated by many intervening words, so too can this be the case with the addition of verb features.
    
    Thus, the processes involved in achieving phonologic forms of concept representations modified by adjectival and verb features are substantially identical. In both cases, these processes entail interaction of concept representations, semantic-phonologic and semantic—morphologic (lexical) knowledge, morphologic sequence knowledge, and phonologic sequence knowledge. The differences in the handling of adjectival and verbal modifications reflect the language-specific knowledge acquired in each of these domains in the process of language acquisition.
  - |-
    Comprehension of spoken language reflects in a broad sense the reverse of these processes, although more so in terms of what initiates them than in terms of the neural activity that likely transpires. However, it is worth briefly considering the details of comprehension. Phonologic representations of the nouns in a sentence elicit the concept representations. Adjectives generally add features to the concept representation corresponding to the noun phonologic form in closest temporal proximity. In English, in which SVO word order is the overwhelming canonical form and case marking is largely absent (isolated to pronouns), the first noun concept representation in the sentence normally automatically acquires the feature of agency, allowing scant opportunity for influence by person marking or animacy. In Italian, in which there is only slight word order preference, agency is conferred predominantly by the person marking of the verb and, in cases of ambiguity, the animacy of the nouns. To the extent that there is compatibility between the person marking of the verb and the meaning feature added by the verb, on the one hand, and the features of one of the noun concept representations on the other (featural plausibility, attractor basin compatibility), that concept representation will acquire both the verb feature and the feature of agency. In some case marking languages, appropriate suffixation of the noun and/or its articles may also confer the feature of agency to the concept representation (other case marking languages rely primarily on accusative case marking). Thus, in comprehension, word order, verb person marking, case marking, and animacy may compete in conferring the feature of agency (or theme, patient, or experiencer) to one of the concept representations. This competition is played out neurally via the links between the substrates for morphologic and phonologic representations and the substrate for concept representations. It will be considered in much more detail below (in the "Competition Model" section).
  - |-
    The complex processes discussed in the foregoing, simultaneously involving multiple constraint systems, may seem highly implausible if viewed in terms of linear sequential information-processing models such as that of Garrett (1976). However, neural processes are fast relative to language processes. Transmission of an action potential from a neuron in association cortex to perisylvian cortex supporting phonologic function could occur in less than one millisecond. Even speaking 300 words a minute allows 200 milliseconds per word and several seconds per sentence. This provides the opportunity for very large numbers of repeated bottom—up/top—down processing interactions to occur in the formation of the phonologic form of a sentence from duly modified concept representations, or the formation of duly modified concept representations from an input phonologic stream. It is this very large number of interactions that enables simultaneous parallel application of the constraints provided by the working and episodic memory of the input and the knowledge latent in the connectivity underlying concept representations, semantic—phonologic (lexical) knowledge, morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge. The gradual settling of patterns of neural activity in the substrates for concept representations and phonologic representations into a final stable state represents the final outcome of the battle of the constraints. A precisely analogous process has been demonstrated neurophysiologically in the generation of movements by corticomotoneurons in the precentral gyrus via alpha motoneurons in the spinal cord, simultaneously engaging the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem reticular motor systems (Porter and Lemon 1993).
    
    Before moving on to a consideration of the domains of sequence knowledge that are essential to the realization of the concept stream over time (equation 3.2) and language output (equation 3.3), I am going to make a brief digression to discuss two other very important classes of words, prepositions and pronouns.
    
    Prepositions
    
    Locative
    
    Locative prepositions can occur in a variety of contexts: as adjunctive phrases to intransitive verbs, for example,
    
    ‘He sleeps on the floor'
    or as adjectival phrases qualifying a noun phrase, for example,
    "The rosemary is in the cabinet over the stove."
  - |-

    In these two examples, the modification created by the locative preposition is highly asymmetrical—‘He' and ‘rosemary' are modified to a far greater degree than ‘floor,' ‘cabinet,' or ‘stove.' However the modification may be more symmetrical, for example,
    
    ‘Helen stands beside Mary.'
    ‘The house sits under a live oak.'
    ‘A live oak arches over the house.'
    
    These examples show that locative prepositions resemble main verbs in that they reciprocally modify two arguments and bind them to one another. In some languages (e.g., German), they also, like verbs, determine case marking (Bastiaanse et al. 2003).
    
    On the other hand, locative prepositions differ in several important respects from verbs:
    
    1. They confer a semantic relationship, but they do not assign thematic roles, at least in the sense that verbs do.
    
    2. Because they do not assign thematic roles, while they add a predicative feature of sorts to their nouns, it is not one that imputes a plan.
    
    3. They are unlikely to prime their arguments in the way that verbs do. As we noted above ("Semantic Contributions to Syntax" section, "Relations between Nouns and Verbs" subsection), verb priming patterns provide an automatic cue to the relationships between their arguments. On the other hand, the engagement of representations corresponding to prepositions and their relationships to their arguments may benefit from figure—ground relationships (e.g., "The spoon is in the cup," but not vice versa) or directionality of relationship (e.g., "The bicycle is next to the garage" but not "The garage is next to the bicycle") that are intrinsic to their argument representations (Miozzo, Fischer-Baum, and Postman 2008).
    
    4. They denote a static relationship, in contrast to action verbs (which denote a dynamic relationship), and therefore might be expected to be represented in "where" pathway parietal regions dorsal to temporoparietal regions of the brain involved in movement perception and processing, which make a major contribution to the flavor component of many verbs (an idea originally proposed by Landau and Jackendoff 1993).
  - |-
    5. They are generally of higher frequency and, therefore, likely to be more redundantly represented in brain connectivity than most verbs.
    
    Obligatory
    
    Obligatory prepositions are prepositions that bear an obligatory relationship to a verb or noun. For example,
    
    (1) "She talks to her mother daily."
    
    Crucially for our discussion here, the preposition modifies the verb.
    Contrasting
    
    (2) "He talks constantly"
    
    it becomes clear that, in sentence (1), "talks to" means more or less
    "converses with" whereas "talks" in (2) describes an irritating behavior.
    
    Obligatory prepositions can also modify nouns (e.g., "at risk," "on
    alert," "in trouble," or "in June"). There may exist fundamental semantic
    dimensions that motivate these word pairings (Kranjec et al. 2010).
    However, it seems more likely that they originated in use conventions
    that developed in the course of the evolution of the English language.
    
    Obligatory prepositions are traditionally distinguished from particles,
    which by linguistic definition cannot head a phrase, for example,
    
    "Watch out for snakes"
    whereas
    *"Out for snakes watch"
    
    is ungrammatical. However, this turns out to be a language-specific
    phenomenon, suggesting that this distinction does not reflect a
    fundamental brain principle but only acquired implicit knowledge of a
    regularity. For example,
    
    ‘Peters calls upon the student.'
    ‘Upon the student Peter calls.'
    But in German,
    
    "Peter ruft den Schiiler auf."
    
    ** Auf den Schiiler ruft Peter."
    
    Thus, obligatory prepositions in one language may function like
    particles in another. Both modify the meaning of the verb and the
    language-specific patterns of use reflect a quasi-regular sequence
    domain established during language acquisition. For these reasons, one
    would expect these types of prepositions to be particularly vulnerable to
    lesions that damage the substrates for verb meaning and morphologic
    sequence knowledge.
  - |-
    Personal Pronouns  
    Personal pronouns can be understood as concept representations that are  
    modified in such a way that they elicit, via connections to perisylvian  
    cortex, one of a limited number of closed class words that capture the  
    case, number, gender, and reference of the concept even as the specific  
    phonologic representation of the concept is no longer engaged. This  
    mechanistic hypothesis predicts that noun concept representations will  
    prime their corresponding pronoun phonologic representations. This has  
    been shown (Rigalleau and Caplan 2000, 2004).
    
    The production of pronouns thus requires the capacity for concept  
    manipulation, and it also requires working memory (selective  
    engagement) capacity and hippocampal capacity and connectivity with  
    cortex, not only to maintain the concept being manipulated but also to  
    maintain concepts engaged in immediately preceding conversation, which provide the basis for reference. The more sustained selective  
    engagement underlying reference is reflected in experiments in which  
    the latency of pronoun reading is tested in sentences like the following  
    (Rigalleau and Caplan 2000, 2004):
    
    (1) "Tom questioned Sue because he wanted to learn the truth."  
    (2) "Tom questioned Sam because he wanted to learn the truth."
    
    In sentence type 1, in which the differing genders of the two nouns  
    create competing priming effects ("he" vs. "she"), reading latencies are  
    prolonged.
    
    Finally, the selection and placement of pronouns is influenced by  
    constraints on sequence at the sentence level, which include goal-  
    directed (endogenous) and perceptually driven (exogenous) elicitation of  
    concept representations, situation-specific factors that influence choices  
    in sentence structure, and sentence-level sequence habits (quasi-regular  
    sequence domains defined by language experience; see the "Syntax:  
    Sequence at the Sentence Level" section below).  
    Damage to the neural substrate for any of these various mechanisms  
    might be expected to interfere with pronoun production. Because, for  
    the most part, these mechanisms are likely instantiated in prefrontal  
    cortex, one would predict differential impairment in personal pronoun  
    generation with Broca's aphasia and in subjects with frontal lesions—a  
    prediction largely borne out by evidence from aphasia (see below).
    
    Sequence: The Basis of Syntax
  - |-
    In the following sections I will focus on sequence knowledge in its various forms—filling in the remaining variables of equations 3.2 and 3.3. It is the interface of suitably modified distributed concept representations with sequence knowledge domains that provides the intrinsic basis for language as a dynamic entity, whether as a concept stream (equation 3.2) or actual language output (equation 3.3). Although grammatic sequence knowledge was first introduced in equation 3.2 in the form of sentence-level sequence knowledge, I am going to start this discussion with the more local sequence knowledge that constrains phrase structure and grammatic morphology (equation 3.3) as it provides a better vehicle for introducing the concept.
    
    Phrase Structure Rules, Grammatic Morphology, and the Competition Model
    
    Phrase Structure Rules
  - |-
    One of the most remarkable attributes of words in spoken language is their consistent respect for phrase structure rules: for example, articles always precede and never follow nouns. Only in the occasional jargon aphasic does this rule seem to be broken, and even then it is far from clear whether inappropriate sequences emerge in continuous discourse or whether they result just by happenstance as a result of the juxtaposition of phrase fragments. Clearly these immutable phrase structure rules reflect some very fundamental and _ redundantly represented attributes of cerebral language networks that govern word sequence. To gain some insight into such network properties, I return to the pattern associator model of single-syllable word reading developed by Plaut and colleagues (Plaut et al. 1996; Seidenberg and McClelland 1989). Had the model been designed to accommodate multisyllabic words rather than only single-syllable words, we would have seen it acquire sequence knowledge about syllables, polysyllables, root forms, and affixes as they combine to form words, simply from its experience with English vocabulary. This sequence knowledge incorporates the sequential relationship of these various sublexical phoneme clumps to each other: the lexical equivalent of phrase structure rules. While phonologic sequence knowledge could capture sequences involving multiple morphemes, free or bound, I will assume here, as throughout the book, that there exists another domain of sequence knowledge at the local level—morphologic sequence knowledge (also supported by a pattern associator network), if for no other reason than that, in aphasia, disorders of phonologic and morphologic sequence may be dissociated (Miceli et al. 1983; Mimouni and Jarema 1997; Caramazza et al. 2000; Kaveé, Ze'ev, and Lev 2007; Maher et al. 1995), even as both knowledge domains are likely to be located in the perisylvian region, hence their disruption in the aphasias associated with perisylvian lesions (Broca's, conduction, Wernicke's). The exact relationship between these two domains of sequence knowledge is unknown.
  - |-
    The inferential leap we need to make in considering morphologic sequence knowledge is that sequential relationships between words are also represented in neural pattern associator networks, in the same way that sequential relationships between phonemes within words are represented. Notably, whether a given grammatic morpheme is free or bound is highly language dependent: linguistic units that tap multiword sequence knowledge in one language may tap within (affixal or infixal) morpheme sequence knowledge in another. The theory is that the pattern associator supporting morphologic sequence knowledge is a property-sequence transducer that translates concept representations modified in particular, class-specific ways, by adjectives, verbs (conferring flavor, implementation, and thematic role), and sentence context, into articulatory sequences comprising phrases incorporating various language-specific mixes of free and bound grammatic morphemes. The repertoire of available sequences and the knowledge of the implicit regularities within these sequences are acquired through extended experience with heard and spoken language. It might seem that, as the number of possible word sequences is virtually infinite, no system, even one comprised of tens of billions of units and ten thousand connections per unit, could possibly represent all the possibilities. However, the actual amount of information relevant to word sequence that is implicit in all the allowable word sequences comprising phrases (or their affixal morphemic counterparts in agglutinative languages) is actually much less than it seems and quite plausibly is incorporated within neural connectivity. This is because word sequence information implicitly incorporates rules governing the order of classes of morphemes, precisely as a multisyllabic phonemic processor would implicitly incorporate rules about the placement of suffixes and prefixes and a single-syllable phonemic processor implicitly instantiates rules of phonemic sequence.* Thus, in English, words that have the attribute of modifying the distributed representation of a concept in a static way (adjectives) uniformly precede nouns and knowledge about the proper order of adjective-noun sequences simply emerges from the network's experience with heard and written English.
  - |-
    How long are the word sequences that are likely to be entrained by  
    the morphologic pattern associator network contemplated here? The  
    answer is not known. Elman (1992) has shown, in computer simulations,  
    that experientially acquired sequence knowledge can instantiate not just  
    phrase structure rules but principles underlying person marking and  
    embedded clause construction. This suggests that the capacity of neural  
    networks instantiating word sequence knowledge may be quite  
    substantial. There is some evidence that the length of commonly used  
    sequences that are encoded grows with practice through the life span.  
    Elderly people are relatively more likely than younger people to develop  
    Wernicke's aphasia and relatively less likely than younger people to  
    develop Broca's aphasia, whether the lesion is due to stroke, neoplasm,  
    or trauma (Basso et al. 1987; Brown and Grober 1983; Kertesz and  
    Sheppard 1981; Miceli et al. 1981). One possible explanation for this is  
    that elderly people are more able to maintain reasonable fluency given a  
    frontal lobe lesion because of the repertoire of word sequence  
    knowledge they retain in the substantially posterior perisylvian  
    morphologic pattern associator network I have described. Only when the  
    lesion directly affects this pattern associator does aphasia result, and  
    then it is a Wernicke's aphasia or a conduction aphasia, reflecting the  
    impairment in sequence knowledge. By contrast, younger people are to  
    a greater degree dependent on sentence-level sequence knowledge,  
    which is more substantially frontally represented, hence their greater  
    propensity for developing Broca's aphasia with left MCA territory  
    infarcts. This explanation does not presume superior syntactic capability  
    by elderly subjects (the evidence is to the contrary), only greater  
    reliance on a particular repository of knowledge than in the young.  
    Another possible explanation for the greater relative incidence of  
    Wernicke's aphasia in the elderly is that through the life span, one may  
    develop more substantial nondominant-hemisphere morphologic  
    sequence knowledge—in effect an elaboration of this hemisphere's  
    normal capacity for nonpropositional language that endows it with a  
    property of propositional language—access to items within word  
    sequences. These nondominant-hemisphere capabilities may compensate

    for deficits stemming from left-hemisphere damage. However, while
    this knowledge may be adequate to preserve sequence, it may not be
    adequate to ensure correct morpheme selection within sequence—hence
    paragrammatic errors (in direct analogy to the phonologic paraphasias
    stemming from inadequately developed nondominant-hemisphere
    phonologic sequence knowledge shown by the patient described in
    chapter 2, "Lexicons" section). The extraordinary resilience of word
    order in phrase structure and grammatic morpheme order (free or
    bound) that has been revealed by cross-linguistic studies of aphasia (see
    below) provides strong evidence of bihemispheric instantiation of this
    sequence knowledge.
    
    Grammatic Morphology
    
    Grammatic morphology subsumes free grammatic morphemes, for
    example, articles, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, some prepositions, and
    bound grammatic morphemes, in most languages affixes specifying
    case, number, person, or tense, whose role appears to be primarily
    grammatical. The following subsection on articles will serve to
    introduce some of the basic ideas. The major theme will be that
    grammatic morphology reflects the interaction between lexical input via
    the fan arrays and morphologic sequence knowledge. A full
    understanding of the neural principles underlying grammatic
    morphology cannot be achieved without knowledge of the competition
    model (see the next major section) and data from aphasia, reviewed in
    chapter 4.
    
    Articles
  - |-
    Sure, here is the corrected and properly formatted text:
    
    As for phrase structure rules, representations of articles are engaged to
    some degree by virtue of their incorporation in morphologic sequence
    knowledge. In addition, although articles in English have minimal
    meaning, they cannot be characterized as having no meaning
    whatsoever: they do indicate definite or indefinite. However, as
    modifiers in noun phrases, they differ from adjectives in that their
    meaning is contextual whereas the meaning of adjectives is more nearly
    absolute. That is, whether the article "a" or "the" is used depends upon
    the preceding discourse; in contrast, the use of an adjective such as
    "big" depends primarily on the attributes of the noun distributed
    representation it is linked to. Thus, in part, the use of articles depends on
    the maintenance of some working and episodic memory of what has
    already been said, that is, sustained selective engagement and recall of
    immediately preceding distributed concept representations and their
    relationship to each other. Finally, to the extent that articles are marked
    in any given language (e.g., for case, number, or gender), their
    representations in phonologic networks will receive additional
    engagement by modifications of concept representations that
    operationally define case, number, and gender. This engagement occurs
    via the fan array connections between the substrate for concept
    representations (association cortices) and the substrate for morphologic
    sequence knowledge (perisylvian cortex). In languages characterized by
    extensive marking, gender can be viewed as an intrinsic feature of a
    concept representation whereas case and number derive from situation-
    specific modifications of a concept representation. Nevertheless,
    recruitment of the phonologic representation of the correctly marked
    articles occurs by the same mechanism for all three—the links between
    the substrate for concept representations and morphologic sequence
    knowledge.
    
    In summary, article expression is supported by (1) morphologic
    sequence knowledge, (2) working memory of what has already been
    said, (3) the concept modification achieved by the article (definite or
    indefinite), and (4) to the extent that there is case, number, and gender
    marking, semantic—phonologic/morphologic (lexical) knowledge
    instantiated in links between the modified concept representation of the
    associated noun and the phonologic representation of the article.
    
    Syntactic-Morphologic Words

    There are circumstances in which words appear to play a purely
    syntactic role, in which case the knowledge that supports them could be
    characterized as syntactic-morphologic (lexical). In sentences
    employing complementizers, such as "He remembered to..." and "She
    believes that...," the use of "to" and "that" can be viewed as a reflection
    of syntactic-morphologic knowledge (instantiated through connectivity
    between the substrate for sentence-level sequence knowledge and the
    substrate for phonologic and morphologic representations), but in these
    two examples there is likely to be substantial support from phrase
    sequence knowledge (e.g., remembered to/that/how; believes that/in). In
    English, this knowledge is not strongly represented, with the result that
    it is often permissible to omit the complementizer (the so-called empty
    complementizer).
    
    The Competition Model
    
    MacWhinney and Bates (Bates and MacWhinney 1989; MacWhinney
    1987) proposed a model to account for normal language function and
    language acquisition in all languages in terms of the statistical influence
    of underlying constraint systems, known as the competition model.
    Since its original conceptualization, the model has been used to account
    for cross-linguistic differences in the breakdown of syntax and
    grammatic morphology in aphasia (Bates and Wulfeck 1989). This
    model, together with the extensive empirical studies it has inspired
    (particularly those involving cross-linguistic studies; MacWhinney and
    Bates 1989), likely constitutes the single most important extant
    contribution to our current understanding of the neural foundation of
    grammatic function. As an associative, probabilistic model, it is
    intrinsically compatible with neural network formulations in general (as
    suggested by Bates, Wulfeck, and MacWhinney 1991), as well as with
    the specific formulation proposed here. By the same token, the many
    empirical studies that provide support for the competition model
    implicitly support the neural network model I have introduced.
    Therefore, it is worth explicitly recasting the major components of this
    model in neural network terms (see table 3.2).

    Neural Correlate  
    
    A given cue is unreliable to the extent that it  
    elicits competing concept representations or  
    competing regularities within quasi-regular  
    domains. That is, a given cue is unreliable to the  
    extent that it engages two or more attractor  
    subbasins or two or more attractor subtrenches.  
    
    Inconsistently available features create  
    potentially competing neural representations—  
    for example, with "He eats" versus " He must  
    eat," the morpheme "s" is not consistently  
    available to signify third person singular.  
    Hearing "eat" therefore engages multiple  
    concept representations including "I" and "they"  
    (a cue reliability issue) but also "he" under some  
    circumstances—for example, with a modal (a  
    cue availability issue). In production, "He"  
    elicits representations of both "eat" and "eats."  
    In neural network terms, inconsistent cue  
    availability has the same effect as cue  
    unreliability: engagement of two or more  
    attractor subbasins or two or more attractor  
    subtrenches corresponding to competing  
    regularities within quasi-regular domains.  
    
    In some languages, important cues are provided  
    only in the written form, and in others, they may  
    be sufficiently unstressed that they may not be  
    perceived by the listener. If a disambiguating  
    cue is not perceived, then competition between  
    two or more neural representations (e.g.,  
    attractor subbasins or subtrenches) may persist  
    unless or until some other cue, in the sentence or  
    in the context, leads to disengagement of all but  
    one neural representation.

    In production, an unambiguous case marker immediately modifies a concept representation. In contrast, the agreement marker on a verb may be mis-selected if the length of the clause placed between the noun and the verb creates a demand for greater working/episodic memory capacity—with the consequence that the verb may be marked to modify the wrong noun concept representation or in a completely inscrutable way. In comprehension, time elapsed between noun and verb + agreement marker may weaken the association of the verb with the target noun representation. In neural network terms, engagement of specific attractor basins or subbasins or attractor trenches or subtrenches is time limited, depending as it does on the duration of selective engagement (working memory) or the robustness of episodic memory (hippocampally encoded).

  - |-
    The competition model proposes that production and comprehension of a given grammatical cue (i.e., mapping between phonological form and grammatical function) depend upon the difference between cue validity and cue cost. Cue validity refers to the informational value of a given phonological, lexical, morphological, or syntactic form in a particular language. Cue cost reflects the amount and type of processing associated with use of a given linguistic form. Cue validity is defined as the mathematical product of cue reliability and cue availability. Cue reliability is defined by the consistency of the relationship between the occurrence of a particular cue and the information it provides. For example, the "-s" ending in Spanish consistently marks the plural." However, in English, "-s" may mark the plural or the possessive. In neural network terms, cue reliability can be conceived in terms of competition between alternate patterns of activity defining different concept representations. In Spanish, hearing the "-s" ending elicits only one possible distributed concept representation (e.g., a modification of the representation of "dog" to make it multiple dogs). However, in English, the multiple dogs concept representation elicited by "dogs" has to compete with a completely different representation (e.g., "bowl" modified to be a dog's bowl). This competition reduces the strength of selective engagement of each of the two alternatives (relative to the single alternative in Spanish) and, in turn, requires reliance on additional cues to tip the balance of selective engagement in favor of one of the two competing concept representations. In general, cue reliability is reduced by the existence of multiple competing forms, either in different domains or within a quasi-regular domain—for example, competing pronunciations of "-own" in English (shown, blown, flown vs. crown, gown, town), competing regular and various irregular verb past tense forms, and competing habits of sequential concept expression and modification (e.g., in Dutch, the verb follows the subject in matrix sentences, but in embedded clauses, subject—object—verb [SOV] order is mandatory).
  - |-
    Cue availability represents the extent to which a cue is there when you need it: in the present context, to the consistency with which a particular feature appears as a grammatic marker. For example, the plural marker "-s" is consistently present in Spanish, regardless of the gender or case of the noun or the presence of modifying words. English provides a good example of an inconsistent marker—the third person singular verb inflection. This provides reliable information about the subject of a simple present tense sentence (e.g., "he eats," in contrast to "T eat"), but not when a modal is introduced (e.g., "he must eat" in contrast to "I must eat'), or when the past tense is used ("he ate" in contrast to "I ate"). In neural network terms, pluralizing a concept representation in Spanish elicits one and only one phonologic form, containing the terminal "-s." In Spanish, failure to hear the terminal "-s" elicits one single concept representation, which is singular. In English language production, modification of the third person singular concept representation by the verb may elicit several competing representations in networks supporting phonologic sequence knowledge (eat, eats, ate, in the example provided), thus reducing the strength of selective engagement of any one of them. It requires other influences (e.g., further modification of the concept representation to elicit the modal and the appropriate verb ending; or the addition of the concept of past tense) to achieve selection of the single correct verb ending, and it provides an opportunity for mis-selections. In English language comprehension, hearing "eat" potentially leads to a number of competing distributed concept representations corresponding to "I eat," "we eat," "they eat," "he must eat," "I must eat," "we must eat," "they must eat," and so on. Again, other pieces of information are required to engender engagement of one single distributed representation, and opportunity for error is created.

  - |-
    In the competition model, cue costs are defined by cue perceivability and cue assignability." The perceivability of a grammatical morphological cue, a factor only in comprehension, may be reduced if the cue consists of a single phoneme, it is in an unstressed syllable, it receives reduced prosodic stress, or it is completely silent.' If a cue is difficult to perceive, then a competition may be created between two or more alternative phonological forms, one the intended target, and alternatives that are in some sense defaults (e.g., most frequently used phonological, most frequently used grammatical, or the grammatical form that was partially engaged by what was heard up to the presentation of the signal cue).
      
    Cue assignability relates to the amount of information that must be held in working plus episodic memory to instantiate the cue. Thus, an unambiguous case marker immediately modifies a concept representation. On the other hand, correct employment or comprehension of grammatical morphemes instantiating noun—verb agreement may demand fairly prolonged recall if (1) one or more words, phrases, or clauses separate noun and verb, and these intervening items can elicit alternative noun concept representations that could compete with the intended representation in influencing the verb form, or (2) the listener has to hear the verb and all nouns in the sentence in order to make use of agreement cues (as in number agreement in the Italian third person).
      
    Finally, the competition model includes the concept of conflict validity. This refers to the idea that a sentence may carry conflicting cues and the "battle" between the cues will be influenced by the importance of these cues in a particular language. In English, the overwhelming dominance of the habit of sentence-level sequence corresponding to the SVO word order preference means that word order will tend to trump subject—verb agreement when agreement indicates that the subject follows the verb. However, in Italian, in which the SVO proclivity is weak, subject-verb agreement is much more likely to determine meaning, that is, which concept representation gets modified in what way.
  - |-
    The competition model is so-called because it posits variously competing roles of cue validity (determined by reliability and availability), cue cost (determined by perceivability and assignability), and conflict validity in determining form—function mapping. From the foregoing, it can be seen that this model is indeed eminently consistent with a neural network formulation (see table 3.2). It can also be seen that when it is reformulated in neural network terms, we might justifiably refer to the model as the (Competition) Model, because the competition that MacWhinney and Bates recognized is additionally neurologically realized as a competition between different concept representations and between different phonologic sequence and word sequence representations within quasi-regular domains (see table 3.1), all variously annealed by the passage of time, intervening linguistic experience, and recall of what has already been spoken and heard. In more general neural terms, the competition in the competition model corresponds to the process of parallel constraint satisfaction within and between interacting neural networks and between regularities within quasi-regular domains instantiated in attractor subbasins and subtrenches. The precise constraints brought to bear at any moment depend upon the specific situation and differ from language to language. Review of cross-linguistic data on aphasia (below) could lead us to refer to a (Competition) Model, because in the face of brain injury, language performance reflects the superior survival of functions that are more redundantly represented in neural connectivity, and functions that are distributed over larger brain regions, coupled with the property of graceful degradation, intrinsic to distributed representations, that tends to preserve function in the face of incomplete damage to the neural substrate underlying a representation. In effect, with brain damage, some of the players in the language competition have become injured. Which ones are injured depends upon the locus of the lesion and the areas of the brain involved in their function. Depending upon the language spoken, some players are better able to function despite injury, and some players are more important than others, and depending upon the specific language situation, the importance of particular players may be altered. Language production and comprehension in aphasia will, on average, reflect this new mix of strengths, weaknesses, and competitions.

    from different languages have learned, through extended experience, to
    play by different rules (the specific regularities within quasi-regular
    domains), and these rule differences govern the pattern of vulnerabilities
    of language function to particular injuries.
    
    Syntax: Sequence at the Sentence Level
    Producing a sentence involves (1) generating concept representations,
    (2) modifying them, and (3) assembling a sequence of representations
    that, translated via connections between association cortices and the
    perisylvian substrate for morphologic and phonologic representations
    (which incorporate local sequence knowledge), yields a grammatic
    sequence of words corresponding to a sentence and effectively
    conveying the intended meaning.
    
    Concept representations may be generated in reactive fashion, in
    response to perceptual input interacting with stored knowledge. They
    may also be generated volitionally on the basis of subjective choices
    driven by the orbitofrontal-limbic system constrained by stored
    knowledge and perceptual input. Inability to volitionally generate
    concept representations appears to be the fundamental mechanism of
    adynamic aphasia (Gold et al. 1997).
    
    Once generated, concept representations are modified in a variety of
    ways that are translated, via association cortex to perisylvian
    connections (the fan arrays), into modifications in sentence wording.
    Simple modifications translate into adjectives. Reciprocal modifications
    of two or more concept representations in a way that achieves
    assignment of thematic roles, confers flavor, and instantiates a dynamic
    plan translates into verbs. Binding and spatial linking of two concept
    representations may translate into locative prepositions. Modification of
    concept representations that reflects an explicit dependence on reference
    to prior expression of those concepts translates into personal pronouns.
    All of the processes of concept manipulation have major implications
    for sentence structure and sequence, some in particularly powerful ways
    —for example, the particular verb-associated constraints on concept
    manipulation that correspond to verb subcategorization requirements.
    The intrinsically serial processes of thinking and conversation also
    influence sentence sequence. Finally, the substrates for morphologic and
    phonologic sequence knowledge overwhelmingly determine word
    sequence at the local level—phrase structure and grammatic
    morphology—such that sequential rules governing phrase structure and
    free and bound grammatic morphology are rarely violated in aphasia.

    All this said, we are still left with sentence structure that is substantially underspecified. This is evident in the obligatorily more complex syntax of Italian, compared with English, related to the need to topicalize simple subject—object sentences (see the "Recursion" section below). Another example is the requirement in Dutch that the verb follow the subject in the matrix sentence but be placed at the end of an embedded clause (consequently, Dutch is characterized as a "verb second" language). Yet another is the dominance of SVO word order in English, in contrast to the much freer word order of other languages, most notably Italian. More generally, patterns of sentence production recapitulate the statistical distribution of sequence patterns characteristic of the language, and comprehension is slowed or degraded with sentences that represent outliers in this distribution (Gennari and MacDonald 2009). Clearly, at this point in our formulation of the neural basis for grammar, we are missing another domain of sequence knowledge—knowledge of sequence at the sentence level that complements other sources of sequence knowledge even as it serves to constrain, in language-specific ways, the processes of concept manipulation discussed above.
    
    How can such sequence constraints—habits of sequential concept manipulation and expression—be instantiated in neural network structure? While a full answer cannot be provided, discoveries in neural network systems dynamics have been quite propitious. In a context recall task involving repeated presentations of sequences of five stimuli to monkeys, the firing patterns of neurons in motor cortex evolved in a way that indicated robust instantiation of knowledge of serial order in neural connectivity (Carpenter, Georgopoulos, and Pellizer 1999). Carpenter et al. identified dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as likely being a major component in the distributed representation of this sequence knowledge, given other evidence of its key role in the capacity to act on the basis of serial order (Milner, Petrides, and Smith 1985; Petrides 1991, 1995).

    Syntax, a particular form of sequence constraint, has been of interest  
    to connectionist scientists for over 20 years. However, only a handful of  
    particularly relevant studies will be described here. Elman (1990)  
    reported a simulation involving a three-layered PDP network (in effect,  
    word—hidden units—word) in which input to the hidden units came from  
    both the word being presented and a set of "context units" representing  
    the state of the hidden units that had been elicited by the input of the  
    prior word. This architecture, known as a simple recurrent network (see  
    figure 3.1), enabled the network to learn sequence regularities in its  
    training corpus. A simple recurrent network is able to handle tasks, such  
    as sentence processing, in which input is provided gradually over time  
    rather than all at once. Elman's network was trained repeatedly on a  
    corpus of two-word (noun—verb) and three-word (noun—verb—noun)  
    sentences. Its task was to correctly predict the next word in the input  
    stream. The model ultimately demonstrated implicit knowledge of the  
    distinction between nouns and verbs, verb argument structure  
    (mandatory vs. optional transitive or intransitive), and implicit  
    knowledge of subclasses of nouns and verbs distinguished solely by the  
    regularities in their sequential relationship to each other (e.g., animates  
    typically precede verbs and inanimates are breakable or edible) and not  
    by any semantic input (which was not a component of the model).  
    Elman's simulation demonstrated that it is not necessary for a recurrent  
    network to learn every possible sequence in the training set to achieve  
    high ability to predict the next word. Rather, a very modest network can  
    be highly successful because, through its recurrent design, the network  
    acquires powerful knowledge of sequence regularities involving classes  
    of words. Furthermore, analysis of the hidden-unit activation vectors in  
    the model revealed knowledge of the hierarchy of constraints implicit in  
    the training sets, for example, verb argument structure > animacy as an  
    agentive feature > subregularities involving particular nouns and verbs,  
    such as that glass can be smashed but cookies are eaten.

    network. However, the context units represent the pattern of activity of the hidden-unit  
    layer extant at the previous processing cycle, when, for purposes of our discussion, the  
    previous word in a sequence was presented to the input layer. This endows the network  
    with a power to capture knowledge of sequence regularities that is far greater than that of a  
    simple pattern associator network, for example, that of the reading model of Plaut et al.  
    (1996) discussed early in the book.

    Joanisse and Seidenberg (2003) reported a simulation involving a three-layered recurrent PDP network (phonology—hidden — units— semantics) in which, during training, connection strengths were adjusted on the basis of present input, target output, and data reflecting up to ten previous inputs, thereby potentially instantiating implicit knowledge of sequence regularities involving much longer' sentences (see Pulvermiiller 2002 for a more extended discussion of the computational neuroscience). The network, through its experience with the statistical regularities of the data set, was able to acquire implicit knowledge of rules governing verb argument structure, subcategorization rules, preposition choice, and pronoun anaphora. St. John and Gernsbacher (1998) showed, in another recurrent network simulation involving learning of active and passive voice and cleft subject and object constructions, that frequency of exposure had a significant protective effect on network comprehension of particular constructions in the face of noise. Other simulation studies involving simple recurrent networks have demonstrated the power of these networks to acquire complex sequence knowledge from experience, including, for example, a capacity for recursion and for generalization of that knowledge (Cartling 2008). This PDP work provides a very strong proof of the principle that sentence-level constraints on sequence can be plausibly instantiated in neural network architecture. Empirical studies suggest that the brain may support an extraordinarily rich repertoire of sentence-level sequence knowledge and that because of extensive implicit knowledge of the statistical regularities of this sequence knowledge garnered through language experience, subtle variations may have strong implications for meaning (Roland, Elman, and Ferreira 2006; Gennari and MacDonald 2009). Extensive work remains to explore the specifics of this PDP approach applied to the enormous range of sequences seen in different languages, to further understand the basis for quasi-regular sequence domains and how subdomains within them compete, and to understand the consequences of graceful degradation in face of lesions.

    Some pioneering human studies have already been reported.  
    Thompson et al. (2003; see also Stadie et al. 2008) have reported a  
    syntactic treatment experiment that, although motivated by linguistic  
    theory, enables us to relate the results of the Joanisse and Seidenberg  
    simulation in a rather direct way to human acquisition of syntactic skills  
    and to put this within the more general context of neural network  
    support of language function. They trained four subjects with Broca's  
    aphasia to produce three sentence types, starting from active NP-V—NP  
    (NP = noun phrase; V = verb) sentences (e.g., The thief chased the  
    artist). The sentence types were: WH questions (Who has the thief  
    chased?), object clefts (It was the artist who the thief chased), and object  
    relatives (The man saw the artist who the thief chased). Two of the  
    Subjects were first trained to produce object relative sentences. These  
    two showed generalization to the production of object cleft sentences  
    and WH questions. Two of the subjects were trained first to produce the  
    WH questions. They showed no generalization to the other forms. These  
    results and those of prior studies along this line were interpreted as  
    providing support for the "complexity account" of treatment efficacy, in  
    which treatment focused on more complex forms results in  
    generalization to less complex forms requiring the same type of  
    movement. Another way of viewing these results is that Thompson et al.  
    were retraining an attractor trench involving a recurrent pattern  
    associator network with a sequence knowledge acquisition capacity  
    similar to that of the network employed by Joanisse and Seidenberg and  
    representing the general class of sequences represented by the sentence  
    types they studied. This pattern associator learns variations on a  
    particular theme of sequential concept manipulation (a quasi-regular  
    sequence domain) that, through fan array links to perisylvian cortex, can  
    enable production of the correct sequence of words. Training the pattern  
    associator with atypical ("complex") exemplars retrains network  
    connections that can support both the atypical sequence exemplars (e.g.,  
    object relatives) and exemplars close to the centroid of the attractor  
    trench (e.g., WH questions). Retraining WH questions succeeds in  
    retraining connections that can support sequences near the centroid but

    does little to tune connections that will support atypical exemplars more
    distant from the centroid, hence the absence of generalization.
    We have seen this before. Plaut (1996) trained a PDP network to
    name animals from semantic representations, damaged the network, and
    then showed in simulations that retraining with atypical exemplars
    (those far from the centroid of the animal attractor basin) facilitated
    naming of both typical and atypical animals whereas retraining with
    typical exemplars benefited naming only of typical exemplars. Kiran
    and Thompson (2003) subsequently replicated these results in a
    treatment study of subjects with aphasia. Thus, the complexity account
    of treatment efficacy corresponds directly to principles governing
    patterns of alterations in connection strengths that occur with retraining
    of damaged networks, whether they are networks supporting attractor
    trenches (representing knowledge underlying patterns of sequential
    concept manipulation) or attractor basins (supporting knowledge
    underlying concept domains) corresponding to quasi-regular sequence
    or concept domains, respectively.
  - |-
    The WH question/cleft object/object relative training experiment of Thompson and colleagues, detailed above, illustrates the impact of training a quasi-regular domain corresponding to a single attractor trench in various ways, and some of the constraints on generalization within such a trench. Other rehabilitation experiments by her group (Thompson, Shapiro, and Roberts 1993) illustrate the scope of quasi-regular sequence domains and demonstrate that superficially similar sequences can involve different attractor trenches, in which case there is no basis for generalization. Subjects with agrammatic aphasia can be trained on specific sequential concept manipulation skills and show generalization to different applications of these skills within a quasi-regular domain but not a generic improvement applying to multiple quasi-regular domains corresponding to multiple attractor trenches (see also Berndt and Mitchum 1998). Subjects with syntactic impairment trained to produce WH questions showed generalization to production of WHAT questions (both involve a verb that requires an agent and a theme) but not to production of WHEN or WHERE questions (in which the verb does not take a theme but may take an adjunctive phrase, e.g., "He is sleeping in the bedroom" — "Where is he sleeping?"). Subjects trained to produce WHEN questions showed generalization to WHERE questions (which also involve verbs that take adjunctive phrases) but not to WHO or WHAT questions. None of these subjects showed generalization to passive voice sentence production (Thompson, Shapiro, et al. 1997).
    
    The clearest demonstration of sentence-level sequence knowledge in nearly isolated form can probably be found in subjects with transcortical sensory aphasia. Their language can be highly fluent, and prosodic cues testify to its organization into sentences, even as it is almost utterly devoid of content because concept representations, however modified by adjectives and verbs, cannot be translated into words because of damage to posterior portions of the fan arrays.
  - |-
    This section has covered evidence of the existence of habits of sequential concept manipulation, the feasibility of support of such habits by the neural instantiation of recurrent neural networks, evidence of sequence knowledge in nonhuman primates, and sentence-level sequence knowledge in attractor trench terms. However, the language-specific scope and regularities of this knowledge, the manner and degree to which it interacts with other domains of knowledge, and the means and circumstances under which it is engaged are subjects of ongoing investigation.
    
    I have cited some of the most straightforward examples of this sequential knowledge: SVO word order in English and its systematic alteration in interrogative questions, the need for topicalization in Italian, and placement of verbs in Dutch. SVO in English and verb-second in Dutch provide the basis for automatic selection of well-worn grooves in attractor trenches corresponding to sentence-level sequence knowledge that eventuate in a standard word order as soon as the major noun concepts have acquired theta role attributes in the process of modification by verbs. In the comprehension process, these order habits also provide an instant cue to agency and to some extent by default, to other theta roles. Interrogative pronouns correspond to concept representations (who, what, why, where, how) that automatically engage appropriate sequence trenches in production.
    
    This sentence-level sequence regularity knowledge must interact with the thematic components of verb semantic knowledge because the latter incorporate sequence components such as the selectional restrictions governing verb argument structure and verb subcategorization information. Complicating matters, verb argument structures are to a limited extent optional and therefore influenced by the number of noun concept representations in play, and verb subcategorization choices reflect statistical patterns of use but also narrative context (Elman 2009; Wilson and Garnsey 2009). For example, consider
    
    "The boy heard the story."
    "The boy heard the story was interesting."
  - |-
    The way that "the story" is interpreted as the listener first hears it reflects the relative frequency with which "heard" occurs with a direct object (DO) or a sentential complement (SC); the relative frequency with which the verb takes an SC without a disambiguating "that"; the specific nature of the noun phrase; or in this case, the plausibility of the postverbal noun phrase as a DO. It can also be influenced by manipulation of the narrative context preceding the sentence (Elman 2009), echoes of which will be instantiated as working memories and hippocampal episodic memories.
    
    Animacy contrasts and type of verb (e.g., agent-theme vs. theme—experiencer) also influence both production and comprehension of sentence word order (Gennari and MacDonald 2009). For example, passive constructions are far more likely to be produced than object relative clauses in relative clause sentences involving theme—experiencer verbs, for example,
    
    "The director that was pleased by the movie..." >> "The director that the movie pleased..."
    
    whereas object relative clauses are more likely to be produced with agent—theme verbs, for example,
    
    "The movie that the director watched..." >> "The movie that was watched by the director..."
    
    On the other hand these patterns are affected by animacy contrasts. Active and passive voice constructions are equally likely with theme—experiencer verbs when there is no animacy contrast, for example,
    
    "The writer that the critic angered..." versus "The writer angered by the critic..."
    
    but passive voice constructions are far more likely with theme—experiencer relative clauses involving an animacy contrast, for example,
    
    "The writer angered by the review..." >> "The writer that the review angered..."
    
    Comprehension is slowed and degraded with sentences that are at odds with these statistical regularities (e.g., "The writer that the review angered..."; Gennari and MacDonald 2009).
    
    The general phenomena described here, and their implications for sentence-level sequence knowledge interactions in language processing, are involved in a broad range of sentence-level ambiguity resolution problems, perhaps the most famous and well studied being those posed by reduced relative clause sentences (see Elman 2009):
  - |-
    "The man who was arrested by the policeman was innocent"
    can be phrased as
    
    "The man arrested by the policeman was innocent."
    
    But we can also have
    
    "The man arrested the burglar."
    
    Thus, "The man arrested..." is ambiguous and susceptible to influence
    by the factors discussed in the foregoing.
    
    These examples are intended only as a hint of the scope of the
    problem of fully understanding sentence-level sequence knowledge and
    the dynamics of its interactive role in language processing. We can
    accept that the ultimate resolution of ambiguities reflects the process of
    parallel constraint satisfaction at which neural networks are intrinsically
    so adept, but it is the details of that constraint satisfaction that pose the
    scientific challenge.
    
    The aspect of syntax I have defined as sentence organization does not
    depend on the machinations of a sophisticated grammar processor.
    Rather it constitutes an emergent property of the distributed
    representations of concepts, the modification of concepts, the linking of
    concepts into superdistributed representations, the constraints of habits
    of sequential concept manipulation and expression, and the interaction
    of the network systems supporting these processes with the pattern
    associator networks defining morphologic and phonologic sequence, all
    occurring in different and often dynamic narrative contexts. Concept
    representations and their manipulations invoke association cortices
    throughout the brain, as well as subcortical structures such as the
    amygdala. Therefore, the ways in which concepts are handled provide a
    window to fundamental properties of higher brain function. The
    grammatic properties that are common to the vast number of languages
    spoken on our planet (the "universal grammar") reflect the fact that, as a
    first approximation, the basic structure and function of the entire
    cerebrum is the same in all human beings. On the other hand, because
    language production is a direct reflection of patterns of distributed
    concept manipulation, grammatic differences in language production
    provide a window to cultural, genetic, and even individual differences in
    the way people think (language unspoken is thought). In this
    conceptualization, syntax is a highly distributed language process—in
    sharp contrast to the hyperlocalized function that linguistically motivated theories of grammar have tended to promote.
  - |-
    This section has been witness to the potential power of recurrent neural networks to acquire knowledge of extended word sequences. It seems likely that the neural underpinnings of phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge also incorporate recurrent network architecture (Acheson and MacDonald 2009; Gupta and Dell 1999). Indeed, although a simple pattern associator network, such as the acoustic—articulatory motor network introduced in chapter 2, may be adequate to incorporate phonemic sequence knowledge within morphemes, the greater power of a recurrent network may be required for acquisition of phonemic and morphemic sequence knowledge represented in phrase structure rules and grammatic morphology. The acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator is also the logical locus of neural support of immediate serial recall (auditory—verbal short-term memory), aided by hippocampally based episodic memory (Nadeau 2001). Botvinick and Plaut (2006), in simulations of a recurrent network PDP model, were highly successful in accounting for a number of empirically well-established properties of immediate serial recall and clearly demonstrated why a simple pattern associator network would not suffice (see also Sibley et al. 2008).
    
    Recursion
    
    Recursion involves the process of inserting (embedding) successive nested relative clauses into sentences. I will focus primarily on a simple type of serial left branching recursion, often considered by linguists to be uninteresting but that nevertheless serves to make my crucial point (for further detail, see Christiansen and Chater 1999 and Chomsky 1957). Consider
    
    (1) "The woman whose dress rustled when she walked sat down beside me."
  - |-
    The presence of two embedded relative clauses in this sentence makes
    the point that this process of successive embedding can, in principle, be
    carried on indefinitely, limited only by powers of recall. This capacity
    for building sentences through repeated operation of a rule is a defining
    characteristic of context free grammars. For this reason alone, it is
    important for any neural model of grammar to come to grips with
    recursion. A capacity for recursion has also been proposed as the
    linguistic capability that uniquely distinguishes human beings from
    other animals (Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch 2002). This is not the place
    to discuss the evolution of language. However, theories about capacity
    for recursion being uniquely human are predicated on the assumption
    that recursion involves a capacity that is qualitatively different from
    anything observed in studies of nonhuman language. Among _ the
    unexpected results of taking a connectionist approach to grammar is the
    conclusion that capacity for recursion may actually represent only a
    quantitative difference, reflecting simply a larger brain, and not the
    presence of a fundamentally different and uniquely human brain
    mechanism. I will argue that the essential capacity needed to support
    recursion is simply the ability to maintain and reciprocally modify two
    or more different distributed concept representations at the same time.
    However, my principal goal in this seeming side trip into recursion is to
    make evident that recursion substantially involves semantic processes,
    the capability for which is likely quite similar in all human beings.
    However, the translation of the various semantic structures at play in
    recursive sentences into words is variously constrained and encumbered
    by sentence-level sequence knowledge, semantic—
    morphologic/phonologic (lexical) knowledge, and morphologic and
    phonologic sequence knowledge, which obviously differ from language
    to language.
    
    Sentence | is presented as a recursive structure. However, when
    broken down into the component concept representations, it becomes
    
    [the dress rustling while walking woman now sitting down by me] [me,
    this woman having sat down beside]
    
    that is, MFGDCR,* ©! ©) Y - MFGDCR,", where V = sat down beside
    me.
  - |-
    Recall that neural network representations of concepts enable almost unlimited modification of these representations (see the "Semantic Contributions to Syntax" section above). Thus, in this example, there are only two concept representations, and this sentence is not fundamentally different from
    
    (2) "The tall, blonde, weeping woman sat down beside me."
    
    This is clearly not a nested structure. The nonsemantic difference between sentence | and sentence 2 is that sentence 1 employs some connecting words (whose, when), which can be viewed as a quantitatively more sophisticated form of acquired sequence and syntacticsmorphologic knowledge.
    The argument that follows is that there is a graded, quantitative difference between nonnested and nested (recursive) sentences rather than an absolute one.
    
    (3) "The woman, whose husband was deep-sea fishing, sat down beside
    
    99
    
    me.
    
    This is not clearly fundamentally different from 1 in its concept representation structure. Thus,
    
    [deep sea fishing man's wife now sitting by me] [me beside this woman]
    There are still two concept representations.
    
    (4) "The woman, whose husband was fishing for marlin, sat down
    beside me."
    
    This sentence is incrementally more complex. It could be viewed as
    [marlin fishing man's wife now sitting by me] [me beside this woman]
    
    However, one could also legitimately argue that a third concept
    representation has been introduced here, [marlin fishing husband], by
    virtue of the semantic salience of marlin.
    
    The realization of three or more concept representations
    (corresponding in this context to recursion) can be achieved without
    changes in the sentence structure through changes in content or context
    that alter the salience of particular entities:
    
    (5) "The woman, whose husband was fishing for great white shark, sat
    down beside me."
    The greater intrinsic semantic salience of great white shark
    unequivocally establishes it as an additional concept representation.
    
    (6) "The president of the United States was deep-sea fishing. The
    woman, whose husband was fishing for marlin, sat down beside me."
    
    Here we have sentence 4, but the salience of husband has been increased
    by context (the implication that this woman is the first lady, in which
    case what the husband is doing cannot help but define husband as its
    own independent concept representation.
  - |-
    (7) "The woman, whose husband drowned while fishing for marlin, sat down beside me."
    
    In this case, there is no question that a third concept representation has been introduced, here by the semantic salience of the alteration of husband.
    
    (8) "The woman, whose son had stolen my daughter's bicycle, sat down beside me."
    
    Here, there are at least four concept representations. The semantic salience of the concepts defined by the relative clause makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to view these items as simply modifiers of the woman.
    
    Whereas the examples given can be understood in general terms as elaborate modifications of the agent, production and comprehension are assisted by two additional factors. First, each noun representation, as noted earlier, immediately engages attractor basin compatible verbs, including a representational component that will elicit morphology defining agreement. This helps to disambiguate which nouns subsequent verbs modify. Second, as noted in the previous section, knowledge of sequence regularities embodied in embedded clause constructions can be acquired by simple recurrent networks. Thus, production or comprehension of embedded clause constructions occurs not in a vacuum but rather in the context of a rich knowledge of the sentence-level sequence regularities of the language. All of these processes, of course, occur at the concept representations level, but all concept modifications are translated to and from morphologic and phonologic forms in perisylvian cortex via the fan arrays.

    Whatever one's views on the individual examples I have provided,
    this series of sentences suggests that while recursion is classically
    viewed as a threshold principle of language function, involving a unique
    neural network that instantiates a rule, which may distinguish human
    from animal communication, when looked at closely, it translates into
    introduction of two up to many concept representations, variously
    complex manipulations of those representations, and various connecting
    words. In short, once there is a capacity for generating two concept
    representations and a capacity for some sort of phrase structure
    formalisms (sequence knowledge), then beyond that everything
    represents quantitative differences, not qualitative differences.
    Furthermore, the fact that number of concept representations can be
    altered by the semantic salience of particular words or the sentence
    context argues strongly against rigid rules predicated only on sentence
    structure. To what extent the auditory communication of certain animals
    reflects sequence knowledge impacting propositional communication is
    a matter of ongoing research and debate.
    
    Linguists postulate that recursion is supported in the brain by a
    pushdown memory mechanism, by analogy with the pushdown stacks of
    digital computers. A pushdown stack is accessed on a first-in/last-out
    manner. This is best exemplified by a type of recursion, mirror
    recursion, that has been of considerable interest to linguists. It is posited
    that we make sense of a rather taxing sentence, exemplifying mirror
    recursion, such as
    
    (9) "The rat the cat the dog chased killed ate the cheese."
    by parsing successive parts into such a pushdown memory mechanism:
    
    "The rat (,the cat (,the dog chased,) killed, ) ate the cheese."
    
    Recent advances in neural network theory suggest that a network
    equivalent of a pushdown stack (incorporating varieties of recurrent
    networks) might actually be feasible (Bodén and Blair 2003). However,
    making sense of sentences employing mirror recursion, like the simple,
    serial recursion discussed earlier, is substantially dependent on semantic
    factors. Contrast the following sentence with sentence 9:
    
    (10) "The woman the burglar the police apprehended robbed sat down
    beside me."
  - |-
    It is immediately evident that it is more easily comprehended than
    sentence 9, notwithstanding identical structure. The reason is that the
    semantic relationships are more transparent. If comprehension of
    sentences 9 and 10 were dependent on a pushdown memory, the two
    sentences would not differ in comprehensibility since a pushdown
    memory mechanism is indifferent to semantic content and the two
    sentences presumably make the same demands on working memory and
    hippocampal function. These arguments only serve to remake the point
    of the preceding discussion: that recursion fundamentally hinges on
    manipulation of distributed concept representations and hence
    fundamentally involves semantic processes.
    
    Looked at from a slightly different perspective, a mathematical,
    linguistic conceptualization of recursion and the fundamentally semantic
    conceptualization introduced here are mutually compatible for a low
    number of recursions, particularly when there are salient semantic
    relationships between the major lexical items (e.g., sentence 10, above).
    
    However, nobody speaks or writes sentences like 9 or 10 (except
    linguists!), much less sentences with greater recursion N, and human
    performance is rather limited (see Christiansen and Chater 1999). That
    is, Just because a sentence is linguistically feasible and grammatic does
    not necessarily mean that it can be produced or comprehended by the
    brain or that it is the stuff of human verbal or written communication.
    That is, recursion N is governed by neural instantiation of statistical
    regularity no less than actual sequence.
    
    I have taken the position that recursion fundamentally reflects
    capacities for generating, manipulating, and modifying two or more
    concept representations, sustained over time—a capacity presumably
    supported by all human brains (and perhaps in rudimentary form, by
    some nonhuman primate brains). However, there exists a language,
    spoken exclusively by a small Amazonian tribe, the Piraha, that has
    recently gained notoriety because it does not employ embedding
    (Everett 2005). Thus, when presented with the situation in sentence 1, a
    tribe member might say,
    
    (11) "The woman walked. The woman's dress rustled. The woman sat
    down beside me."
  - |-
    Considered purely in terms of their meaning (i.e., concept representations), sentence 1 and sentence series 11 are essentially identical. What is different is the presence of knowledge of sentence-level and morphological sequence that enables the more direct, more efficient, but more complex instantiation of recursion in the phonological form exemplified in sentence 1. The Piraha lack the capacity for embedding because despite adequate phonology and capacity for semantic concept manipulation, they lack the requisite grammatical morphological and sentence-level sequence knowledge (clutter they are reportedly proud to be free of!). This might best be viewed as a cultural effect, rather than an indication of a fundamental difference in grammatical capacity simply because the Piraha never acquire that sequence knowledge. Other studies provide support for this interpretation (Bates and Devescovi 1989). In simple subject–object sentences, Italians almost obligatorily make use of more complex syntax than Americans because they must topicalize the agent:
    
    "A monkey is eating a banana." (American)
    "There is a monkey that is eating a banana." (Italian)

    Furthermore, in describing sequences of actions involving more than
    two nouns, whereas Americans are wont to say "An A hit a B and a C,"
    Italians more often use gapping constructions—for example, "An A hit a
    B and then hit a C". Italians more often shift voice to maintain
    perspective—for example, "An A hit a B and then got hit by a C">
    —whereas Americans are more likely to say "An A hit a B and then a C hit
    A." The same differences were observed even when American graduate
    students at an elite university, used to writing and speaking on complex
    topics, were compared with Italian or American college students. This
    suggests that these differences do not reflect greater intelligence or
    greater skill in manipulating distributed concept representations, only
    cultural differences in the way the resultant concept configurations are
    translated into word sequences. In short, Americans are more
    Hemingwayesque than Shakespearian in their use of language simply
    because of their linguistic experience growing up, and the Piraha are
    more Hemingwayesque still. During language acquisition, these
    differences are wired into the connectivity within and between the
    neural networks underlying grammatic function listed in table 3.1, and
    most particularly into the neural substrate for habits of sequential
    concept manipulation that comprise sentence-level sequence knowledge.
    Grammar: A Synthesis
  - |-
    In previous sections, I have described ten different cerebral domains of knowledge and cerebral processes that provide the substrate for grammar (see table 3.1). The vast stores of acquired knowledge in domains 1-8 and the interactions between these domains and key functional capacities like working memory and hippocampal episodic declarative memory acquisition provide the basis for the enormous complexity, richness, and flexibility of grammar, the enormous and highly constrained differences between languages, and the particular, substantially language-specific patterns of breakdown in aphasia. Even in completely right-handed subjects, variations in the degree to which the right brain has incipient function in these eight domains sufficient to play a role in recovery, and variations in the degree to which the right and left hemispheres are disconnected by the typical periventricular white matter (PVWM) lesions observed with MCA distribution strokes, which may involve callosal fibers, no doubt contribute additionally to the variation in patterns of breakdown in aphasia. These will be the topic of chapter 4. Finally, and crucially, patterns of breakdown in aphasia reflect the distributed neural network property of graceful degradation: aphasic subjects speak like normal subjects but with a far greater probability of error and in a manner that reflects the particular vulnerability of particular aspects of their particular language to disruption by lesions of particular geography.
    
    Semantic—phonologic function is based primarily upon three domains of knowledge: semantic, phonologic sequence, and the pattern associators linking semantic and sequence knowledge (fan arrays), which provide the basis for the phonologic lexicons. It additionally requires frontal systems involved in selective engagement (working memory) and frontal systems involved in manipulation of distributed concept representations in order to volitionally modify distributed concept representations corresponding to nouns (MFGDCRs of equation 3.1).
    
    Grammatic function demands:
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    1. A general capacity for modification of distributed noun concept representations (either volitionally, in language production, or substantially automatically, in language comprehension). This requires an intact substrate for concept representations (Semantics) and a capacity for selective engagement of neural networks supporting any type of knowledge, not just phonologic (working memory). Modification of noun concept representations may be achieved by adjectives, verbs, prepositional phrases, or clauses, hence MFGDCR*: PP. CY from equation 3.2. Noun representations are not only verb modified and verb representations modified in their engagement with specific MFGDCRs, but both noun and verb representations are modified to instantiate number and thematic role, hence case and person marking of the phonologic forms.
    
    2. A capacity for reciprocal manipulation of two or more distributed concept representations that (a) achieves the modifications of these representations that instantiate thematic role assignment and (b) simultaneously involves reciprocal predicative modification of these representations through colinkage to the semantic representation of a verb, thereby achieving both the neural instantiation of the association of a verb with a specific argument structure and the engagement of verb semantics (hence the reciprocity of the relationship symbolized by MFGDCR, ' - MFGDCR;').
    
    3. A capacity for sequential control of concept representation modification processes in a way that ultimately achieves a concept stream (CS(t) from equation 3.2) whose morphologic—phonologic translation (equation 3.3) fully respects the sentence-level sequence regularities of the language—what I have termed habits of sequential concept manipulation.
    
    4. A perisylvian domain of phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge that limits the repertoire of available phonemic sequences to those supporting the vocabulary of a particular language, limits the repertoire of morphologic sequence knowledge to that needed to support the range of word stems and associated affixes or infixes in that language, and implicitly instantiates the phrase structure rules and rules of grammatic morphologic sequence of that language.
  - |-
    5. Connectivity between the substrate for the semantic representations of nouns and verbs and perisylvian domains of phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge that constrain phonologic and morphologic sequence to the concept configuration. This connectivity, comprising fan arrays, instantiates semantic—phonologic/morphologic (lexical) knowledge and enables the phonologic realization of nouns, verbs, adjectives, grammatic morphology, and ultimately, the full sentence in correct sequence.
    
    6. Connectivity between the substrates for sentence-level sequence knowledge (habits of sequential manipulation) and the perisylvian substrate for sequence knowledge that instantiates syntactic phonologic/morphologic (lexical) knowledge, for example, complementizers.
    
    7. Capacity for ongoing maintenance of concepts previously spoken or heard that may serve to further modify current concept representations as well as grammatic morphology (e.g., articles and pronouns), a capacity realized through selective engagement and hippocampal episodic memory mechanisms.
    
    8. Capacity for ongoing selective engagement of a concept of time that will achieve, through semantic—phonologic/morphologic connectivity, the instantiation of tense and aspect in spoken output.

    These various domains are constrained on a moment-to-moment basis
    in language comprehension by verbal input (acoustic or orthographic).
    They are constrained in language production on a moment-to-moment
    basis by prefrontal neural representations of goals of verbal
    communication, together with sensory input. Expressive goals
    (instantiated by representations of narrative plan and subjective value)
    define the concepts that are to be engaged, their thematic roles, and their
    modification by adjectives and verbs, in ways that are consistent with
    featural plausibility, attractor basin compatibility, verb argument
    structure, and verb subcategorization requirements. Lack of consistency
    in any of these domains will tend to induce shifts to different noun and
    verb representations. Expressive goals also take advantage of the fact
    that, because verb semantic representations comprise the predicative
    component of noun concept representations, verbs and nouns prime one
    another to the degree that there is featural plausibility and attractor basin
    compatibility. Working memory, the product of selective engagement,
    coupled with encoding of concepts and concept associations by the
    hippocampus as episodic memory (Shrager et al. 2008), provides the
    substrate for keeping this concept configuration online.
    
    Semantic relationships between nouns, verbs, and adjectives have
    some implications for sentence sequence, but ultimately, sequence is
    determined at the sentence level by sequence habits based in sequence
    knowledge represented in prefrontal association cortex and its
    connections, and at the local level by sequence knowledge supporting
    phrase structure rules and grammatic morphology, instantiated in
    perisylvian pattern associator networks. Expressive goals can
    legitimately be said to come first, but thereafter everything occurs in
    parallel. In this more comprehensive conceptualization, the term
    "concept manipulation" that I have used so often can be seen to
    predominantly involve the combination of goal driven reciprocal
    engagement of mutually compatible verb and noun representations
    constrained by sequence habits (equation 3.2).
    
    Disorders of Grammar in Aphasia
    
    In this chapter I will review the literature on grammatic dysfunction in
    aphasia in relation to the model developed in chapter 3, in order to (1)
    test the theoretical model for its ability to account for empirical data and
    (2) further elaborate the model. There will be several recurrent themes:
  - |-
    ¢ Language is a multicomponent process that engages several domains of knowledge (see table 3.1 and equations 3.1—3.3). If we include the neural representation of meaning (semantics), linguistic function taps the entire cerebrum.
    
    ¢ Specific components of language (and grammatic) function are localized to the neural domains that, by virtue of their connectivity and neural network properties, can uniquely support them. Thus, a lesion almost anywhere can potentially disrupt language function, but in a specific way that reflects the unique contribution of that neural tissue to language processes.
    
    ¢ The impact of lesions will reflect four factors:
    
    1. The language mechanisms resident in the tissue affected. The steadily accumulating knowledge of the brain over the past 100+ years has only served to illustrate how exquisitely localized and specific brain function is, reflecting in the main the principle that the specific connectivity of a neural network with other parts of the brain substantially defines the substance of its function. However, this same neuroscientific advance has also testified to the extraordinary extent to which complex functions are distributed over extensive regions of the brain, the hyperlocalized findings of functional imaging studies notwithstanding.
    
    2. The property of graceful degradation, implicit in neural networks instantiating population encoding (i.e., distributed representations), in which, in the face of network damage or noisy input, the major regularities in the knowledge represented are preserved, most particularly regularities that are most redundantly wired into neural connectivity—through relative frequency of use and consistency of use (absence of competing alternative regularities). These regularities, which define different attractor basin and trench landscapes, hence different quasi-regular domains, differ from language to language, hence the often quoted maxim that in aphasia, it is surprisingly difficult to "take Turkish out of the Turk, and English out of the Englishman."
    
    3. The extent to which knowledge underlying a given function is distributed across the brain and the pattern of this distribution. In the damaged brain, the impact of distribution of knowledge plays out in two ways: first, the particular susceptibility or resilience of an entire domain of knowledge or function to brain lesions and, second, the interaction of distribution of function with lesion geography.
  - |-
    a. Domain susceptibility: Functions substantially dependent on morphologic sequence knowledge—for example, grammatic morphology—are disproportionately affected by lesions of the dominant perisylvian region, wherein that knowledge is represented (i.e., the lesions present in Broca's, Wernicke's, and conduction aphasia). However, there is considerable evidence that in richly inflected languages, there may be substantial preservation of this knowledge even in subjects with large left-hemisphere strokes, strongly suggesting that in part, it is also represented in the right hemisphere, presumably in homologous perisylvian or parasylvian regions. The degree of distribution of any language function into the right brain is subject to substantial interindividual variability. Thus, a large, predominantly anterior left-hemisphere lesion may produce a global aphasia in a person with a poor substrate for language function in the right hemisphere, and a Broca's aphasia in a subject with better right-hemisphere linguistic capacity. The extent of distribution may be greater for some functions than others. Thus, loss of capacity for multiple concept manipulation, as constrained by sentence-level sequence habits, tends to occur only with relatively large left-frontal lesions whereas grammatic morphology can be profoundly affected by much more modest perisylvian lesions.
    
    b. Lesion pattern: Because morphologic sequence knowledge is predominantly located in the dominant perisylvian region, it is particularly likely to be seriously damaged by MCA territory strokes, in which the locus of maximal damage is usually perisylvian. On the other hand, verb flavor knowledge, which is predominantly represented in nonperisylvian postcentral cortices, may be substantially spared with MCA territory strokes but severely affected in subjects with semantic dementia.
  - |-
    4. The stochastic nature of neural network processing. The output of a  
    neural network is intrinsically probabilistic. We are constantly reminded  
    of the impact of this property on language processing in normal subjects  
    by the various slips of the tongue, occasional word finding difficulty,  
    semantic paraphasias, and grammatic gaffs we are frustratingly prone to  
    making. Damage to language networks increases the probability of  
    errors even as the nature of these errors continues to reflect the  
    language-specific knowledge wired into the networks and the  
    geographic distribution of the lesion.
    
    The impact of graceful degradation and distribution of  
    knowledge effects will be precisely reflected in the principles of  
    the competition model and in the results of cross-linguistic studies  
    of language.
    
    Grammaticality Judgment and the Issue of Loss of Knowledge  
    versus Loss of Access to Knowledge
    
    Many studies of subjects with impaired grammatic function have  
    demonstrated relatively preserved grammaticality judgment: the ability  
    to determine whether a sentence is grammatically correct or not  
    (Linebarger, Schwartz, and Saffran 1983; Wulfeck 1988; Lukatela,  
    Crain, and Shankweiler 1988). This has often been held forth as  
    evidence that access to the neural substrate for grammatic function is  
    impaired but that the neural substrate itself is preserved. Two questions  
    arise: (1) is this explanation neurologically plausible? and (2) if it is not  
    neurologically plausible, what alternative explanation can be offered?  
    The answers to these questions are of fundamental importance to  
    understanding all the discussions of grammatic impairment in aphasia  
    that follow.
  - |-
    The brain is best understood as a neural network machine (Buonomano and Merzenich 1998). Knowledge is represented as the strengths of neural synapses, and learning consists of changing the strengths of these synapses. The brain has 100 billion neurons, and one neuron can have thousands of synapses. Any damage to the brain destroys synapses and therefore causes loss of knowledge. A large MCA distribution stroke could destroy 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses. Because knowledge is distributed as connection strengths throughout a neural network, damage to a network, whether focal or diffuse, may lead to a substantial probability of output error, but it does not eliminate all knowledge unless the network is completely destroyed, the phenomenon referred to as graceful degradation. Thus, evidence of residual knowledge is perfectly consistent with partial loss of knowledge due to network damage. We have also seen that given damage to a left-hemisphere network (e.g., the acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator), right-hemisphere networks may contain sufficient knowledge of the right type to provide some support for that function, even if not enough to ensure uniformly correct output. The right hemisphere might also support nonlinguistic capacities that aid in the performance of grammaticality judgment tasks. For example, Caramazza and Berndt (1985) suggested that subjects with Broca's aphasia may use relatively preserved capacity for assessment of intonational contours to make grammaticality judgments. They noted that the grammaticality judgment of their subjects was better for material presented aurally then for material presented in written form.
  - |-
    On the other hand, certain types of brain damage, particularly that involving major white matter pathways, may destroy connections between networks, leading to cognitive dysfunction that truly reflects loss of access to intact knowledge representations—true disconnection syndromes (Geschwind 1965). For example, following transection of the corpus callosum to treat refractory generalized epilepsy, the right hemisphere generally cannot express itself verbally because it has no access to left-hemisphere language networks and the left hemisphere cannot speak about right-hemisphere memories, perceptions, thoughts, and plans because it has no way of accessing these representations. Subjects with posterior cerebral infarcts that destroy the left occipital cortex and the splenium of the corpus callosum cannot read words because, even though the right occipital cortex can see the printed words, it cannot relay this orthographic information to the left hemisphere for linguistic processing. In the final analysis, it is likely that most aberrant behavior observed after brain damage reflects a mix of loss of knowledge due to destruction of neural networks and loss of access to knowledge due to damage to white matter pathways or intervening gray matter "relay stations." Even in the case of callosal section, arguably the purest disconnection syndrome, the involved interhemispheric axons support synaptic connections that represent knowledge, connections that are lost with the surgery.
    
    There are at least five mechanisms by which left-hemisphere stroke might damage white matter pathways such that the aphasic syndrome that results reflects a mixture of loss of knowledge and loss of access to knowledge:
  - |-
    1. Damage to left Brodmann's area 39 (angular gyrus), posterior
    area 21 (middle temporal gyrus), and area 37 (posterior middle
    and inferior temporal gyrus). In the mid-1960s, Norman
    Geschwind (Geschwind 1965) recognized that there exist
    polymodal cortical "relay stations" that, besides having
    processing roles, serve to link other cortical areas to each other,
    and that damage to such relay stations could produce a
    disconnection syndrome. The region in posterior temporal lobe
    encompassing parts of areas 21, 37, and 39 is such a relay station,
    linking perisylvian language cortex to association cortices
    throughout the left hemisphere that support concept
    representations (i.e., semantic knowledge). Lesions of this area or
    of its white matter afferents and efferents, components of the fan
    arrays, expectably produce loss of semantic—phonologic (lexical)
    knowledge manifesting as word retrieval deficits (Chertkow et al.
    1997; Hart and Gordon 1990; Raymer et al. 1997; Whatmough et
    al. 2002).
  - |-
    2. Damage to the arcuate fasciculus. The precise role of the
    arcuate fasciculus, which links posterior perisylvian cortex to
    frontal operculum (Catani, Jones, and Fytche 2005), remains
    unclear (Nadeau 2001). However, functional imaging studies
    (Démonet et al. 1992; Paulesu, Frith, and Frackowiak 1993) and
    intraoperative cortical stimulation studies (Ojemann 1991)
    provide strong support for the concept that there is an anatomic
    separation of posterior perisylvian cortex and frontal cortical
    regions supporting language function, the two regions separated
    by primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and the
    secondary somatosensory area. It seems most likely that if the
    arcuate fasciculus is involved in language function, it is in the
    domain of phonology (and perhaps morphology). Thus, in some
    sense, phonologic dysfunction associated with lesions of the
    arcuate fasciculus (which typically also involve overlying
    perisylvian cortex known to be involved in phonologic function)
    could be viewed as in part reflecting a disconnection syndrome,
    hence destruction of the acoustic—articulatory motor pattern
    associator.
  - |-
    3. Damage to frontal—perisylvian connections. Frontal systems involvement in language function, disruption of which is most manifested in Broca's aphasia, logically depends upon extensive connectivity between prefrontal cortex and left perisylvian cortices supporting morphologic and phonologic function. Frontal systems engaging in language function are likely to be highly distributed and therefore resistant to severe disruption by focal lesions. However, as frontal—perisylvian white matter tracts funnel down to the perisylvian region via components of the fan arrays, they necessarily become spatially concentrated and therefore more susceptible to extensive damage by moderate-sized lesions (just as very small lesions of the posterior limb of the internal capsule or the posterior PYVWM can cause severe hemiparesis). As it turns out, there is good evidence that lesions causing Broca's aphasia reflect both damage to networks supporting concept representations (instantiating semantics) and networks (the fan arrays) linking the substrates for concept representations to perisylvian cortex, producing loss of access to meaning reflected in lexical impairment. This evidence will be reviewed below.
  - |-
    4. Damage to frontal—posterior and frontal subcortical pathways.
    Maintenance of volitional selective engagement (working
    memory) is substantially dependent upon prefrontal cortex. It may
    be achieved directly through frontal—postcentral white matter
    connectivity, or indirectly via frontal-thalamic connectivity. MCA
    distribution strokes commonly cause major damage to PVYWM
    because the PVWM is the end zone of small lenticulostriate
    vessels supplying the basal ganglia (Nadeau and Crosson 1997;
    Nadeau and Rothi 2008). This is the major mechanism of
    hemiparesis in such strokes because this is the pathway taken by
    corticospinal and corticobulbar projections from cerebral motor
    areas. However, anterior—posterior fibers potentially involved in
    direct selective engagement of postcentral cortices may also be
    damaged by PVWM lesions. Ventral cortical lesions involving the
    frontal operculum or anterior temporal operculum may damage
    fronto—temporal—occipital pathways (Catani, Jones, and Fytche
    2005; Duffau et al. 2005) that additionally may play a role in
    selective engagement of more ventral posterior cortices.
    Embolism of blood clot to the proximal MCA causes infarction of
    the basal ganglia and intervening anterior limb of the internal
    capsule, potentially producing a fronto—thalamic disconnection
    and elements of thalamic aphasia (Nadeau and Crosson 1997).
    There are scant studies of the impact of thalamic lesions on
    grammatic function (De Witte et al. 2006). In short, there is a
    variety of mechanisms by which the subcortical components of
    stroke might disrupt working memory mechanisms crucial to
    language function, including grammatic function.
  - |-
    5. Damage to transcallosal pathways. The corpus callosum provides a means by which the two hemispheres might complement each other's function in the subject rendered aphasic by left-hemisphere lesions. However, the PYWM damage typically produced by MCA distribution strokes may damage transcallosal pathways linking homologous regions of the left and right hemispheres, thereby preventing optimal coordination of left- and right-hemispheric function in recovery from aphasia. To the extent that damage to callosal fibers contributes to the ultimate evolution of the aphasic syndrome, one could view loss of access to knowledge as being a factor in language impairment.
    
    Brain lesions associated with impairment in grammatic function are typically very large and destroy vast numbers of neural connections (i.e., knowledge). Thus, the notion that preserved grammaticality judgment indicates loss of access with preserved knowledge is simply not neurologically plausible. However, there is likely to be some contribution of loss of knowledge access to any aphasic syndrome, via the mechanisms discussed in the foregoing. Relative sparing of grammaticality judgment can be attributed in the main to two factors: (1) graceful degradation and (2) the capacity for other neural networks in the brain, most importantly in the right hemisphere, to partially compensate for left-hemisphere damage. The variable role of the right hemisphere in language production by subjects with aphasia has been difficult to define experimentally and is perhaps best (though not well) understood for phonologic, semantic, and semantic–phonologic (lexical) function. Given the often very large left-hemisphere lesions associated with enduring aphasia, particularly Broca's aphasia (which usually emerges from global aphasia), it seems likely that the role of the right hemisphere in recovery has generally been underestimated.
  - |-
    In sum, the evidence is quite clear that knowledge and function, by virtue of being distributed and gracefully degrading, are not lost in all-or-none fashion. Rather, they are degraded to one degree or another by lesions. Therefore, the presence of some residual capacity is best interpreted as indicating the presence of some residual knowledge or function, not completely preserved knowledge or function with impaired access. However, genuine impairment in access, as a result of disconnection, clearly also contributes to aphasia, even as the details of this contribution are poorly understood.
    
    The patterns of impairment in grammaticality judgment that have been defined in empirical studies are similar to and fully anticipate the patterns observed in the breakdown of other aspects of grammar in aphasia (see below). They therefore likely reflect the operation of similar neural principles. For example, in a study of grammaticality judgment in English and Italian subjects with Broca's aphasia, Wulfeck, Bates, and Capasso (1991) found that all subjects were sensitive to ungrammatic violations of word order and agreement, all subjects were more sensitive to violations of word order, and there was a group by error type interaction such that English speakers were relatively more sensitive to word order violations and less sensitive to agreement violations than their Italian counterparts. These findings are fully in agreement with predictions of the competition model (and its neural instantiation): in English, word order is the predominant cue to meaning, whereas in Italian, there is little word order preference and rich inflectional marking denoting agent—verb agreement is the key to sentence interpretation. Furthermore, also anticipating later discussion of results of cross-linguistic studies of sentence comprehension and production, the relatively greater loss of ability to detect agreement violations observed in speakers of both languages is consistent with the concept of substantial instantiation of morphologic sequence knowledge underlying agreement detection in left perisylvian cortex, a region that is consistently damaged in subjects with Broca's aphasia.
    
    Syntax
  - |-
    Broca's aphasia is commonly characterized by two grammatic attributes:  
    simplification of syntax and a characteristic abnormality of grammatic  
    morphology known as agrammatism—the propensity, at least in  
    English, for leaving out words of primarily grammatic importance, such  
    as articles, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, and to some extent prepositions. These two aspects of Broca's aphasia may be dissociated:  
    several cases of morphologic agrammatism without simplification of  
    syntax have been reported (Nadeau and Gonzalez-Rothi 1993; Kolk,  
    vanGrunsven, and Keyser 1985; Miceli et al. 1983) and a number of  
    cases of simplification of syntax without morphologic agrammatism  
    have been reported (Nadeau 1988; Berndt 1987; Paresi 1987; Saffran,  
    Schwartz, and Marin 1980b; Tissot, Mounin, and Lhermitte 1973).  
    These dissociations provide strong evidence of separate neural  
    substrates for these two functional domains as discussed in chapter 3. I  
    will turn to disorders of grammatic morphology later in the book.  
    Disorders of syntax, reflected in the production of short, simple  
    sentences, most often in canonical form, with a paucity of embedded  
    clauses and of prepositional phrases modifying noun phrases (Miceli  
    and Mazzucchi 1990), likely reflect a combination of two factors: (1)  
    impairment in the ability to engage and flexibly modify distributed  
    concept representations (including, most importantly, the process of  
    verb modification of these representations) and (2) degradation of  
    sentence-level sequence knowledge underlying acquired habits of  
    sequential manipulation.

    Subjects with Broca's aphasia exhibit defects of selective engagement  
    and modification of concept representations in some elemental ways.  
    For example, it was observed long ago that they cannot use strings of  
    adjectives (e.g., they are capable of "large house," or "white house," but  
    not "large white house"; Gleason et al. 1975; see also Menn and Obler  
    1990b). Studies of lexical priming provide further evidence of defects  
    in selective engagement (Prather et al. 1992). In normal subjects  
    engaged in a lexical decision task, preceding a lexical target with a  
    semantically related word reduces the time needed to determine whether  
    the target is a word or a nonword. Seeing the semantically related word  
    has led to the selective engagement of a number of semantically related  
    distributed concept representations and their associated articulatory  
    motor representations, one of which is the target. In subjects with  
    Broca's aphasia, the range and number of the distributed concept  
    representations selectively engaged appears to be limited, with the result  
    that speeding of lexical decision by semantic priming is less likely to  
    occur.  
    
    This defect in selective engagement capacity is illustrated most  
    clearly by errors in verb argument structure exhibited by subjects with  
    Broca's aphasia. In a key paper, Thompson, Lange, et al. (1997; see also  
    Kim and Thompson 2004) showed that these subjects are usually correct  
    in the production of sentences involving a single argument. They exhibit  
    greater difficulty with two-argument constructions, and still greater  
    difficulty with sentences involving three arguments. They correctly  
    produce sentences employing verbs requiring only an agent/experiencer  
    more often than those also requiring a patient/theme. Performance is still  
    poorer with verbs additionally requiring a goal/location and is poorest  
    with verbs specifying a sentence complement. These observations  
    suggest not only restricted selective engagement in Broca's aphasia but  
    also a hierarchy of engagement capacity, agent/experiencer >  
    patient/theme > goal/location, which was most obvious in Broca's  
    aphasia but was also apparent in the normal control subjects that  
    Thompson et al. studied. They also found that both in subjects with  
    aphasia and in normal control subjects, production of sentences  
    containing verbs with obligatory two- or three-component argument  
    structures was better than production of sentences containing verbs

    Allowing argument structure options (e.g., the woman eats/the woman eats spaghetti; the woman throws the stick/the woman throws the stick to the dog). This suggests that, as in other language domains (e.g., reading irregular words with spelling-sound options for the rhyme: pint vs. mint, tint, lint), the simultaneous presence of multiple options (competing regularities in quasi-regular domains) slows or degrades performance.

    Subjects with Broca's aphasia also exhibit relatively greater difficulty
    accessing verbs than nouns, and their production of verbs with complex
    argument structures is generally more impaired than is production of
    verbs with one or two noun phrase arguments (Thompson, Lange, et al.
    1997). This pattern has been observed for a number of languages,
    including English, Dutch, German, Italian, and Hungarian (Caplan and
    Hana 1998; Kim and Thompson 2000; Bastiaanse and Jonkers 1998;
    Kim and Thompson 2004; de Bleser and Kauschke 2003; Jonkers and
    Bastiaanse 1998; Kemmerer and Tranel 2000; Luzzatti et al. 2002).°
    These observations provide further support for the concept introduced
    early in this book that the meaning of a verb is inextricably linked to the
    meaning of its arguments (see the "Deficits in Verb Production in
    Broca's Aphasia—Potential Mechanisms" section below for further
    discussion). However, verb naming ability is often dissociated to some
    degree from ability to use verbs in sentences, produce syntactically well-
    formed sentences, and realize correct verb argument structure (Berndt,
    Haendiges, et al. 1997; Berndt, Mitchum, et al. 1997; Mitchum and
    Berndt 2001; Saffran, Berndt, and Schwartz 1989; Bates, Chen, et al.
    1991; Bastiaanse and Jonkers 1998). In some subjects, verb naming may
    be better in sentence context than in a confrontation naming task
    (Zingeser and Berndt 1990). The dissociations may reflect (1)
    differential damage to different components of the semantic
    representations of verbs: (a) damage to anterior substrates maximally
    disrupting verb use in sentences and verb argument structure because of
    its impact on the thematic component of verb meaning and (b) damage
    to posterior substrates maximally affecting verb naming, which may be
    relatively more dependent on the integrity of the substrate for verb
    flavor representations (see the "Distributed Representations of Verb
    Semantics" section below) and (2) the degree of preservation of
    sentence-level sequence knowledge. It is also possible that in a sentence

    Context, bottom—up engagement of the semantic representations of arguments may enable more successful engagement of verb representations due to mutual priming effects (McRae et al. 2005). Supplying the verb may also aid some subjects in the production of syntactically well-formed sentences (Berndt, Haendiges, et al. 1997; Marshall, Pring, and Chiat 1998). In subjects with no more than modest damage to the semantic representation of the verb, bottom—up engagement of the verb representation can facilitate engagement of argument representations (Ferretti, McRae, and Hatherell 2001).
    However, subjects with agrammatism and intact verb semantics but a semantic—phonologic (lexical) deficit in verb production (see the next section) may produce markedly better sentences when the verb is supplied (Marshall, Pring, and Chiat 1998). In this circumstance, supplying the verb may mitigate the particularly disruptive effects of anomia on their discourse.
    
    As noted above, disorders of syntax may also reflect degradation of sentence-level sequence knowledge. Further discussion of this will be deferred until after a full consideration of the competition model in the context of aphasia (see "The Competition Model and a Return to Syntax" section below).
    
    Deficits in Verb Production in Broca's Aphasia—Potential Mechanisms
  - |-
    Difficulty in producing main verbs by subjects with Broca's aphasia was  
    first observed over 50 years ago (Fillenbaum, Jones, and Wepman 1961). Luria may have been the first to relate this to prefrontal lesions  
    (Luria 1984; Luria and Tsvetkova 1967). There have since been a host of  
    studies demonstrating differential deficits in production of either nouns  
    or verbs in naming tasks and sentence production that have revealed a  
    double dissociation and linked selective deficits in lexical access to  
    verbs with nonfluent aphasia and with dominant frontal lobe lesions  
    (Bates, Chen, et al. 1991; Berndt, Haendiges, et al. 1997; Berndt,  
    Mitchum, et al. 1997; Caramazza and Hillis 1991; Damasio and Tranel  
    1993; Daniele et al. 1994; Gleason et al. 1980; Hillis and Caramazza  
    1995; Miceli et al. 1984; Tranel et al. 2001; Zingeser and Berndt 1990;  
    Bak et al. 2001; Rhee, Antiquena, and Grossman 2001; Luzzatti et al.  
    2002; Cappa et al. 1998; Cotelli et al. 2006; Matzig et al. 2009;  
    Robinson et al. 2008). Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic  
    stimulation (rTMS) applied over the left anterior middle frontal gyrus  
    (thereby producing temporary dysfunction of this region) induces a  
    differential deficit in production of verbs relative to nouns (Shapiro et al.  
    2001; Cappelletti et al. 2008). Similar stimulation of posterior middle  
    frontal gyrus or pars triangularis of Broca's area does not have this  
    effect (Cappelletti et al. 2008). Because rTMS produces temporary and  
    quite focal cortical dysfunction and is unlikely to affect white matter  
    function, it may be a useful tool to further test the hypotheses proposed  
    in this section on the frontal representation of verb semantics.
  - |-
    Even in tasks involving homographic homophones, for example,
    
    (1) "Squash the bug"
    
    (2) "Squash and beans"
    
    Subjects with nonfluent aphasia tend to opt for the noun form (2),
    whereas subjects with fluent aphasia tend to opt for the verb form (1)
    (Goldberg and Goldfarb 2005). However, differential difficulty in
    producing verbs may sometimes occur in the setting of fluent aphasia
    (Berndt, Mitchum, et al. 1997; Miceli et al. 1984; Matzig et al. 2009).
    
    Three major linguistic explanations for differential impairment in
    verb production have been offered as nicely reviewed by Bates and
    colleagues (Bates, Chen, et al. 1991; Chen and Bates 1998):
    
    1. Semantic—conceptual The argument was that because nouns
    and verbs convey different meanings, their generation may reflect
    differential participation by anterior and posterior cortical
    representations. At the time, the specifics of those regions were
    largely a subject of speculation, but as we have seen, verbs have a
    multifocal distributed representation (thematic, implementational,
    and flavor), two components of which are supported by frontal
    systems, whereas noun processing is more substantially a
    temporal lobe function. The loss of knowledge supporting the
    thematic components of verb representations may be particularly
    critical.
  - |-
    2. Lexical  
    This account, proposed by Miceli and colleagues (Miceli et al. 1984; Miceli et al. 1988), argues that the noun—verb dissociation is a special case of a category-specific naming defect reflecting storage of different parts of the lexicon in different parts of the brain. This conclusion was motivated by the finding that subjects with Broca's aphasia were impaired, relative to those with anomic aphasia, on naming of actions (but were superior on naming of objects). The tasks employed by Miceli and colleagues, which involved only action naming, seemingly eliminated the potential impact of syntax or grammatical morphology. The fact that subjects with Broca's aphasia produced the corresponding noun in lieu of the verb (the two forms are uniformly different in Italian) 25% of the time led them to conclude that it could not be a semantic defect because production of the noun suggested an intact semantic representation.
    
    3. Grammatical  
    This has two versions:
    
    a. Morphologic: Verbs carry a heavy load of grammatical markings (though perhaps not more than nouns, especially in extremely richly inflected languages such as Turkish and Hungarian) and differential problems with grammatical morphology may thereby create particular difficulty with verbs.
    
    b. Syntactic: Verbs play a crucial role in syntactic processing, and, therefore, syntactic deficits might be associated with differential problems in verb retrieval.
    
    These three potential explanations are considered in more detail below.
    
    Semantic—Conceptual  
    
    The concept introduced earlier that verb representations have a prefrontal thematic component that is associated with the prefrontal capacity for plan generation, with its implicit temporal parameter, is a refinement of the semantic—conceptual explanation offered by Bates, Chen, et al. (1991). In this conceptualization, verb anomia may be viewed as a form of category-specific naming deficit (McCarthy and Warrington 1985). Notably, the semantic—conceptual explanation predicts that the noun—verb dissociation in aphasia should be observable in every language, regardless of the nature of its grammar.
  - |-
    The observation that subjects with aphasia show knowledge of the concept even when they cannot produce the verb ("tears" in lieu of "cry"; Miceli et al. 1984; Miceli et al. 1988; Berndt, Mitchum, et al. 1997) does not discredit the semantic—conceptual account. It only confirms that concept representations are often highly distributed and that a damaged brain will produce a response using whatever resources it has left—in the case of subjects with Broca's aphasia, the posterior association cortices can generate a slightly inaccurate, static (noun) semantic paraphasia corresponding to the desired verb, with which it is functionally linked. The semantic—conceptual account is fully consistent with the principles of brain function elaborated in this book and accommodates the experimental data from many but not all of the lesion studies. Lack of consistent agreement between studies of this problem should come as no surprise given the evidence of more posteriorly located implementation and flavor components of verb knowledge. This will be reviewed in some detail below (see the "Distributed Representations of Verb Semantics" section).
    
    Lexical
  - |-
    The lexical account, in a refined form, can also be reconciled with the principles elaborated in this book, and it accounts for some empirical observations that cannot by explained in terms of semantic—conceptual dysfunction. As I have argued, lexicons correspond to semantic—phonologic connectivity—fan arrays of connections between association cortices supporting semantic knowledge (the substrate for concept representations) and the perisylvian phonologic processor. Therefore, a lesion anywhere along the pathway between the substrate for concept representations and the phonologic processor can cause a lexical deficit. If that lesion is at the concept representations end of this pathway, proximal to the neural counterpart of the hidden-unit layer, then the lexical account is only subtly different from the semantic—conceptual account, albeit in an important way (see below). However, if the lesion is between the hidden-unit layer and the phonologic processor, then the deficit becomes genuinely lexical. The prefrontal representations that I have posited to modify distributed concept representations to achieve thematic instantiation of verbs could yield the phonologic form of verbs by two pathways: (1) prefrontal to largely postcentral association cortices (achieving the phonologic representation via verb-modified noun representations) and (2) prefrontal to perisylvian cortex (achieving the phonologic representation directly). Flavor and implementational components of verb representations could achieve phonologic realization through their direct influence on postcentral verb-modified noun representations, which then engage phonology, or they could achieve their phonologic realization through their influence on prefrontal, thematic components of verb representations, which then engage phonology. Engagement of verb phonology could rely on both prefrontal and postcentral perisylvian projections. It is also possible that the neural bases for lexical representations of verbs and nouns are not the same as the bases for the lexicons of verb and noun grammatic morphology, even as all are represented in peri- and parasylvian fan arrays. As we shall see, the evidence tends to favor relative verb reliance on frontal—perisylvian pathways for both verb lexical representation and verb grammatic marking, and relative noun reliance on posterior pathways. However, this issue is far from settled and may not be resolved in the near future.

    susceptible to a simple dichotomy (see, e.g., Lu et al. 2002 in the
    "Distributed Representations of Verb Semantics" section below).
    
    Caramazza and Hillis (1991; see also Hillis and Caramazza 1995;
    Hillis et al. 2003; Hillis, Tuffiash, and Caramazza 2002; Marshall, Pring,
    and Chiat 1998; Zingeser and Berndt 1990; Rapp and Caramazza 2002;
    Menichelli and Semenza 2006; Miceli et al. 1983; Druks 2006) have
    provided strong evidence that this modified lexical account does indeed
    account for observed linguistic behavior in some subjects. They reported
    two subjects, one with a selective deficit in verb access in oral
    production, the other with a selective deficit in written production. Both
    subjects produced semantic paraphasic errors in the differentially
    impaired modality. The modality specificity in these subjects indicates
    that their disorder cannot be caused by damage to the neural substrate
    for semantic knowledge. However, it is consistent with the
    conceptualization developed here (and elaborated further in later
    sections) of a substrate for verb semantics that has a major prefrontal
    component, which must directly access phonology, and a substrate for
    noun semantics that has multiple predominantly postcentral
    components, together with hemispheric fan arrays of connections from
    the respective association cortices that funnel into the perisylvian
    phonologic processor. Paralleling this array is a second fan array of
    connections funneling into a parasylvian orthographic—inscriptional
    processor. Yet another fan array funnels into a parasylvian orthographic—
    articulatory motor processor. Each fan array instantiates input and
    output lexicons. Functional—anatomic correlation is preserved at the
    origin of these arrays in convexity cortices. However, as the white
    matter tracts comprising the arrays funnel down to the perisylvian
    region, projections from near and far convexity cortices become
    spatially proximate and functional—anatomic correlation is potentially
    lost—one modest-sized lesion can simultaneously destroy projections
    from both near and far. From this arises a substantial probability that a
    given lesion will lead to differential noun—verb deficits relatively
  - |-
    Selectively affecting spoken or written language, and production or comprehension in one or the other of these modalities, and that small differences in the geography of white matter damage affecting these arrays will lead to substantial differences in the profile of impairment. I will refer to this as the "wild-card effect" because of its potential shattering impact on efforts to link deficit to lesion location."
    
    As noted above, the fan arrays supporting verb and noun lexicons may not be the same as the fan arrays supporting verb and noun grammatic morpheme lexicons. In any event, just as different patterns of damage to the fan arrays supporting verb and noun lexicons in various functional domains (production, comprehension, reading, writing) can lead to differential patterns of impairment, different patterns of damage to the arrays can have a differential impact on verb and noun grammatic morphology (Shapiro and Caramazza 2003; Shapiro, Shelton, and Caramazza 2000; Tsapkini, Jarema, and Kehayia 2002). Of course, the impact of fan array damage on grammatic morphology will be constrained by morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge to the extent that this knowledge survives perisylvian damage. In the presence of damage to the semantic representations of verbs or nouns, or the fan of connections linking them to the perisylvian domain of the morphologic pattern associator network, even inflection of pseudowords will be affected (Shapiro and Caramazza 2003) because word-like pseudowords have phonologic neighborhoods that are likely to engage semantic representations, however imprecisely.
  - |-
    The spatial dispersion of fan arrays can also account for fractional deficits in inflectional morphology, which have been shown with noun phrases. In German, articles are marked for both case and gender. Case marking of articles is defined by the thematic role assumed by the noun phrase, which in turn is related to the thematic component of verb meaning. In contrast, gender marking of articles is related to an intrinsic and invariant feature of noun representations. Because the substrate for verb meaning has a major prefrontal component, whereas noun meaning is predominantly posteriorly instantiated, one would expect differential impairment of case marking and sparing of gender marking in German subjects with Broca's aphasia. This is precisely what Bastiaanse et al. (2003) found. Of the article substitution errors they observed, 88% involved case, 11% gender, and 1% both.
    
    The observation made by Caramazza and Hillis (1991) of semantic paraphasias in the context of a lexical deficit poses a problem. It could indicate that their subjects had combined semantic and lexical deficits, the former accounting for the paraphasias. However, there may be another explanation. In my earlier discussions of the neural instantiation of the lexicons, it was at least implied that because there is generally no association between word sound and word meaning, a lesion of the substrate for the lexicons would not lead to semantic paraphasic errors. However, it has to be noted here that in proximal portions of the pattern associator networks instantiating the lexicons (e.g., pathways 1 and 4 in figure 2.1) semantic featural knowledge is still represented. Thus, semantic paraphasic errors could result from lesions of the proximal portion of the neural instantiation of an output lexicon, phonologic or inscriptional. Where exactly the hidden units lie that dissipate the semantic featural knowledge is uncertain.
    
    Grammatic
  - |-
    The morphologic-grammatic account for observations of differential impairment in verb production with frontal lesions runs into difficulty on several counts. A double dissociation between object and action naming has been observed in Hungarian (Osman-Sagi 1987), in which nouns are at least as morphologically encumbered as verbs, and in Chinese (Bates, Chen, et al. 1991), in which there are no inflectional morphemes of any kind for nouns or verbs. The most damning evidence against the morphologic-grammatic account comes from the study by Bates et al. (1991) of Chinese subjects with aphasia. Chinese makes considerable use of verb—noun compounds to express verbs. For example, the word for book is "shu," the word for look is "kan," and the word for "read" is "kan-shu," literally look—book. Because nouns and verbs are completely uninflected in Chinese, there is no reason to suspect an impairment in verb retrieval on morphologic grounds. Because nouns must often be preceded by a noun classifier, a word interposed between articles and numbers and the following nouns, arguably the most inconsistent and difficult aspect of the Chinese language, one might predict differential impairment of nouns in Broca's aphasia because of the demonstrated differential impairment of subjects with Broca's aphasia in noun classifier use (Tzeng, Chen, and Hung 1991). On the other hand, if the noun—verb dissociation has nothing to do with morphology, then one might predict differential involvement of the verb component of verb—noun compounds in subjects with Broca's aphasia and of the noun component in subjects with Wernicke's aphasia. Although Bates et al. (1991) failed to quite demonstrate a double dissociation (but see Chen and Bates 1998), there was a significant group by element interaction on naming verb—noun compounds. Subjects with Broca's aphasia produced either the target or an acceptable lexicalization thereof for 59.2% of the verb components and 68.8% of the noun components, whereas subjects with Wernicke's aphasia produced the target or an acceptable lexicalization for 93.4% of
  - |-
    The verb components and 63.9% of the noun components. These results provide strong support for the semantic—conceptual account and against a morphologic grammatic account.
    
    The grammatic—syntactic account cannot be addressed in a simple way because it is substantially conflated with the semantic account. A verb modifies a noun concept representation through the links its semantic representation has to the substrate for the noun representation as a predicative component of that noun representation. This is pure semantics. However, in language context, a verb adds an additional semantic feature to the noun representations it predicates, thereby transforming each noun (argument) representation in a way that gives it the appropriate thematic role attributes. In short, in language context, the semantics and syntax of verbs become two sides of the same coin, and this duality is maintained so long as the subcategorization properties of the verb allow only noun phrase arguments. Only with deviations from this constraint (e.g., "I remembered that she had told me that before") do we see syntax outpacing semantics, reflecting the role of sentence-level sequence knowledge. Because verbs are neurally wedded to their arguments, differential impairment of verb production in Broca's aphasia, if it is not lexical in origin, reflects coincident syntactic and semantic deficits. The attenuation of frontally supported attractor basins and attractor trenches by lesions should differentially affect verbs with more complex thematic components. Consistent with this concept, verb production deficits in aphasia go hand in hand with argument production deficits. The likelihood of correct sentence production by subjects with Broca's aphasia is greatest for single-argument verbs, least for three-argument and sentential complement verbs, and intermediate for two-argument verbs—seemingly a syntactic phenomenon. However, the likelihood of correct verb production in sentential context follows exactly the same gradient, revealing the parallel and underlying semantic phenomenon (Caplan and Hana 1998; Kim and Thompson 2000; Thompson, Lange, et al. 1997; Thompson and Disterhoft 1997).
  - |-
    However, there are circumstances in which the semantic—syntactic duality of verbs might not be reflected in behavior. Semantic—phonologic (lexical) deficits might lead to impairment in verb production that is disproportionate to impairment in production of argument structure (Bates, Chen, et al. 1991; Berndt, Haendiges, et al. 1997; Thompson, Lange, et al. 1997). The presence of options for number of arguments, because it creates a competition between two alternative sentence structures/concept configurations, expectably degrades sentence production (Thompson, Lange, et al. 1997) but, not surprisingly, does not impair verb retrieval because semantic support of the verb from its arguments is not reduced by the existence of argument structure options (Kim and Thompson 2000; Thompson, Lange, et al. 1997).
    
    Distributed Representations of Verb Semantics
    
    Thematic and Flavor (Manner—Path) Representations of Verbs
    
    In the elaboration of our model of grammar, the concept was introduced that verbs have a distributed representation composed of frontal (thematic and implementational) and postcentral (flavor) components. This hypothesis provides the basis for a double dissociation between theme and flavor impairment. This has been reported. Subjects with frontal lesions or Broca's aphasia are able to distinguish perceptual differences between verbs (e.g., between fall and rise, skate and slide); however, they have difficulty with differences substantially contingent on nuances of reciprocal thematic roles (e.g., buy-sell; lead—follow; Byng 1988; Breedin and Martin 1996; Manning and Warrington 1996; Berndt et al. 2004; Jones 1984; Saffran, Schwartz, and Marin 1980b). It seems that in the face of frontal lesions, the greater the symmetry in verb arguments that is attributable to the verb's impact in modifying argument representations, the greater the difficulty in comprehending the direction of the asymmetry and hence in comprehending the

    " sentence.' On the other hand, subjects with more posterior lesions,
    particularly lesions implicating visual association cortices, have minimal
    difficulty with thematic aspects of verb meaning but do poorly when
    having to make flavor distinctions (Breedin and Martin 1996; Breedin,
    Saffran, and Coslett 1994; Marshall et al. 1995/96). Subjects with
    posterior lesions also show loss of specificity of verb flavor processing.
    Loss of specificity is a characteristic feature of degraded semantic
    representations (Patterson 2007). For example, a subject with severe
    damage to visual association cortices caused by herpes simplex
    encephalitis had disproportionate difficulty in verifying specific verbal
    attributes (predicative features) of living things (e.g., galloping,
    pounding) but not general attributes (e.g., eating, sleeping; Moss et al.
    1998). Subjects with Alzheimer's disease, who have predominantly
    temporal–parietal pathology with relative sparing of frontal cortex, were
    more successful in a sentence completion task in producing general than
    specific verbs (e.g., clean vs. scrub—dust and cut vs. chop; Kim and
    Thompson 2004).
    
    Damage to the substrate for the thematic component of verb meaning
    (or its connections to the perisylvian region), with relative sparing of the
    substrate for the flavor component, may account for the phenomenon of
    relatively preserved action naming (in which thematic knowledge is less
    important) despite a severe paucity of verbs in spontaneous speech, in
    which thematic knowledge is essential (Druks and Carroll 2005; Bates,
    Chen, et al. 1991; De Renzi and di Pellegrino 1995).

    account for the particular difficulty subjects with Broca's aphasia  
    encounter in producing sentences in which the grammatic subject is the  
    recipient of an action—for example, in response to a picture of a boy  
    being hit in the head with a baseball (Saffran, Schwartz, and Marin  
    1980b). To the extent that the manner component more readily  
    predicates animate noun representations (i.e., has higher attractor basin  
    compatibility for animate nouns), disproportionate reliance on the  
    manner component will prime "boy" in a sentence like this, leading to a  
    production beginning "The boy...," thereby trapping the subject into an  
    attempt at formulating the passive—a formidable task for someone with  
    deficits in grammatic morphology and sentence-level sequence  
    knowledge—and prevent use of the simple active voice form "The ball  
    hit the boy."
    
    Earlier in the book (in chapter 3, "Semantic Contributions to Syntax"  
    section, "Verb Thematic, Implementational, and Flavor Representations"  
    subsection), it was posited that subjects with MCA distribution strokes  
    should exhibit relative sparing of use of verbs that, with or without  
    adjunctive phrases, connote movement in extrapersonal space (e.g., "the  
    bird flew over the house"). The reasoning was that the flavor of these  
    verbs is likely to be instantiated in very dorsal cortices (frontal, parietal,  
    and occipital) that are likely to be spared by such strokes (although fan  
    array components linking these neural networks to perisylvian cortex  
    might be damaged). Kemmerer and Tranel (2000) have provided  
    empirical support for this hypothesis in a study of action naming.
  - |-
    The degree to which the meaning of a verb is instantiated in thematic or flavor representational components likely interacts with the properties of the arguments to influence interpretation. Thus, animacy contrasts can overcome the potential ambiguity associated with verbs with predominantly thematic representations (e.g., "He always follows the rules"). Ambiguity may be introduced with verbs with a prominent manner representation if the verb, in conjunction with strong grammatical cues (e.g., SVO order in English), acts to severely distort the natural attractor basins of its arguments (e.g., "The cute bunny attacked the pit bulls'").

    Subjects with Alzheimer's disease are impaired in object and action naming (e.g., Masterson et al. 2007). When one considers that, for the most part, the verbs used in such studies have a major flavor representation and the tasks employed do not tax the thematic component, this should be no surprise—the pathology of Alzheimer's disease heavily involves lateral and inferior temporal cortex implicated in visual representations of objects and flavor representations of verbs. In addition, subjects with Alzheimer's disease have been shown to be severely impaired in their ability to learn the flavor component of a novel verb (actually, an archaic verb: to "lour"': to look angry or sullen, as if in disapproval) but only moderately impaired in learning the thematic matrix of this verb (verb argument structure, subcategorization rules; Grossman et al. 2007). Whether or not the hippocampus is involved in this type of knowledge acquisition, particularly in subjects with extensive paramedian temporal pathology (as in Alzheimer's disease) remains a source of controversy. If the hippocampus is involved, it is through the closure of long-loop cortical—hippocampal complex—cortical connections (Alvarez and Squire 1994; McClelland, McNaughton, and O'Reilly 1995; Rolls and Treves 1998; Squire and Zola-Morgan 1991). Thus, with or without hippocampal mediation, the integrity of cerebral cortex is the key. This particularly poor acquisition of flavor knowledge by subjects with Alzheimer's disease correlates nicely with the severe pathology of visual association cortices in this disease (Braak and Braak 1991) and the established deficits in action perception in these subjects (Gilmour et al. 1994). The more modest impairment in learning the thematic matrix is consistent with the minimal prefrontal pathology found in Alzheimer's disease until mid and late stages (Braak and Braak 1991). In further studies employing the same experimental paradigm, involving subjects with frontotemporal dementia, Grossman and colleagues (Murray et al. 2007) found that subjects with pure social—executive dysfunction, as well as subjects with
  - |-
    Progressive nonfluent aphasia, had particularly severe impairment in acquisition of thematic matrix knowledge, whereas subjects with semantic dementia were particularly impaired in learning the association between the verb and its pictorial representation. These studies in dementia populations provide additional evidence of a double dissociation between deficits of verb theme and verb flavor knowledge.

    Lu et al. (2002) found that subjects who had undergone left anterior temporal lobectomy demonstrated equal mild impairment in naming videos depicting objects and actions, relative to subjects who had undergone right anterior temporal lobectomy. However, subjects with left anterior temporal lobectomy were differentially impaired in naming videos depicting objects used by humans (e.g., cup, fan, fork, hammer) and videos depicting human actions (e.g., cutting, dialing, digging, drilling), whereas they performed relatively normally in naming videos depicting living objects (e.g., ant, apple, carrot, cat) and naming videos of actions characteristic of nonhuman objects (e.g., blooming, boiling, dripping, flying). One possible explanation for this finding is that objects used by humans predicate practic verbs, which have a frontal implementational component, and human actions both have an implementational component and are transitive, thereby strongly engaging thematic components of verb meaning. By contrast, living objects, on average, tend to engage verbs with flavor components that involve pure motion, eliciting predominantly a posterior temporal flavor representation. The actions characteristic of nonhuman objects have little implementational representation, and they are largely intransitive. Thus, they tend to function as adjectives and minimally engage a thematic meaning component. The fact that naming objects of human use and human actions tends to be disrupted by left anterior temporal lobectomy suggests that the pathway linking the flavor with thematic and implementational components of the distributed representations of practic verbs and verbs engaged by tools is the inferior occipito—temporal—frontal fasciculus (Catani et al. 2002; Duffau et al. 2005), which was likely to be damaged by the surgery. However, natural objects and their associated actions may rely to a greater degree on direct pathways between visual association cortices and the left posterior perisylvian region and to a lesser degree on frontal thematic components, and thus be less affected by the damage to long connections that may occur with left anterior temporal lobectomy.
    
    Concreteness Effects
  - |-
    Normal subjects and most subjects with aphasia caused by stroke perform better on tasks involving concrete words than on tasks involving abstract words (Papagno, Capasso, and Miceli 2009), a phenomenon referred to as the concreteness effect. However, certain subjects with posterior lesions, most notably those with semantic dementia or sequelae of herpes simplex encephalitis, display a reversed concreteness effect with nouns (Breedin, Saffran, and Coslett 1994; Marshall et al. 1995/96)—they perform better with abstract than concrete nouns—and they show relative preservation of thematic components of verb meaning, even as flavor components are severely affected. These findings are consistent with Marshall's concept of distributed semantic representations (Marshall et al. 1995/96) and the hypothesis proposed earlier that the frontal lobes, by virtue of their role in simultaneous engagement and manipulation of multiple distributed concept representations, and hence the maintenance of working associations, might play a major role in the instantiation of both verbs and abstract nouns—because both appear to be based on contextual linking of representations in multiple, often widespread, brain regions.
    
    "Heavy" versus "Light" Verbs
  - |-
    Several studies have focused on the effects of verb frequency and what has been deemed semantic complexity in verb production. In some studies, subjects who demonstrate impairment in production of verbs relative to nouns tend to rely on the highest frequency verbs, called "light" verbs (Jesperson 1965), such as have, do, come, go, give, get, make, and take, and to underutilize "heavy" verbs with richer meaning (e.g., grab vs. get, grab indicating a particular manner of getting; Berndt, Haendiges, et al. 1997; Kohn, Lorch, and Pearson 1989). However, Breedin, Saffran, and Schwartz (1998), in a particularly extensive study, found precisely the opposite. In production of the Cinderella story, subjects with agrammatic aphasia produced more heavy than light verbs. In a story completion paradigm, they found that most of their subjects also more often made use of heavy verbs, more often made use of specific verbs (e.g., wipe vs. clean), and more often made use of verbs that indicated a change of place or state as a result of the action (e.g., smashed vs. hit). In the process, these subjects demonstrated a reverse frequency effect, preferring lower frequency verbs. These results were precisely replicated in a subsequent investigation of 23 subjects that included nine subjects from the original study (Barde, Schwartz, and Boronat 2006). Kim and Thompson (2004) found, in a somewhat less constrained sentence completion paradigm than the one used by Breedin et al., that subjects with Broca's aphasia were equally impaired in the production of heavy and light verbs but more impaired in the production of general verbs than of specific verbs. However, in the unconstrained context of narrative, they showed a predilection for heavy over light verbs.
  - |-
    The reasons for the discrepancies between the results of these studies are not clear. In particular, the patient selection criteria in the Berndt, Haendiges, et al. (1997) and Breedin, Saffran, and Schwartz (1998) studies were the same: subjects were recruited because of selective deficits in verb retrieval; the percentage of subjects with agrammatism or Broca's aphasia in the two studies was approximately the same; and the findings were equally discrepant for the subjects with Broca's aphasia, with and without impairment in grammatic morphology. In discussion that follows, I will go with the preponderance of evidence—that with lesions associated with differential deficits in verb production or Broca's aphasia, there is selective impairment in the use of light verbs.
    
    To the extent that differential involvement of light—heavy or general—specific verbs is a genuine phenomenon in certain brain-injured populations, it may reflect the variable dependence of individual verb meaning on neural substrates for frontal (thematic) and posterior (flavor) components. The meaning of light verbs, though instantiated in both anterior and posterior cortical regions, is more substantially defined by their thematic—cause component, which is prefrontally represented, whereas heavy verbs, although also instantiated in both regions, derive a relatively greater portion of their meaning from the flavor component, which is posteriorly represented. Light verbs will therefore be affected to a greater degree by frontal damage and heavy verbs by posterior damage. Gordon and Dell (2003) developed a connectionist model that instantiated the distributed representation of verb meaning discussed here and showed the predicted light—heavy patterns of differential verb impairment with "frontal" and "posterior" lesions.

    Studies of subjects with strokes are also susceptible to the vagaries of
    lesion distribution in the individuals investigated. Subjects with MCA
    distribution strokes have quite variable relative involvement of
    prefrontal and posterior temporal cortices, and this may contribute to the
    discrepant results of Berndt, Haendiges, et al. (1997) and Kohn, Lorch,
    and Pearson (1989), on the one hand, and Breedin, Saffran, and
    Schwartz (1998), Kim and Thompson (2004), and Barde, Schwartz, and
    Boronat (2006) on the other. Furthermore, regardless of the integrity of
    semantic fields and the proximal portions of their perisylvian projections
    (which still carry semantic feature knowledge), MCA distribution
    strokes have wild-card effects related to damage to perisylvian
    components of the fan arrays (see "Deficits in Verb Production in
    Broca's Aphasia—Potential Mechanisms" section, "Lexical" subsection
    above)." These can act to obscure the frontal_posterior representational
    effects posited to account for relative sparing of heavy verb use with
    anterior lesions. The ideal test of the differential frontal—posterior,
    thematic/manner—pathway damage account for differences in heavy
    versus light and specific versus general verb use would be a contrast
    between subjects with progressive nonfluent aphasia or the behavioral
    variant of frontotemporal dementia, on the one hand, and those with
    semantic dementia on the other. In fact, Kim and Thompson (2004) have
    reported that subjects with Alzheimer's disease (with their
    predominantly posterior pathology) are more successful in producing
    general than specific verbs although they showed no evidence of
    differential involvement of heavy over light verbs.
    
    Unaccusative and Unergative Verbs
  - |-
    An unaccusative verb is an intransitive verb whose syntactic subject is not a semantic agent. Examples include to fall, to bounce, to break, to sink, to melt, to drop, to roll, to crash, and to boil. An unergative verb is an intransitive verb that has an agent subject. Examples include to run, to sleep, to jump, to bark, to wink, to snore, to sit, to swim, to pray, to laugh, to cry, to crawl, and to sneeze. Subjects with agrammatic aphasia exhibit greater impairment in the production of unaccusative verbs than in the production of unergative verbs (Kegle 1995; Lee and Thompson 2004; Thompson 2003). These authors have offered syntactic explanations for this phenomenon: Kegle that unaccusative verbs are more complex because they require movement of the single-verb argument in the translation from d- to s-structure; Thompson and Lee that they are more complex because they require greater movement along the syntactic tree.

    Neither of these syntactic explanations can easily be reconciled with
    the neural model of grammar presented here. Instead, I suggest an
    alternative explanation based on the semantic properties of these verb
    classes. Both unaccusative and unergative verbs have a _ thematic
    representational component that is likely to be damaged by lesions
    causing agrammatic aphasia. A brief consideration of the examples of
    unaccusative verbs listed above suggests that they are either state-
    changing verbs or verbs characterized by a flavor of intrinsic movement.
    Both flavors are represented in posterior temporal cortex, inferior (state
    changing), or ventral inferolateral (intrinsic movement). Thus, these
    verbs have one or two nonthematic representational components, located
    in the same general region of the brain. Although neither component is
    very likely to be directly damaged by MCA distribution strokes, both are
    at the mercy of the wild-card effect of fan array lesions. In contrast,
    unergative verbs, by and large, have a single flavor component (intrinsic
    movement) plus an implementational component, in addition to their
    thematic representation. Although the flavor component is also likely
    instantiated in ventral posterolateral temporal cortices, as _ for
    unaccusative verbs, and equally susceptible to direct and wild-card
    lesion effects, the presence of three representational components
    instantiated in three separate areas of brain (prefrontal, precentral gyrus,
    postcentral) might account for the relatively less severe impairment in
    production of unergative verbs. Moreover, for unergative verbs
    describing arm or leg motion, the implementational component is
    represented high on the cortical convexity, and thus less likely to be
    directly affected by the infarct, and for unergative verbs describing
    whole body movements, the implementational representation is likely to
    be bilateral. The general operational principle here is that the greater the
    number of semantic representational components and the greater their
    geographic dispersion, the greater the likelihood of relative preservation
    of function. In addition, the lack of an implementational component for
    unaccusative verbs may have particular importance. The performance by
    Subjects with aphasia with unaccusative verbs improves when these
    verbs are given an implementational component by rendering them

    transitive (Bastiaanse and Zonnefeld 2005; McAllister et al. 2009), for
    example,
    
    "The ball bounced." — "The boy bounced the ball."
    
    Psychological Verbs
    
    Psychological verbs denote mental states. Two classes have been
    distinguished:
    
    1. Mental state experienced by the subject (SubjExp; e.g., "Mary
    admires Janet'). Other examples include fears, cherishes,
    despises, and distrusts.
    
    2. Mental state experienced by the object (ObjExp; e.g., "Janet
    amused Mary''). Other examples include angers, intrigues,
    frightens, and bothers.
    
    Psychological verbs have been a subject of considerable interest in
    the field of linguistics, and quite a variety of theoretical arguments have
    been offered to explain the essential difference between the two classes
    (Thompson and Lee 2009). The common thread to these arguments is
    that ObjExp verbs are more complex. It is thus reasonable to
    hypothesize that production and comprehension of these verbs might be
    differentially impaired with Broca's aphasia. Thompson and Lee, in
    testing this hypothesis, found that subjects with Broca's aphasia, as
    posited, were more impaired in the production (sentence generation to a
    picture + verb to be used) of ObjExp verbs than of SubjExp verbs and
    that, whereas they did relatively better with SubjExp verbs in active
    voice sentences, they did relatively better with ObjExp verbs in passive
    voice sentences (though overall they did much worse with passive voice
    sentences). These results were interpreted as supporting the complexity
    account.
    
    For SubjExp verbs, all errors involved inappropriate substitution of
    the active voice for the passive voice, reflecting the well-known
    difficulty that subjects with Broca's aphasia have with production of
    passives, an infrequently used form in general and particularly with
    SubjExp verbs. The pattern of errors with ObjExp verbs was
    heterogeneous but generally fell into two categories:
    
    Passive substitution for active—for example, "The boy is
    bothered by the girl" (target: The boy bothers the girl).
    
    Active substitution for passive—for example, "The man
    frightened the girl" (target: The man is frightened by the girl).
  - |-
    The complexity account finds no place in the model of grammar introduced here. However, the pattern of errors with ObjExp verbs can be accounted for in terms of slips involving competing attractor domains. First, in English, the passive voice is more often used with ObjExp verbs than is the active voice (see Gennari and MacDonald 2009). Thus, with these verbs, the usual overwhelming statistical predominance of the active voice is reduced, enhancing the probability of a slip to a passive voice sequence. Second, with ObjExp verbs, the salience of the noun that is most tightly linked to the verb—the object—is enhanced such that it is more likely to rival the subject as the preeminent noun phrase in the sentence—a place normally held by the subject agent. Consequently, there is a greater probability of a slip in thematic role assignment.
    
    In short, we do not need to resort to complexity accounts to interpret the pattern of results in the experiment of Thompson and Lee (2009): we can explain the findings in terms of the statistical regularities of the language and the greater noisiness and enhanced probability that activity functions in damaged networks will settle into attractor basins (or trenches) corresponding to incorrect responses.
    
    Verb Naming Errors as a Reflection of the Nature of Neural Networks Supporting Verb Meaning
    
    A number of studies of the semantic representation of nouns have shown differences in naming errors for living things and artifacts (e.g., in semantic dementia) that are related to the fact that living things have more features in common than do artifacts (see, e.g., Rogers et al. 2004). There are more opportunities for coordinate ("horse" in lieu of "zebra") and superordinate ("animal" in lieu of "horse") naming errors with living things, hence a higher frequency of these error types and a lower frequency of nonresponses in naming living things relative to naming artifacts.
  - |-
    There is evidence of a comparable phenomenon affecting verb naming in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, another disorder predominantly affecting posterior cortices, at least in early and mid stages of the disease. Verbs have a shallower hierarchy of meaning than do nouns (Miller and Fellbaum 1991). For example, to jog is to run, which is to move, whereas a Labrador is a dog, which is a mammal, which is an animal, which is a living thing. Consequently, with damage to posterior cortices, one might expect more nonresponses and descriptive errors and less superordinate errors with verbs relative to nouns. This prediction has been borne out in empirical studies (Robinson et al. 1996; White-Devine et al. 1996).
    
    Verb Representations: A Summary
  - |-
    To summarize, the meaning of verbs in general appears to have a distributed representation that has (1) prefrontal components having to do with the thematic attribute of their meaning, the processes of modifying and manipulating the relationship between their arguments, and reconciliation of argument structure and _ subcategorization requirements with regularities in knowledge of sentence-level sequence; (2) posterior components supporting flavor attributes; and (3) an implementational component in premotor and motor cortex (Damasio and Tranel 1993; Lu et al. 2002). Abstract verbs (e.g., "to belong to") may be represented as an aggregate of contextually associated concrete representations, in analogy to abstract nouns, and thus be more dependant on prefrontal capacity for maintenance of working associations. Of these three verb representational components, it appears that the frontal component that supports the thematic attribute of meaning is preeminent and that subjects with damage to this component will consistently demonstrate serious impairment in verb use. This is nowhere better demonstrated than in experiments involving homophonic noun—verb phones in which subjects show no difficulty completing a sentence with the word as a noun but perform poorly when they need to complete a sentence with the word as a verb (Laiacona and Caramazza 2004). It seems likely that the thematic component of verb representations will respect the regions of "what" and "where" pathway specialization of prefrontal cortex; the manner—path (flavor) component will respect the separation of movement representations (at the temporo—parietal occipital junction),° from more dorsal components of the "where" pathway instantiating spatial location, and _ the implementational component will respect the organization of the motor homunculus in precentral and premotor cortex. These various representational components, while separate, are likely to be connected and interdependent. As Farah and McClelland (1991) have demonstrated, damage to one of two connected networks will adversely impact the function of the other by virtue of the degradation of the input from the damaged network to the intact network. Thus, a subject with damage to one component of the multifocal distributed representation of verbs might still be able, in certain circumstances, to use verbs that are

    to a greater degree dependent upon other components (e.g., in naming
    pictured heavy verbs) but would not be expected to perform normally.
    The particular pattern of performance by a subject with brain injury will
    reflect the interaction of lesion geography with the quasi-regular
    domains implicated, subject to perturbation by the wild-card effect.
    
    In contrast, the representation of noun meaning appears to be
    predominantly postcentral, as reflected particularly in studies of
    semantic dementia (Rogers et al. 2004), with the possible exception of
    human implements, which may include a frontal component in their
    distributed representations (Lu et al. 2002). Abstract nouns may be
    represented as an aggregate of the representations of more concrete
    nouns and, therefore, like verbs, may be particularly dependent on the
    maintenance of working associations, hence prefrontal function. The
    differential cerebral representation of noun and verb meaning provides
    the basis for differential impairment in the context of brain lesions.
    
    The possibility has been raised that the grammatic class difference
    observed in aphasia may be based on other factors, such as imageability
    (Bird et al. 2000). Imageability likely reflects the extent to which a word
    is represented in postcentral association cortices, particularly visual, and
    the limbic system (emotion; Paivio, Yuille, and Madigan 1968). The
    imageability account seeks to provide a unidimensional explanation for
    noun—verb differences that is not explicitly linked to brain geography. In
    contrast, the multicomponent differential cerebral representation of
    nouns and verbs discussed here offers a multidimensional explanation
    for noun—verb differences that accords with the distributed network
    model of brain organization introduced in this book, even as it
    accommodates the empirical data, including the observation that nouns,
    on average, are more imageable than verbs (Bird, Howard, and Franklin
    2003). Empirical studies of subjects with aphasia have also shown that
    the noun—verb grammatic class distinction remains when imageability is
    carefully controlled for, even as the production of both nouns and verbs
    is influenced by imageability (Berndt et al. 2002).

    The semantic representations of verbs and nouns interact with the
    perisylvian pattern associator supporting morphologic sequence
    knowledge. The morphologic pattern associator provides the grammatic
    morphologic options, but the choice of options is heavily constrained by
    input (via the fan arrays) from verb and noun semantic representations
    that have been reciprocally modified by their interaction in language
    context (see equation 3.3). Damage to the morphologic processor, which
    is very common with MCA territory strokes, is reflected in the
    grammatic morphologic deficits of perisylvian aphasias (Wernicke's,
    conduction, Broca's). One might expect that, in general, because of the
    principle of graceful degradation, subjects with damage limited to verb
    or noun semantic representations and sparing perisylvian cortex might
    exhibit minimal deficits in grammatic morphology. The most obvious
    potential exception would be the circumstance in which the factor
    influencing grammatic morphology is itself a representation distributed
    broadly in prefrontal cortex, likely the case with tense (see the
    "Grammatic Morphology—Special Cases" section, "Tense versus
    Agreement" subsection below) or, in posterior association cortices,
    likely the case with gender.
    
    On the other hand, it seems conceivable that damage to the fan arrays
    might so loosen the constraints on the morphologic sequence network
    that category-specific verb or noun lexical deficits might be associated
    with corresponding category-specific deficits in verb or noun grammatic
    morphology (case, gender, number, and person marking), particularly in
    the context of concurrent damage to the morphologic processor.
    Subjects have been reported who displayed isolated category-specific
    lexical semantic deficits affecting nouns or verbs with preserved
    grammatic morphology. Other subjects have been reported in whom the
    category-specific verb or noun deficit was associated with a
    corresponding category-specific deficit in grammatic morphology
    (Laiacona and Caramazza 2004). The precise conditions leading to these
    two very different deficit combinations have not been elucidated.
    Simulations employing connectionist models might help to shed some
    light on this problem.
    
    Syntax: Phrase Structure Rules
  - |-
    The extreme rarity of word order errors in aphasia (Bates et al. 1988; Kemmerer, Tranel, and Zdanczyk 2009), notwithstanding the vast opportunities for such misorderings, particularly in the context of perisylvian infarcts, provides the strongest evidence of the degree of redundancy of representations in the brain of the multiword sequence knowledge implicitly manifesting as phrase structure rules and suggests the presence of redundant right-hemisphere sequence knowledge. Word Slips in normal language that can be classed as structural errors provide evidence of this same sequence knowledge—but also the occasional availability of two competing forms (competing regularities within a quasi-regular domain), for example,
    
    "Roll up it" from "Roll it up'/"Roll up the carpet"
    
    "Turn on the light on" from "Turn on the light'/"Turn the light on"
    (Stemberger 1984).
  - |-
    The preservation of word order is directly analogous to the preservation in aphasia of order of up to four bound grammatic morphemes that may be appended to nouns in Turkish and Hungarian (see tables 4.1 and 4.2; see also the "Grammatic Morphology—Cross-Linguistic Aphasia Studies" section, "Sparing of Grammatic Morphology in Production of Richly Inflected Languages: Implications for Neuroanatomy of Grammar" subsection below). Redundancy in the representation of morphologic sequence knowledge, reflecting statistical regularities in language experience, also accounts for the absence of morphemic omissions that in highly inflected languages would generate an illegal "naked stem" (Stemberger 1984).
    
    The rarity of word order errors by subjects with aphasia that involve phrase structure rules, and the rarity of grammatic morpheme order errors in such richly inflected languages as Hungarian and Turkish, reflects the overwhelming regularity of these orders in their respective languages and the encoding of these regularities in the neural substrate for morphologic sequence knowledge. This principle receives further support from data on word order errors at the phrase level that involve sequence knowledge that is less regular and less redundantly represented. To place these data in proper perspective, it is important to recall that the order of words in a phrase and the series of grammatic morphemes suffixed to a noun or verb reflect an interaction between modified semantic representations and the substrate for morphologic sequence knowledge. Thus, "the blue bird" corresponds to two specific modifications of the distributed concept representation of bird impacting, via the fan arrays, morphologic sequence knowledge constraining word order. Suffixes corresponding to case, person, and number also correspond to semantic modifications of a concept, or of a verb modifying that concept, and are translated into a representation in the morphologic sequence knowledge domain.
  - |-
    Kemmerer, Tranel, and Zdanczyk (2009) tested two classes of phrase-level sequence knowledge in 34 subjects with brain lesions. One class involved the type of phrase structure knowledge discussed in the foregoing: the order of article, adjective, and noun. Performance was mildly impaired in only one aphasic subject. The second class involved phrase-level sequence knowledge of a somewhat more subtle nature—the preferred order of different types of adjectives preceding a noun in English. Some orders are very consistently preferred, such as that of adjectives adding features of size and color (e.g., "a huge gray elephant" but not "a gray huge elephant"). Other orders are less consistently preferred, such as that of adjectives adding features of value and size (e.g., "a nice small cup" vs. "a small nice cup"). When tested on this knowledge, subjects with focal brain lesions, most often in the dominant perisylvian region, exhibited impaired performance, and the degree of impairment was greatest for less consistently preferred sequences (e.g., value + size). The production of adjective-noun sequences reflects an interaction between semantic representations and morphologic sequence knowledge, no less than the types of sequences discussed at the beginning of this section. The findings of Kemmerer et al. indicate that the explanation is not semantically constrained versus semantically unconstrained syntax as they suggested. Rather, the findings suggest that production of all of these various sequences entails a semantic—morphologic sequence interaction and that the performance of subjects with aphasia reflects the statistical regularity of different sequence types—very high for article + adjective + noun, intermediate for size adjective + color adjective + noun, low for value adjective + size adjective + noun.
  - |-
    Interestingly, Kemmerer, Tranel, and Zdanczyk (2009) noted that
    adjective order (e.g., value — size — color) is substantially consistent
    across a large number of languages, and even between languages
    employing prepositioned and postpositioned adjectival sequences. This
    suggests that the order regularities discussed above are not serendipitous
    but rather reflect the properties of the specific regions of the brain
    engaged and the nature of the modifications associated with particular
    adjectives. Size and color, in general, predominantly involve visual
    representations. Color may be a more consistent feature of the typical
    evocation of a given distributed visual representation than size.
    Elephants are likely always conceived of as gray in color. Size is an
    important feature, but perhaps a less consistently evoked one because it
    involves engagement of a representation of an elephant in an
    environmental context (see Kemmerer, Tranel, and Zdanczyk 2009 for
    related discussion in more traditional terms). Thus, the existence of
    variably robust adjectival order conventions reflects _ statistical
    regularities of use wired into morphologic sequence knowledge, but the
    evolution of similar patterns of regularity in multiple languages likely
    reflects semantic influences.
    
    Grammatic Morphology—Cross-Linguistic Aphasia Studies
  - |-
    A host of pioneering cross-linguistic studies of aphasia were performed  
    in the late 1980s under the leadership of Bates and MacWhinney (Bates,  
    Wulfeck, and MacWhinney 1991) and Menn and Obler (1990b). Cross-  
    linguistic studies continue to flourish, but unfortunately, the uniquely  
    productive approach of Bates and MacWhinney, premised on the  
    existence of language-specific statistical regularities, is now seldom in  
    evidence. The studies of Bates and MacWhinney and their colleagues  
    provide the foundation for our current understanding of the neural  
    representation of grammatic morphology. They reveal that alterations in  
    English grammatic morphology in aphasia that we have long assumed to  
    be universal in fact represent a very special case. The situation with  
    richly inflected languages is very different. Relevant properties of the  
    languages studied in this cross-linguistic research are summarized in  
    table 4.1. The results are briefly summarized in tables 4.2 and 4.3. The  
    major findings are discussed below.

    SVO preference but frequent option to omit subject and use word order variations.  
    Animacy provides most important cue to meaning.
    
    Austere marking system: no conjugation of verbs, no declension of nouns, no  
    agreement or case markers of any kind.
    
    Only one element of grammatic morphology: nominal classifiers, a word placed  
    between articles, numbers, and certain other modifiers and the noun. Influenced by  
    the semantic features of the noun it precedes. Highly specific and idiosyncratic,  
    viewed as the most difficult aspect of Chinese grammar, often a challenge for  
    native speakers.
    
    Strong SVO word order preference in neutral main clauses and SOV in embedded  
    clauses and past participles provides principal guide to meaning.
    
    Case marking of pronouns but not nouns; when present, case marking trumps  
    word order as a cue to meaning.
    
    Highly consistent use of person marking system for verbs, which, though partially  
    degenerate, is more elaborate than in English.

    Here is the extracted and corrected text:
    
    Articles marked for number and gender but not case, and number and gender marking in modern Dutch largely degenerate: masculine-feminine singular: "de"; neutral singular: "het"; all plural: "de."
    
    Very strong SVO word order preference provides principal guide to meaning; passive voice consistently marked by "is/was ... by" construction (both high in cue validity).
    
    Vestigial case and gender marking limited to the pronoun system; subject-verb agreement marking system is complex, is inconsistent, is at times contradictory, and provides weak guide to meaning (low cue validity).
    
    Limited but complicated system of verb morphology, including conjugations for person, number, tense, and aspect.
    
    Noun modifier agreement very limited, for example, "one bird," "many birds." Dropping article is often optional and sometimes mandatory (e.g., "Dogs are a man's best friend"; "John's house"). Only three forms of article.

    Extensive case marking system with high cue validity (albeit some gaps and inconsistencies, making it less reliable than in Hungarian and Turkish); involves articles and adjectives rather than nouns (unlike most case marking languages) as well as pronouns; case is the single most important cue in assigning thematic roles. Extensive system of verb morphology, including conjugations for person, number, tense, and aspect.
    
    Far more noun-verb agreement contrasts than in English.
    
    Noun modifiers must agree with governing nouns in number, gender and case.
    
    Six indefinite and six definite article forms; 28 possible gender-number-case combinations involving articles.
    
    More reliance on animacy contrasts than English or Italian, but primarily in settings left ambiguous by case and agreement markers.
    
    Neutral word order is SOV with indefinite objects and SVO with definite objects, and further variations are allowed.
    
    ‘Two major verb conjugations, which depend on word order: (1) definite conjugation used with definite objects and SVO and (2) indefinite conjugation used with indefinite objects and SOV.

    More complex case marking than Turkish (and no nominative case marking) and inflectional marking in general less consistent than in Turkish (lower cue validity). Case marking more reliable than in German,
    
    Accusative case marking (suffixation) almost always present and the backbone of sentence interpretation; however, five possible vowel choices before marking accusative, complex criteria for choice, and a dozen major stem modifications when accusative marker is added. Marking less perceivable than in Turkish.
    Verb-object agreement marking (medium cue validity).
    
    Extensive omission of articles permitted and articles not marked for case, number, or gender.
    
    Animacy influences inference of meaning,
    
    Use of "pro-drop" form—omission of pronoun subject with complete reliance on verb marking—70% of the time in informal discourse.
    
    Entirely variable word order but slight preference for SVO; flexibility of word ordering within subordinate clauses (a rare feature).
    
    Vestigial case marking limited to the pronoun system but quite consistent.
    Extensive system of verb morphology, including conjugations for person, number, tense, and aspect.

    Use of "pro-drop" form—omission of pronoun subject with complete reliance on verb marking—70% of the time in informal discourse.
    
    SVO is default word order but weakly preferred (low cue validity) with considerably more word order flexibility than English. Two passive voice forms, one preferred in formal discourse, which uses an "is/was ... by" marker convention, the other the "a" marker plus a clitic (e.g., "A la chica la encuentrra el perro." —"The girl is found by the dog"). "Por" and "a" used for many other purposes.
    
    Vestigial but quite consistent case marking limited to the pronoun system.
    
    Highly consistent subject-verb agreement marking system, like Italian, with no null inflections. Agreement markers serve as the major cues to meaning. Gender and number agreement of articles and adjectives with nouns enhances salience of agreement markers.
    
    Extensive use of "pro-drop" form—omission of pronoun subject with complete reliance on verb marking.
    
    Canonical word order is SOV, but other variations are allowed. Unlike Hungarian, no verb conjugation by word order interaction. When direct object is indefinite and not case marked, SOV is required.
    
    One of the most elaborately marked languages spoken; extensive use of bound grammatical morphemes prefixed to nouns and verbs. Up to four markers appended at once (agglutination) in absolutely reliable order.
    
    Accusative case marking (suffixation) uniformly present (with important obligatory exception of indefinite objects) and the backbone of sentence interpretation; much simpler and more consistent than Hungarian: four vowel choices in adding marker, made according to rules of vowel harmony, and minimal stem modifications. Accusative marking adds a full and readily perceived syllable. Case marking more reliable than in German.
    
    Subject-verb agreement marking of medium cue validity.
    
    Animacy influences inferences of meaning but also has syntactic role: indefinite inanimate subjects must occur preverbally.
    
    Use of "pro-drop" form—omission of pronoun subject with complete reliance on verb marking—70% of the time in informal discourse.

    Note. SVO = subject-verb-object; SOV = subject-object-verb; VS = verb-subject.

    Support for the Competition Model
    
    The single most important outcome of cross-linguistic aphasia research
    is the very strong and consistent support it provides for the competition
    theory of Bates and MacWhinney, and implicitly for its neurological
    correlates of competition between regularities in quasi-regular domains,
    parallel constraint satisfaction by connected neural networks,
    redundancy of representations in neural connectivity, the distribution of
    capacities across cortex and degree of redundancy across hemispheres,
    and the property of graceful degradation intrinsic to distributed
    representations (see table 3.2). In all languages, and in normal and
    brain-injured subjects, production and comprehension of spoken
    language reflect the interaction of a number of language facilities, cue
    validity and cue cost defining the relative strength of influence of
    competing regularities in particular facilities in particular situations in
    particular languages. Each facility corresponds in a clearly definable
    way to neural networks instantiating particular domains of knowledge or
    skill (see tables 3.1 and 3.2). With brain damage, certain facilities are
    selectively impaired, depending upon the locus of the lesion. For
    example, there is consistent vulnerability of comprehension that is
    dependent on agreement marking across languages (English, German,
    Italian) that differ enormously in their reliance on agreement cues
    (Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck 1987a). Dominant perisylvian cortex is
    the region of involvement common to all aphasia types examined in
    these studies—Broca's, Wernicke's, and conduction (see tables 4.1—4.3
    for evidence of this and other points discussed in this section). The
    consistent disruption of grammatic morphology with lesions of this
    region, and the nearly complete sparing of grammatic morphology in
    semantic dementia (Meteyard and Patterson 2009), provide compelling
    evidence that dominant perisylvian cortex is the primary substrate for
    grammatic morphology as sequence knowledge. This localization
    accounts for the closed class theory of agrammatism because closed
    class items are strongly dependent on this sequence knowledge insofar
    as it implicitly instantiates phrase structure rules.
    
    Because of graceful degradation and variously extensive distribution
    of representations, it is rare for any particular facility to become
    completely lost, but with impairment of selected facilities in particular

     aphasias, individual subjects bring a different relative mix of facilities to
    bear on a particular language situation, a mix that varies from language
    to language. The profile of language impairment always reflects the
    particular mix of strengths (redundancies in neural connectivity,
    distribution of representations) and vulnerabilities of the native
    language.
    
    The breakdown in grammar that occurs with aphasia will reflect the
    geography of the lesion, the capacity for right-hemispheric assumption
    of language processing, and the major language-specific constraints that
    have been implicitly wired into neural connectivity through the process
    of learning the language. Because of the property of graceful
    degradation demonstrated by networks supporting distributed processing
    (which include neural networks), aphasic language will invariably
    strongly reflect the character of the normal language. It may also reflect
    vulnerabilities inherent in the reliance of that language on certain
    techniques of influencing meaning through grammar. Overwhelming
    constraints, like SVO word order in English, are likely to survive any
    lesion, particularly so in the case of SVO word order because this is
    likely to be instantiated by networks supporting the dynamic process of
    relating concept representations to each other, and to sentence-level
    sequence knowledge, which are likely to be highly distributed across
    frontal cortex and may have bihemispheric representations. On the other
    hand, number, gender, case, and person marking are heavily dependent
    upon constraints on word and phoneme order and selection, which are
    likely largely represented in dominant perisylvian cortex and therefore
    susceptible to modest-sized perisylvian lesions. Grammatic function in
    languages heavily dependent on these features might be expected to
    suffer to a greater degree in aphasia, leading to greater reliance on
    convergence between features and constraints, and on animacy, in
    enabling comprehension. To some extent this has been observed, but
    weighing against this is the much more extensive and redundant
    knowledge of grammatic morphology that becomes wired into the brain
    as morphologic sequence and semantic—morphologic (lexical)
    knowledge in heavily inflected languages, almost certainly in more
    bihemispheric fashion than in minimally inflected languages such as
    English (see the "Grammatic Morphology— Special Cases" section,
    "Verb Past Tense Formation" subsection below).
  - |-
    The fate of articles in aphasia provides a good example of some of these principles (Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck 1987b; see also Bates, Appelbaum, and Allard 1991; MacWhinney and Osman-Sagi 1991 in table 4.2 and Jarema and Kehayia 1992). In German, Italian, and French, languages that are much more richly inflected than English, subjects with Broca's aphasia are far less likely to omit articles than are English subjects with Broca's aphasia. Whereas English subjects with Broca's aphasia omit articles 83% of the time, German subjects omit them only 15% of the time (Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck 1987). English subjects with Broca's aphasia almost never make article substitutions, whereas 40% of article errors in comparable German subjects are substitutions. To the extent that German subjects with Broca's aphasia make case substitution errors, they tend to involve less frequently used dative and accusative cases. To the extent that article substitution occurs, the errors rarely involve more than one grammatical marker (case, number, or gender). These data indicate that even in aphasia, there are strong constraints on language production reflecting residual knowledge wired into neural connectivity. Errors are minimized and tend to differentially affect the least used forms. Thus, aphasia unmasks the probabilistic nature of neural network function.

    Three factors can be identified that make a major contribution to
    article engagement: morphologic sequence knowledge (including
    sequence knowledge bearing on bound and free-standing grammatic
    morphemes), semantic attributes of the article linked to its associated
    noun, and working memory. The general resilience of articles in
    German, Italian, and French subjects compared to English subjects
    indicates that one or more of these factors is more redundantly, and
    possibly bilaterally, represented (see the next section) in the brains of
    German, Italian, and French speakers—at least in part a consequence of
    the greater cue validity of articles in these richly inflected languages.
    The preservation of word order (articles before nouns) in all four
    languages can be credited to preservation of the most redundantly
    represented morphologic sequence knowledge. Because of the various
    options for omission of articles in English (e.g., "Dogs are a man's
    best friend"; "according to _— government reports" (reflecting
    reduced cue availability; Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck 1987b)), articles
    are less redundantly represented in English morphologic sequence
    knowledge. In German, in which articles are marked for case, number,
    and gender, and in Italian and French, in which they are marked for
    number and gender, articles share in the semantic attributes of their
    associated verb-modified noun. The multiplicity of these attributes
    provides stronger engagement of morphologic/phonologic
    representations from concept representations in these languages, further
    reducing omission errors, even as it provides increased opportunities for
    substitutions. Finally, in all four languages, article engagement, and in
    particular the choice of definite or indefinite article, is influenced by
    working and recent memory of what has just been said. The relatively
    greater frequency of article omissions even in German subjects with
    Broca's aphasia and the relatively greater frequency of substitutions in
    those with Wernicke's aphasia (Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck 1987b;
    see table 4.2) may reflect the preponderant role of loss of morphologic
    sequence knowledge coupled with reduced working memory capacity in
    influencing article errors in Broca's aphasia and the preponderant role of
    loss of morphologic sequence knowledge coupled with loss of
  - |-
    semantic—morphologic/phonologic (lexical) influence on articles errors  
    in Wernicke's aphasia (see "Hierarchy of Morphologic Sequence Knowledge" below).  
    
    Sparing of Grammatic Morphology in Production of Richly Inflected Languages: Implications for Neuroanatomy of Grammar
  - |-
    As the example of articles discussed in the previous section illustrates,  
    in spoken language, grammatic morphology in general is relatively  
    spared in inflectionally rich languages, which make extensive use of  
    both bound and unbound grammatic morphemes (e.g., German [see  
    table 4.2] and Polish; Kehayia, Jarema, and Kadzielawa 1990), but also  
    in languages that are agglutinative, in which grammatic morphemes are  
    appended (e.g., Greek; Kehayia, Jarema, and Kadzielawa 1990), in some  
    cases in strings incorporating multiple morphemes, to nouns and verbs  
    (e.g., in Turkish and Hungarian [see table 4.2]; Finnish, Niemi et al.  
    1990; and Korean, Halliwell 2000, which strongly resembles Turkish in  
    its grammar). By this I mean that while grammatic morphology is  
    susceptible to impairment in both subjects with Broca's and subjects  
    with Wernicke's aphasia in all languages, in inflectionally rich  
    languages, production errors are far more likely to be marked by  
    substitutions than omissions, and even rather extreme grammatic  
    morphemic order constraints are rarely if ever violated. Degree of  
    preservation of grammatic morphology appears to be proportionate to  
    both the prominence and the consistency of grammatic morphology in  
    the particular language—for example, higher in Turkish than in  
    Hungarian because of the greater consistency of Turkish, and higher for  
    verb inflections than case markers in Korean because the latter are  
    generally optional in casual speech (Halliwell 2000), that is, have lower  
    cue availability. Hungarian and Turkish specify an absolutely consistent  
    ordering of up to four inflectional suffixes. In studies of Turkish and  
    Hungarian subjects with Broca's or Wernicke's aphasia, order errors  
    have never been observed (MacWhinney and Osman-Sagi 1991; Slobin  
    1991). In Arabic, verbs are richly inflected, whereas articles (which are  
    bound grammatic morphemes) are inconsistently used; Arabic subjects  
    with Broca's aphasia produce predominantly substitution errors of verb  
    grammatic morphemes (even those that involve the internal structure of  
    the verb) but predominantly omission errors involving articles
  - |-
    (Mimouni and Jarema 1997). Again, aphasia unmasks the probabilistic nature of neural network function.
    
    The effect of richness in grammatic marking is so dramatic that one of the cardinal features of English Broca's aphasia, morphologic agrammatism, can no longer be used as an aphasia classification criterion in inflectionally rich languages. In cross-linguistic studies, Broca's aphasia has had to be defined in somewhat modified terms: diminished fluency, reduced utterance length and sentence complexity, and impaired prosody, with errors of production more often involving substitution than omission of grammatic morphemes. This can be substantially accounted for in competition model terms as relative preservation of grammatic components of high cue validity, and in neural terms as relative preservation of components most redundantly instantiated in neural connectivity, coupled with the phenomenon of graceful degradation and the extent of distribution of knowledge in the brain. This neural interpretation, and the discussion that follows, reflect the conclusion, closely argued in the section on grammaticality judgment, that aphasia, including grammatic dysfunction, stems in the main from loss of knowledge due to loss of neural synaptic connections (and neurons) in the damaged cortex, and to a much lesser degree, from loss of access to knowledge due to disconnection syndromes produced by lesions.
  - |-
    Can this interpretation be reconciled with what we know about the lesions causing aphasia? Broca's aphasia is typically the result of very large lesions (Mohr et al. 1978), most often involving much of frontal opercular and ventral convexity cortex and extending beyond the central sulcus into postcentral temporal and parietal lobes. Most subjects who end up with Broca's aphasia had global aphasia acutely. This suggests that many, perhaps most, subjects with Broca's aphasia are substantially using the right hemisphere to speak. If this is so, then it suggests that in inflectionally rich languages, the right hemisphere consistently has the capacity to provide substantial support for grammatic morphology. This right-hemisphere knowledge is likely to be redundant with left-hemisphere knowledge—it provides a basis for recovery of function, particularly in richly inflected languages, but it does not, so far as we know, provide a basis for unique knowledge—hence the rarity of reports of grammatic impairment in dextral subjects with right-hemisphere lesions (though this has not been adequately studied).
    
    It might be objected that neural networks supporting grammatic morphology in inflectionally rich languages may be located more posteriorly. However, cross-linguistic studies of aphasia in such languages indicate that Wernicke's aphasia (also typically associated with very large, albeit posterior, lesions) is consistently characterized by fluent language, serious word finding difficulties, and semantic, morphologic, and phonologic paraphasic errors—but also substantially retained and correctly ordered grammatic morphology.

    It is possible that in the cross-linguistic studies, the subjects with Broca's aphasia represented the subset of global aphasics with sufficient right-hemisphere language capacity not only to produce contentive language but also to support grammatic morphology, and that the subjects with Wernicke's aphasia represented the subset of all subjects with large posterior lesions who had sufficient right-hemisphere language capacity to not only participate effectively in language studies but also to support grammatic morphology. If the subset of all aphasias associated with large left-hemisphere lesions evaluated in cross-linguistic studies is small, then this would lead us to overestimate the prevalence of preservation of grammatic morphologic capacity in right-hemisphere neural networks. Only studies that evaluate all subjects with large left-hemisphere strokes could address this question.
  - |-
    In the meantime, I will accept the phenomenon of relative preservation of grammatic morphology in spoken language in subjects with Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia in richly inflected languages as representative of the brain organization of language in speakers of these languages, and not simply an artifact of case ascertainment. Because this preservation of grammatic morphology occurs in the context of very large lesions, lesions that destroy virtually the entire recognized substrate for the major components of language in the left hemisphere, it cannot be explained solely on the basis of the competition model or its neurological correlates of redundancy of representations in neural connectivity and graceful degradation. The only other neural principle that can explain it is wider distribution of neural representation. Some language functions, as I have discussed, are clearly widely distributed in the left hemisphere—for example, the capacities for concept manipulation and semantic knowledge. However, phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge underlying spoken language, because it is acoustic and articulatory motor, is likely to be represented in perisylvian areas. It is not plausible that brain regions involved in completely different motor functions (e.g., hand or foot), different modalities (e.g., visual or somatosensory), or different principles of information processing (e.g., prefrontal or parahippocampal cortex) could provide a basis for this sequence knowledge in the wake of injury. Thus, we are led to the conclusion that the wider representational distribution that supports relative preservation of grammatic morphology in inflectionally rich languages in the face of major injury to the left hemisphere is distribution that includes the right hemisphere.
    
    Support for the Competition Model from Studies of Language Comprehension
  - |-
    The patterns of breakdown of grammatic comprehension in various languages (see table 4.3) are generally similar to those observed in production (see table 4.2), providing further support for the competition model and its neural counterpart (see table 3.2). One might have anticipated that comprehension would be more resilient than production because near misses may suffice, particularly when inference of meaning is aided by context, whereas in production, one and only one response is correct. However, several studies of comprehension of grammatic morphology in aphasia have suggested that even in inflectionally rich languages, comprehension is highly vulnerable and may be at least as severely affected as production (see table 4.3). The reasons for this are not entirely clear, but one strong possibility lies in the nature of the comprehension task most often used in cross-linguistic studies testing the competition model (Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck 1987a). Because this peculiar vulnerability of grammatic morphology in comprehension relative to production, even in inflectionally rich languages, is unexpected, and because this finding motivated a highly nonlocalizationalist interpretation, one strongly at odds with the model introduced in this book, the findings will be reviewed in some detail.
  - |-
    The task of Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck (1987a) is elegant in its simplicity and power. Subjects are presented with sentences comprised of two nouns and a verb employing all possible combinations of word order (NVN, VNN, NNV), animacy (AA, AI, IA, II), and a variable reflecting grammatic morphology, for example, agreement (AGI, verb ending agrees with first noun; AG2, second noun; AGB, both nouns; and AGO, neither noun). Subjects are instructed to listen to each sentence and, as quickly as possible, decide which of the two nouns is the agent or grammatic subject. The constructions are often difficult to interpret because they use unfamiliar word orders, strain credulity, or are frankly ungrammatic. Aphasic subjects who rely overwhelmingly on word order (e.g., English) perform essentially like controls when word order provides an adequate guide to meaning. However, subjects speaking inflectionally rich languages lose much of their ability to employ grammatic morphology in interpreting these sentences, and having lost, for example, their ability to interpret agreement markers, overrely on word order and animacy—precisely as predicted by the competition model and its neural counterpart of competing but altered neural representations. However, Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck (1987a) also found that subjects with anomic aphasia, neurological subjects with no evidence of cortical damage, and subjects on an orthopedic ward—all with no grammatic impairment in production—demonstrated impairment in comprehension of grammatic morphology that was often nearly as severe as in subjects with Broca's or Wernicke's aphasia. Furthermore, Kilborn (1991) found that normal young English and German subjects who listened to these same sentences partially masked with "pink noise" (white noise confined to the spoken language frequency range), exhibited the same pattern and degree of impairment: verb agreement cues had a markedly reduced impact on agent choice under the pink noise condition. These findings suggest that because of the intrinsic difficulty of this somewhat artificial task and the low salience (high cue cost) of agreement markers compared to word order or animacy, loss of reliance on grammatic markers may occur under

    many conditions and may not be specific either to aphasia impacting
    grammatic morphologic function or to the effects of perisylvian lesions
    associated with agrammatism or paragrammatism in aphasia.
    
    Evidence that the somewhat artificial nature of the task used by Bates,
    Friederici, and Wulfeck (1987a) was an important factor comes from an
    experiment by Heeschen (1980) testing comprehension of sentences by
    German subjects with Broca's or Wernicke's aphasia. The effects of
    opposing word order to animacy and/or case markers were tested using
    sentences that were entirely plausible and grammatic. Case marking is a
    very strong cue—indeed the principal cue—to interpretation of meaning
    in German. On the reversible sentences (i.e., lacking animacy cues),
    when word order was opposed only to case marking, subjects with
    Broca's aphasia correctly responded to case cues 73% of the time—
    suggesting substantial retention of ability to use grammatic morphologic
    markers to guide comprehension.
    
    Further evidence that the somewhat artificial nature of the task of
    Bates et al. may have been a factor comes from a study of a two-noun,
    one-verb, semantically reversible sentence comprehension _ task
    employing simple (SVO) sentences, cleft subjects, cleft objects, and
    passive voice constructions (Dick et al. 2001). Elderly English-speaking
    control subjects performed normally on this task.
    
    I do not mean by these arguments to dismiss the importance of the
    comprehension studies pioneered by Bates and others. These studies
    have been of inestimable value in determining language-specific
    contributions to comprehension and the variable impact of aphasia on
    these contributions. Rather, the argument here is that the absolute
    magnitude of effects on agreement, and perhaps other inflectional
    markers, may be overestimated (even as relative magnitude is
    preserved) because of the impact of implausible and ungrammatic
    sentences on all subjects under some duress, whether because of noise
    or brain damage. The comprehension task of Bates et al. has provided a
    powerful tool for revealing the language-specific gradient of
    morphologic resilience. However, lower reaches of that gradient may be
    vulnerable even in normal subjects, at least under certain conditions.
  - |-
    The questions raised by the findings of Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck (1987a) in subjects with brain lesions, and the subsequent study by Kilborn (1991), have provided the impetus to an extensive series of studies further examining grammatic comprehension deficits in aphasic subjects and in normal subjects performing tasks under various adverse conditions. These studies have also, to a significant degree, been motivated by a response to Grodzinsky's unflagging advocacy for a single-component grammatic processor located in Broca's area (Grodzinsky 2000). Dick et al. (2001) have provided a nice review of this literature and reported the results of newer and quite eloquent studies that sought to address many of the controversies. They arrived at remarkably antilocalizationist conclusions, even as they averred that they are not against localization (Dick et al. 2001, p. 782):
    
    We suggest that the defining profile of receptive agrammatism has no localizing value, it is not specific to Broca's aphasia, is not specific to damage at any particular lesion site, and can be reproduced in normal participants under a broad array of adverse processing conditions.
    
    Dick et al. (2001) tested 56 subjects with aphasia of various types and lesion location, elderly control subjects, and 216 college students on an auditory sentence comprehension task consisting of simple two-noun, one-verb SVO sentences and active, cleft subject, cleft object, and passive voice forms. All sentences were semantically reversible. College students were tested under a variety of conditions, including the requirement to simultaneously retain a memory of a visually or auditorily presented string of digits (tested by recognition), 50% speech rate compression, such that each sentence was presented in one half the time, addition of a 50% noise mask, and a 600 Hz low-pass filter condition.

    They found that elderly normal subjects (who were tested only in the baseline condition) performed essentially normally on this task. All Subjects with aphasia performed abnormally (those with anomia the best, those with Broca's or conduction aphasia at intermediate levels, those with Wernicke's aphasia the worst). While all aphasic groups demonstrated some impairment in comprehension of active and cleft subject constructions, they were particularly impaired on cleft object and passive voice constructions. This led to the conclusion that receptive agrammatism has no localizing value. They also found that when college students performed this task under conditions of speech rate compression, noise, and to a lesser extent low-pass filtering, they also Showed differential deficits with cleft object and passive voice constructions—hence a conclusion that grammatic breakdown reflects the performance of the brain under stress.
    
    In order to better understand these results, it is necessary to consider in somewhat greater detail the nature of this comprehension task and the specific cognitive—linguistic domains it taxes. First, the most affected task conditions require subjects to one degree or another to contravene the overwhelming and therefore highly redundantly represented and distributed predilection for SVO word order in English. Achieving this, particularly in cleft object and passive voice constructions, makes heavy demands upon perisylvian neural structures supporting morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge and their links to semantic representations and frontal networks involved in concept manipulation and verb modification of concepts, and phonologic working memory. All perisylvian lesions (as in Broca's, Wernicke's, and conduction aphasias), as well as noise and to some extent low-pass filtering, are likely to degrade representations within the perisylvian domain of phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge.' Speech rate compression potentially pushes neural function supporting all linguistic components beyond its operational range, leading to a speed—accuracy trade-off. Viewed in this way, when one looks at the results of these experiments, the logical conclusion is how could it be otherwise? It is also worth recalling that in PDP networks, the effects of damage and noise may be quite similar.
  - |-
    Dick et al. (2001) did not find that imposing a requirement to simultaneously recall a visually or auditorily presented series of digits had an adverse effect on sentence comprehension. Why not? The concurrent visual task should have divided attention, and the concurrent auditory task should have placed an additional load on the perisylvian substrate for morphologic and phonologic processing. The interaction of two factors can be offered by way of an explanation. First, the visual and auditory tasks involved only six digits and recall was tested in a recognition task. Thus, the tasks were not demanding and could have been performed largely on the basis of hippocampal function with little impact on the function of perisylvian language networks. Second, although the task used by Dick et al. was sufficiently demanding to provoke errors in the context of aphasia, the markers signaling reversal of SVO order in English (is/was ... by) have high cue availability and reliability. Therefore, it is not so surprising that the cue value of these markers was retained in the context of the mild and largely hippocampal processing load imposed in the digits conditions. If this interpretation is correct, then one might anticipate that imposing a digital recall load in the setting of a task in which performance was contingent on cues with lower validity would lead to degradation of performance. This has been shown. Comprehension by German subjects of noun—verb agreement (a weak cue) is susceptible to digit load, whereas comprehension of case markers (a strong cue) is not (Dick et al. 2001).
    
    Thus, these elegant experiments on the impact of stress on grammatical comprehension do not in any way undermine the localizationist concepts of grammar developed here. Rather, they provide further support. They also provide further indication of the distributed nature of grammatical processes, which Dick et al. (2001) ultimately endorse. However, the concept of distributed processing is not, as Dick et al. (2001) suggest, fundamentally nonlocalizationist. Rather, it states that complex brain functions simultaneously engage a number of very specific and geographically mappable functional domains.
    
    Hierarchy of Morphologic Sequence Knowledge
  - |-
    Here is the text with formatting and spelling errors corrected, while preserving all original content verbatim:
    
    In phonology, there is evidence of a hierarchy of knowledge stored in the connectivity of the acoustic—articulatory motor pattern associator that supports phonologic sequence knowledge (Nadeau 2001). Phonologic errors made by subjects with Broca's aphasia are more likely to involve slips of one or perhaps two distinctive features, and Slips are likely to reflect a shift from a more marked (less phonotactically frequent) to a less marked (more phonotactically frequent) form—a reflection of redundancy of coding in neural connectivity. On the other hand, in subjects with Wernicke's aphasia, phonologic slips do not reflect these constraints, consistent with the tendency for these slips to involve syllables or morphemes—a reflection of phonologic neighborhood effects rendered noisy as a result of the lesion. There has long been evidence of an analogous phenomenon governing slips involving morphologic sequence knowledge, reflected in part in the agrammatism (Broca's aphasia)/paragrammatism (Wernicke's aphasia) dichotomy. This phenomenon has been defined more precisely through the performance of German subjects with aphasie on the Given-New Picture Description Test (Bates, Friederici, and Wulfeck 1987; see footnote, table 4.2, for a description). Subjects with Broca's aphasia were far more likely to switch to unmarked forms (reflecting the disappearance of the shallower attractor trenches with brain damage)—a plausible grammatic morphologic sequence knowledge frequency effect. Subjects with Wernicke's aphasia were more likely to switch from one oblique or marked case to another oblique or marked case, a plausible "noisy morphologic neighborhood effect." Unfortunately, the evidence in German is not unequivocal, as subjects with Broca's aphasia tend to approach the Given-New Picture Description Test with a sequence of simple sentences or serial naming of the changing item, whereas subjects with Wernicke's aphasia tend to plunge ahead with a fully dative construction and make a lot of substitution errors in the process. With more case markers on the working memory "table," there is more opportunity for errors involving substitution of one oblique form for
  - |-
    Another. On the other hand, in Chinese, in which the only element of grammatic morphology is the nominal classifier (see table 4.1), subjects with Broca's aphasia more often substitute the high-frequency neutral form whereas subjects with Wernicke's aphasia tend to substitute lower frequency classifier types, a pattern analogous to that observed with case marking in German subjects (Tzeng, Chen, and Hung 1991). This observation provides further support for the concept of a hierarchy of morphologic sequence knowledge, reflecting the interaction of knowledge of morphologic sequence regularities and morphologic neighborhood effects with pattern of breakdown related to lesion locus.

    The analogy between phonologic and morphologic neighborhoods is an incomplete one. The neighborhood of a phonologic sequence corresponds to all words (links to concept representations) that include that phonologic sequence. These concept representations are based on established and enduring semantic knowledge. In contrast, grammatical morphemes are engaged only by the transitory concept representations that are created and modified online during speech. For this reason, the morphologic neighborhood is likely to be populated only by morphemes engaged by the multiple concept representations currently in play, and perhaps their close semantic associates (in the case of gender and number marking and nominal classifiers).
    
    Grammatic Morphology—Special Cases
    
    Personal Pronouns
  - |-
    In earlier discussion of the neural network model of grammar introduced here, the dependence of pronoun comprehension and production on several frontally based mechanisms was discussed. Theoretically, then, subjects with frontal lesions or Broca's aphasia should demonstrate particular problems with pronoun use. This has been borne out in empirical studies. Subjects with agrammatic aphasia exhibit markedly reduced use of personal pronouns (Saffran, Berndt, and Schwartz 1989; Menn and Obler 1990b). By contrast, people with aphasia due to more posterior lesions, which leave frontally mediated selective engagement mechanisms intact, use pronouns to excess as a device to deal with their problems with semantic access. Consistent with principles of graceful degradation and some degree of redundancy of representation provided by the right hemisphere, subjects with aphasia do show evidence of priming of pronoun phonologic representations by corresponding noun concept representations (Rigalleau and Caplan 2000, 2004). They also show evidence of preservation of sufficient capacity for sustained selective engagement to produce competitive priming effects in sentences like the following:
    
    ‘Tom questioned Sue because he wanted to learn the truth'
    
    in which latency to read the pronoun is greater than in sentences like the following, in which there is no competition:
    
    ‘Tom questioned Sam because he wanted to learn the truth.'
    
    However, this competitive priming effect varies very substantially in aphasia, is not observed in all subjects, and seems to bear no simple relationship to type of aphasia (Rigalleau and Caplan 2004).
  - |-
    Reflexive pronouns derive their meaning from within a sentence and are thus less likely than strong pronouns to be affected by working memory impairment. Subjects with Broca's aphasia nevertheless demonstrate difficulty in the comprehension of reflexives (Blumstein et al. 1983). Breakdown in this comprehension, as demonstrated by Blumstein et al. (1983), provides another excellent example of the principle of parallel constraint satisfaction. In their study of subjects with Broca's, conduction, and Wernicke's aphasias, they tested comprehension of sentences employing reflexive pronouns in which meaning was supported by syntax, syntax + semantic clues, and syntax + semantic + morphologic cues, as illustrated by the following:
    
    SYNTAX: "The boy watched the chef bandage himself."
    SYNTAX + SEMANTIC: "The boy watched the girl bandage himself."
    
    SYNTAX + MORPHOLOGIC: "The boy watching the men bandaged himself."
    
    SYNTAX + SEMANTIC + MORPHOLOGIC: "The boy watching the girls bandaged himself."
    
    The more cues available, the better subjects of all types performed. In short, comprehension was achieved through simultaneous processing of syntactic, semantic, and morphologic cues. Errors reflected heavy reliance on the "minimal distance principle"—when cues were insufficient to resolve ambiguity, subjects referenced the pronoun to the nearest noun phrase, and comprehension was far better when reference to the nearest noun phrase was correct. Presumably, this reflects the additional impact of working memory effects.
  - |-
    Deficits in comprehension of reflexive pronouns by subjects with Broca's aphasia have been shown to be particularly related to breakdown in sentence-level sequence knowledge. As discussed earlier (in chapter 3, "Syntax: Sequence at the Sentence Level" section), Joanisse and Seidenberg (2003) showed that a recurrent PDP network, through its experience with statistical regularities of the data set, was able to acquire implicit knowledge of rules governing verb argument structure, subcategorization, preposition choice, and pronoun anaphora. I also noted that personal pronouns can be understood as concept representations that are modified in such a way that they elicit, via connections to perisylvian cortex, one of a limited number of closed class words that capture the case, number, gender, and reference of the concept. Thus, for a sentence involving pronouns and reflexives to be produced or understood, there must be assembled a representation in networks supporting sentence-level sequence knowledge that establishes the correct time series of concept representations and appropriately pronominally modified concept representations. With complete destruction of the substrate for sentence-level sequence knowledge, we might expect complete loss of all capacity for processing pronouns. However, assuming a wide and possibly to some extent bihemispheric distribution of this substrate, coupled with the principle of graceful degradation, we might expect some residual capacity for processing pronouns and reflexives but a tendency to make substitution errors that might properly be characterized as parasyntactic. An elegant study by Choy and Thompson (2010) supports this conceptualization.
    
    Participants (subjects with Broca's aphasia and controls) fixated on crosshairs in the middle square of a nine-square array while listening to sentences of two types:
    
    1. "The soldier told the farmer with glasses to shave him in the bathroom."
    
    2. "The soldier told the farmer with glasses to shave himself in the bathroom."
  - |-
    Subsequently, participants were asked, "Did the farmer shave the soldier?" As subjects were listening to the sentences, their eye movements were tracked, enabling the experimenters to monitor saccades to the corner squares of the nine-square array, which contained pictures of the target and competing distracter (soldier and farmer, respectively, in sentence 1) and two foils (e.g., glasses and something completely irrelevant). Unsurprisingly, the subjects with Broca's aphasia were severely impaired (but above chance) in their responses to probe questions. However, their eye movements revealed nearly normal saccade patterns, indicating the presence of residual sentence-level sequence knowledge. On correct trials, saccades were completely normal with more fixations on the target picture (e.g., soldier in sentence 1) than the competing picture (farmer in sentence 1). On incorrect trials, however, there were an equal number of saccades to the target and the competitor, indicating either a modest breakdown in sentence-level sequence knowledge, such that knowledge of the precise sequential relationship between the pronoun and its referent was degraded, or defective pronominal modification of the target and competitor concept representations, such that the pronominally modified concept representations were no longer reliably discriminable by the end of the sentence.
    
    Auxiliary Verbs
  - |-
    Auxiliary verbs are among the elements most commonly omitted by subjects with Broca's aphasia (Saffran, Berndt, and Schwartz 1989; Niemi et al. 1990). The use of be—have as the main verb (the "copula") is likewise consistently severely impaired in Broca's aphasia. There are four attributes of auxiliary verbs that might make them particularly prone to omission. First, they are linked to the main verb and thus are likely to be susceptible to the general impairment in verb function characteristically seen in Broca's aphasia. Although auxiliary verbs have been consigned to the class of functors, in their use they typically act like main verbs in an adjectival way to modify distributed concept representations. For example, consider the two sentences "Mary hides the candy" and "Mary has hidden the candy," differing only in grammatical aspect: progressive versus perfect. In the first, Mary is in motion, busily secreting the candy in an obscure place. In the second, Mary is static but has the attribute of responsibility for the current state of the candy. In the first, the candy is being carried about. In the second, it is still. Clearly there is an important semantic difference between "hides" and "has hidden." I have already identified this process of volitional modification of distributed concept representations as one requiring frontal systems, which are consistently impaired in subjects with Broca's aphasia. The employment of an auxiliary verb actually represents a further refinement of the semantic representation of the verb and the adjectival role it plays. Thus, one might expect auxiliary verbs to be particularly vulnerable in subjects with Broca's aphasia, who have difficulty employing even two adjectives (e.g., "large house," "white house," but not "large white house"; Gleason et al. 1975).
    
    Second, often the purpose of an auxiliary verb is to convey tense, to be discussed below. Frontal systems may provide the chief substrate for the neural instantiation of the time concept by virtue of their primary role in planning.
  - |-
    Third, auxiliary verbs are often used only to reconcile the tense of the sentence with the tense of the preceding narrative—for example, "She has a headache now. She has been having headaches for six months." That is, the inclusion and choice of auxiliary verbs may be based, like those of articles, on narrative context, hence working and episodic memory.
    
    Finally, auxiliary verbs may be linked to main verbs within the domain of sequence knowledge.
    
    The fact that the neural mechanisms underlying these various attributes of auxiliary verbs are impaired in subjects with Broca's aphasia may account for the tendency for these subjects to omit these words. Furthermore, not only are auxiliary verbs and the copula at risk for the fate of main verbs in many subjects with Broca's aphasia but they also have low cue validity. Relatively little meaning is lost by their omission.
  - |-
    Locative Prepositions  
    In the discussion of locative prepositions in chapter 3, the concept was  
    introduced that the fundamental process engaged in handling locative  
    prepositions has similarities to that involved in processing of verbs: both  
    require simultaneous reciprocal modification of multiple distributed  
    concept representations and binding of these modified representations to  
    each other to form a superdistributed concept representation. Thus, one  
    might predict comparable problems in verb and locative preposition  
    tasks in subjects with severe grammatic impairment. This has been  
    borne out in empirical studies (McCarthy and Warrington 1985; Saffran,  
    Schwartz, and Marin 1980a; Schwartz, Saffran, and Marin 1980).  
    However, locative prepositions do not assign thematic roles. This means  
    that they are unlikely to have a significant frontal semantic  
    representation and it provides the potential for a double dissociation  
    between impairments in processing of verbs and impairments in  
    processing of locative prepositions. This has been described (Kemmerer  
    and Tranel 2003; Berndt and Mitchum 1998). Kemmerer and Tranel  
    (2003) reported severely impaired processing of verbs but spared  
    processing of locative prepositions in a subject with a very large stroke  
    limited to the left frontal lobe, and normal processing of verbs but  
    severely impaired processing of locative prepositions in a subject with a  
    very large stroke substantially confined to the left parietal cortex. The  
    division of labor between prefrontal cortex and postcentral cortex  
    involved in processing of locative prepositions may hinge on the degree  
    to which the use of a preposition is aided by figure—ground relationships  
    (e.g., "The spoon is in the cup") or directionality of relationship (e.g.,  
    "The bicycle is next to the garage'') intrinsic to their arguments. Thus,  
    Miozzo, Fischer-Baum, and Postman (2008) observed poor performance  
    by a subject with a predominantly frontal infarct when such  
    relationships were absent (e.g., "The diamond is above the square'') but  
    relatively preserved performance when they were present.

    Because locative prepositions also encode direction, one might expect
    them to have a predominantly posterior semantic representation that
    Supports an analog to the path information subsumed in the meaning of
    action verbs in path-incorporating languages (see above)—that is, a
    representation in cortices in the postcentral "where" pathway. Friederici
    (1982) found that production of locative prepositions was quite impaired
    in both subjects with Broca's and subjects with Wernicke's aphasia, but
    it was more impaired in the latter. Goodglass, Gleason, and Hyde (1970)
    found that comprehension of locative prepositions was particularly
    impaired in subjects with Wernicke's aphasia. Wu, Waller, and
    Chatterjee (2007) found an association between impaired
    comprehension of locative prepositions and lesions of inferior parietal
    lobule and the occipitoparietal junction. Tranel and Kemmerer (2004)
    assessed production, comprehension, and semantic analysis of locative
    prepositions in 78 subjects with focal left-hemisphere lesions. When the
    lesions of subjects without major impairment were subtracted from the
    lesions of those with major impairment, the resultant lesion map
    predominantly involved frontal operculum and inferior parietal lobule
    and subjacent white matter. Although it cannot be determined in these
    lesion studies what mix of cortical damage and damage to fan arrays
    was responsible for the observed deficits, the findings are generally
    congruent with the hypothesis proposed above.
    
    Functional imaging studies have also implicated the supramarginal
    gyrus and inferior parietal lobule in processing of prepositions
    (Kemmerer 2006). To what extent this implicates these regions as the
    actual substrate for concept relationships defined by prepositions, and to
    what extent it reflects the fact that these regions are targets of
    perisylvian afferents (Geschwind 1965)—the fan arrays—is not certain
    (see the "Grammaticality Judgment and the Issue of Loss of Knowledge
    versus Loss of Access to Knowledge" section, mechanism 1).
    
    Obligatory Prepositions
  - |-
    Obligatory prepositions may impact both thematic and _ flavor  
    components of verb meaning. For example:  
    " He was telling her what to do."  
    " He was telling about his experience in the army."  
    
    Beyond the obvious differences in the argument structure of these two  
    sentences, "telling her" comes close to "ordering her" whereas "telling  
    about" comes close to "recounting'—very different flavors indeed.  
    Obligatory prepositions are also likely to be linked to verbs in  
    morphologic sequence knowledge. Thus, one might expect difficulty  
    with obligatory prepositions in subjects with frontal lesions impacting  
    thematic components of verb meaning, posterior lesions impacting  
    flavor components, and perisylvian lesions impacting morphologic  
    sequence knowledge or the fan arrays linking this sequence knowledge  
    to association cortices. Which of these various actors is dominant may  
    depend upon details of lesion location and language-specific quasi-  
    regular domains involving semantic modification of verbs and verb-  
    obligatory preposition sequence knowledge.  
    
    In a study of German subjects with aphasia, Friederici (1982) found  
    that whereas subjects with Broca's aphasia did better than those with  
    Wernicke's aphasia in production of locative prepositions (in a cloze  
    test), they did considerably worse with obligatory prepositions (a  
    significant group by type interaction). Subjects with Broca's aphasia  
    tended to omit the obligatory preposition whereas subjects with  
    Wernicke's aphasia tended to make within-category substitutions. Thus,  
    in this study, the presumably better preservation of verb flavor  
    knowledge in subjects with Broca's aphasia was apparently trumped by  
    their impairments in processing of thematic components of verb  
    meaning and in phonologic/morphologic sequence knowledge.  
    
    Verb Past Tense Formation
  - |-
    The generation of the past tense forms of verbs has been a subject of intense inquiry, pitting proponents and foes of PDP approaches against each other ever since Rumelhart and McCelland and their colleagues demonstrated in their landmark 1986 chapter (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986) that a single pattern associator network could generate both regular and irregular past tense forms given the present tense. In a very real sense, this problem has become the crux of the debate over PDP and its applicability to language functions of the brain. The very substantial literature that has resulted from this controversy is important in its own right. However, it is even more important because the resulting research has dug deeply into the potential vulnerabilities of PDP approaches and led to a subtler and more detailed understanding of the neural network basis of language in general. The modification of the connectionist past tense model that will be discussed below will show how the larger theoretical model that has been the topic of this book naturally extends in a fractal-like way to fill in interstices unanticipated in its original formulation to account for heretofore perplexing reports in the past tense literature, to motivate further study, and to better understand fundamental differences in the brain substrate for different languages.
  - |-
    In 1986, Rumelhart and McClelland reported the results of extensive simulations involving a single small PDP network (920 units) that proved to be fully capable of learning and, ultimately, correctly producing the past tense of English verbs, both regular and irregular, given the present tense (despite the unitary structure of the network). It also seemed to successfully recapitulate the evolution of past tense production in young children. It aroused a storm of protest (Pinker and Prince 1988; Pinker 1991; Jaeger et al. 1996), some related to the imperfect match between model behavior and the results of more extensive studies of language development in children and some related to peculiarities and weaknesses of the specific model (see the review by MacWhinney and Leinbach 1991). This type of criticism has been substantially addressed by subsequent studies involving more sophisticated PDP models (incorporating hidden units) trained with more contemporary and detailed child language data (Daugherty and Seidenberg 1992; Hoeffner 1992; MacWhinney and Leinbach 1991; Plunkett and Marchman 1991, 1993; Plunkett and Juola 1999).
    However, a more fundamental debate about the nature of mental computation has continued. Although there has been some willingness to accept a connectionist account for the production of irregular past tense forms (or a linguistic simulacrum; Pinker and Ullman 2002; Ullman et al. 2005), it has been argued that a symbolic, rule-based system is required to explain properties of the regular past tense and, by extension, many properties of language and cognition in general (Pinker 1991; Pinker and Prince 1988; Prasada and Pinker 1993). This debate has been fueled by numerous studies, employing several methodologies, that have demonstrated a double dissociation between regular and irregular past tense processing by subjects with brain injury. Tests have included a story completion cloze test paradigm to induce verb past tense production, lexical decision (testing, e.g., to what degree "jumped" primes "jump," and "sang" primes "sing"), forced choice recognition.

    (testing grammaticality judgment), and reading and repetition tasks.  
    Subjects with generally more anterior MCA distribution strokes, most  
    often with agrammatic aphasia, subjects with Parkinson's disease, which  
    is characterized by progressive, predominantly frontal cortical pathology  
    (Braak et al. 2003), and subjects with the developmental disorder,  
    specific language impairment (SLI; Ullman 2001), demonstrate  
    differential impairment involving regular past tense endings (Marslen-  
    Wilson and Tyler 1997; Ullman et al. 1997; Ullman et al. 2005; Tyler,  
    deMornay-Davies, et al. 2002; Tyler, Randall, and Marslen-Wilson  
    2002; Marslen-Wilson and Tyler 1998).° Subjects with more posterior  
    lesions, due to stroke, semantic dementia, Alzheimer's disease, herpes  
    simplex encephalitis, or the hereditary developmental disorder, Williams  
    syndrome, demonstrate differential impairment involving irregular past  
    tense endings (Marslen-Wilson and Tyler 1997; Ullman et al. 1997;  
    Patterson et al. 2001; Tyler et al. 2002; Marslen-Wilson and Tyler 1998;  
    Ullman 2001; Miozzo 2003; Ullman et al. 2005; Colombo, Fonti, and  
    Stracciari 2009; Cortese et al. 2006; Patterson et al. 2006). Impairment  
    involving irregular past tense endings (but not regular) is usually  
    (though not invariably; Miozzo 2003; Tyler et al. 2004) strongly  
    correlated with degree of semantic impairment (Patterson et al. 2001;  
    Patterson et al. 2006) and a propensity for making regularization errors  
    (e.g., "swimmed" in lieu of "swam''), and it is associated with  
    reasonable facility in producing the past tense form of nonword (nonce)  
    verbs (Ullman et al. 1997; Patterson et al. 2001; Ullman et al. 2005).
  - |-
    Clouding this controversy have been several questionable assumptions. Most obvious is the dichotomization of regularity when in fact there is a spectrum of regularity, ranging from extremely regular (add ‘"—ed": /d/ as in agreed; /t/ as in jumped; /ed/ as in hated), through quasi-regular (e.g., the 28 verbs ending in /d/ or /t/ for which present and past tense forms are identical and many other verbs ending in /d/ or /t/ for which the past tense is achieved through a vowel change, e.g., bleed—bled, slide—slid; McClelland and Patterson 2002), to truly idiosyncratic (e.g., go-went; Bybee 2001). This continuum of regularity is even more conspicuous in more richly inflected languages, such as Italian (Colombo, Fonti, and Stracciari 2009). Some languages—for example, German—do not even have a single statistically predominant form that could be characterized as the regular past tense ending (Mac Whinney and Leinbach 1991).
    
    Second, in the face of our burgeoning knowledge of how the brain works and, in particular, the repeated demonstration of implicit rule-based, albeit probabilistic behavior generated as an emergent product of connectionist network function, the quest for an explicit, symbolic, rule instantiating neural mechanism becomes ever more quixotic.
    
    Finally, while the demonstration by Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) that a single connectionist network can correctly generate both regular and irregular forms provided strong testimony to the computational power of connectionist systems, there is no particular reason to presume that the brain actually does use a single network to generate verb past tense forms, and the double dissociation in subjects with brain lesions noted above suggests that it does not. Nevertheless, proponents of an explicit, rule-based, symbolic, regular past tense marker generating mechanism remain entrenched (Ullman 2001; Ullman et al. 2005), and connectionist modelers remain no less dedicated to the concept of a single network responsible for generating both regular and irregular past tense forms (Joanisse and Seidenberg 1999; McClelland and Patterson 2002).
  - |-
    In 2001, a two-pathway connectionist mechanism was proposed that
    appeared to be capable of accounting for the extant data at that time
    (Nadeau 2001). This hypothesis, deriving directly from the two-pathway
    concept naming mechanism elaborated early in the present book (see
    figure 2.1), has stood the test of time. It is in substantial agreement with
    both the two-route hybrid models and the single-route fully
    connectionist models proposed, but it differs in ways that prove to be
    crucial in accounting for the data and doing so in terms of mechanisms
    fully consistent with known neural network functions. To recapitulate,
    both the substrates for verb modified concept representations and for
    verb semantic representations access articulatory motor representations
    via two pattern associator networks, one a direct, substantially whole
    word pathway, the other indirect, interfacing with the acoustic—
    articulatory motor pathways that instantiate phonologic and
    morphologic sequence knowledge. Tense is likely to be the product of
    another distributed representation, presumably substantially frontal
    because of its implicit relationship to dynamic time sense. The
    hypothesis is that projections from networks instantiating tense
    representations terminate on both the direct and indirect pathways. The
    effect on both direct and indirect pathways is to induce modifications of
    the articulatory forms of verbs that will yield both regular and irregular
    verb past tense endings. However, the nature of the verb past tense form
    knowledge implicit in these two pathways, and the impact of lesions,
    will be quite different. Because the direct pathway is a pattern-sequence
    transducer, there will be but modest instantiation of sequence
    knowledge. Therefore, verb frequency and age of acquisition effects
    (Lambon Ralph and Ehsan 2006; token effects) will be the primary
    factors that determine the robustness of verb past tense representations.
    There are only approximately 160 English verbs with irregular past
    tense endings, but they are among the most commonly used in the
    language. For this reason, the direct pathway confers a relative
    advantage to irregular past tense forms, and accessibility of irregular
    past tense forms is very substantially influenced by frequency (Ullman
    1999). In contrast, the indirect pathway, which involves the acoustic—
    articulatory motor pathway, is fully capable of instantiating knowledge
    of both frequency (token effects) and degree of regularity (type effects).

    Type effects correspond to the impact of attractor trenches—subtrenches
    in the network. To the extent that type effects are operant, frequency
    effects will be reduced. Type effects will be present to some degree for
    any forms that exhibit some regularity (including quasi-regular forms,
    e.g., know — knew, blow — blew, and throw — threw), but they will be
    overwhelming for the most regular past tense form, the ‘"-ed" ending,
    because the brain learns, through experience, that the vast majority of
    English verbs, however infrequent, accept this form. Quasi-regular
    forms, including the -ed ending form, will compete with each other.
    Normally, both pathways are employed in interactive fashion. In most
    subjects with brain lesions affecting verb past tense formation, both
    pathways will be affected, but not to the same degree, in a pattern
    reflecting lesion locus. Lesions differentially affecting either pathway
    will impair production of both regular and irregular forms. However,
    with lesions predominantly affecting the direct pathway, the type effects
    of the indirect pathway will become ascendant, yielding a relative
    advantage for regular past tense formation. With lesions predominantly
    affecting the indirect pathway, the token effects of the direct pathway
    will become ascendant, yielding a relative advantage for irregular past
    tense formation. The interaction of dual pathways envisioned here and
    the contrasting effects of lesions differentially affecting them has been
    very effectively demonstrated by Plaut and colleagues in their study of
    PDP models of acquired dyslexia (Plaut et al. 1996). The association of
    anterior lesions with selective deficits of regular past tense formation
    suggests a relatively anterior interface between projections conveying
    tense and the indirect pathway. To accommodate the association of
    differential deficits in irregular past tense formation with semantic
    dementia, Alzheimer's disease, the lesions of herpes simplex
    encephalitis, and some strokes, one need only posit a relatively posterior
    interface between projections conveying tense and the direct pathway,
    perhaps relatively close to the substrate for semantic representations, or
    involving a parasylvian relay station between semantic representations
    and perisylvian phonologic networks, for example, Brodmann areas 37
    and 39 (Geschwind 1965). Lesions impacting fan array projections from
    the neural substrate of the tense concept to both pathways supporting

    Past tense morphology might be expected to affect regular and irregular forms more or less equally and might elicit wild-card effects—for example, production of a past tense form when the target is future tense with its uninflected stem (e.g., "Tomorrow the maid wiped the table"; Faroqi-Shah and Thompson 2007).
    
    The relationship between the two routes of verb past tense formation in the face of disease is nicely demonstrated by results of a study by Cortese et al. (2006) of verb past tense production in a sentence context in 67 healthy older adults, 70 individuals with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease, and six subjects with semantic dementia. Subjects were shown a sentence in the present tense, for example,
    
    "Every day I ding the bell"
    followed by
    
    "Yesterday, I the bell."
    
    Cortese et al. examined the effects of regularity and consistency.
    Consistent verbs are verbs (regular or irregular) whose past tense form has similar phonology to most or all of its neighbors—for example, the regular match (— matched), and hatch, latch, patch, scratch, and snatch, the single exception being catch, and the irregular creep (— crept), and sleep, keep, and weep. Inconsistent verbs have neighborhoods that preponderantly take a different phonologic form—for example, the regular ding (— dinged) and sing, ring, sting, and the irregular spit (— spat) and fit, knit, and hit. To put it another way, consistent verbs have many friends and few enemies, whereas inconsistent verbs have few friends and many enemies.

    Because both the posited routes of verb past tense formation can  
    Support correct production of both regular and irregular forms, the  
    production of errors by individuals with brain pathology indicates  
    damage to both routes. The overall pattern of performance should reflect  
    the relative degree of damage to the two routes. Relatively greater  
    damage to the direct route should lead to particular difficulty with  
    irregular forms. On the other hand, consistency effects, because they  
    reflect the impact of quasi-regular domains, reflect damage to the  
    indirect route (the direct route, being substantially a whole word route,  
    has no such domains). With such damage, slips will occur and they will  
    be most likely when the correct form has many enemies. Consistency  
    effects should also reflect the degree of reliance on the indirect route.
    
    There is temporal lobe pathology involving semantic representations  
    in both Alzheimer's disease and semantic dementia. However, the  
    severity of pathology and of semantic impairment is far greater in  
    Semantic dementia than in Alzheimer's disease in most studies,  
    including that of Cortese et al. Thus, one would predict far greater  
    difficulty with irregulars in subjects with semantic dementia and  
    consequently greater reliance on the indirect route, hence stronger  
    consistency effects. This is precisely what Cortese et al. (2006) found  
    (see table 4.5).

    The neural network system supporting reading aloud is in part
    different from the system involved in speaking, repetition, and
    comprehension—it involves additional pattern associator networks
    linking orthographic representations to semantics and to the acoustic—
    articulatory motor pattern associator (Kendall et al. 2008). This being
    the case, it would not be too surprising to see differential dissociations
    between regular and irregular past tense formation in reading and purely
    verbal tasks. Druks (2006) observed precisely this in a subject with
    Broca's aphasia and phonologic alexia, who exhibited significantly more
    severe impairment in production of regular past tense forms in reading
    tasks but similar impairments of regular and irregular past tense
    
    formation in verbal tasks.
    In the following sections, some of the major points offered by
    protagonists of the single-route connectionist model and the dual-route,
    hybrid associative-symbolic model will be considered in some detail.
    
    Single-Route Connectionist Model
  - |-
    Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) argued that differently located lesions of a single network could account for the observed double dissociation between regular and irregular verb past tense formation. In computer simulations, "lesions" to the semantic representation component of the pattern associator network produced selective impairment in the production of irregular past tense forms and the production of regularization errors, supporting their hypothesis. However, lesions of the phonologic component of the network were not quite so effective in emulating the behavior of subjects with selective deficits involving regular verb endings: conjugation of nonce verbs was most affected, and regular and irregular endings of trained verbs were approximately equally affected. Only the most severe lesions succeeded in producing differential impairment of regular forms, and in this circumstance, production of irregular forms was only 50%—63% correct. Furthermore, their hypothesis makes some predictions that have not been borne out.
    
    First, it predicts that impairment in forming irregular past tense forms should be strongly correlated with impairment in semantic function. However, impairment of irregular forms may be observed in cases in which semantic function is preserved (Miozzo 2003; Druks 2006). Furthermore, in a study of production of finite past participle forms in a sentence context by Italian subjects with Alzheimer's disease, semantic impairment, as measured by a synonym task, accounted for only 28% of the variance in errors made with irregular verbs (Colombo, Fonti, and Stracciari 2009). Differential impairment involving irregular forms in the face of preserved semantic function (Miozzo 2003) and preserved production of irregular forms in the face of semantic impairment (Tyler et al. 2004) is entirely compatible with the two-pathway connectionist model proposed.
  - |-
    Second, the hypothesis predicts that subjects with impairment in forming the regular past tense form will have severe impairment in phonology and that the severity of impairment in regular past tense formation will be highly correlated with the severity of the deficit in phonologic processing. Tyler, Randall, and Marslen-Wilson (2002), in a study of four subjects with agrammatic aphasia and deficits in regular past tense formation, provided strong evidence that neither of these assumptions is necessarily correct. The severity of the subjects' difficulty with regularly conjugated verbs (reflected in ability to discriminate pairs such as paid—pay) significantly exceeded that observed with an identical discrimination not involving verb conjugation (ability to discriminate pairs such as raid—ray) and was substantially greater than their difficulty in discriminating single phonemic feature differences (e.g., seed from seat and skim from skin) or differences based on the addition of a single phoneme that could not possibly represent an inflectional morpheme (claim—clay, plank—plan). Subjects demonstrated comparable impairment whether they had mild or severe impairment in phonologic processing. That is, phonologic impairment certainly could be responsible for some impairment in production of regular forms in some subjects. However, in others, the preservation of phonology makes this explanation implausible and favors a lesion of the pathway whereby the representation of tense influences verb morphology as described in the model presented here.

    Unfortunately, the study of Tyler et al. did not quite provide a definitive response to Joanisse and Seidenberg because it made the assumption that the pattern of impairment in production (which they did not study) would be comparable to that observed for comprehension—recognition (which they did study but which was not tested by Joanisse and Seidenberg). Bird et al. (2003) did study production in six subjects with nonfluent aphasia (unknown number with agrammatism). They employed a story completion paradigm in which regular and irregular verbs were matched for frequency and phonologic complexity (e.g., jump—jumped, keep—kept) because they were concerned that the reported advantage with irregular forms previously documented in Broca's aphasia might be related to the usually greater phonologic complexity of regular past tense forms (which often lengthen a terminal consonant cluster or add a syllable). Their results were also highly inconsistent with a single-route connectionist model. They, like Tyler, Randall, and Marslen-Wilson (2002), found that severity of phonologic impairment had no effect on the relative advantage seen with irregular forms (the Joanisse and Seidenberg model predicts a progressive advantage for irregular forms as severity of phonologic impairment increases). Their results are actually most consistent with the two-pathway connectionist model introduced here. No subject performed better with regular forms, suggesting that all were attempting to produce the past tense substantially via the whole word route, where there is no basis for type effects, only token (i.e., frequency/age of acquisition) effects. With production predominantly via the whole word route, one would not expect a difference in the production of regular and irregular past tense forms when frequency and phonologic complexity are controlled for. One would expect evidence of frequency effects in the production of all past tenses, regular and irregular, when produced via the whole word route (favoring the more frequent irregular forms). One would expect errors, given the absence of type effects, to be predominantly complete failures of production (as opposed to production of a competing quasi-regular form). Bird et al. (2003) did find a trend suggesting a frequency effect (p = .09), and 86%—89% of

    errors were either a repetition of the stem or a response that was too
    wide of the mark to be interpretable (i.e., neither phonologic—phonetic
    or morphologic). One would expect phonologic complexity, to the
    extent that it impacts phonetic and practic aspects of past tense
    production (almost uniformly impaired in Broca's aphasia), to effect all
    past tense forms (1) when the basis for type effects has been
    substantially eliminated because of damage to the indirect, phonologic
    route (as in Broca's aphasia) and (2) when frequency has been
    controlled for. This is exactly what Bird et al. (2003) found.
    
    The phonologic account for differential susceptibility of regular past
    tense forms also has difficulty explaining why subjects with such
    impairment may have no difficulty producing the "s" of plural nouns (a
    phonologically more complex form), even as they are quite impaired in
    producing the third person singular form of verbs (Druks 2006). These
    observations argue for a morphologic deficit confined to verbs, not a
    phonologic deficit that would affect all grammatic forms equally.
  - |-
    Kello and colleagues (Kello 2003; Kello and Plaut 2000, 2003; Kello, Sibley, and Plaut 2005) have suggested an alternative mechanism by which dissociations in performance with regular and irregular forms might occur in a single-route model—alteration in the gain in unit activation functions. At low levels of input gain, larger magnitudes of net input are necessary to push a unit's output to asymptote (0 or 1). Input gain alters the sigmoidal shape of the activation function that is standard in such models. Low values of input gain flatten the function, whereas high values sharpen it to more closely mimic a step function, that is, enhance the nonlinearity of the function. Gain influences the scope of processing. At low gain, the processing of a given input pattern is influenced by a wide range of known items, some more or less similar to the input pattern, yielding a major advantage for regular forms. At high gain, processing is influenced mainly by items that are very similar to the input pattern, yielding normal performance with both regular and irregular forms but a decided disadvantage for novel forms, which depend entirely on implicit knowledge of regularities instantiated in network connectivity. Alteration in gain does not seem to be a good candidate for explaining the double dissociation in performance with regular and irregular forms in different patient populations because these populations are distinguished by locus of the pathology. However, alterations in gain might provide a basis for the impact of modulatory systems on performance (e.g., projections from thalamic relay and intralaminar nuclei [see Nadeau and Crosson 1997] and ascending histaminergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and — serotonergic projections), speed of task performance effects, and the impact of drugs on performance.
    
    Hybrid Associative Symbolic Model
    
    Those who advocate the concept that the formation of the regular past tense form is based upon a symbolic, explicitly rule-based, nonassociative system have cited a number of empirical findings in support of their view (Ullman 2001; Ullman et al. 2005):
    
    1. The absence of frequency effects for regular forms.
  - |-

    In actuality, the data do not support this idea. Patterson et al. (2001)
    Showed that in semantic dementia, there is some evidence of a
    frequency effect for regulars, but the type effect is so strong that
    performance is nearly at ceiling and the frequency effect is markedly
    attenuated, to the point of nonsignificance.
    
    2. The relatively better performance of subjects with nonfluent
    aphasia with irregular forms cannot be attributed to the higher
    frequency of these forms (Ullman et al. 2005).
    
    As noted, the principal advantage conferred by the direct pathway is
    token effect, and this favors irregular forms, which are far more
    frequent. Ullman et al. (2005) presented evidence seemingly at odds
    with this: in a moderately impaired subject, F.C.L., the advantage of
    irregular over regular forms persisted after frequency was controlled.
    Frequency control would eliminate any advantage for irregulars
    provided by the direct pathway. However, fully 40% of this subject's
    responses for regular forms (vs. 13% for irregulars) consisted of the
    alternative "ing" form in lieu of the "ed" form. That is, the apparent
    advantage of irregulars after frequency was controlled for was related to
    the lesser tendency for F.C.L. to make "ing" form errors with irregulars.
    
    3. Because regular forms are computed by a rule-based system,
    they should be impervious to neighborhood effects, whereas
    because irregular forms are computed through an associative
    system, they should be susceptible to neighborhood effects.
    
    The absence of evidence of neighborhood effects on regular forms owes
    to the overwhelming force of the regular ending type effect, which is
    shared by such an enormous number of verbs. The existence of evidence
    of neighborhood effects on irregular (quasi-regular) endings constitutes
    evidence of processing by the indirect route that implicitly instantiates
    rules, competition between different sequences, and_ stochastic
    properties. If these forms were processed exclusively by the non—rule
    instantiating direct route, there would be evidence of frequency effects
    but no neighborhood effects because the neighborhood effects emerge
    only from the domain of sequence knowledge.
    
    4. Because regular forms are computed by a rule-based system,
    children should demonstrate sudden and consistent production of
    the regular form and regularization errors of irregular forms the
    moment they discover the rule.
  - |-
    In fact, children demonstrate rather erratic behavior and gradual
    acquisition of the ability to generate regular forms, evolving over a year
    or more, consistent with gradual instantiation of an implicit rule through
    experience with the regularities of the language that is applied
    probabilistically (McClelland and Patterson 2002).
    
    5. The rule governing regular form production is applied
    categorically and therefore should be insensitive to semantics.
    
    However, there is evidence that application of the rule is sensitive to
    semantic context (as one would expect given the structure of the model
    proposed here). Ramscar (2002) demonstrated that depending on
    semantic context, a nonce verb like "frink" might be conjugated as
    "frank" (reflecting the type effect observed with drink—drank) or as
    "frinked" (reflecting the type effect observed with blink—blinked).
    
    6. Because processing of regular and irregular forms involves
    completely separate mechanisms, there should be no mixed errors.
    
    Most errors in subjects with semantic dementia are regularizations, but
    some reflect a combination of regular and irregular forms—for example,
    tear — tored, freeze — frozed—or no change, consistent with the quasi-
    regular no change seen with many verbs ending in t or d (Patterson et al.
    2001). This favors the presence of knowledge regarding irregular forms
    within the supposedly rule-bound, symbolic pathway.
    
    Proponents of a rule-based symbolic nonassociative mechanism of
    regular past tense formation (Ullman et al. 2005; Ullman 2001) have
    also advanced the idea that this mechanism involves procedural
    memories and engages the basal ganglia. I would agree that mechanisms
    involved in tense morphology in online tasks are likely to depend on
    procedural memory (Nadeau, Rothi, and Rosenbek 2008). However, the
    evidence is now overwhelming that the basal ganglia are not involved in
    language function in any important way (Nadeau and Crosson 1997;
    Nadeau, Rothi, and Rosenbek 2008).

    Normal subjects, when asked to produce the past tense form of written or auditorily presented verb stems, will tend to respond more slowly to irregulars and to make regularization errors (Woollams, Joanisse, and Patterson 2009). Such data have also been cited as evidence supporting the linguistically motivated dual route for verb past tense formation mechanism, one route involving a rule, one based on knowledge represented in the lexicon (Pinker and Ullman 2002). However, Woollams, Joanisse, and Patterson (2009) demonstrated that the disadvantages of irregulars shown in verb stem conjugation tasks disappear when subjects are asked to produce the past tense when presented with an action picture. They cite this as evidence in favor of a Single-route, connectionist model and against the posited dual-route pathway, which proposes that the verb stem, as part of its lexical representation, should also be recruited from semantic representations.
    
    The findings of Woollams, Joanisse, and Patterson (2009) are dramatic but do not constitute proof of a single-route model. I have argued in favor of a dual-route pathway, not on the basis of linguistic theory but in order to account for patterns of responses by subjects with different lesion topographies. The findings of Woollams et al. are entirely compatible with the model introduced here. In this conceptualization, providing a verb stem by the written or auditory route directly engages the phonology of that stem within the indirect pathway (without need for semantic realization), subjecting it to brisk competition within a quasi-regular domain. The indirect pathway network has the knowledge to produce the correct past tense form, but because of the competition from enemies in a quasi-regular domain, production is slowed and the likelihood of regularization errors is increased. However, when verbs are engaged via semantic representations, the past tense forms of irregulars can also be generated by the direct pathway, which has no quasi-regular domains to prejudice their production.
    
    Discrepant Results

    Studies of verb past tense formation in English-speaking subjects with focal brain lesions have been highly consistent on the correlation between lesion location or aphasia type and pattern of differential impairment. Subjects with Broca's aphasia consistently demonstrate differential impairment with regular forms. Thus, the study of Penke, Janssen, and Krause (1999; see also Penke and Westermann 2006), reporting differential impairment among German subjects with Broca's aphasia in the production of irregular present participles, together with a tendency to overregularization, warrants attention.
    
    German present participles are formed in two ways:
    "regular": tanzen (to dance) — getanzt (dancing)
    "irregular": lessen — gelesen (reading)
    or: trinken — getrunken (drinking)
    
    The creation of some "irregular" participles also involves the addition of an umlaut to the stem vowel. I have placed irregular in quotation marks because the discrepant results achieved by these investigators may be best accounted for by viewing these forms as quasi-regular, rather than irregular. The explanation I propose is that in this highly inflected language, morphologic sequence knowledge is particularly redundantly represented, and very likely this representation involves the right hemisphere, as well, as discussed earlier in the section on cross-linguistic studies in grammatic morphology (see "Sparing of Grammatic Morphology in Production of Richly Inflected Languages" above). In this context, the production of fully regular participle forms survives the lesion, but the production of quasi-regular forms, which compete with each other and with the regular form, is expectably impaired.
    Comparable results have been reported in other highly inflected languages, including Spanish, Catalan (de Diego Balaguer et al. 2004), Dutch (Penke and Westermann 2006), Swedish (Laine et al. 1994), and possibly Greek (Tsapkini, Jarema, and Kehayia 2002).
  - |-
    The type effect achieved by the regular form should be sufficiently strong to outweigh any token (i.e., frequency) effects (as noted in the prior section). However, because type effects are less assured in competition between quasi-regular forms, one might expect some evidence of frequency effects. This is precisely what Penke, Janssen, and Krause (1999) found. Furthermore, they found that errors involving regular participles invariably involved verbs with an "e" stem vowel, which usually leads to a quasi-regular inflection, and that errors involving "irregular" participles are predominantly verbs with stem vowels that usually are associated with regular participles—precisely what one would expect in an environment, such as the indirect concept naming route, in which the regular and various irregular forms compete.
  - |-
    The full constellation of findings of Penke, Janssen, and Krause (1999) also suggests something rather unexpected. The high-frequency irregular participles they studied were of considerably higher frequency than the high-frequency regulars. Thus, they should have been able to benefit from the frequency effects that dominate the direct, whole word concept naming route. However, they did not: error rates were actually higher for the high-frequency irregulars. Furthermore, the irregular forms still demonstrated type effects in these subjects with agrammatic Broca's aphasia — further evidence that their processing was still predominantly via the indirect route. These two findings, together, suggest that the direct, whole word route may be less well developed in highly inflected languages even as the indirect, phonologic route may be more fully developed and more bihemispherically represented. If so, this would also mean that in these languages, verb past tense formation is to a greater degree supported by a single pattern associator network like that modeled by Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) and Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999), but that this network has a substantial right-hemisphere counterpart that, while not as knowledgeable as the left, in aphasia serves to better preserve fully regular forms and the most common quasi-regular forms. The consequence is that less common quasi-regular forms are most affected. Frequency effects will be observed but in competition with residual type effects within the indirect pathway, not in the unfettered, fully dominant way observed in the direct pathway, where token effects reign supreme. Because the past tense model I have proposed is theoretically linked to the two-route naming model outlined at the beginning of this book, this hypothesis has implications for the relative occurrence of phonemic paraphasias observed during naming of concepts and repetition in subjects with conduction aphasia (see chapter 2).
    
    Other Forms
  - |-
    The mechanism underlying the phenomena discussed in this section, and in particular, the specific connectionist model I have introduced, should be capable of supporting any domain of grammatical morphology involving a spectrum characterized by regular, quasi-regular, and fully irregular forms. Examples include verb past participles (e.g., jump—jumped vs. speak—spoken), plurals (dogs, homes vs. children, feet; Miozzo 2003; Plunkett and Juola 1999; Goebel and Indefrey 2000), and spelling errors on inflected homophonic verb forms (in which errors are common and tend to involve substitutions of the higher frequency form—a cue reliability effect—and the distance between the verb involved and the noun that determines the spelling of its suffix—a cue assignability effect), notwithstanding that a very simple rule dictates the correct form (Sandra 2010). Brain lesions should induce parallel differential deficits affecting all of these domains. There is preliminary evidence that this is the case. Miozzo (2003) described a subject with anomic aphasia who displayed differential impairment in production of irregular verb past tense, past participle, and plural forms. However, because the substrates for the semantic representations of nouns and verbs differ, there is a potential for differential involvement of pathways from these substrates to perisylvian cortex (the fan arrays supporting semantic—morphologic [lexical] knowledge) and, thus, for dissociation between the grammatical morphology of verbs (past tenses, participles) and that of nouns (plural forms) as discussed above ("Deficits in Verb Production in Broca's Aphasia—Potential Mechanisms" section, "Lexical" subsection).
    
    Tense versus Agreement
  - |-
    Cross-linguistic aphasia studies involving speakers of many languages (English, Dutch, German, French, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Spanish, and Czech) have consistently shown that tense marking tends to be more severely impaired than agreement marking (Wenzlaff and Clahsen 2004; Kok, Kolk, and Haverkort 2006; Kok, van Doorn, and Kolk 2007; Benedet, Christiansen, and Goodglass 1998; Friedmann and Grodzinsky 1997; Jarema and Kehayia 1992; Nadeau and Gonzalez-Rothi 1993; Nanousi et al. 2006; Nespoulous et al. 1988; Stavrakaki and Kouvava 2003; Varlokosta et al. 2006; Clahsen and Ali 2009; Ruigendijk and Friedmann 2008). The phonological/morphological forms of both tense and agreement markers are represented in perisylvian cortex and therefore are particularly susceptible to disruption by the damage of MCA distribution strokes. Thus, the tendency toward better preservation of agreement marking must reflect the relative degree of instantiation in neural connectivity and the degree to which there is some right-hemisphere representation. As we have seen, this, in turn, will reflect the relative importance of inflectional morphology in any particular language. In richly inflected languages, there appears to be substantial right-hemisphere representation of inflectional morphology across the board, although in the case of tense, regular past tense forms appear to be at a unique advantage in these languages.
  - |-
    To find the explanation for the relative advantage of agreement over tense marking in aphasia, we must look to the competition model. In particular, while agreement marking certainly has its complexities and inconsistencies, with associated risk of eliciting competition between multiple forms, this complexity and inconsistency are considerably eclipsed by what we observe with tense marking. The tense of an intended sentence is likely represented in distributed form in association cortices and is communicated to perisylvian cortex via components of fan arrays, with their particular susceptibility to MCA infarcts. Much tense marking involves the use of auxiliaries, the unique susceptibility of which I have already discussed, or it may be reflected in bound morphemes. These particular susceptibilities to lesion effect are further
    
    28
    
    complicated by the interaction between tense and aspect.*" Aspect is
    commonly as impaired as tense. English will serve as an example. In
    English there are four present tenses:
    
    "T go." (simple)
    
    "Tam going." (present progressive)
    
    ‘"T have gone." (present perfect)
    
    ‘T have been going." (present perfect progressive)
    
    and likewise for past and future tenses. The interaction between tense
    and aspect is complex:
    
    Indefinite (simple): no statement of whether the action is finished:
    "Tl go."
    
    ""T went."
    
    "T will go."
    
    Complete or perfect: describes a finished action:
    
    ""T have gone."
    
    ""T had gone."
    
    "T will have gone."
    
    Incomplete or progressive: describes an unfinished action:
    
    "Tam going."
    
    "T was going."
    "T will be going."
    
    Combinations of complete and incomplete: describes an action that
    was in progress and then finished:
    
    "T have been going."
    "T had been going."
    ""T will have been going."
  - |-
    Because tense marking, by virtue of all these dimensions, leads to
    competition between such a host of quasi-regular forms, it is little
    wonder that substitution errors are highly probable in aphasia. The
    precise probability of particular substitutions will, of course, be
    influenced by the patterns of use peculiar to a particular language and
    may be influenced by phonologic factors as well (because the substrates
    for phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge are likely located
    relatively close to each other in perisylvian—parasylvian regions).
    
    Present Tense versus Past Tense
    
    A number of studies have reported that subjects with Broca's aphasia
    (and, in one study, Wernicke's aphasia) have more difficulty with past
    than present tense (see Jonkers and de Bruin 2009). These studies do not
    provide sufficient data on the attributes of the various languages
    reported to enable explanations in terms of the principles elucidated in
    this book. However, several predictions can be made. Whether subjects
    have more difficulty in producing or comprehending past tense forms
    will depend on the frequency of these forms relative to present tense
    forms (hence their susceptibility to disruption by noise or lesions) and
    their consistency (competition between multiple forms in quasi-regular
    domains will increase the probability of an error). Subjects with Broca's
    aphasia also show a predilection for using the infinitive or the present
    participle—both of which reflect a flavor component without a thematic
    component to the verb semantic representation, which is to be expected
    in subjects with frontal lesions.
    
    The Competition Model and a Return to Syntax
  - |-

    In recent years, studies of disorders of syntax in aphasia have most often
    been hypothetically driven by theories of grammar. As noted, these
    theories are not logically grounded in neural network structure and
    function. Whatever heuristic value they might have has been
    undermined by the conflicting results of various published studies.
    Furthermore, these theoretical approaches have often sought a single
    magic bullet explanation for grammatic impairment, such as loss of
    capacity for trace deletion, pruning of the syntactic tree, or impaired
    capacity for verb movement. However, as we have seen, grammatic
    capacity is a complex and multidimensional function supported by many
    neural network systems (see also Milman, Dickey, and Thompson
    2008), involving competing regularities within quasi-regular domains
    and governed by parallel constraint satisfaction. The syntactic tree
    hypothesis, as currently formulated, does provide a reasonable index of
    the relative probability of impairments in subjects with agrammatism.
    However, empirical studies fail to support it as a deterministic
    mechanism (Milman, Dickey, and Thompson 2008)—entirely consistent
    with the concepts developed here that patterns of normal and abnormal
    language function reflect underlying statistical regularities.
    
    As discussed earlier, the competition model has provided a powerful
    account for disorders of grammatic morphology even as it is
    additionally well grounded in neural network structure and organization.
    The competition model can provide an equally powerful account for
    many disorders of syntax, and now that it has been fully fleshed out in
    this book, we are prepared to return briefly to syntax to illustrate this.
    
    Bastiaanse and Thompson (2003) administered a sentence completion
    task to English and Dutch subjects with Broca's aphasia that was
    designed to elicit either simple declarative sentences or sentences that
    included an embedded clause. English is an SVO language, whereas
    Dutch is a so-called SOV language. This is most apparent in
    constructions employing nonfinite verbs (infinitives and participles) and
    in the embedded clause of embedded clause sentences:
    
    English:
    "The boy has read a book."
    "This boy cuts the tomato."
    "This is the boy that cuts the tomato."
    
    Dutch:
    "De jongen heeft een boek gelezen." (The boy has a book read).
    "Deze jongen snijdt de tomaat." (This boy cuts the tomato).
  - |-
    "The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    "Dit is de jongen die de tomaat snijdt." (This is the boy that the tomato
    cuts).
    
    English subjects with Broca's aphasia often made errors of verb
    morphology, typically employing infinitive—stem or gerund as would be
    expected in this poorly inflected language, but made no word order
    errors (Bastiaanse and Thompson 2003). In contrast, Dutch subjects
    with Broca's aphasia made no morphologic errors but frequently made
    errors of word order, most often involving the matrix sentence verb of
    an embedded clause sentence. Bastiaanse and Thompson interpreted this
    finding as evidence that the Dutch subjects had problems when
    movement of the verb from the sentence terminal to the postsubject
    position was required. An alternative interpretation, favored by the
    competition model, is that in Dutch, the position of the verb relative to
    the subject is unreliable (there are competing regularities within a quasi-
    regular sentence-level sequence domain), with the result that in aphasia,
    order errors are likely to occur and these errors are most likely to
    involve the most inconsistent forms, i.e., involving the matrix sentence
    verb).'' In contrast, in English, SVO word order is one of the most
    consistent attributes of the language, and therefore it tends to be
    preserved even in the face of extensive brain damage. That is, errors in
    both languages involve the quasi-regular domain with most closely
    competing or least well-instantiated subdomains.
    
    This interpretation finds further support in a study by Kok, Kolk, and
    Haverkort (2006) of Dutch subjects with Broca's aphasia that seemed
    superficially to contradict the results of Bastiaanse and Thompson
    (2003). Kok et al. employed a different type of embedded clause
    construction (constituent order in the embedded clause noted in braces;
    N = noun; V = verb):
    
    (1) "Ik ben blij, want mijn vader kookte gisteren het eten." {NVN} (I
    am glad because my father cooked yesterday the food.)
    
    (2) "Ik ben blij, omdat mijn vader gisteren het eten kookte." {NNV}(I
    am glad because my father yesterday the food cooked.)"
  - |-
    (3) "Ik ben blij, want gisteren kookte mijn vader het eten." {VNN?}(I am glad because yesterday my father cooked the food.)
    (4) "Ik ben blij, omdat gisteren mijn vader het eten kookte." {NNV}(I am glad because yesterday my father cooked the food.)
    
    The critical determinants of word order are the choice of the conjunction "because" ("want" vs. "omdat") and the placement of the adverb "yesterday" ("gisteren"). The choice of "omdat" always requires an NNV construction, regardless of the position of the adverb. However, with "want," postpositioning of the adverb requires an NVN construction, whereas prepositioning of the adverb requires a VNN construction. Notably, even though sentences employing "omdat" always require the NNV construction, normal subjects are far more likely to choose the form of sentence type 2 than sentence type 4. Matrix sentence word order errors (in the sense used by Bastiaanse and Thompson 2003) were rendered highly unlikely by the experimental design.
  - |-
    Now, to compare the results of these studies, Bastiaanse and Thompson (2003) tested two competing regularities in a quasi-regular sequence domain, one used in the matrix sentence and one in the embedded clause, and found that verb order errors largely occurred in the matrix sentence, which employed the marked (SVO) form (51% error rate), and uncommonly occurred in the embedded clauses (21% error rate), all of which employed the SOV construction. However, Kok, Kolk, and Haverkort (2006) constrained the matrix sentence and tested four different competing regularities involving embedded clauses, two of which (types 2 and 4) involved a verb final construction. If errors were related to problems with constructions requiring verb movement, one would expect errors to occur overwhelmingly with sentence types 1 and 3. However, if errors stemmed exclusively from the competition of regularities in a quasi-regular domain, one would expect all sentence types to be more or less equally affected, all other things being equal. In addition, one would expect more word order errors with the less preferred, and therefore statistically less likely, sentence 4 form, even though the embedded clause is verb final. This is precisely what Kok, Kolk, and Haverkort (2006) found. The average number of word order errors was 12% for the embedded clause of sentence type 1, 17% for sentence type 2, 20% for sentence type 3, and 36% for sentence type 4. Thus, viewed in terms of the model I have introduced, and in particular in terms of competition between various regularities in a quasi-regular sequence domain, there is no contradiction between the results of Kok, Kolk, and Haverkort (2006) and those of Bastiaanse and Thompson (2003).
    
    Further pursuing the verb movement hypothesis, Bastiaanse and Thompson tested a group of English subjects with Broca's aphasia in their ability to generate simple declarative sentences, simple declarative sentences with an auxiliary verb, and yes—no question sentences in which the auxiliary is separated from the main verb, for example,
  - |-
    (1) "The convict kicks the sheriff."
    (2) "The convict is kicking the sheriff."
    (3) "Is the convict kicking the sheriff?"
    
    Far more errors occurred with the third sentence type, and they were
    equally likely to involve complete omission of the auxiliary and failure
    to move the auxiliary to the beginning of the sentence. Again, the
    interpretation was that movement, in this case auxiliary movement,
    posed a particular problem for subjects with Broca's aphasia. On the
    other hand, the competition model would account for these results in
    terms of the greater cue cost involved in splitting the auxiliary from the
    main verb, which places additional demands on working memory.
    Sentence 3 also involves a word order issue (the use of Aux NVN instead
    of N Aux VN), subsumable under the rubric of cue reliability, that
    corresponds to use of a less frequent sequence regularity within a quasi-
    regular sequence domain. Complete omission of the auxiliary may also
    reflect some of the factors discussed earlier that make auxiliary verbs
    particularly fragile in the context of Broca's aphasia.
    
    A recent study (Burchert, Meissner, and De Bleser 2008) of adverb—
    object sequencing in Dutch subjects with agrammatic aphasia was
    interpreted as evidence in support of the derived order problem
    hypothesis motivated by linguistic theory (Bastiaanse and Zonnefeld
    2005). However, the results are also entirely consistent with the
    competition model applied to sentence-level sequence knowledge and,
    in turn, with acquired preferences in a quasi-regular sequence domain.
    The experiment involved a sentence completion paradigm in which a
    canonical or scrambled (but grammatic) word order was used:
    
    Canonical:
    
    "Das ist der Junge, der gerade das Haus malt und das ist der Junge,
    der..." (Target: "gerade die Blume malt').
    
    "This is the boy who right now the house paints, and this is the boy who
    ..." (right now the flower paints").
    
    Scrambled:
    
    "Das ist der Junge, der das Hause gerade malt und das ist der Junge,
    der..." (Target: "die Blume gerade malt').
    
    "This is the boy who the house right now paints and this is the boy
    who..." ("the flower right now paints').
  - |-
    Control subjects made no errors in the canonical condition but occasionally produced canonical sequences in the scrambled condition.
    Subjects with agrammatic aphasia made far more errors in the scrambled condition, and these errors consisted of either reversion to the canonical sequence or adverb omission, both interpretable as the result of damage with graceful degradation.
    
    Bastiaanse and Thompson (2003) provided adequate data on the pertinent language-specific regularities of the linguistic phenomenon they studied to enable interpretation of their results in terms of the competition model. Unfortunately, most studies of syntactic aberrations in Broca's aphasia motivated by grammatic theory do not provide such information, precluding both a competition model interpretation and further refinement of the competition model.
    
    Competing regularities in quasi-regular sequence domains may become overt in subjects with impaired grammatic function who have difficulty completing a sentence. We reported a _ subject with morphologic agrammatism and mild anomia but preserved syntax who, during discourse, appeared to maintain selective engagement of several sequence plans, switching back and forth as he encountered difficulty, most often caused by anomia or morphologic dysfunction (Nadeau and Gonzalez-Rothi 1993).
    
    Disorders of Comprehension
    
    Impairment in grammatic comprehension deriving from disorders of grammatic morphology was discussed above in the section on cross-linguistic aphasia studies. Here we turn to a broader consideration of disorders of grammatic comprehension.
  - |-
    Notwithstanding that preserved comprehension is commonly viewed as a defining characteristic of Broca's aphasia, characteristic impairments in comprehension have long been recognized (de Bleser 1987). Caramazza and Zurif (1976) brought the matter to the fore in their demonstration that subjects with Broca's aphasia have difficulty interpreting sentences with center-embedded relative clauses in which either of two nouns could logically be the agent of the action in the subordinate clause (e.g., The lion that the tiger is chasing is fat). Later, it was shown that semantic reversibility adversely affected interpretation of simple active and passive sentences (Ansell and Flowers 1982; Schwartz, Saffran, and Marin 1980). Berndt, Mitchum, and Haendiges (1996), in a meta-analysis of 64 reported data sets, provided dramatic evidence of a continuous spectrum of performance on active and passive voice sentences among English-speaking subjects with Broca's aphasia. Some subjects performed well above chance if not absolutely normally with both sentence types. Some scored well above chance with active voice sentences but either at chance or significantly worse than chance with passive voice sentences. Some scored no better than chance for either sentence type. Some scored at chance level with active voice sentences and either better or worse than chance with passive voice sentences. Despite considerable efforts to reconcile these data with a unifactorial theoretical linguistic account (Grodzinsky et al. 1999), in the subsequent heated debate, Berndt, Caramazza, and their colleagues (Caramazza et al. 2001) convincingly argued that the data were valid and indicative of a multifactorial account. Caramazza et al. (2005) have since provided overwhelming evidence of a multifactorial account in a study of 38 Italian subjects with Broca's aphasia and imaging evidence of damage to Broca's area.
  - |-
    In a general way, this spectrum of differential comprehension of semantically reversible active and passive voice sentences (as well as the spectrum of differential impairment of comprehension and production) is what one might have predicted on the basis of the anatomically distributed multicomponent model of grammatic function introduced in this book. The proximity of networks (particularly those subserving grammatic morphology) and pathways (particularly portions of the fan arrays) supporting grammatic comprehension and production would statistically favor more or less comparable involvement of each in the context of a perisylvian stroke (Caramazza et al. 2001), even as particular, more limited lesions or unusual right-hemisphere capacity might lead to dramatic dissociations in certain cases. Dissociations between comprehension and production are likely to stem from differential involvement of more posterior or anterior portions, respectively, of the perisylvian pattern associator network supporting grammatic morphology (in which case differences in the profile of morphologic dysfunction would be expected) or differential involvement of the afferent and efferent fan arrays, respectively, linking the phonologic and morphologic processors to prefrontal networks involved in determining the pattern of verb modification of argument representations that instantiates thematic roles. Dysfunction in these same domains also likely accounts for dissociations between the comprehension of active and passive sentences. Both dissociations between comprehension and production and between active and passive voice comprehension may reflect differential contributions by the right hemisphere. The extremely high cue validity of SVO word order in English and the distributed nature of this knowledge tend to preserve comprehension of actives and, all other things being equal, might lead to a tendency to consistently misinterpret passives (below chance performance). This tendency is inhibited by free-standing grammatic morphemes (is/was ... by). However, the cue reliability of these morphemes is not absolute, and if their cue perceivability is also reduced because of a perisylvian lesion, the subject may develop an awareness that word order is not the only operational cue but be less able to make a reliable interpretation, in which case chance response patterns may occur. Comprehension of passives may also simply be

    more difficult (Caramazza et al. 2001), a reflection of their less frequent
    use, particularly in spoken language—a factor that would tend to favor
    closer to chance performance on passives than actives in any aphasic
    subject. In a simulation involving a recurrent PDP network that in effect
    represented a much simplified substrate for habits of sequential
    manipulation, St. John and Gernsbacher (1998) showed that frequency
    of exposure during the learning process had a significant protective
    effect on network comprehension in the face of noise.
    
    Imputation of agent and patient in passive voice constructions may
    depend upon two anatomically separate processes. Diesfeldt (2004)
    observed that a Dutch subject with semantic dementia was able to
    comprehend truncated passives such as
    
    "The cow was pushed"
    but performed at chance level on full passives, such as
    "The cow was pushed by the farmer."
    
    It appears that when this subject was able to rely solely on the thematic
    component of verb meaning, represented in prefrontal cortex spared by
    the disease process, he was able to reliably identify the patient,
    notwithstanding the degraded representation of "cow." On the other
    hand, the phrase "by the" effectively serves as an adjective that normally
    confers the property of agency, in this case on "farmer." Because most
    of this agency-modified noun concept was posteriorly represented, in
    cortices affected by the disease, it served as a source of confusion to the
    subject. One would predict that this subject would also have problems in
    comprehending nouns modified by adjectives. This was not tested. One
    might also predict that subjects with other forms of primary progressive
    aphasia, most notably the behavioral variant, might have more difficulty
    with truncated passive voice constructions than with full passives.

    A number of interesting discoveries can be reasonably interpreted  
    within the framework of the competition model (and corresponding  
    competing neural representations) if the competition model is  
    understood in a broader sense. The competition model was originally  
    conceived as a theoretically motivated account of normal language  
    function in terms of variously competing or synergistic principles  
    implicitly acquired in the experience of a particular language  
    (corresponding to parallel constraint satisfaction involving multiple  
    neural networks and the regularities in the knowledge they have wired  
    into neural connectivity though experience). Because of the distributed  
    nature of language knowledge and the principle of graceful degradation,  
    the competition model provides a powerful and logical explanation for  
    alterations of language in aphasia. However, but for one major exception  
    —cue assignability, with its link to working memory—the competition  
    model is predicated solely on the function of neural networks primarily  
    or exclusively involved in language function. This is an artificial  
    limitation: the model can accommodate all brain functions bearing on  
    language, however directly or indirectly, including working memory, but  
    also prefrontally based representations instantiating task strategy.
  - |-
    Broadening the domain of the competition model in this way changes  
    the spectrum of neural representations that enter into the competition. In  
    the original model, this spectrum was limited to representations based  
    upon acquired language knowledge. A more broadly conceived  
    competition model that includes the influence of prefrontal  
    representations will reflect the fact that prefrontal representations  
    instantiate plans for action (or thought) that reflect the subject's  
    response, involuntary or volitional, to the entire experimental situation.  
    This perspective anticipates a number of findings reported in the  
    literature. Test-retest performance in comprehension of actives and  
    passives can be quite inconsistent (Berndt, Mitchum, and Haendiges  
    1996; Schwartz, Saffran, and Marin 1980), presumably reflecting plan  
    alteration by intervening experience and acquired familiarity with the  
    experimental paradigm, differences in the experimental situation, or the  
    Subject's experience prior to testing on the day of the experiment.  
    Predicative knowledge about the noun representations elicited by  
    semantically reversible sentences may bias response (e.g., dogs are more  
    likely to chase cats than vice versa; Mitchum, Haendiges, and Berndt  
    2004). In studies of comprehension of actives and passives in which the  
    sentence is heard and the subject has to respond yes—no on subsequent  
    presentation of a corresponding picture (with the attendant working  
    memory load), some subjects may display a strong affirmative bias  
    (Mitchum, Haendiges, and Berndt 2004). In studies involving forced  
    choice between two alternative pictures, accuracy of response to both  
    actives and passives may be influenced by the position of the picture  
    (top or bottom; Mitchum, Haendiges, and Berndt 2004), presumably  
    reflecting a propensity for closer scrutiny of pictures in a particular  
    location. This could reflect an interaction of impaired language  
    mechanisms with deficits in attentional systems associated with vertical  
    neglect.

    Grammar is the emergent product of a host of variously distributed auto-
    associator networks and their connecting pattern associator networks
    (see table 3.1 and equations 3.1—3.3). The knowledge in these networks,
    instantiated as the strengths of neural connections, is acquired through
    language experience. The patterns of this knowledge, which define the
    attractor basins and subbasins and attractor trenches and subtrenches of
    network activity functions (see figure 2.2), reflect the implicit
    (statistical) regularities of the language spoken. Input to this apparatus
    derives from perceptual systems, intentional systems (dorsolateral
    prefrontal and orbitofrontal-limbic), and the complementary
    contributions of hippocampal episodic memory and selective engagement of what has recently been said. The product of the grammar
    apparatus, whether spoken language or comprehension, reflects the
    mutual settling of the linked networks into quasi-optimal states through
    the process of parallel constraint satisfaction.' The limitations of the
    apparatus, and the mistakes it makes, reflect the limitations of the
    human brain; the degree to which each network is taxed during language
    use; and the degree to which quasi-optimal states achieved through
    parallel constraint satisfaction deviate from truly optimal, because it is
    impossible to perfectly meet all relevant constraints, because language
    processing in practice proceeds too quickly to allow full remodeling of
    natural attractor basins and trenches and settling into them (Spivey
    2007), or because the target state requires excessive distortion of these
    basins and trenches. The product of the grammar apparatus in the
    context of brain lesions reflects, first and foremost, the premorbid
    regularities in language knowledge, but also the locus, extent, and
    degree of brain damage, the property of graceful degradation intrinsic to
    neural networks, and the extent to which affected knowledge domains
    are also represented in other regions of the injured hemisphere and in
    the nondominant hemisphere (see table 5.1).
    Table 5.1
    Major Principles governing grammar and impairment of grammatic function
  - |-
    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and presented verbatim:
    
    1. Parallel constraint satisfaction involving goal-directed sequential concept manipulation, distributed semantic representations, phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge, semantic—morphologic/phonologic (lexical) knowledge, syntactic-morphologic (lexical) knowledge, and sentence-level sequence knowledge.
    
    2. Different distributed semantic representations of nouns and verbs, hence differential involvement in brain lesions. Fractional degradation of meaning with focal lesions (e.g., visual attributes of nouns with inferior temporal lesions and thematic aspects of verbs with frontal lesions) and associated category-specific disorders (e.g., living things with inferior temporal lesions and light verbs with frontal lesions).
    
    3. Lexical knowledge instantiated in fan arrays linking association cortices to dominant (and nondominant) perisylvian cortex. These same fan arrays provide the basis for constraint of morphologic sequence representations by semantics and other concepts (e.g., tense, mood) instantiated in association cortices. Variable and idiosyncratic involvement of fan arrays by middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution strokes creates the wild-card effect.
    
    4. Preservation of function in the context of brain damage reflects combined effects of the following:
       a. Locus of lesion interacting with degree of geographic distribution of the function.
       
       b. The particularly invidious effects of dominant-hemisphere perisylvian lesions—the most common site of major damage from MCA distribution infarctions—on morphologic and phonologic sequence knowledge.
       
       c. Redundancy of representation in neural network connectivity.
       
       d. Degree to which the right hemisphere contains similar knowledge.
    
    5. Competition model substantially reflects a competition between various statistical regularities in the knowledge within each of the multiple systems participating in the parallel constraint satisfaction process that yields grammatic behavior. These forms usually correspond to subbasins and subtrenches within attractor basins and trenches corresponding to quasi-regular domains, but sometimes to completely different basins and trenches.
    
    6. Language-specific lesion effects:
    
       a. The effects of language properties outweigh the effects of lesion on pattern of deficits observed because behavior in aphasia reflects graceful degradation of existing language knowledge.
       
       b. Grammatic morphology is differentially spared in heavily inflected languages, suggesting more redundant encoding of morphologic sequence knowledge, but also parallel, but likely less well developed right-hemisphere knowledge.
  - |-
    c. Grammatical morphology of verb inflection reflects convergent actions of two pattern associator networks, one engaging the phonological route of word production and thereby instantiating type effects (with much lesser token effects) and one engaging the whole word route of concept naming and thereby instantiating only token effects.
    
    i. Type effects, normally particularly affected by anterior perisylvian lesions causing Broca's aphasia, are severely affected in English, but in heavily inflected languages, the predominant type effect may be largely spared because of right-hemisphere representations, and error patterns reflect competition between less common quasi-regular forms.
    
    d. Syntactic deficits reflect loss of knowledge of regularities in sentence-level sequence knowledge. Because of the principle of graceful degradation, errors are most likely to involve the most inconsistent forms within quasi-regular sequence domains and reversion to the representation nearest to the centroid—the canonical form.
  - |-
    The model discussed here seems to fly in the face of modularity. For  
    example, visual association cortices in temporal and parietal lobes  
    provide the basis for visual processing; they serve as the substrate for  
    visual knowledge and, by virtue of the fact that we are substantially  
    visual animals, the substrate for a large portion of our semantic  
    knowledge; and they provide the substrate for the flavor component of  
    verb meaning. Premotor cortex provides the basis for precision  
    movement (pyramidal function), but it also serves as the major substrate  
    for the implementational component of verb meaning. All this is not to  
    say, however, that modularity is dead, only that it lives in a functional  
    rather than an anatomic form. To understand this, it must be recalled that  
    the brain consists almost entirely of hidden units in the PDP sense. This  
    means that the activity of these units, anywhere in the brain, cannot be  
    interpreted in direct behavioral terms." Rather, the activity of a given set  
    of units reflects their transient engagement in a set of working  
    associations, which, in turn, define a module. The necessary transient  
    selective engagement of widely disseminated cortices as working  
    associations to constitute functional modules likely explains why the  
    human brain is substantially a single-channel cognitive machine. In our  
    discussion of the implementational component of verb meaning, we saw  
    what happened when two functional modules, one supporting language,  
    one supporting goal-oriented movement, but both engaging premotor—  
    motor cortex, were simultaneously engaged. They collided with one  
    another, leading to interference effects and degraded processing.
  - |-
    The model discussed here also strikes to the heart of the rules and symbols versus statistical regularities debate. I would argue that this debate primarily reflects hesitancy to let go of traditional and heretofore heuristically useful ways of theorizing about brain mechanisms underlying cognitive processes. I have argued that this is a fundamentally closed issue—beyond any shadow of scientific doubt, rules and symbols are emergent products of distributed representations and processes, not literal products of neural rule machines. However, here I will argue that there is really nothing to debate. Although cognition is born of population activity functions that are guided by statistical regularities in neural connectivity, these regularities, in conjunction with the substantially discrete nature of brain inputs and outputs, provide the basis for a dizzying array of discrete states, many reflecting binary opportunities, hence rules and symbols. First and foremost, statistical regularities in neural connectivity provide the basis for attractor basins and attractor trenches. Therefore, at any one time, network activity functions have settled into either the right or the wrong attractor basin or trench—for example, "What I see is an elephant, not a rat" or "The past tense of ‘hit' is ‘hit,' not ‘hitted.'" I have focused on the landscape of basins and trenches underlying language function, but one can presume that regularities in the neural connectivity of orbitofrontal-limbic systems also define attractor basins—hence binary rather than graded value assignments—for example, "I prefer apples to pears," "I prefer not to be naked in public even when the weather is hot," "That sentence is ungrammatic," or "That is not logical" (but also graded value assignments when quasi-regular value domains compete). Plans, the essential product of prefrontal systems, orbitofrontal—limbic and dorsolateral prefrontal, are intrinsically binary: they do or do not exist. Plans that reflect compromises can be developed, but two plans cannot simply be blended. Actions are also discrete and binary: I reflexively do or do not jerk my hand away from the hot stove, or I volitionally do or do not reach for my coffee. Three dimensions of brain function can immediately be identified that add extraordinary richness.
  - |-
    and complexity to this spectrum of fundamentally discrete emergent neural network state opportunities. First, the featural basis of concrete word distributed representations means that any given representation primes a host of other representations that share features with it and can therefore potentially replace it, and the mechanisms supporting abstract nouns and verbs as working associations involving contextual associations provide great opportunity for achieving change of meaning to other discrete alternatives as a result of change in context. These mechanisms provide the basis for a panoply, as opposed to pairs, of discrete alternatives, but not for continuous gradations of choice (though clearly we have other means at our disposal that enable us to perceive gradations and make graded responses). Second, because nouns and verbs defined at any one time by the brain state activity function prime other nouns and verbs, there is the potential for serial movement from brain state to brain state over time, steered by perceptual input, memory, dorsolateral prefrontal definition of narrative plans, and orbitofrontal—limbic definition of subjective value—the basis for logical (or illogical) trains of thought (see equation 3.2). Third, language itself, oral and written, ranging from conversational to mathematical, provides an external system of explicit symbols in particular relationship to each other that can steer engaged neural network activity functions into corresponding attractor basins and trenches, thereby making language a powerful tool in enabling the brain's capacity for manipulation of rules and symbols. In short, rules and symbols are a guaranteed product of the distributed neural network brain described in this book, and thankfully, we now have the ability to understand why this should be so.

    Much of grammar involves regularities of word sequence. Linguists in the tradition of Noam Chomsky have claimed that linguistic diversity is constrained by the setting during language acquisition of a limited set of parameters in a universal neurally instantiated grammatic device (Baker 2001; Chomsky 1981, 1986). For example, when heads are set to be first, verbs are placed before objects and adpositions before nouns (i.e., aS prepositions). Traits set by any given parameter will strongly if not absolutely covary. Linguists in the Greenberg tradition have taken a non-mechanistic but only slightly less deterministic position: in lieu of a universal set of parameters determining various word order patterns, a universal set of statistical biases determines these patterns (Dryer 2007; Greenberg 1963; Hawkins 2009). In contrast, the theoretical framework forwarded in this book makes a fundamentally different claim: the grammar anyone of us uses is not intrinsically universal except to the extent that it reflects the capacity and organization of human neural systems. Instead it is based on the statistical regularities of our own linguistic experience (instantiated in neural connectivity), which have been determined by the modest community of people we have conversed with or read. This grammar will have an enormous amount in common with the grammar of the universe of people who speak our language at the present time and it will largely respect the patterns of word order regularity of our parent language as it has evolved over the centuries, buffeted by historical and cultural forces (see, e.g., Lerer 2007). In this view, there is no reason whatever to expect that other languages, which have evolved to one degree or another separately, and been buffeted by completely different historical and cultural forces, should have evolved, either population-wide or in their myriad local micro-communities, the sets of parametric or statistical word order correlations we have arrived at, except to the extent that these languages share commonalities of origin with our language. This view predicts that in the statistical analysis of word sequence patterns in different languages, language-specific patterns will be substantially idiosyncratic. This is precisely what recent studies have shown (Dunn et al. 2011).

    This book presents but a broad overview of the major domains of knowledge supporting grammatic function and the functional relationships between the neural networks supporting these domains, as constrained by the known neuroanatomy and principles of neurophysiology (e.g., selective engagement). Consequently, the picture of grammatic function that emerges remains — substantially underspecified. Nevertheless, this picture appears to be remarkably consistent given the disparate fields of investigation that led to its formulation.
    
    This book has dealt with the statistical regularities of behavior of the substantially established neural networks of adults. However, the ontogenesis of cortical anatomy reflects statistical regularities in the migration of neurons to the cortex, the attrition of many of them along the way, and the interconnectivity they establish in the process. The development of that interconnectivity is guided by language experience, which has absolute primacy in determining the breadth, depth, and patterns of our language knowledge (you can't take the Turkish out of the Turk). This experience in one language could lead to attrition of connections that could be important to speaking another language—if proven, a strong argument for teaching of additional languages early in life rather than in secondary school or college.
  - |-
    Disorders like SLI are likely to be most useful as experimental models in the clues they provide to how this ontogenesis of anatomy and connectivity might run amok. Heterozygous mutations of the FOXP2 gene were first identified as a cause of this rare Mendelian inherited speech and language disorder (Vernes et al. 2008). FOXP2 encodes a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a number of genes, mutations of which may represent more common causes of SLI.
    
    Significant quantitative associations have been demonstrated in families with probands afflicted by SLI between mutations in one of these regulated genes, CNTNAP2, and nonword repetition, a robust endophenotype of SLI (Vernes et al. 2008). CNTNAP2 is differentially expressed during human ontogenesis in the middle and inferior frontal gyri (Abrahams et al. 2007). It may mediate intercellular interactions during neuroblast migration and laminar organization of the brain during cortical development (Strauss et al. 2006). It is thus possible that CNTNAP2 mutations lead, through defective neuroblast migration and lamination in middle and inferior frontal gyri, to reduction in hidden units or associated connectivity (e.g., reduction in dendritic arborization or spine density) in para- and perisylvian networks supporting phonologic and morphologic sequence knowledge, with the resultant endophenotypic traits of impaired nonword repetition and defective grammatic morphology characteristic of SLI.
  - |-
    A closing word is in order regarding PDP theory, which is woven throughout this book. PDP models are to this day often regarded as heuristic. They are not. They truly model the brain. Nevertheless, it is fair to ask, how much can we accept as fact about the assumptions of PDP theory and how much must be considered hypothesis? While this is not the place to offer a systematic defense of PDP models, the following principles are supported by so much evidence that they can be considered noncontroversial: (1) population encoding of representations (hence distributed representations and graceful degradation; Rolls and Treves 1998), (2) encoding of knowledge (and skills) as connection strengths (synaptic strengths), and (3) the acquisition of knowledge through experience and, with it, implicit rules corresponding to regularities in that experience, hence attractor basins and attractor trenches. PDP models critically depend upon nonlinearities in unit function—certainly a property of neurons. Their power stems from the presence of abundant hidden units and massive connectivity (most of the mass of the human brain is white matter). What cannot be accepted as fact is any particular PDP model (including any of the models discussed in this book). Rather, a particular PDP model is best viewed as a hypothesis about neural network structure and function. Like any hypothesis about the brain, PDP models should be subjected to further testing. However, the failure of a particular PDP model to meet certain behavioral or neural benchmarks should not be viewed as an indictment of such fundamentals as population coding of representations or the capacity for acquisition of implicit rules reflecting regularities in experience. Rather, it should be viewed only as an indication of the limitations of that particular model and perhaps the incorrectness of some of the assumptions that were made in its particular design.

    The foregoing analysis of the neural architecture of grammar enables us to speak very specifically to the implications of this architecture for empiricist and nativist (nurture vs. nature) theories of grammar. It strongly supports what Elizabeth Bates termed emergentist theory (see Bates and Goodman 1997 and 1999 for reviews of the empirical data bearing on this). Our analysis defines the following native essentials to the development of language function, grammar included:
    
    • Domains of feature pattern knowledge sustained by auto-associator networks, the key ones being semantic, articulatory motor, and acoustic.
    
    • Domains of sequence knowledge supported by pattern associator networks that almost certainly incorporate recurrent network features, the most important being phonologic sequence, morphologic sequence, and sentence-level sequence.
    
    • Massive interconnectivity between these domains, which enables the vast and comprehensive interactivity crucial to parallel constraint satisfaction and additionally instantiates vast repertoires of knowledge (e.g., lexical).
    
    • Declarative and procedural learning mechanisms that enable the trillions of neural connections involved to be modified throughout life, most dramatically in early life, thereby conferring a vast capacity for learning through language experience.
    
    • The intrinsic capacity of neural networks to instantiate the Statistical regularities of experience as implicit rules (what might be termed implicit inference).
    
    • The strong capacity and predilection of the human brain, largely prefrontally based, for explicit inference—the capacity and willingness to derive a hypothesis, test it, and learn from the consequences (an oft neglected concept in assertions that the quantity of language experienced by a child is insufficient to encode the grammatic capacity ultimately demonstrated).
    
    • Neural support systems, most critically the capacity for selective engagement, which instantiates working memory and, to a substantial degree, working associations, and very rapid (one-second latency) hippocampally mediated episodic memory acquisition, which complements selective engagement (Shrager et al. 2008).
    
    • Perceptual systems that automatically generate representations in neural networks via the capacity for content addressable memory that is intrinsic to distributed neural networks.
    
    • Systems, largely prefrontal, supporting the instantiation and pursuit of linguistic communicative goals.
  - |-
    The actual language product is a function of the patterns of neural connection strengths that are established in these systems in the course of language and thinking experience (see equations 3.1—3.3). The similarities between languages reflect the fact that we all have approximately the same Homo sapiens brain. Language function is emergentist in two ways: (1) it emerges from the shaping of neural connectivity in the process of language experience, most dramatically in the first three years of life, and (2) it emerges on a moment to moment basis from the interaction of the multiple neural systems involved, melded by the process of parallel constraint satisfaction.
    
    Future Research Directions
    
    In this section, I offer some thoughts, in no particular order, for directions that future language research might profitably take.
    
    Complementarity of Stroke and Dementia as Lesion Models
  - |-
    MCA territory stroke, by virtue of the fairly consistent infarction of perisylvian cortex, provides an excellent lesion model for the study of morphologic and phonologic processes. To the extent that convexity cortex is involved, it may provide the basis for insight into semantic function (including the semantics of verbs). However, MCA territory stroke variably damages white matter tracts (fan arrays), introducing the wild-card effect into semantic—morphologic/phonologic (lexical) components of language function. This has been used to great advantage by such investigators as Caramazza and Hillis (1991) to tease apart parallel language subsystems (spoken, written; production, comprehension). However, it has also clouded the results of innumerable investigations. On the other hand, dementias, most particularly the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and semantic dementia, but also Alzheimer's disease, produce pure lesions of semantic cortex. The behavioral variant of FTD produces an almost pure frontal lesion (predominantly orbitofrontal in early stages of the disease), sparing perisylvian cortex, and semantic dementia produces an almost pure lesion of temporal cortex, thereby providing ideal opportunities for the study of verb representations in the absence of either the wild-card effect or perisylvian pathology. Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is associated with a somewhat protean distribution of pathology. However, in many cases there is particularly severe involvement of parietal and premotor cortex and particularly severe ideomotor apraxia. Thus, CBD may be a particularly good model for study of locative prepositions, practic verbs, and the implementational component of all verbs. The syndrome of posterior cortical atrophy (usually an Alzheimer's disease variant) is commonly associated with severe pathology of posterior parietal cortex, and thus it may also be a good model for study of locative prepositions, as well as the path component of verb representations.
    
    White Matter Connections
  - |-
    The brain is mostly white matter as befits a connectionist machine.
    However, since Normal Geschwind's seminal work, "Disconnexion
    Syndromes in Animals and Man" (Geschwind 1965), the contribution of
    white matter lesions to aphasia has drawn little attention. Only recently,
    with the advent of diffusion tensor imaging, have we seen a flurry of
    studies exploring the arcuate fasciculus and the occipitotemporofrontal
    fasciculus. Yet, there has been little or no study of the fan arrays. A more
    precise understanding of the trajectories of these white matter pathways
    might enable us to tame the wild-card effect. Subjects with rare diseases
    that exclusively and homogeneously affect white matter—for example,
    metachromatic leukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy—may
    provide a model for studying the neural instantiation of lexicons in the
    same way that patients with semantic dementia provide a model for
    studying semantic representations. Their chief shortcoming as models of
    lexical damage lies in the prominence of prefrontal dysfunction resulting
    from frontal disconnection. Studies of subjects with subcortical
    microvascular dementia, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury
    may also provide insights into the role of long white matter pathways
    linking prefrontal with postcentral associations cortices and perisylvian
    cortex; however, the focality of lesions in these diseases may be
    experimentally challenging.
    
    The Role of the Hippocampus in Grammatic Function
    
    The role of working memory in various components of grammatic
    function has been one of the many themes of this book. However, this
    working memory, which is sustained by selective engagement of neural
    networks, is complemented by memory of recent language produced by
    the subject and his or her conversation partner that is actually encoded
    in changes in neural connectivity within the hippocampus as episodic
    memory (Shrager et al. 2008). The hippocampal contribution to
    grammatic function could usefully be studied in subjects with the
    amnesic syndrome due to selective hippocampal damage (e.g., by
    anoxic events).
    
    Impact of Prefrontal Dysfunction
  - |-
    The potential roles of prefrontal cortex have been another recurring theme in this book. Focal prefrontal lesions caused by stroke or tumor, but also behavioral variant FTD, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and disseminated or multifocal white matter disease provide lesion models to explore these further. Among other things, the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in sentence-level sequence habits (prediction: prefrontal dysfunction will result in errors closer to the centroid of sentence-level sequence attractor trenches), working memory, and thematic aspects of verb semantics. One can further posit that prefrontal engagement of postcentral cortex is crucial to verb and noun selection in a fashion precisely tailored to communicative demands, and that prefrontal dysfunction will result in verb and noun utilization behavior—the more automatic selection of verbs and nouns closer to the centroids of their attractor basins (see Nadeau and Heilman 2007 for discussion of the principles involved).
    
    Linguistic utilization behavior might be manifested in other ways. The propensity of nouns and verbs to automatically engage each other, by virtue of shared features, coupled with the tendency of these representations to remain online by virtue of working memory processes, may tend to set in motion a serial concept representation entrainment process (the momentum implicit in MFGDCR,"
    
    MFGDCR," - ... MFGDCR,,"). This can be both stimulated and

    Constrained by perceptual and linguistic input. However, a variety of disorders, broadly classifiable as utilization behavior, might occur if this process is not suitably reined in. Volitional withholding of prefrontal constraint may be responsible for the rambling babble we have all become familiar with during fundraising drives. Lesions affecting frontal systems most often result in reduced language fluency, but on occasion, with midline thalamic lesions, language is fluent and characterized by undisciplined and serially cued wandering from one semantic association to another, something we termed paradynamic aphasia (Nadeau and Crosson 1997) and that was initially described by Lhermitte (1984). Some of the language phenomena of schizophrenia may reflect the same general type of dysfunction, albeit with some unique flavors, for example, clang associations, which may represent phonologic neighborhood effects run amok in the absence of frontal constraint. The propensity for excessive, excessively anecdotal, and at times tangential monologue by the very elderly may represent yet another form of linguistic utilization behavior.
    
    Grammatic, Morphologic and Phonologic Function
    Many studies locate these functions to the perisylvian region, primarily in the dominant hemisphere. In principle, this would make them equally susceptible to the perisylvian lesions of MCA territory strokes. However, there has been little research on the details of concurrent grammatic morphologic and phonologic dysfunction. Impaired grammatic morphology with preservation of phonology has been reported (Miceli et al. 1983; Mimouni and Jarema 1997; Caramazza et al. 2000; Kavé, Ze'ev, and Lev 2007; Maher et al. 1995).
    
    Syntactic Function
    
    One feature defines Broca's aphasia in all languages: simplification of syntax. I have suggested that a major contributor is loss of the sentence-level sequence knowledge that underlies habits of sequential manipulation. To what extent can this be dissociated from deficits in selective engagement and modification (particularly verb modification) of distributed noun concept representations? Can the quasi-regular domains corresponding to sequential modification be systematically mapped?

    Many observations cited in this book have pointed to a major right-
    hemisphere role in grammatic morphology, particularly in richly
    inflected languages. However, this clearly warrants further study.
    Occasional well-studied subjects with a left-brain stroke experience a
    second stroke on the opposite hemisphere that can be very revealing
    (Nadeau and Gonzalez-Rothi 1993). r™TMS might be usefully employed
    to induce temporary "lesions" of the right hemisphere in subjects with
    
    left-brain strokes in order to test some of the hypotheses proposed in this
    book.
    
    The Competition Model
    
    The competition model provides an extraordinarily strong theoretical
    framework for the study of language disorders by virtue of its
    correspondence to neural network structure and function and its implicit
    characterization of language function in terms of parallel constraint
    satisfaction involving quasi-regular domains. The flourishing of cross-
    linguistic studies continues to provide the basis for advances in our
    understanding of language and the brain. Unfortunately, in the last 15
    years, we have seen few of the fully collaborative experimental studies
    that were pioneered by Elizabeth Bates, Brian MacWhinney, and their
    colleagues, studies that tested implicitly neural hypotheses and that used
    differences in language-specific patterns of regularity as a powerful tool
    to elucidate fundamental underlying mechanisms. This literature has
    been substantially forgotten of late, and we are largely back to seeking
    single-factor explanations for grammatic dysfunction founded in
    linguistic theory rather than neural principles, for example, the trace
    deletion hypothesis and hypotheses based upon various trimming of the
    syntactic tree.
    
    Mapping of the Cortical Extent of Lesions Using More Sensitive
    Techniques
  - |-
    The cortical extent of lesions is likely to be seriously underestimated by current image mapping techniques, which most commonly employ T1-weighted MRI or computerized tomography (Nadeau and Crosson 1997). Even the consistent use of fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences would enable a considerable advance. The MRI technique with the highest sensitivity for ischemic lesions is diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). The salient shortcomings of DWI for purposes of lesion mapping are that brain images are more susceptible to distortion (thus hindering mapping to anatomic images such as T1 weighted MRI) and that they substantially revert to normal within about one month. Functional imaging techniques, such as H,10O PET and 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT imaging of cerebral blood flow, and 18F-SEDG-PET imaging of cerebral metabolism, are the most sensitive means for mapping extent of cortical damage in chronic states, even as they pose risk of conflating anatomic damage with the influences of functional state. Lesion map subtraction and voxel based lesion symptom mapping approaches, commonly used to identify brain regions critically involved in particular functions, are fraught with a host of serious methodological problems and are beyond the scope of this discussion.
    
    Functional Imaging
    
    Functional imaging (fMRI, PET, SPECT) is founded in sound science, and when functional imaging experiments are well executed, they are capable of yielding important insights into brain function; witness the studies referenced in this book. Unfortunately, most functional imaging studies founder on two major omissions: (1) they are not hypothesis driven, and (2) little or no attention is given to the actual experience of the task employed in the study.
  - |-

    Lack of a specific motivating hypothesis means that no scientific question is asked, leaving none to be answered. In many studies, one is left with a smattering of putatively engaged regions, often in embarrassing places like white matter (in which there are scant synapses, synapses being the major loci of energy consumption in the brain), spinal fluid (where there are no synapses), or even skull or scalp muscle. The selection of bright spots that putatively reflect the effects of the experimental investigation thus becomes largely arbitrary, the subject of post hoc speculation, and the possibility is rarely considered that the spots selected could be the wrong ones—that they could reflect incidental rather than essential engagement or that they could reflect a statistical fluke associated with the particular group of subjects studied (hence the often poor reproducibility of a particular reported finding).
    
    The intrinsic propensity for hyperlocalization in functional imaging studies, built into the mathematics of image processing and compounded by interindividual differences in the distribution of cortical representations (see chapter 1, note 1), often confounds even those studies that seek to test a hypothesis. This is because it has promoted the idea that brain functions are highly localized (demonstrably not the case), and this in turn has fed into the overwhelming urge to account for regions of activity in very literal behavioral, if not frankly anthropomorphic, terms. As I have noted, the brain is almost entirely comprised of hidden units. Therefore, functional imaging studies can only give us clues as to the nature and distribution of neural computational processes. Hypothesis-driven, region-of-interest-centered, voxel-counting approaches that eschew the statistical techniques that engender hyperlocalization would go a long way to addressing this general problem.
  - |-
    It has long been a matter of deep faith in the functional imaging community that because a particular task theoretically engages a particular process, it must be doing so in the brains of the subjects studied. I was first sensitized to this problem many years ago when I volunteered in the course of assessing a planned test battery to participate in an auditory 3-back task. The experience was one of the most painful in my life, right up there with biliary colic and major migraine. Nonetheless, this task is widely accepted as an exemplary test of working memory.
    
    To conclude on a positive note, functional imaging studies, hypothesis driven and skillfully thought out and executed, can yield important insights into brain function in ways that are complementary to cognitive neuropsychological, psycholinguistic, cognitive psychological, and connectionist studies. I emphasize complementary. Functional imagers must reconcile their findings with principles of anatomy, neurophysiology, and cognitive function that have been well established through studies in these other disciplines. This is key to hypothesis generation and to correct interpretation of results.
    
    Application of the Neural Model to the Challenges of Linguistics
    
    Linguists have done a magnificent job of precisely and systematically mapping the language landscape. To date, however, the field of linguistics has sought to find logic in this complex terrain without recourse to neural principles. For linguists truly interested in how language is represented in the brain, the new challenge is this: when approaching a particular language phenomenon (e.g., the grammaticality or lack thereof a particular form), to ask, what quasi-regular domains are at play and what are the regularities captured by neural connectivity through language experience that account for this phenomenon? For aphasiologists, the question is, for any given aphasic phenomenon, what quasi-regular domains are at play, and how can the observed pattern of breakdown be accounted for in terms of the affected neuroanatomy and graceful degradation of the language-specific knowledge acquired though experience that shapes these language-specific quasi-regular domains and their relationships to each other.
    
    Replication

    Many of the observations and inferences in this book are supported by
    only one or two studies—clear evidence that replication, optimally
    cross-linguistic, is needed. Studies have been cited in this book if the
    data reported appeared to inform the theory introduced. In many
    instances, what initially appeared to be contradictory evidence served to
    pave the way for a previously unanticipated theoretical refinement.
    Again, the presence of only one or two literature citations in such
    instances signals a strong need for replication.
    
    Some studies, most notably those motivated by the competition model
    and PDP simulations, have tested implicitly neural hypotheses. Some,
    most notably those of Cynthia Thompson and her colleagues, have been
    motivated by linguistic theory but have been so well controlled and have
    provided sufficient background data on the regularities of the languages
    studied that the results can easily be interpreted in terms of neurally
    motivated theory. However, many studies have tested purely linguistic
    hypotheses. I have used the results of these studies in ways that the
    authors never could have imagined, let alone intended. Clearly
    replication is in order here.
    
    Implications for Rehabilitation
    
    Broadly speaking, language rehabilitation can be viewed as
    reestablishing the neural connectivity needed to recreate the complex
    terrain of attractor basins and attractor trenches that existed before the
    brain damage occurred. In complex basins and trenches, to the extent
    that exemplars share features, training of some exemplars may benefit
    others (Kiran, Ntourou, and Eubank 2007; Plaut 1996; Thompson et al.
    2003; Thompson, Shapiro, and Roberts 1993; Edmonds, Nadeau, and
    Kiran 2009; Kendall et al. 2008; Stadie et al. 2008). In very simple
    undifferentiated trenches, for example, those underlying the lexicons,
    such generalization effects will not occur and rehabilitation comes down
    to simply training the pairing of concepts with names (but see Nadeau,
    Rothi, and Rosenbek 2008).

    Language rehabilitation has long been conceptualized primarily as an
    exercise in reprogramming the left hemisphere. However, as discussed
    throughout this book, there are innumerable lines of evidence that, given
    the large left perisylvian lesions that characteristically cause aphasia,
    this narrow viewpoint is no longer tenable. It is not too much to say that
    the new frontier of language rehabilitation lies in methods of training up
    nascent language networks in the right hemisphere to the point that they
    can support useful language function.
    
    A major left-hemisphere stroke causes vast loss of the neural substrate
    for language as conceivably five to ten billion neurons, each with up to
    10,000 connections, are lost. The ability to replace this lost neural
    substrate could represent an enormous advance, although the promise,
    futuristic as it is, is further tempered by the fact that this virgin substrate
    would have to be trained up with language knowledge, no less than the
    brains of infants.
    
    Another alternative may be within closer reach. As I have noted, with
    stroke comes not just lesions of gray matter but also lesions of white
    matter: the arcuate fasciculus, the fan arrays, transcallosal fibers, and
    long anterior—posterior pathways, such as the occipitotemperofrontal
    fasciculus. After birth, a number of white matter proteins serve as potent
    inhibitors of axon growth via what is often referred to as the Nogo
    signal transduction pathway (now multiple pathways that involve many
    other receptors besides Nogo). The molecular details of these pathways
    are rapidly being revealed, and agents that might inhibit it, such as Rho-
    kinase inhibitors, have been identified (Walmsley and Mir 2007).
    Reestablishment of capacities for axonal regrowth through regions of
    damage that could benefit paresis due to stroke could also enhance the
    neural substrate for language rehabilitation.
    
    Glossary
    
    Attractor basin The state into which the neural activity function of an
    auto-associator network settles, thereby defining a particular distributed
    representation.
  - |-
    Attractor basin compatibility The extent to which a verb with featural plausibility distorts the natural attractor basin of the noun concept representations engaged by the phonologic form of the sentence. Thus, in "The cute bunny attacked the pit bulls," the addition of the "attacked" feature would minimally modify the natural attractor basin of the pit bull concept, but it would grossly distort the natural attractor basin of cute bunnies.
    
    Attractor trench The state into which the neural activity function of a pattern associator network incorporating sequence knowledge settles, thereby defining a particular distributed sequence representation.
    
    Auto-associator network A network in which all units are connected to many if not most of the other units of the network, thereby enabling the network activity function to settle into stable states, corresponding to attractor basins, that define representations. In some model simulations, heavily interconnected "clean-up unit" layers are used to confer attractor basin properties in the absence of connections between all the units in the primary network.
    
    Content addressable memory The property of an auto-associator network that enables recall of a particular representation through activation of all its corresponding features simply by engaging one or more of those features.
    
    Fan array Fan-like white matter connections linking association cortices to the perisylvian regions. They provide the basis for the input and output lexicons.
    
    Featural plausibility The extent to which a verb can add features to a noun concept representation. For example, in the sentence "The crash frightened the children," "frightened" can readily add features to the concept representation of "children" but not to that of "crash."
    
    Graceful degradation An intrinsic property of networks employing population encoding. In the face of damage or noise, the probability of error is increased but the predominant patterns of knowledge represented in network connectivity are relatively preserved, leading to near miss errors and not to bizarre responses uncharacteristic of the knowledge acquired by the network in the first place. Graceful degradation stems from the fact that knowledge is distributed in connectivity throughout the network.
  - |-
    Hebbian learning The concept, originally proposed by Donald Hebb (1949) and now supported by innumerable studies, that when two interconnected neurons are simultaneously active, the strength of the connection between them will increase. However, it is now clear that other conditions must also be met for this to happen, for example, a burst in local acetylcholine levels (see Gonzalez Rothi et al. 2009 for review).
    
    Hidden units Units in intermediate layers of pattern associator networks that are essential to the computational power of the networks but whose activity cannot be directly interpreted in behavioral terms.
    
    Pattern associator network A PDP network linking two domains that serves to translate representations in one domain into representations in the other domain. Most often, pattern associator networks incorporate one or more intermediate layers of hidden units.
    
    Quasi-regular domain Implicit knowledge of various competing regularities captured by a neural network in a particular domain through experience.
    
    Selective engagement The bringing online of selected representations in selected neural networks, either by eliciting alterations in the pattern of neural activity, alterations in the likelihood of neural firing, or selection of inputs that will produce neural firing (Desimone and Duncan 1995; Moran and Desimone 1985). Selective engagement constitutes the neural instantiation of working memory and working associations, among other things.
    
    Verb flavor Components of verb meaning incorporating manner and path attributes and likely to be instantiated in postcentral association cortices and the limbic system.
    
    Wild-card effect Because the fan arrays funnel into perisylvian cortex even as they carry perisylvian projections from both near and far association cortices, clinicopathologic correlation is lost with lesions (usually vascular) affecting these arrays. This yields the wild-card effect and is confined to syntactic and semantic-morphologic/phonologic (lexical) access.
    
    Working association The automatic or volitional maintenance of sustained patterns of activity corresponding to _ distributed representations in two or more networks. For concrete noun representations, engagement of a single network, for example, in visual association cortex, can suffice. However, transitive verb and abstract noun representations require contextual associations of two or more networks—that is, a working association.
  - |-
    Working memory  
    A sustained pattern of activity in a particular network, maintained via selective engagement mechanisms, that serves to keep a particular distributed representation "online."
    
    Notes
    
    Chapter 1  
    
    1. The results of such studies need to be considered judiciously. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography are "hyperlocalizing" by virtue of the mathematics underlying image processing (e.g., cluster algorithms in fMRI, smoothing algorithms, and statistical parametric mapping). That is, the extent of cortex engaged by a particular activity is likely to be considerably underestimated, hence the small areas of enhanced signal commonly observed. This hyperlocalizing propensity may be aggravated by limitations in the sensitivity of these studies, such that only the most strongly engaged regions, or only the regions that represent the greatest degree of differential engagement between the task of interest and the baseline task or state, appear on the composite image. It is further aggravated in group studies because the cytoarchitectonic geography of association cortices varies substantially from person to person (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic 1995), with the result that what is actually seen on a composite image is likely to represent the overlap region of a Venn diagram. The region of overlap is likely to vary from one group of subjects to another, hence the difficulties in replication. Second, these studies often reveal regions of engagement that have nothing to do with the task at hand. Only disciplined hypothesis testing can succeed in distinguishing what is real from what is artifact and what is essential to the process of interest from what is incidental. Finally, it is often difficult to ensure that subjects are participating in tasks in the ways intended and that a given task is tapping the targeted functions.

    That is defined as a nonlinear mathematical function of its combined inputs at any one time (in
    many models a sigmoid curve that asymptotically approaches a minimum value of 0 or a
    maximum value of 1). It has an output that is a nonlinear mathematical function of its level of
    activation, often incorporating a threshold such that for activation levels below that threshold,
    there is no output. Each unit is connected to a very large number of other units. The patterns of
    connectivity within a network define its functional capacity. The precise neural counterpart of a
    unit is uncertain and may vary with brain region. Thus, it is not implausible that single neurons
    function as units in the superior colliculus, whereas in the cortex, it is possible that a cortical
    microcolumn comes closer to meeting our definition of a unit. The neurophysiology of cortical
    
    neural network function is currently understood at only the most rudimentary level.
    
    2. This is a highly effective but entirely heuristic means of training PDP networks. Real neural
    networks learn by completely different mechanisms, currently not well understood, though they
    
    likely incorporate Hebbian principles.
    
    3. The only local representations are at the input and output terminuses of the nervous system
    (e.g., rods and cones in the retina, Pacinian corpuscles and Merkel's discs in the somatosensory
    system, and hair cells in the cochlea on the afferent terminus and muscle fibers at the efferent
    
    terminus).

    2. By selective engagement, I mean the bringing online of selected representations in selected
    neural networks, either by eliciting alterations in the pattern of neural activity, alterations in the
    likelihood of neural firing, or selection of inputs that will produce neural firing (Desimone and
    Duncan 1995; Moran and Desimone 1985). Selective engagement is a general term that
    embraces the many processes by which the brain allocates resources and it supports processes
    commonly referred to as working memory—the specific type of selective engagement I refer to
    here—as well as attention (see Nadeau and Crosson 1997 for an extended discussion). Often the
    terms "activation" and "attention" are used, somewhat misleadingly, as synonyms for selective
    engagement.
    
    3. This concept can be credited to Wernicke (cited in Eggert 1977). However, the evidence that
    these fan arrays exist is currently circumstantial and based on the extensive body of work
    demonstrating that semantic knowledge is widely distributed but must be linked to perisylvian
    cortex to enable language function. Diffusion tensor imaging studies have not yet been directed
    at this vital piece of language anatomy. Presumably, as for cerebral connection patterns in
    general, the arrays are composed of both afferent and efferent connections.
    4. This is, in fact, the solution offered by all grammars to this particular sequencing problem.
    5. The examples presented here were provided by Benedet, Christiansen, and Goodglass (1998),
    who succinctly provide a particularly good characterization and illustration of the competition
    model.
    6. In more recent versions of the competition model, cue costs are viewed more broadly (Bates,
    Devescovi, and Wulfeck 2001). However, this broader view does not alter the major points to be
    made here and, therefore, will be omitted for the sake of economy.
    7. Bates and MacWhinney (1989) cite the following example of completely imperceptible
    subject—verb agreement marking in French:
    Elle mange. [She eats]
    Elles mangent. [They + FEM, eat + PLURAL]
    
    These two sentences are pronounced identically—as is usually the case
    with singular and plural forms of the verb in French.

    1. Subjects with Broca's aphasia exhibit the same tendency in experiments testing the hierarchy of perceived relationships of words to each other (as determined by hierarchical cluster analysis of subject judgments; Zurif, Caramazza, and Myerson 1972). They tend to ignore adjectives in a manner no different than that observed with articles, possessive pronouns, and demonstratives (Kolk 1978). This too suggests an inability to incorporate an adjective as a feature of a modified concept representation and rules out an explanation specific to spoken language production.
    2. In contrast, Kim and Thompson (2004) found that complexity of verb argument structure had no influence on verb naming or production of correct argument structure in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, who have predominantly posterior lesions.
    3. This conceptualization helps to address the concern of Chen and Bates (1998) over the apparently extreme lack of parsimony of lexical explanations for noun—verb dissociations. Right-hemisphere mechanisms likely also play a role in these phenomena, but given the state of the science, one can only speculate.
    4. These symmetries pose some difficulty even for normal subjects, who exhibit slightly but significantly greater error rates and significantly prolonged response latencies in comprehension tasks (Berndt et al. 2004).
    5. This wild-card effect may also account for the enormous variability in relative ability to name objects and actions in both subjects with agrammatic aphasia and subjects with anomic aphasia (Bastiaanse and Jonkers 1998). To the wild-card effect of ischemic white matter damage might be added the wild-card effect of cortical damage that is unapparent on conventional imaging studies (Nadeau and Crosson 1997). The most sensitive means for detecting cortical damage are PET (HO) and SPECT studies (e.g., HMPAO) of cerebral blood flow and PET (F-fluorodeoxyglucose) studies of regional cerebral metabolism. Diffusion tensor imaging offers a great opportunity for more precisely delineating white matter damage. Unfortunately, lesion mapping studies continue to employ the least sensitive MRI sequences (T1) or x-ray computed tomography.

    7. Aphasia classification was on the basis of Western Aphasia Battery performance. The lesion
    analysis did not address the presence or absence of dominant perisylvian cortical involvement.
    We can assume, however, given the gradient of hemispheric blood flow with MCA occlusion,
    
    that even in subjects with anomic aphasia, there was some perisylvian damage.
    
    &. These results were not replicated in a subsequent study of subjects with Parkinson's disease
    and subjects with substantially subcortical MCA distribution vascular lesions (Longworth et al.
    
    2005).
    
    %. The steadfast adherence by connectionists in this debate to a single-pathway model may reflect
    
    the continued overwhelming influence of Occam's razor. However, the evidence from study of
    living systems, in which the order is chaotic, whether the evolution of species (Dawkins 2004) or
    the neural organization of the brain, is that Nature is perfectly happy to experiment with another
    solution, however duplicative or Rube Goldberg it might be, and however much duct tape and
    bailing wire are needed. The final arbiter is survival value of the genetic underpinnings (Dawkins
    1976). The brain, in its neural network organization and enormous complement of white matter,
    has pathways and pattern associators in enormous abundance, so there is no particular reason to
    
    reject a posited pathway because it is partially redundant.
    
    1G. In some languages there are also interactions between tense and agreement (Wenzlaff and
    
    Clahsen 2004).
    
    11. In a subsequent study, Bastiaanse, Bouma, and Post (2009) tested the hypothesis that these
    error patterns in subjects with aphasia reflected frequency effects. This hypothesis was not
    supported. Unfortunately, they did not assess to what extent the errors made reflected reversion
    to the most consistent sequence within a quasi-regular sequence domain—that is, the one with
    the greatest cue reliability. Some of their data (e.g., on the sequential order of adverbial phrase
    
    and verb object) seem to support a consistency account.
    
    12. It should be noted that, according to linguistic theory, the clauses of "want" constructions are
    considered to be "coordinated," with the consequence that the second clause is considered to be
    grammatically equivalent to a matrix clause, whereas in "omdat" constructions, the second

    13. There is evidence that problems exhibited in comprehension of passives extend to all forms
    in which the order of nouns does not follow the order of the action—instrumentals ("Tap the
    crayon with the pencil" vs. "With the pencil tap the crayon") and datives ("John threw Mary a
    ball" vs. "John threw a ball to Mary"; O'Grady and Lee 2005).

    2. This fact should serve to discourage behaviorally literal interpretations of patterns of activity
    
    in functional imaging studies. Analysis of patterns of activity in hidden-unit layers observed in
    connectionist simulations can be highly informative. However, these patterns are informative of
    the regularities in the knowledge incorporated, and considerable sophistication is required of the
    
    analytic approaches that are used.
