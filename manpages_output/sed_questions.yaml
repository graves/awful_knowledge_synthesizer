Multiple\n     commands may be specified by using the -e or -f options.  All commands\n     are applied to the input in the order they are specified regardless of\n     their origin.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -E      Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular\n\t     expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).  The\n\t     re_format(7) manual page fully describes both formats.\n\n     -a      The files listed as parameters for the “w” functions are created\n\t     (or truncated) before any processing begins, by default.  The -a\n\t     option causes sed to delay opening each file until a command\n\t     containing the related “w” function is applied to a line of\n\t     input."

For example, the context address \\xabcx is equivalent\n\t  to /abc/.  Also, putting a backslash character before the delimiting\n\t  character within the regular expression causes the character to be\n\t  treated literally.  For example, in the context address \\xabc\\xdefx,\n\t  the RE delimiter is an “x” and the second “x” stands for itself, so\n\t  that the regular expression is “abcxdef”."
