Each filesystem is described on a separate\n     line; fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces.  The order of\n     records in fstab is important because diskarbitrationd(8), fsck(8),\n     mount(8), and umount(8) sequentially iterate through fstab doing their\n     thing.\n\n     The first field, (fs_spec), describes the block special device, the local\n     filesystem, or the remote filesystem to be mounted.  The diskarbitrationd\n     program supports the identification of a local filesystem uniquely by its\n     UUID or by its volume name, irrespective of hardware configuration and of\n     hardware parallelism, using the constructs ``UUID'' and ``LABEL''.  For\n     APFS volumes, this field should never be the block special device as it\n     is not constant. Only the constructs ``UUID'' and ``LABEL'' should be\n     used."

For swap partitions, this field should be specified as\n     ``none''.\n\n     The third field, (fs_vfstype), describes the type of the filesystem.  The\n     system currently supports different filesystem types, including the\n     following:\n\n\t   apfs    APFS is the Mac OS X default filesystem since version 10.13\n\t\t   (High Sierra).\n\n\t   hfs\t   HFS+ is the previous Mac OS X default filesystem.\n\n\t   nfs\t   a Sun Microsystems compatible ``Network File System''\n\n\t   msdos   a DOS compatible filesystem\n\n\t   cd9660  a CD-ROM filesystem (as per ISO 9660)\n\n\t   fdesc   an implementation of /dev/fd\n\n\t   union   a translucent filesystem\n\n     The fourth field, (fs_mntops), describes the mount options associated\n     with the filesystem.  It is formatted as a comma separated list of\n     options.  It contains at least the type of mount (see fs_type below) plus\n     any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type."

If fs_type is ``rw'' or ``ro'' then the filesystem whose name is\n     given in the fs_file field is normally mounted read-write or read-only on\n     the specified special file.  If fs_type is ``sw'' then the special file\n     is made available as a piece of swap space by the swapon(8) command at\n     the end of the system reboot procedure.  The fields other than fs_spec\n     and fs_type are unused.  If fs_type is specified as ``xx'' the entry is\n     ignored.  This is useful to show disk partitions which are currently\n     unused.\n\n     The fifth field, (fs_freq), is used for these filesystems by the dump(8)\n     command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.\tIf the fifth\n     field is not present, a value of zero is returned and dump will assume\n     that the filesystem does not need to be dumped."
