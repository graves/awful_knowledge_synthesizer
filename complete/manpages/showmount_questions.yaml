By\n     default it prints the names of all hosts that have NFS file systems\n     mounted on the host. See NFS: Network File System Protocol Specification,\n     RFC 1094, Appendix A, and NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol\n     Specification, Appendix I, for a detailed description of the protocol.\n\n     -A      Search for NFS servers advertised via Bonjour.\n\n     -a      List all mount points in the form: host:dirpath\n\n     -d      List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts.\n\n     -e      Show the host's exports list.\n\n     -3      Use mount protocol Version 3, compatible with NFS Version 3.\n\n     -6      Use only IPv6 addresses to contact servers.\n\n     -p      Ping NFS server on the host based on provided version (2,3 or 4)\n\t     using the NULL procedure."
