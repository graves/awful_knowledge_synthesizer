It listens on UDP port 464\n     (service kpasswd) and processes requests when they arrive. It changes the\n     database directly and should thus only run on the master KDC.\n\n     Supported options:\n\n     --addresses=address\n\t     For each till the argument is given, add the address to what\n\t     kpasswdd should listen too.\n\n     --check-library=library\n\t     If your system has support for dynamic loading of shared\n\t     libraries, you can use an external function to check password\n\t     quality. This option specifies which library to load.\n\n     --check-function=function\n\t     This is the function to call in the loaded library. The function\n\t     should look like this:"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the kpasswdd tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you configure kpasswdd to listen on a specific UDP port for password change requests?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how to use kpasswdd with a custom password quality check library and function?
