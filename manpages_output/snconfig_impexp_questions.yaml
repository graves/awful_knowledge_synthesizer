Current values can be\n       returned in JSON format via stdout.  A JSON object can be passed to\n       stdin to cause the tool to update the configuration.  All this is done\n       as directed by the actions described below.\n\n       In almost all cases, a JSON object is written to stdout.  It will have\n       keys describing the success or failure of the requested action.\tThe\n       return_code key is zero if the action succeeded or one if the action\n       failed.\tIf the action failed, an error key will be present describing\n       the problem.  On a non-fatal error, a warnings key will be present.\n       These keys will be ignored in a JSON object passed to snconfig_impexp."

All top-level keys (other than the\n\t      snconfig_impexp_version key), are optional.  If a top-level key\n\t      is present, the key's values are written to the appropriate\n\t      configuration files, replacing anything that was there.  If a\n\t      top-level key is not present, then no changes are made to the\n\t      configuration represent by the key.  After all configuration\n\t      changes are made, the current state is returned exactly as if -R\n\t      was specified."
