Any buffer reachable from a\n     pointer in a reachable malloc-allocated buffer is also assumed to be in\n     use.  The buffers which are not reachable are leaks; the buffers could\n     never be freed because no pointer exists in memory to the buffer, and\n     thus free() could never be called for these buffers.  Such buffers waste\n     memory; removing them can reduce swapping and memory usage.  Leaks are\n     particularly dangerous for long-running programs, for eventually the\n     leaks could fill memory and cause the application to crash."

    Manpage text:

    leaks requires one argument -- either the process ID or the full or
         partial executable name of the process to examine, or the pathname of a
         memory graph file generated by leaks or the Xcode Memory Graph Debugger.
         (Unless the -atExit -- command argument is given, see below for more
         details.)

         Once the leaked buffers have been identified, leaks analyzes them to find
         "root leaks" (those which are not referenced by any other buffer) and
         "root cycles" (cycles of objects which reference or retain each other,
         but which are not referenced by any other buffer outside the cycle).
         Then, it identifies the tree of buffers which are referenced by those
         root leaks and root cycles, if any.  leaks then prints each such "leak
         tree".

         If the MallocStackLogging environment variable was set when the
         application was launched, leaks also prints a stack trace describing
         where the buffer was allocated.

    MEMORY GRAPH FILES
         A memory graph file archives the memory state of a process for further
         analysis at a later time, on a different machine, or by other people.  It
         includes information about all VM and malloc nodes in the process, and
         the references between them.  Memory graph files can be generated by
         leaks using the -outputGraph option (and the -fullContent option if
         desired), or by examining a live process with the Xcode Memory Graph
         Debugger then using the Export Memory Graph menu item from the File menu.
         The standard filename suffix for memory graph files is ".memgraph".
         These files can be used as input to various commands including leaks,
         heap, stringdups, vmmap, malloc_history, footprint, and the Xcode Memory
         Graph Debugger.
