For all blocks which have the same content, it shows a line\n     with the number of such blocks, their total allocated size (the total\n     size in the malloc heap, not just the specific size of their content),\n     and the average allocated size.\n\n     stringdups requires one argument -- either the process ID or the full or\n     partial executable name of the process to examine, or the pathname of a\n     memory graph file generated by leaks. When generating a memory graph with\n     leaks for use with stringdups it is necessary to use the -fullContent\n     argument to include labels describing the contents of memory."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the stringdups tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use stringdups to find duplicate strings in a process with the process ID 1234?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using stringdus to analyze a memory graph file generated by leaks, focusing only on strings and ignoring stack traces?
