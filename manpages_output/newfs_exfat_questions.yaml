If a volume\n     name was specified via the -v option, that name is used instead of the\n     volume's previous name.\n\n     The options are as follow:\n\n     -N      Don't create a file system: just print out parameters.\n\n     -R      Do not check whether the device is currently formatted as ExFAT.\n\t     Always derive the partition offset, bytes per cluster, FAT offset\n\t     and size, and offset to start of clusters based on the device\n\t     type and size."
