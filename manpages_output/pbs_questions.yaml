It scans for and vends available\n     Services, to populate the Services menu.\n\n     pbs is NOT related to the pasteboard.  The pasteboard is managed by the\n     pboard agent.\n\n     pbs normally runs the first time Services are needed in any login\n     session.  You may run it manually for debugging Services. If run without\n     any options, pbs will scan for changed Services, cache them along with\n     their English localization, and immediately update the Services menu in\n     all running apps. It will also log about any invalid Services\n     declarations in Info.plist. This is useful when developing or testing\n     Services, because it immediately applies any changes.\n\n     ServicesMenu.strings files for a localization are loaded only when an app\n     running under that localization shows the Services menu.  You may pass\n     pbs language codes (e.g. \"fr\") to cause it to load that localization\n     immediately."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pbs`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\npbs has additional options that are useful for debugging, in particular\n     the -dump and -read_bundle options. The complete list of options is:\n\n     -debug\n\t Output debugging information regarding what pbs is doing.\n\n     -dump\n\t Prints the userdef cache of Services information.  pbs caches\n\t Services information in its userdefs to avoid scanning the entire\n\t system every boot.  Changed apps are still detected via FSEvents, so\n\t there is no need to flush the userdef cache when installing a new\n\t Service.\n\n     -read_bundle PATH\n\t Prints the Services information for the given application or service\n\t bundle. Does not update the cache.\n\n     -flush\n\t Erases the userdef cache, entirely resetting pbs. The next time\n\t Services information is needed, pbs will do a complete rescan for\n\t apps vending Services, and read their plist.  Note: this rescan may\n\t be very expensive!\n\n     -update\n\t Updates the userdef cache. pbs will do a complete rescan for apps\n\t vending Services, and read their plist."
