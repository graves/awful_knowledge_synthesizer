         If a continuation line subtracts N seconds from the UT offset after a
         transition that would be interpreted to be later if using the
         continuation line's UT offset and rules, the “until” time of the previous
         zone or continuation line is interpreted according to the continuation
         line's UT offset and rules, and any rule that would otherwise take effect
         in the next N seconds is instead assumed to take effect simultaneously.
         For example:
