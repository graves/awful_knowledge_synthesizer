This is supported on linux MDCs and is required when\n       using the Storage Manager web-based GUI. If the GUI is not used or not\n       available, the sncfgedit(8) utility should be used to create or change\n       the XML configuration file.\n\n       The old non-XML format (see snfs.cfg.5) used in previous versions of\n       Xsan is required on Windows MDCs and is valid on linux MDCs, but the\n       Storage Manager GUI will not recognize it.\n\n       Linux MDCs will automatically have their volume configuration files\n       converted to the XML format on upgrade, if necessary.  Old config files\n       will be retained in the\n       /Library/Logs/Xsan/data/<volume_name>/config_history directory.\n\n       When a volume system is created, the configuration file is stored in a\n       compressed format in the metadata.  Some Xsan components validate that\n       if the configuration file has changed, it is still valid for the\n       operation of that component.  The components that do this are: fsm(8),\n       cvupdatefs(1), and cvfsck(1).  If the configuration is invalid, the\n       component terminates.  If the configuration has changed and is valid,\n       the old configuration is saved in\n       /Library/Logs/Xsan/data/<volume_name>/config_history/*.cfg.<TIMESTAMP>\n       and the new one replaces the old one in metadata.\n\n       This manpage seeks to describe the configuration file in general.\n       Format specific information can be found in snfs.cfgx.5 and snfs.cfg.5.\n\nGLOBAL VARIABLES\n       The file system configuration has several global variables that affect\n       the size, function and performance of the Xsan File System Manager\n       (FSM).  (The FSM is the controlling program that tracks file allocation\n       and consistency across the multiple clients that have access to the\n       volume via a Storage Area Network.) The following global variables can\n       be modified.\n\n     • XML: affinityPreference <true/false>\n\n       Old: AffinityPreference <Yes|No>\n\n       The AffinityPreference variable instructs the FSM how to allocate space\n       to a file with an Affinity in low space conditions.  If space cannot be\n       allocated on a storage pool with a matching Affinity, the system\n       normally fails with ENOSPC.  This occurs even if the file system has\n       remaining space that could satisfy the allocation request.  If this\n       variable is set to true (Yes), instead of returning ENOSPC, the system\n       attempts to allocate space on another storage pool with an Affinity of\n       0.\n\n       With this preference mechanism, the file's Affinity is not changed so a\n       subsequent allocation request will still try to use the original\n       Affinity before retrying with an Affinity of 0.\n\n       The default value of false (No) retains the behavior of returning\n       ENOSPC instead of retrying the allocation request.\n\n     • XML: allocationStrategy <strategy>\n\n       Old: AllocationStrategy <strategy>\n\n       The AllocationStrategy variable selects a method for allocating new\n       disk file blocks in the volume.\tThere are three methods supported:\n       Round, Balance, and Fill.  These methods specify how, for each file,\n       the allocator chooses an initial storage pool to allocate blocks from,\n       and how the allocator chooses a new storage pool when it cannot honor\n       an allocation request from a file's current storage pool.\n\n       The default allocation strategy is Round.  Round means that when there\n       are multiple storage pools of similar classes (for example two storage\n       pools for non-exclusive data), the space allocator should alternate\n       (round robin) new files through the available storage pools.\n       Subsequent allocation requests for any one file are directed to the\n       same storage pool.  If insufficient space is available in that storage\n       pool, the allocator will choose the next storage pool that can honor\n       the allocation request.\n\n       When the strategy is Balance, the available blocks of each storage pool\n       are analyzed, and the storage pool with the most total free blocks is\n       chosen.\tSubsequent requests for the same file are directed to the same\n       storage pool.  If insufficient space is available in that storage pool,\n       the allocator will choose the storage pool with the most available\n       space.\n\n       When the strategy is Fill, the allocator will initially choose the\n       storage pool that has the least amount of total free space.  After that\n       it will allocate from the same storage pool until the storage pool\n       cannot honor a request.\tThe allocator then reselects a storage pool\n       using the original criteria.\n\n       To use a strategy other than Round, the Allocation Session Reservation\n       feature must be disabled.\n\n     • XML: fileLockResyncTimeOut <value>\n\n       Old: BRLResyncTimeout <value>\n\n       NOTE: Not intended for general use.  Only use when recommended by Apple\n       Support.\n\n     • XML: allocSessionReservationSize <value>\n\n       Old: AllocSessionReservationSize <value>\n\n       The Allocation Session Reservation (ASR) feature allows a file system\n       to benefit from optimized allocation behavior for certain rich media\n       streaming applications and most other workloads.  The feature also\n       focuses on reducing free space fragmentation.\n\n       By default, this feature is enabled with a 1GB, 1073741824, size.\n\n       An old, deprecated parameter, AllocSessionReservation, when set to yes\n       would use a 1 GB segment size with no rounding.\tThis old parameter is\n       now ignored but can generate some warnings.\n\n       allocSessionReservationSize allows you to specify the size this feature\n       should use when allocating segments for a session.  The value is\n       expressed in bytes so a value of 2147483648 is 2 GBs.  The value must\n       be a multiple of MBs.  The XML file format must be in bytes.  The old\n       configuration file format can use multipliers such as m for MBs or g\n       for GBs.  If the multiplier is omitted in the old configuration file,\n       the value is interpreted as bytes as in the XML format.\n\n       A value of 0 turns off this capability and falls back on the base\n       allocator.  When enabled, the value can range from 128 MB (134217728)\n       to 1 TB (1099511627776).  (The largest value would indicate segments\n       are 1 TB in size, which is extremely large.)  The feature starts with\n       the specified size and then may use rounding to better handle user's\n       requests.  See also InodeStripeWidth.\n\n       There are 3 session types: small, medium, and large.  The type is\n       determined by the file offset and requested allocation size.  Small\n       sessions are for sizes (offset+allocation size) smaller than 1MB.\n       Medium sessions are for sizes 1MB through 1/10th of the\n       allocSessionReservationSize.  Large sessions are sizes bigger than\n       medium.\n\n       Here is another way to think of these three types: small sessions\n       collect or organize all small files into small session chunks; medium\n       sessions collect medium sized files by chunks using their parent\n       directory; and large files collect their own chunks and are allocated\n       independently of other files.\n\n       All sessions are client specific.  Multiple writers to the same\n       directory or large file on different clients will use different\n       sessions.  Small files from different clients use different chunks by\n       client.\n\n       Small sessions use a smaller chunk size than the configured\n       allocSessionReservationSize.  The small chunk size is determined by\n       dividing the configured size by 32.  For 128 MB, the small chunk size\n       is 4 MB.  For 1 GB, the small chunk size is 32 MBs.\n\n       Files can start using one session type and then move to another session\n       type.  If a file starts in a medium session and then becomes large, it\n       \"reserves\" the remainder of the session chunk it was using for itself.\n       After a session is reserved for a file, a new session segment will be\n       allocated for any other medium files in that directory.\n\n       When allocating subsequent pieces for a session, they are rotated\n       around to other stripe groups that can hold user data unless\n       InodeStripeWidth is set to 0.  When InodeStripeWidth is set, session\n       chunks are rotated in a similar fashion to InodeStripeWidth.  The\n       direction of rotation is determined by a combination of the session key\n       and the index of the client in the client table.  The session key is\n       based on the inode number so odd inodes will rotate in a different\n       direction from even inodes.  Directory session keys are based on the\n       inode number of the parent directory.\n\n       If this capability is enabled, StripeAlignSize is forced to 0.  In\n       fact, all stripe alignment requests are disabled because they can cause\n       clipping and can lead to severe free-space fragmentation.\n\n       The old AllocSessionReservation parameter is deprecated and replaced by\n       allocSessionReservationSize.\n\n       If any of the following \"special\" allocation functions are detected,\n       allocSessionReservationSize is turned off for that allocation:\n       PerfectFit, MustFit, or Gapped files.\n\n       When this feature is enabled, AllocationStrategy must be set to Round.\n       As of StorNext 6, this is enforced when creating and modifying file\n       systems. If a file system was created using a prior version of StorNext\n       and ASR was enabled but AllocationStrategy was not set to Round, the\n       FSM will run. However, the AllocationStrategy will be treated as Round\n       and a warning will be issued whenever the configuration file is parsed.\n\n     • XML: bufferCacheSize <value>\n\n       Old: BufferCacheSize <value>\n\n       This variable defines how much memory to use in the FSM program for\n       general metadata information caching.  The amount of memory consumed is\n       up to 2 times the value specified but typically less.\n\n       Increasing this value can improve performance of many metadata\n       operations by performing a memory cache access to directory blocks,\n       inode info and other metadata info.  This is about 10 - 1000 times\n       faster than performing I/O.\n\n       There are two buffer caches: the L1 cache and the L2 cache.  If\n       bufferCacheSize is configured as 1G or smaller, only the L1 cache is\n       used.  If bufferCacheSize is configured greater than 1G, the first 512M\n       is used by the L1 cache and the remainder is used by the L2 cache.\n       Blocks may reside in both caches.  Blocks in the L2 cache are\n       compressed by about a factor of 2.4, allowing for better memory\n       utilization.  For example, if bufferCacheSize is set to a value of 8G,\n       the FSM will actually be able to cache about 7.5 * 2.4 = 18 G of\n       metadata.  Depending on the amount of RAM in the MDC and the number of\n       allocated metadata blocks, in some cases it may be possible to keep all\n       used metadata in cache which can dramatically improve performance for\n       file system scanning.  Cvfsck also uses the buffer cache and specifying\n       a large enough value of bufferCacheSize to cover all metadata will\n       result in a large speed increase.  The cvadmin \"metadata\" command can\n       be used to determine the value of bufferCacheSize required to cache all\n       metadata.\n\n       Also see the useL2BufferCache configuration parameter.\n\n     • XML: caseInsensitive <true|false>\n\n       Old:"

    The caseInsensitive variable controls how the FSM reports case
           sensitivity to clients. Windows clients are always case insensitive,
           Mac clients default to case insensitive, but if the FSM is configured
           as case sensitive then they will operate in case sensitive mode.  Linux
           clients will follow the configuration variable, but can operate in case
           insensitive mode on a case sensitive filesystem by using the
           caseinsensitive mount option. Linux clients must be at the 5.4 release
           or beyond to enable this behavior.

           Note: You must stop the file system and run  cvupdatefs once the config
           file has been updated in order to enable or disable case insensitive.
           Clients must re-mount the file system to pick up the change.

           When enabling case insensitive, it is also strongly recommended that
           cvfsck -A be run to detect name case collisions. Cvupdatefs will not
           enable case insensitive when name case collisions are present in the
           file system.

           Old: GlobalSuperUser <Yes|No>

           The Global Super User variable allows the administrator to decide if
           any user with super-user privileges may use those privileges on the
           file system. When this variable is set to true, any super-user has
           global access rights on the volume. This may be equated to the
           maproot=0 directive in NFS. When the Global Super User variable is set
           to false, a super-user may only modify files where it has access rights
           as a normal user. This value may be modified for existing volumes.  If
           storageManager is enabled and this variable is set to false, the value
           will be overriden and set to true on storage manager nodes.  A storage
           manager node is the MDC or a Distributed Data Mover client.  Apple Xsan
           clients do not honor the setting of globalSuperUser.

This occurs when an activated FSM is not\n       properly maintaining its brand of an arbitration block (ARB) on the\n       metadata LUN.  Timers on the activated and standby FSMs coordinate the\n       usurpation of the ARB so that the activated server will relinquish\n       control or perform a hardware reset before the standby FSM can take\n       over.  It is very important to configure all file systems correctly and\n       consistently between the two servers in the HA cluster.\n\n       There are currently three types of HA monitoring that are indicated by\n       the HaShared, HaManaged, and HaUnmanaged configuration parameters.\n\n       The HaShared dedicated file system holds shared data for the operation\n       of the StorNext File System and Stornext Storage Manager (SNSM).

The running of SNSM processes and the starting of\n       managed file systems is triggered by activation of the HaShared file\n       system.\tIn addition to being monitored for ARB branding as described\n       above, the exit of the HaShared FSM triggers a hardware reset to ensure\n       that SNSM processes are stopped if the shared file system is not\n       unmounted."

    Manpage text:

    The HaManaged file systems are not started until the HaShared file
           system activates.  This keeps all the managed file systems collocated
           with the SNSM processes.  It also means that they cannot experience
           split-brain corruption because there is no redundant server to compete
           for control, so they are not monitored and cannot trigger a hardware
           reset.

           The HaUnmanaged file systems are monitored.  The minimum configuration
           necessary for an HA cluster is to: 1) place this type in all the FSMs,
           and 2) enter the peer server's IP address in the ha_peer(4) file.
           Unmanaged FSMs can activate on either server and fail over to the peer
           server without a hardware reset under normal operating conditions.

           On non-HA setups, the special HaUnmonitored type is used to indicate no
           HA monitoring is done on the file systems.  It is only to be used on
           non-HA setups. Note that setting HaFsType to HaUnmonitored disables the
           HA monitor timers used to guarantee against split brain.  When two MDCs
           are configured to run as an HA pair but full HA protection is disabled
           in this way, it is possible in rare situations for file system metadata
           to become corrupt if there are lengthy delays or excessive loads in the
           LAN and SAN networks that prevent an active FSM from maintaining its
           branding of the ARB in a timely manner.

           Old: InodeStripeWidth <value>

           The Inode Stripe Width variable defines how a file is striped across
           the volume's data storage pools.  The default value is 4 GBs
           (4294967296).  After the initial placement policy has selected a
           storage pool for the first extent of the file, for each Inode Stripe
           Width extent the allocation is changed to prefer the next storage pool
           allowed to contain file data.  Next refers to the next numerical stripe
           group number going up or down.  (The direction is determined using the
           inode number: odd inode numbers go up or increment, and even inode
           numbers go down or decrement).  The rotation is modulo the number of
           stripe groups that can hold data.

           When Inode Stripe Width is not specified, file data allocations will
           typically attempt to use the same storage pool as the initial
           allocation to the file.

           When used with an Allocation Strategy setting of Round, files will be

    Manpage text:

    A problem with DMA I/O is that small or unaligned I/Os need to do a
           read-modify-write.  So, two racing clients can undo each other's writes
           since they could have data in memory.  This occurs when a client has
           read into a buffer, modifies part of the buffer, and then write it
           using DMA (after the other client's write that occurred before this
           client read into the buffer being written).  Different platforms have
           requirements on the granularity of DMA I/O, usually at least 512 bytes
           that must be written and also using a 512 or greater boundary for the
           start and end of the I/O.

           If one sets ioTokens to true (the default setting), each I/O performed
           by a client must have a token.  Clients cache and can do many I/Os
           while they have the token.  When the token is revoked, all data and
           associated attributes are flushed.

           Customers, who have multiple writers on a file, should set ioTokens to
           true, unless they know that the granularity and length of I/Os are safe
           for DMA.  File locking does NOT prevent read-modify-write across lock
           boundaries.

    Manpage text:

    The default for I/O Tokens is true.

           For backward compatibility, if a client opens a file from a prior
           release that does not support ioTokens, the coherency model drops back
           to the "Shared Write" model using DMA I/O (ioTokens false) but on a
           file-by-file basis.

           If ioTokens is changed and the MDC is restarted, files that were open
           at that time continue to operate in the model before the change.  To
           switch these files to the new value of ioTokens, all applications  must
           close the file and wait for a few seconds and then re-open it.  Or, if
           the value was switched from true to false, a new client can open the

    Manpage text:

    When reservedSpace is true, the FSM reserves enough disk space so that
           clients are able to safely perform these delayed allocations.  The
           meta-data server reserves a minimum of 4GB per stripe group and up to
           280 megabytes per client per stripe group.

           Setting reservedSpace to false allows slightly more disk space to be
           used, but adversely affects buffer cache performance and may result in
           serious fragmentation.

           XML: metadataArchive <true|false>

           The metadataArchive statement is used to enable or disable the Metadata
           Archive created by the FSM. The Metadata Archive contains a copy of all
           file system metadata including past history of metadata changes if
           metadataArchiveDays is set to a value greater than zero.  The Metadata
           Archive is used for disaster recovery, file system event notification,
           and file system auditing among other features.

           XML: metadataArchiveDir <path>

           The metadataArchiveDir statement is used to change the path in which
           the Metadata Archive is created. The default path is

           it will be assigned the Affinity or 0.  This is only done for regular
           files and not other types of files such as directories, devices,
           symbolic links, etc.  An extension can only exist once for all
           autoAffinity and noAffinity mappings.

           Extensions in a file name are defined by all the characters following
           the last "." in the file name.  The extension tag in the configuration
           file is followed by the characters in the extension without the ".".
           There is one special extension that is defined by not specifying an
           extension.  This is the "empty" extension and tells file creation to
           map all files not matching another extension to the autoAffinity or
           noAffinity mapping it is in.

    DISKTYPE DEFINITION
           A diskType defines the number of sectors for a category of disk
           devices, and optionally the number of bytes per disk device sector.
           Since multiple disks used in a file system may have the same type of
           disk, it is easier to consolidate that information into a disk type
           definition rather than including it for each disk definition.

           For example, a 9.2GB Seagate Barracuda Fibre Channel ST19171FC disk has
           1778311 total sectors. However, using most drivers, a portion of the
           disk device is used for the volume header. For example, when using a
           Prisa adapter and driver, the maximum number of sectors available to
           the volume is 11781064.

           When specified, the sector size must be 512 or 4096 bytes.  The default
           sector size is 512 bytes.

    DISK DEFINITION
           Note: The XML format defines disks in the stripeGroup section. The old
           format defines disks in a separate section and then links to that
           definition with the node variable in the stripe group. The general
           description below applies to both.

    Manpage text:

    Each disk definition has a type which must match one of the names from
           a previously defined diskType.

           NOTE: In much older releases there was also a DeviceName option in the
           Disk section.  The DeviceName was previously used to specify a
           operating system specific disk name, but this has been superseded by
           automatic volume recognition for some time and is no longer supported.
           This is now for internal use only.

    STRIPEGROUP DEFINITION
           The stripeGroup defines individual storage pools.  A storage pool is a
           collection of disk devices. A disk device may only be in one storage
           pool.

           The stripeGroup has a name name that is used in subsequent system
           administration functions for the storage pool.

           A storage pool can be set to have it's status up or down.  If down, the
           storage pool is not used by the file system, and anything on that
           storage pool is inaccessible.  This should normally be left up.

           A storage pool can contain a combination of metadata, journal, or
           userdata.  There can only be one storage pool that contains a journal
           per file system.  Best performance is attained with a minimum of 2
           stripe groups per file system with one stripe group used exclusively
           for metadata/journal and the other for user data.  Metadata has an I/O
           pattern of small random I/O whereas user data is typically of much
           larger size.  Splitting apart metadata and journal so there are 3
           stripe groups is recommended particularly if latency for file creation,
           removal and allocation of space is important.

    Manpage text:

    When a collection of disk devices is assembled under a storage pool,
           each disk device is logically striped into chunks of disk blocks as
           defined by the stripeBreadth variable.  For example, with a 4k-byte
           block-size and a stripe breadth of 86 volume blocks, the first 352,256
           bytes would be written or read from/to the first disk device in the
           storage pool, the second 352,256 bytes would be on the second disk
           device and so on. When the last disk device used its 352,256 bytes, the
           stripe would start again at drive zero. This allows for more than a
           single disk device's bandwidth to be realized by applications.

           The allocator aligns an allocation that is greater than or equal to the
           largest stripeBreadth of any storage pool that can hold data. This is
           done if the allocation request is an extension of the file.

           A storage pool can be marked up or down.  When the storage pool is
           marked down, it is not available for data access. However, users may
           look at the directory and meta-data information. Attempts to open a
           file residing on a downed storage pool will receive a Permission Denied
           failure.

    Affinities can be used to target allocations at specific stripe groups,
           and the stripe group can exclusively contain affinity targeted
           allocations or have affinity targeted allocations co-existing with
           other allocations.  See snfs.cfg(5) and snfs.cfgx(5) for more details.

           Each stripe group can define a multipath method, which controls the
           algorithm used to allocate disk I/Os on paths to the storage when the
           volume has multiple paths available to it. See sgmanage(8) for details.

           Various realtime I/O parameters can be specified on a per stripe group
           basis as well.  These define the maximum number of I/O operations per
           second available to real-time applications for the stripe group using
           the Quality of Service (QoS) API.  There is also the ability to specify
           I/Os that should be reserved for applications not using the QoS API.
           Realtime I/O functionality is off by default.

           A stripe group contains one or more disks on which to put the
           metadata/journal/userdata.  The disk has an index that defines the
           ordinal position the disk has in the storage pool. This number must be
           in the range of zero to the number of disks in the storage pool minus
           one, and be unique within the storage pool. There must be one disk
           entry per disk and the number of disk entries defines the stripe depth.
