The default implementation of\n       unknown is a library procedure defined when Tcl initializes an\n       interpreter.  You can override the default unknown to change its\n       functionality, or you can register a new handler for individual\n       namespaces using the namespace unknown command.\tNote that there is no\n       default implementation of unknown in a safe interpreter.\n\n       If the Tcl interpreter encounters a command name for which there is not\n       a defined command (in either the current namespace, or the global\n       namespace), then Tcl checks for the existence of an unknown handler for\n       the current namespace. By default, this handler is a command named\n       ::unknown.  If there is no such command, then the interpreter returns\n       an error.  If the unknown command exists (or a new handler has been\n       registered for the current namespace), then it is invoked with\n       arguments consisting of the fully-substituted name and arguments for\n       the original non-existent command.  The unknown command typically does\n       things like searching through library directories for a command\n       procedure with the name cmdName, or expanding abbreviated command names\n       to full-length, or automatically executing unknown commands as sub-\n       processes.  In some cases (such as expanding abbreviations) unknown\n       will change the original command slightly and then (re-)execute it.\n       The result of the unknown command is used as the result for the\n       original non-existent command."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `unknown`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe default implementation of unknown behaves as follows.  It first\n       calls the auto_load library procedure to load the command.  If this\n       succeeds, then it executes the original command with its original\n       arguments.  If the auto-load fails then unknown calls auto_execok to\n       see if there is an executable file by the name cmd.  If so, it invokes\n       the Tcl exec command with cmd and all the args as arguments.  If cmd\n       cannot be auto-executed, unknown checks to see if the command was\n       invoked at top-level and outside of any script.\tIf so, then unknown\n       takes two additional steps.  First, it sees if cmd has one of the\n       following three forms: !!, !event, or ^old^new?^?.  If so, then unknown\n       carries out history substitution in the same way that csh would for\n       these constructs.  Finally, unknown checks to see if cmd is a unique\n       abbreviation for an existing Tcl command.  If so, it expands the\n       command name and executes the command with the original arguments.  If\n       none of the above efforts has been able to execute the command, unknown\n       generates an error return.  If the global variable auto_noload is\n       defined, then the auto-load step is skipped.  If the global variable\n       auto_noexec is defined then the auto-exec step is skipped.  Under\n       normal circumstances the return value from unknown is the return value\n       from the command that was eventually executed."
