    NAME
           perl5005delta - what's new for perl5.005

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.004 release and this
           one.

    About the new versioning system
           Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes
           small, safe updates to released production versions with emphasis on
           compatibility; and a development track that pursues more aggressive
           evolution.  Maintenance releases (which should be considered production
           quality) have subversion numbers that run from 1 to 49, and development
           releases (which should be considered "alpha" quality) run from 50 to
           99.

           Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track development
           scheme.

    Incompatible Changes
       WARNING:  This version is not binary compatible with Perl 5.004.
           Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching
           changes to the language internals.  If you have dynamically loaded
           extensions that you built under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue
           to use them with 5.004, but you will need to rebuild and reinstall
           those extensions to use them 5.005.  See INSTALL for detailed
           instructions on how to upgrade.

The effect of this should be largely transparent to\n       the user, but there are some boundary conditions under which user will\n       need to be aware of the issues.\tFor example, \"local(@_)\" results in a\n       \"Can't localize lexical variable @_ ...\" message.  This may be enabled\n       in a future version.\n\n       Some new keywords have been introduced.\tThese are generally expected\n       to have very little impact on compatibility.  See \"New \"INIT\" keyword\",\n       \"New \"lock\" keyword\", and \"New \"qr//\" operator\"."

    Relaxed new mandatory warnings introduced in 5.004
           Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been made
           optional.  Some of these warnings are still present, but perl's new
           features make them less often a problem.  See "New Diagnostics".

       Licensing
           Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors.  See Porting/Contract.

           The license included in much of the Perl documentation has changed.
           Most of the Perl documentation was previously under the implicit GNU
           General Public License or the Artistic License (at the user's choice).
           Now much of the documentation unambiguously states the terms under
           which it may be distributed.  Those terms are in general much less
           restrictive than the GNU GPL.  See perl and the individual perl
           manpages listed therein.

    Core Changes
       Threads
           WARNING: Threading is considered an experimental feature.  Details of
           the implementation may change without notice.  There are known
           limitations and some bugs.  These are expected to be fixed in future

       Reliable signals
           Perl's signal handling is susceptible to random crashes, because
           signals arrive asynchronously, and the Perl runtime is not reentrant at
           arbitrary times.

           However, one experimental implementation of reliable signals is
           available when threads are enabled.  See "Thread::Signal".  Also see
           INSTALL for how to build a Perl capable of threads.

       Reliable stack pointers
           The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable times.
           In particular, magic calls never trigger reallocations of the stack,
           because all reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a "stack of
           stacks".  This should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in
           the internals and in XSUBs.

       More generous treatment of carriage returns
           Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in
           scripts.  Now they are mostly treated like whitespace within program
           text.  Inside string literals and here documents, literal carriage
           returns are ignored if they occur paired with linefeeds, or get
           interpreted as whitespace if they stand alone.  This behavior means
           that literal carriage returns in files should be avoided.  You can get
           the older, more compatible (but less generous) behavior by defining the
           preprocessor symbol "PERL_STRICT_CR" when building perl.  Of course,
           all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes like "\r" are
           handled within strings.

    Manpage text:

    Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all text
           files in DOS format.  The generous treatment only applies to files that
           perl itself parses.  If your C compiler doesn't allow carriage returns
           in files, you may still be unable to build modules that need a C
           compiler.

       Memory leaks
           "substr", "pos" and "vec" don't leak memory anymore when used in lvalue
           context.  Many small leaks that impacted applications that embed
           multiple interpreters have been fixed.

       Better support for multiple interpreters
           The build-time option "-DMULTIPLICITY" has had many of the details
           reworked.  Some previously global variables that should have been per-
           interpreter now are.  With care, this allows interpreters to call each
           other.  See the "PerlInterp" extension on CPAN.

       Behavior of local() on array and hash elements is now well-defined
           See "Temporary Values via local()" in perlsub.

       "%!" is transparently tied to the Errno module

       "foreach (1..1000000)" optimized
           "foreach (1..1000000)" is now optimized into a counting loop.  It does
           not try to allocate a 1000000-size list anymore.

       "Foo::" can be used as implicitly quoted package name
           Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a subroutine with the same
           name as a package happened to be defined.  Thus, "new Foo @args", use
           the result of the call to "Foo()" instead of "Foo" being treated as a
           literal.  The recommended way to write barewords in the indirect object
           slot is "new Foo:: @args".  Note that the method "new()" is called with
           a first argument of "Foo", not "Foo::" when you do that.

       "exists $Foo::{Bar::}" tests existence of a package
           It was impossible to test for the existence of a package without
           actually creating it before.  Now "exists $Foo::{Bar::}" can be used to
           test if the "Foo::Bar" namespace has been created.

       New "INIT" keyword
           "INIT" subs are like "BEGIN" and "END", but they get run just before

       New "lock" keyword
           The "lock" keyword is the fundamental synchronization primitive in

           To minimize impact on source compatibility this keyword is "weak",

           like operators, is used to create precompiled regular expressions.
           This compiled form can now be explicitly passed around in variables,
           and interpolated in other regular expressions.  See perlop.

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl5005delta`.



    Manpage text:

    "our" is now a reserved word
           Calling a subroutine with the name "our" will now provoke a warning
           when using the "-w" switch.

       Tied arrays are now fully supported
           See Tie::Array.

       Tied handles support is better
           Several missing hooks have been added.  There is also a new base class
           for TIEARRAY implementations.  See Tie::Array.

       4th argument to substr
           substr() can now both return and replace in one operation.  The
           optional 4th argument is the replacement string.  See "substr" in
           perlfunc.

       Negative LENGTH argument to splice
           splice() with a negative LENGTH argument now work similar to what the
           LENGTH did for substr().  Previously a negative LENGTH was treated as
           0.  See "splice" in perlfunc.

       Magic lvalues are now more magical
           When you say something like "substr($x, 5) = "hi"", the scalar returned
           by substr() is special, in that any modifications to it affect $x.
           (This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is something on
           the left side of an assignment.)  Normally, this is exactly what you
           would expect to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use
           substr(), pos(), or vec() in a context where they might be modified,
           like taking a reference with "\" or as an argument to a sub that
           modifies @_.  In previous versions, this 'magic' only went one way, but
           now changes to the scalar the magic refers to ($x in the above example)
           affect the magic lvalue too. For instance, this code now acts
           differently:

    Configuration Changes
           You can use "Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl" which causes installperl to
           skip installing perl also as /usr/bin/perl.  This is useful if you
           prefer not to modify /usr/bin for some reason or another but harmful
           because many scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.

    BUGS
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the headers of
           recently posted articles in the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.  There
           may also be information at http://www.perl.com/perl/ , the Perl Home
           Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Make sure you trim your bug down
           to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
           output of "perl -V", will be sent off to <perlbug@perl.com> to be
           analysed by the Perl porting team.
