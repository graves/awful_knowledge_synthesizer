Below is a short explanation of tkpp GUI.\n\n   Menu\n       File -> Save command line\n\n       When you build or display command line in the Tkpp GUI, you can save\n       the command line in a separated file. This command line can be executed\n       from a terminal.\n\n       File -> Save configuration\n\n       You can save your GUI configuration (all options used) to load and\n       execute it next time.\n\n       File -> Load configuration\n\n       Load your saved file configuration. All saved options will be set in\n       the GUI.\n\n       File -> Exit\n\n       Close Tkpp.\n\n       Help -> Tkpp documentation\n\n       Display POD documentation of Tkpp.\n\n       Help -> pp documentation\n\n       Display POD documentation of pp.\n\n       Help -> About Tkpp\n\n       Display version and authors of Tkpp.\n\n       Help -> About pp\n\n       Display version and authors of pp ( pp --version).\n\n   Tabs GUI\n       There are five tabs in GUI : General Options, Information, Size, Other\n       Options and Output.\n\n       All tabs contain all options which can be used with pp. All default pp\n       options are kept.  You can now set as you want the options. When your\n       have finished, you can display the command line or start building your\n       package. You will have the output tab to see error or verbose messages.\n\nNOTES\n       In Win32 system, the building is executed in a separate process, then\n       the GUI is not frozen.\n\n       The first time you use Tkpp, it will tell you to install some CPAN\n       modules to use the GUI (like Tk, Tk::ColoredButton...).\n\nSEE ALSO\n       pp, PAR\n\nAUTHORS\n       Tkpp was written by Doug Gruber and rewrite by Djibril Ousmanou.
