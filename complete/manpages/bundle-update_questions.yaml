In\n       general, you should use bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html to\n       install the same exact gems and versions across machines.\n\n       You would use bundle update to explicitly update the version of a gem.\n\nOPTIONS\n       --all  Update all gems specified in Gemfile.\n\n       --group=<name>, -g=[<name>]\n\t      Only update the gems in the specified group. For instance, you\n\t      can update all gems in the development group with bundle update\n\t      --group development. You can also call bundle update rails\n\t      --group test to update the rails gem and all gems in the test\n\t      group, for example.\n\n       --source=<name>\n\t      The name of a :git or :path source used in the Gemfile(5). For\n\t      instance, with a :git source of\n\t      http://github.com/rails/rails.git, you would call bundle update\n\t      --source rails\n\n       --local\n\t      Do not attempt to fetch gems remotely and use the gem cache\n\t      instead.\n\n       --ruby Update the locked version of Ruby to the current version of\n\t      Ruby.\n\n       --bundler\n\t      Update the locked version of bundler to the invoked bundler\n\t      version.\n\n       --full-index\n\t      Fall back to using the single-file index of all gems.\n\n       --jobs=[<number>], -j[<number>]\n\t      Specify the number of jobs to run in parallel. The default is 1.\n\n       --retry=[<number>]\n\t      Retry failed network or git requests for number times.\n\n       --quiet\n\t      Only output warnings and errors.\n\n       --force\n\t      Force downloading every gem. --redownload is an alias of this\n\t      option.\n\n       --patch\n\t      Prefer updating only to next patch version.\n\n       --minor\n\t      Prefer updating only to next minor version.\n\n       --major\n\t      Prefer updating to next major version (default).\n\n       --strict\n\t      Do not allow any gem to be updated past latest --patch | --minor\n\t      | --major.\n\n       --conservative\n\t      Use bundle install conservative update behavior and do not allow\n\t      shared dependencies to be updated.\n\nUPDATING ALL GEMS\n       If you run bundle update --all, bundler will ignore any previously\n       installed gems and resolve all dependencies again based on the latest\n       versions of all gems available in the sources.\n\n       Consider the following Gemfile(5):\n\n\n\n\t   source \"https://rubygems.org\"\n\n\t   gem \"rails\", \"3.0.0.rc\"\n\t   gem \"nokogiri\"\n\n\n\n\n       When you run bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html the first time,\n       bundler will resolve all of the dependencies, all the way down, and\n       install what you need:\n\n\n\n\t   Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.........\n\t   Resolving dependencies...\n\t   Installing builder 2.1.2\n\t   Installing abstract 1.0.0\n\t   Installing rack 1.2.8\n\t   Using bundler 1.7.6\n\t   Installing rake 10.4.0\n\t   Installing polyglot 0.3.5\n\t   Installing mime-types 1.25.1\n\t   Installing i18n 0.4.2\n\t   Installing mini_portile 0.6.1\n\t   Installing tzinfo 0.3.42\n\t   Installing rack-mount 0.6.14\n\t   Installing rack-test 0.5.7\n\t   Installing treetop 1.4.15\n\t   Installing thor 0.14.6\n\t   Installing activesupport 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing erubis 2.6.6\n\t   Installing activemodel 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing arel 0.4.0\n\t   Installing mail 2.2.20\n\t   Installing activeresource 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing actionpack 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing activerecord 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing actionmailer 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing railties 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing rails 3.0.0.rc\n\t   Installing nokogiri 1.6.5\n\n\t   Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 26 gems total.\n\t   Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.\n\n\n\n\n       As you can see, even though you have two gems in the Gemfile(5), your\n       application needs 26 different gems in order to run. Bundler remembers\n       the exact versions it installed in Gemfile.lock. The next time you run\n       bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html, bundler skips the dependency\n       resolution and installs the same gems as it installed last time.\n\n       After checking in the Gemfile.lock into version control and cloning it\n       on another machine, running bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html\n       will still install the gems that you installed last time. You don´t\n       need to worry that a new release of erubis or mail changes the gems you\n       use.\n\n       However, from time to time, you might want to update the gems you are\n       using to the newest versions that still match the gems in your\n       Gemfile(5).\n\n       To do this, run bundle update --all, which will ignore the\n       Gemfile.lock, and resolve all the dependencies again. Keep in mind that\n       this process can result in a significantly different set of the 25\n       gems, based on the requirements of new gems that the gem authors\n       released since the last time you ran bundle update --all.\n\nUPDATING A LIST OF GEMS\n       Sometimes, you want to update a single gem in the Gemfile(5), and leave\n       the rest of the gems that you specified locked to the versions in the\n       Gemfile.lock.\n\n       For instance, in the scenario above, imagine that nokogiri releases\n       version 1.4.4, and you want to update it without updating Rails and all\n       of its dependencies. To do this, run bundle update nokogiri.\n\n       Bundler will update nokogiri and any of its dependencies, but leave\n       alone Rails and its dependencies.\n\nOVERLAPPING DEPENDENCIES\n       Sometimes, multiple gems declared in your Gemfile(5) are satisfied by\n       the same second-level dependency. For instance, consider the case of\n       thin and rack-perftools-profiler.\n\n\n\n\t   source \"https://rubygems.org\"\n\n\t   gem \"thin\"\n\t   gem \"rack-perftools-profiler\"\n\n\n\n\n       The thin gem depends on rack >= 1.0, while rack-perftools-profiler\n       depends on rack ~> 1.0. If you run bundle install, you get:\n\n\n\n\t   Fetching source index for https://rubygems.org/\n\t   Installing daemons (1.1.0)\n\t   Installing eventmachine (0.12.10) with native extensions\n\t   Installing open4 (1.0.1)\n\t   Installing perftools.rb (0.4.7) with native extensions\n\t   Installing rack (1.2.1)\n\t   Installing rack-perftools_profiler (0.0.2)\n\t   Installing thin (1.2.7) with native extensions\n\t   Using bundler (1.0.0.rc.3)\n\n\n\n\n       In this case, the two gems have their own set of dependencies, but they\n       share rack in common. If you run bundle update thin, bundler will\n       update daemons, eventmachine and rack, which are dependencies of thin,\n       but not open4 or perftools.rb, which are dependencies of\n       rack-perftools_profiler. Note that bundle update thin will update rack\n       even though it´s also a dependency of rack-perftools_profiler.\n\n       In short, by default, when you update a gem using bundle update,\n       bundler will update all dependencies of that gem, including those that\n       are also dependencies of another gem.\n\n       To prevent updating shared dependencies, prior to version 1.14 the only\n       option was the CONSERVATIVE UPDATING behavior in bundle install(1)\n       bundle-install.1.html:\n\n       In this scenario, updating the thin version manually in the Gemfile(5),\n       and then running bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html will only\n       update daemons and eventmachine, but not rack. For more information,\n       see the CONSERVATIVE UPDATING section of bundle install(1)\n       bundle-install.1.html.\n\n       Starting with 1.14, specifying the --conservative option will also\n       prevent shared dependencies from being updated.\n\nPATCH LEVEL OPTIONS\n       Version 1.14 introduced 4 patch-level options that will influence how\n       gem versions are resolved. One of the following options can be used:\n       --patch, --minor or --major. --strict can be added to further influence\n       resolution.\n\n       --patch\n\t      Prefer updating only to next patch version.\n\n       --minor\n\t      Prefer updating only to next minor version.\n\n       --major\n\t      Prefer updating to next major version (default).\n\n       --strict\n\t      Do not allow any gem to be updated past latest --patch | --minor\n\t      | --major.\n\n       When Bundler is resolving what versions to use to satisfy declared\n       requirements in the Gemfile or in parent gems, it looks up all\n       available versions, filters out any versions that don´t satisfy the\n       requirement, and then, by default, sorts them from newest to oldest,\n       considering them in that order.\n\n       Providing one of the patch level options (e.g. --patch) changes the\n       sort order of the satisfying versions, causing Bundler to consider the\n       latest --patch or --minor version available before other versions. Note\n       that versions outside the stated patch level could still be resolved to\n       if necessary to find a suitable dependency graph.\n\n       For example, if gem ´foo´ is locked at 1.0.2, with no gem requirement\n       defined in the Gemfile, and versions 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 2.0.0\n       all exist, the default order of preference by default (--major) will be\n       \"2.0.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.4, 1.0.3, 1.0.2\".\n\n       If the --patch option is used, the order of preference will change to\n       \"1.0.4, 1.0.3, 1.0.2, 1.1.1, 1.1.0, 2.0.0\".\n\n       If the --minor option is used, the order of preference will change to\n       \"1.1.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.4, 1.0.3, 1.0.2, 2.0.0\".\n\n       Combining the --strict option with any of the patch level options will\n       remove any versions beyond the scope of the patch level option, to\n       ensure that no gem is updated that far.\n\n       To continue the previous example, if both --patch and --strict options\n       are used, the available versions for resolution would be \"1.0.4, 1.0.3,\n       1.0.2\". If --minor and --strict are used, it would be \"1.1.1, 1.1.0,\n       1.0.4, 1.0.3, 1.0.2\".\n\n       Gem requirements as defined in the Gemfile will still be the first\n       determining factor for what versions are available. If the gem\n       requirement for foo in the Gemfile is ´~> 1.0´, that will accomplish\n       the same thing as providing the --minor and --strict options.\n\nPATCH LEVEL EXAMPLES\n       Given the following gem specifications:\n\n\n\n\t   foo 1.4.3, requires: ~> bar 2.0\n\t   foo 1.4.4, requires: ~> bar 2.0\n\t   foo 1.4.5, requires: ~> bar 2.1\n\t   foo 1.5.0, requires: ~> bar 2.1\n\t   foo 1.5.1, requires: ~> bar 3.0\n\t   bar with versions 2.0.3, 2.0.4, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 3.0.0\n\n\n\n\n       Gemfile:\n\n\n\n\t   gem ´foo´\n\n\n\n\n       Gemfile.lock:\n\n\n\n\t   foo (1.4.3)\n\t     bar (~> 2.0)\n\t   bar (2.0.3)\n\n\n\n\n       Cases:\n\n\n\n\t   #  Command Line\t\t       Result\n\t   ------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   1  bundle update --patch\t       ´foo 1.4.5´, ´bar 2.1.1´\n\t   2  bundle update --patch foo        ´foo 1.4.5´, ´bar 2.1.1´\n\t   3  bundle update --minor\t       ´foo 1.5.1´, ´bar 3.0.0´\n\t   4  bundle update --minor --strict   ´foo 1.5.0´, ´bar 2.1.1´\n\t   5  bundle update --patch --strict   ´foo 1.4.4´, ´bar 2.0.4´\n\n\n\n\n       In case 1, bar is upgraded to 2.1.1, a minor version increase, because\n       the dependency from foo 1.4.5 required it.\n\n       In case 2, only foo is requested to be unlocked, but bar is also\n       allowed to move because it´s not a declared dependency in the Gemfile.\n\n       In case 3, bar goes up a whole major release, because a minor increase\n       is preferred now for foo, and when it goes to 1.5.1, it requires 3.0.0\n       of bar.\n\n       In case 4, foo is preferred up to a minor version, but 1.5.1 won´t work\n       because the --strict flag removes bar 3.0.0 from consideration since\n       it´s a major increment.\n\n       In case 5, both foo and bar have any minor or major increments removed\n       from consideration because of the --strict flag, so the most they can\n       move is up to 1.4.4 and 2.0.4.\n\nRECOMMENDED WORKFLOW\n       In general, when working with an application managed with bundler, you\n       should use the following workflow:\n\n       •   After you create your Gemfile(5) for the first time, run\n\n\t   $ bundle install\n\n       •   Check the resulting Gemfile.lock into version control\n\n\t   $ git add Gemfile.lock\n\n       •   When checking out this repository on another development machine,\n\t   run\n\n\t   $ bundle install\n\n       •   When checking out this repository on a deployment machine, run\n\n\t   $ bundle install --deployment\n\n       •   After changing the Gemfile(5) to reflect a new or update\n\t   dependency, run\n\n\t   $ bundle install\n\n       •   Make sure to check the updated Gemfile.lock into version control\n\n\t   $ git add Gemfile.lock\n\n       •   If bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html reports a conflict,\n\t   manually update the specific gems that you changed in the\n\t   Gemfile(5)\n\n\t   $ bundle update rails thin\n\n       •   If you want to update all the gems to the latest possible versions\n\t   that still match the gems listed in the Gemfile(5), run\n\n\t   $ bundle update --all"
