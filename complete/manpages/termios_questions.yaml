For most hardware, the presence of a\n     connection is indicated by the assertion of the hardware CARRIER line. If\n     the termios structure associated with the terminal file has the CLOCAL\n     flag set in the cflag, or if the O_NONBLOCK flag is set in the open(2)\n     call, then the open will succeed even without a connection being present.\n     In practice, applications seldom open these files; they are opened by\n     special programs, such as getty(2) or rlogind(2), and become an\n     application's standard input, output, and error files.\n\n   Job Control in a Nutshell\n     Every process is associated with a particular process group and session.\n     The grouping is hierarchical: every member of a particular process group\n     is a member of the same session.  This structuring is used in managing\n     groups of related processes for purposes of job control; that is, the\n     ability from the keyboard (or from program control) to simultaneously\n     stop or restart a complex command (a command composed of one or more\n     related processes).  The grouping into process groups allows delivering\n     of signals that stop or start the group as a whole, along with\n     arbitrating which process group has access to the single controlling\n     terminal.\tThe grouping at a higher layer into sessions is to restrict\n     the job control related signals and system calls to within processes\n     resulting from a particular instance of a \"login\".  Typically, a session\n     is created when a user logs in, and the login terminal is setup to be the\n     controlling terminal; all processes spawned from that login shell are in\n     the same session, and inherit the controlling terminal.  A job control\n     shell operating interactively (that is, reading commands from a terminal)\n     normally groups related processes together by placing them into the same\n     process group.  A set of processes in the same process group is\n     collectively referred to as a \"job\". When the foreground process group of\n     the terminal is the same as the process group of a particular job, that\n     job is said to be in the \"foreground\".  When the process group of the\n     terminal is different than the process group of a job (but is still the\n     controlling terminal), that job is said to be in the \"background\".\n     Normally the shell reads a command and starts the job that implements\n     that command.  If the command is to be started in the foreground\n     (typical), it sets the process group of the terminal to the process group\n     of the started job, waits for the job to complete, and then sets the\n     process group of the terminal back to its own process group (it puts\n     itself into the foreground).  If the job is to be started in the\n     background (as denoted by the shell operator \"&\"), it never changes the\n     process group of the terminal and doesn't wait for the job to complete\n     (that is, it immediately attempts to read the next command).  If the job\n     is started in the foreground, the user may type a key (usually ‘^Z’)\n     which generates the terminal stop signal (SIGTSTP) and has the affect of\n     stopping the entire job.  The shell will notice that the job stopped, and\n     will resume running after placing itself in the foreground.  The shell\n     also has commands for placing stopped jobs in the background, and for\n     placing stopped or background jobs into the foreground."

A terminal may be the controlling terminal for at\n     most one session.\tThe controlling terminal for a session is allocated by\n     the session leader by issuing the TIOCSCTTY ioctl.

    Manpage text:

    The controlling terminal is inherited by a child process during a fork(2)
         function call.  A process relinquishes its controlling terminal when it
         creates a new session with the setsid(2) function; other processes
         remaining in the old session that had this terminal as their controlling
         terminal continue to have it.  A process does not relinquish its
         controlling terminal simply by closing all of its file descriptors
         associated with the controlling terminal if other processes continue to
         have it open.

         When a controlling process terminates, the controlling terminal is
         disassociated from the current session, allowing it to be acquired by a
         new session leader.  Subsequent access to the terminal by other processes
         in the earlier session will be denied, with attempts to access the
         terminal treated as if modem disconnect had been sensed.

       Terminal Access Control
         If a process is in the foreground process group of its controlling
         terminal, read operations are allowed.  Any attempts by a process in a
         background process group to read from its controlling terminal causes a
         SIGTTIN signal to be sent to the process's group unless one of the
         following special cases apply:  If the reading process is ignoring or
         blocking the SIGTTIN signal, or if the process group of the reading
         process is orphaned, the read(2) returns -1 with errno set to EIO and no
         signal is sent.  The default action of the SIGTTIN signal is to stop the
         process to which it is sent.

    Manpage text:

    If a process is in the foreground process group of its controlling
         terminal, write operations are allowed.  Attempts by a process in a
         background process group to write to its controlling terminal will cause
         the process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal unless one of the following
         special cases apply:  If TOSTOP is not set, or if TOSTOP is set and the
         process is ignoring or blocking the SIGTTOU signal, the process is
         allowed to write to the terminal and the SIGTTOU signal is not sent.  If
         TOSTOP is set, and the process group of the writing process is orphaned,
         and the writing process is not ignoring or blocking SIGTTOU, the write
         returns -1 with errno set to EIO and no signal is sent.

         Certain calls that set terminal parameters are treated in the same
         fashion as write, except that TOSTOP is ignored; that is, the effect is
         identical to that of terminal writes when TOSTOP is set.

       Input Processing and Reading Data
         A terminal device associated with a terminal device file may operate in
         full-duplex mode, so that data may arrive even while output is occurring.
         Each terminal device file has associated with it an input queue, into
         which incoming data is stored by the system before being read by a
         process.  The system imposes a limit, {MAX_INPUT}, on the number of bytes
         that may be stored in the input queue.  The behavior of the system when
         this limit is exceeded depends on the setting of the IMAXBEL flag in the
         termios c_iflag.  If this flag is set, the terminal is sent an ASCII BEL
         character each time a character is received while the input queue is
         full.  Otherwise, the input queue is flushed upon receiving the
         character.

    Manpage text:

    Two general kinds of input processing are available, determined by
         whether the terminal device file is in canonical mode or noncanonical
         mode. Additionally, input characters are processed according to the
         c_iflag and c_lflag fields.  Such processing can include echoing, which
         in general means transmitting input characters immediately back to the
         terminal when they are received from the terminal.  This is useful for
         terminals that can operate in full-duplex mode.

         The manner in which data is provided to a process reading from a terminal
         device file is dependent on whether the terminal device file is in
         canonical or noncanonical mode.

         Another dependency is whether the O_NONBLOCK flag is set by open() or
         fcntl().  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, then the read request is
         blocked until data is available or a signal has been received.  If the
         O_NONBLOCK flag is set, then the read request is completed, without
         blocking, in one of three ways:

    Case B: MIN > 0, TIME = 0
         In this case, since the value of TIME is zero, the timer plays no role
         and only MIN is significant.  A pending read is not satisfied until MIN
         bytes are received (i.e., the pending read blocks until MIN bytes are
         received), or a signal is received.  A program that uses this case to
         read record-based terminal I/O may block indefinitely in the read
         operation.

       Case C: MIN = 0, TIME > 0
         In this case, since MIN = 0, TIME no longer represents an inter-byte
         timer.  It now serves as a read timer that is activated as soon as the
         read function is processed.  A read is satisfied as soon as a single byte
         is received or the read timer expires.  Note that in this case if the
         timer expires, no bytes are returned.  If the timer does not expire, the
         only way the read can be satisfied is if a byte is received.  In this
         case the read will not block indefinitely waiting for a byte; if no byte
         is received within TIME*0.1 seconds after the read is initiated, the read
         returns a value of zero, having read no data.  If data is in the buffer

    In the context of asynchronous serial data transmission, a break
         condition is defined as a sequence of zero-valued bits that continues for
         more than the time to send one byte.  The entire sequence of zero-valued
         bits is interpreted as a single break condition, even if it continues for
         a time equivalent to more than one byte.  In contexts other than
         asynchronous serial data transmission the definition of a break condition
         is implementation defined.

         If IGNBRK is set, a break condition detected on input is ignored, that
         is, not put on the input queue and therefore not read by any process.  If
         IGNBRK is not set and BRKINT is set, the break condition flushes the
         input and output queues and if the terminal is the controlling terminal
         of a foreground process group, the break condition generates a single
         SIGINT signal to that foreground process group.  If neither IGNBRK nor
         BRKINT is set, a break condition is read as a single ‘\0’, or if PARMRK
         is set, as ‘\377’, ‘\0’, ‘\0’.

    If ECHOK and ICANON are set, the KILL character causes the current line

         If ECHOKE and ICANON are set, the KILL character causes the current line
