With each pattern there can be an associated action that\n       will be performed when a line of a file matches the pattern.  Each line\n       is matched against the pattern portion of every pattern-action\n       statement; the associated action is performed for each matched pattern.\n       The file name - means the standard input.  Any file of the form\n       var=value is treated as an assignment, not a filename, and is executed\n       at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.  The\n       option -v followed by var=value is an assignment to be done before prog\n       is executed; any number of -v options may be present.  The -F fs option\n       defines the input field separator to be the regular expression fs.\n\n       An input line is normally made up of fields separated by white space,\n       or by the regular expression FS.  The fields are denoted $1, $2, ...,\n       while $0 refers to the entire line.  If FS is null, the input line is\n       split into one field per character.\n\n       A pattern-action statement has the form:\n\n\t      pattern { action }\n\n       A missing { action } means print the line; a missing pattern always\n       matches.  Pattern-action statements are separated by newlines or\n       semicolons.\n\n       An action is a sequence of statements.  A statement can be one of the\n       following:\n\n\t      if( expression ) statement [ else statement ]\n\t      while( expression ) statement\n\t      for( expression ; expression ; expression ) statement\n\t      for( var in array ) statement\n\t      do statement while( expression )\n\t      break\n\t      continue\n\t      { [ statement ... ] }\n\t      expression\t      # commonly var = expression\n\t      print [ expression-list ] [ > expression ]\n\t      printf format [ , expression-list ] [ > expression ]\n\t      return [ expression ]\n\t      next\t\t      # skip remaining patterns on this input line\n\t      nextfile\t\t      # skip rest of this file, open next, start at top\n\t      delete array[ expression ]# delete an array element\n\t      delete array\t      # delete all elements of array\n\t      exit [ expression ]     # exit immediately; status is expression\n\n       Statements are terminated by semicolons, newlines or right braces.  An\n       empty expression-list stands for $0.  String constants are quoted \" \",\n       with the usual C escapes recognized within.  Expressions take on string\n       or numeric values as appropriate, and are built using the operators + -\n       * / % ^ (exponentiation), and concatenation (indicated by white space).\n       The operators ! ++ -- += -= *= /= %= ^= > >= < <= == != ?: are also\n       available in expressions.  Variables may be scalars, array elements\n       (denoted x[i]) or fields.  Variables are initialized to the null\n       string.\tArray subscripts may be any string, not necessarily numeric;\n       this allows for a form of associative memory.  Multiple subscripts such\n       as [i,j,k] are permitted; the constituents are concatenated, separated\n       by the value of SUBSEP.\n\n       The print statement prints its arguments on the standard output (or on\n       a file if > file  or >> file  is present or on a pipe if | cmd  is\n       present), separated by the current output field separator, and\n       terminated by the output record separator.  file and cmd may be literal\n       names or parenthesized expressions; identical string values in\n       different statements denote the same open file.\tThe printf statement\n       formats its expression list according to the format (see printf(3)).\n       The built-in function close(expr) closes the file or pipe expr.\tThe\n       built-in function fflush(expr) flushes any buffered output for the file\n       or pipe expr.\n\n       The mathematical functions atan2, cos, exp, log, sin, and sqrt are\n       built in.  Other built-in functions:"

Finally, cmd | getline\n       pipes the output of cmd into getline; each call of getline returns the\n       next line of output from cmd.
