    Objective-C
    
    Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that extends the C programming language with Smalltalk-style messaging. While simultaneously developing for OS X and iOS, Objective-C's capabilities have been bolstered by the inclusion of a dynamic runtime and assistance for object-oriented programming.
    
    Objective-C: The Ultimate Guide walks developers and coders through a straightforward and practical method of learning the Objective-C programming language. This book discusses the basics in brief, and then moves on to more advanced and detailed exercises to help readers quickly gain the required knowledge. The focus in this book remains on writing optimized and well-structured code in Objective-C.
    
    Key Features:
    
    • Follows a hands-on approach and offers practical lessons and tutorials
    related to Objective-C
    
    • Discusses Objective-C using real world industry concepts
    
    • Includes at-length discussion of Objective-C concepts to help build robust
    knowledge

    ➢ What is Objective-C
    ➢ Major Concepts
    ➢ Advantages and Disadvantages
    ➢ Syntax and Code Basics
    ➢ Additional Info
    
    Objective-C language is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming  
    language that extends the C programming language with Smalltalk-style  
    messaging. Apple's primary programming language for the OS X and iOS  
    operating  systems  and  their  associated  APIs,  Cocoa,  and  Cocoa  Touch.  
    This book will walk you through a straightforward and practical method  
    of learning the Objective-C programming language.
    
    Programming in Objective-C is a general-purpose programming lan-
    guage. Although it is not unique to any platform or system, use it to con-
    struct  a  wide  range  of  frameworks.  Programming  in  Objective-C  adds 
    communications features to the language C.
    
    Objective-C  is  one  of  the  primary  programming  languages  used  by 
    Apple  for  the  iOS  platform  and  is  used  to  develop  mobile  apps  for  this 
    platform.  Being  the  superset  of  the  C  programming  language,  it  allows

    developers to be more detail-oriented and accommodating of objects and 
    other programming languages.
    
    Numerous  programming  languages  exist.  Three  programming  lan-
    guages are now in high demand: Swift, Objective-C , and C++. Let's exam-
    ine the fundamental distinctions between Objective-C and the other two 
    programming languages:
    
    OBJECTIVE-C SPECIFICS
    
    Objective-C  is  excellent  for  memory  management;  there  are  avail-
    able  compilers  that  can  turn  Objective-C  code  into  static  code  analy-
    sis, which the language then uses to distinguish important information 
    from "trash."
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The most crucial aspect of Objective-C to understand is that it is very  
    object-oriented. Using this additional language, you can move graphs and  
    modify  files,  but  it  is  crucial  to  understand  its  limits  to  comprehend  its  
    benefits.
    
    Objective-C,  a  programming  language  created  in  the  1980s,  retains  
    many features used in iOS-specific mobile app development. While there 
    has been no breakthrough that enables Objective-C to be utilized on all 
    platforms, Objective-C is compatible with C and other languages for iOS 
    apps.
    
    Objective-C competes with Swift, a more recent iOS programming lan-
    guage. Several discussions over whether programming language provides 
    superior iOS mobile application development outcomes.
    
    WHY OBJECTIVE-C?
    
    For  several  reasons,  the  Objective-C  programming  language  is  selected. 
    It's  an  object-oriented  language,  first  and  foremost.  Object-oriented 
    approaches are required to give the type of capability seen in the Cocoa 
    frameworks. Second, since Objective-C is an extension of ANSI C, exist-
    ing C applications are converted to utilize the software frameworks with-
    out  sacrificing  any  of  the  efforts  that  went  into  their  creation.  Because 
    Objective-C includes C, you receive all of the advantages of C while deal-
    ing with it.
    
    You may select whether to use object-oriented programming methods 
    (for example, to create a new class) and when to use procedural program-
    ming techniques (define a structure and some functions instead of a class).
    Furthermore, Objective-C is a very basic programming language. It has 
    
    a simple, clear syntax that is simple to pick up.
    
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    3
    
    Object-oriented  programming  poses  a  high  learning  curve  to  new 
    recruits with its self-conscious vocabulary and focuses on abstract design. 
    A well-structured language, such as Objective-C, may make becoming an 
    expert object-oriented programmer considerably easier.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Objective-C is exceptionally dynamic when compared to other C-based  
    object-oriented languages. For usage at runtime, the compiler saves a lot  
    of information about the objects themselves. Decisions taken at compile  
    time are deferred until after the program has been executed. Objective-C  
    programs have a lot of flexibility and power because of their dynamism. It  
    provides two major advantages that are difficult to get with other ostensi-
    bly object-oriented languages.
    
    Objective-C has an open, dynamic binding approach that can allow a  
    basic interactive user interface design. Messages are not always bound by  
    the receiver's class or method name. Therefore a software framework may  
    enable users to make decisions at runtime and provide developers a cre-
    ative latitude in their design. (Terms like dynamic binding, message, class,  
    and receiver will be defined later in this text.)
    
    Dynamism allows for the creation of advanced development tools. It's  
    feasible to construct tools that monitor, intervene, and disclose the underly-
    ing structure and activity of Objective-C programs using an interface to the  
    runtime system, which offers access to information about running apps.
    
    DIFFERENTIATING OBJECTIVE-C VERSUS SWIFT
    
    Swift is the programming language that Apple introduced in June 2014.  
    Objective-C has all the flaws one would anticipate from a language derived  
    from C. To differentiate keywords and types from C types, Objective-C  
    prefixes new keywords with @. Swift is not based on C. Therefore, it may  
    combine all Objective-C types and object-related keywords and extract  
    their many @ symbols.
    
    In addition to other modern programming languages, Swift code  
    nearly resembles natural English. This readability makes it easier for exist-
    ing programmers from JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and C++ to adopt  
    Swift as part of their toolchain, in contrast to the painful experience that  
    Objective-C programmers had.
    
    DIFFERENTIATING OBJECTIVE-C FROM C++
    
    Wilkerson states that C++ was introduced in 1979 to combine objects and  
    instance methods with the original C programming language. Objective-C  
    language was founded on the belief that object-oriented programming

    would be more productive and successful for big software projects; several 
    senior  experts  see  this  as  the  cause  for  C++'s  widespread  acceptance  in 
    the years that followed. According to programming community experts, 
    C++ is the language used to create most current desktop applications. As 
    a result of its popularity, many frameworks and libraries have been devel-
    oped  to  extend  C++  for  functions  such  as  high-performance  graphics, 
    audio digital signal processing, and user interface design.
    
    Both languages are derived from C, but they are two entirely distinct 
    languages.  Objective-C  relies  heavily  on  its  runtime  library  to  handle 
    inheritance  and  polymorphism,  while  C  relies  heavily  on  compile-time 
    choices for transmission. Nevertheless, in C++, the focus is often on com-
    pile-time conclusions. C++ is a middle-level programming language that 
    runs  on  several  cross-platform  operating  systems  including  Windows, 
    UNIX, Mac OS, etc. Objective-C, in contrast, is a general-purpose, object-
    oriented programming language that Apple uses in its operating systems 
    and Cocoa APIs, etc.
    
    UPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES OF OBJECTIVE-C
    Upsides
    
    •  Compatibility with both C++ and Objective-C++
    
    •  Effective attributes such as method swizzling
    
    •  More dependable assistance in coding Binary Frameworks.
    
    Downsides
    
    •  Since  Objective-C  is  built  upon  C,  namespacing  is  required.  All 
    classes  inside  an  Objective-C  program  must  be  globally  unique. 
    Therefore, there is a practice of prefixing class names to avoid con-
    flict. This is why we own the "NS" prefix for Foundation Framework 
    classes and the "UI" prefix for UIKit classes.
    
    •  Specific pointers.
    
    •  The  ability  to  send  a  message  on  a  nil  object  without  dropping 
    and the lack of strict type make it harder to identify and resolve 
    issues.
    
    •  The syntax of the language is tedious and complex.

    FACTORS TO CONSIDER
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Objective-C application development may be expedited and is an excellent approach to adding object-based functionality to an application. There are many important considerations about this superset language:
    
    Maintenance is essential; this pertains to upgrading Objective-C developed applications. Although the language is dated, it is not outdated. It merely takes minimal maintenance to remain current.
    
    Less adaption is necessary as many APIs still have a lot to catch up for Swift-developed applications. This suggests that Objective-C may be simpler to deploy to iOS mobile applications.
    
    Object handling made simpler Apple is all about having an object network. Using Objective-C, these objects are readily movable.
    
    Objective-C may simplify iOS mobile applications in all Apple iOS devices, including smartphones and tablets.
    
    OBJECTIVE-C OVERVIEW
    
    Objective-C supports object-oriented programming, along with the four object-oriented development pillars.
    
    • Encapsulation
    • Data hiding
    • Inheritance
    • Polymorphism
    
    Example:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
       NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
    
       NSLog (@ "hello everyone");
       [pool drain];
       return 0;
    }
    
     
    6    ◾    Objective-C
    
    FRAMEWORK FOR THE FOUNDATION
    
    The Foundation Framework has a plethora of functionality, which are described below.
    
    It includes several expanded datatypes such as NSArray, NSDictionary,NSSet, and others.
    
    It has an extensive collection of functions for handling files, strings, etc.
    It has URL processing functions and utilities like date formatting, data handling, error handling, etc.
    
    LEARNING OBJECTIVE-C
    
    When studying Objective-C, the essential thing to remember is to stay focused on principles rather than getting bogged down in language technicalities.
    
    The goal of studying a programming language is to become a better programmer or become more successful at developing, implementing, and maintaining existing systems.
    
    USING OBJECTIVE-C
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    As previously stated, Objective-C is utilized in iOS and Mac OS X. It has  
    a sizable iOS user base and a rapidly growing Mac OS X user base. And  
    because Apple prioritizes quality, this is fantastic news for individuals who  
    have just begun learning Objective-C.
    
    SETUP OF THE OBJECTIVE-C ENVIRONMENT
    
    LOCAL ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
    
    If we want to create our own environment for the Objective-C program-
    ming language, we must install Text Editor and The GCC Compiler on our 
    computer.
    
    EDITOR OF TEXT
    
    This is where we will type our program. Some editors are Windows 
    Notepad, the OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
    
    On various operating systems, the name and version of the text editor 
    may differ. Notepad, for example, will be used on Windows, and use vim 
    or vi on both Windows and Linux or UNIX.
    
    Source files are files that we produce with our editor that contain pro-
    gram source code. Objective-C source files are commonly named with the 
    extension ".m."
    
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    7
    
    Before starting our programming, make sure we have one text editor 
    in place, and we have enough knowledge to develop a computer program, 
    store it in a file, compile it, and eventually run it.
    
    GCC COMPILER
    
    Our program's source code is written in a source file and is human read-
    able. It must "compiled" into machine code before our CPU can run the 
    program as instructed.
    
    Use this GCC compiler to transform our source code into an executable 
    application. We're assuming we're familiar with programming language 
    compilers.
    
    The GCC compiler is available for free on various systems, and the tech-
    
    nique for installing it on those platforms is detailed here.
    
    UNIX/LINUX INSTALLATION
    
    The first step is to install gcc and the gcc Objective-C package. This is 
    accomplished by:
    
    $ su - 
    $ yum install gcc
    $ yum install gcc-objc
    
    The following command is used to configure package dependencies:
    
    $ yum install make libpng libpng-devel libtiff 
    libtiff-devel libobjc 
       libxml2 libxml2-devel libX11-devel libXt-devel 
    libjpeg libjpeg-devel
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Download and install GNUStep to unlock all of Objective-functionality.  
    The package is obtained by visiting http://wwwmain.gnustep.org/resources/  
    downloads.php  
    
    Now we must navigate to the downloaded location and unpack the file  
    
    using:
    
    $ tar xvfz gnustep-startup-.tar.gz
    
    Now we must navigate to the folder GNUStep-startup, which is created 
    
    by using:
    
    $ cd gnustep-startup-<version>
    
    8    ◾    Objective-C
    
    The construction procedure must then be configured.
    
    $. /configure
    
    Then we may construct by
    
    $ make
    
    We must eventually create the environment by
    
    $ ./usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
    
    We have a helloeveryone.m Objective-C file that looks like this:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
       NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool 
    alloc] init];
    
       NSLog (@"hello everyone");
       [pool drain];
       return 0;
    }
    
    Now we can build and execute an Objective-C file, say helloeveryone.m, 
    by using cd to get to the file's location and then doing the following steps:
    
    $ gcc 'gnustep-config --objc-flags' 
    -L/usr/GNUstep/Local/Library/Libraries 
    -lgnustep-base helloeveryone.m -o helloeveryone
    $ ./helloeveryone
    
    MAC OS INSTALLATION
    
    If we're running Mac OS X, the simplest method to get GCC is to down-
    load Apple's Xcode development environment and follow the straightfor-
    ward installation instructions. Once we've installed Xcode, we'll be able to 
    utilize the GNU C/C++ compiler.
    
    Xcode  is  presently  being  downloaded  at  https://developer.apple.com/
    
    xcode/.
    
       
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    9
    
    WINDOWS INSTALLATION
    
    To run an Objective-C program on Windows, we must first install MinGW 
    and  GNUStep  Core.  Download  both  at:  https://www.gnu.org/software/
    gnustep/windows/installer.html.
    
    We must first install the MSYS/MinGW System package. The GNUstep 
    Core package then is installed and both of which have a self-explanatory 
    Windows setup.

    ---
    
    Then, go to Start -> All Programs -> GNUstep -> Shell to utilize Objective-C and GNUstep.
    
    Navigate to the helloeveryone.m folder.
    We may use to compile the code.
    
    $ gcc 'gnustep-config --objc-flags' 
    -L /GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries helloeveryone.m 
    -o hello -lgnustep-base -lobjc
    
    STRUCTURE OF THE OBJECTIVE-C PROGRAM
    
    Before we examine the fundamental building blocks of the Objective-C programming language, let's look at a bare minimum Objective-C program structure that we can use as a reference in the later chapters.
    
    OBJECTIVE-C EXAMPLE OF HELLO EVERYONE
    
    A simple Objective-C program consists of the following components:
    
    • Preprocessor Commands

    Consider a simple code that prints the words "Hello Everyone."
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface SampleClass:NSObject
    
    - (void)sampleMethod;
    @end
    
    @implementation SampleClass
    
    - (void)sampleMethod {
       NSLog(@"Hello, Everyone \n");
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main() {
       /* first program in the Objective-C */
       SampleClass *sampleClass = [[SampleClass alloc]
    init];
       [sampleClass sampleMethod];
       return 0;
    }
    
    Let's examine several components of the code above:
    
    • The first line of the code, #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>, is a preprocessor instruction that instructs an Objective-C compiler to import the Foundation.h file before real compilation.
    
    • The following line @interface SampleClass:NSObject demonstrates interface creation. It inherits the foundation class for all objects, NSObject.
    
    • (void)sampleMethod; demonstrates how to define a method.
    
    • The following line, @end, signifies the end of an interface.
    
    • The following line demonstrates how to implement the interface SampleClass.
    
    • The sampleMethod is implemented in the following line, (void) sampleMethod.

    • The next line @end signifies the conclusion of an implementation.
    
    • The following line, int main(), is the program's main function, where execution starts.

    • The next line /*…*/ will be disregarded by the compiler and has been included to provide additional program comments. Therefore, these lines are known as comments in the program.
    
    • The following line NSLog(…) is an Objective-C function that causes the message "Hello, Everyone" to appear on the screen.
    
    • The next line return 0; concludes the main() function and returns the number 0.
    
    BASIC SYNTAX IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    OBJECTIVE-C TOKENS
    
    A token is a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol in an Objective-C program. For instance, the following Objective-C statement is made up of six tokens:
    
    NSLog(@"Hello, Everyone \n");
    
    Individual tokens are referred to as:
    
    NSLog
    @
     (
       "Hello, Everyone \n"
    )
    ;
    
    SEMICOLONS;
    
    A semicolon is a statement terminator in an Objective-C program. That is, a semicolon must follow each sentence. It denotes the end of a single logical entity.
    
    For example, consider the following two statements:
    
    NSLog(@"Hello, Everyone \n");
    return 0;
    
    COMMENTS
    
    Comments are similar to help text in our Objective-C application and are disregarded by the compiler. As illustrated below, they begin with /* and end with the characters */.
    
    /* first program in the Objective-C */
    
      
    
    12    ◾    Objective-C
    
    There can be no comments within comments, and they cannot be within a string or character literals.
    
    IDENTIFIERS

    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed:
    
    An Objective-C identifier recognizes a variable, function, or other user-defined items. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore and ends with zero or more letters, underscores, or numbers (0 to 9). Punctuation characters such as @, $, and percent are not permitted within identifiers in Objective-C. Objective-C is a computer language that is case sensitive. Thus, in Objective-C, Manpower and manpower are two different IDs. The following are some instances of appropriate identifiers:
    
    Kohd       lara    bac   move_name  b_213
    name50   _temp   j     b23b9      retVal

    WHITESPACE IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    A blank line has simply whitespace, potentially with a remark, and is completely ignored by an Objective-C compiler.
    
    In Objective-C, whitespace refers to blanks, tabs, newline characters, and comments. Whitespace divides one section of a statement from another and allows the compiler to determine where one element, such as int, ends, and the next element starts in a statement. As a result, in the following sentence
    
    int ages;
    
    For the compiler to distinguish between int and age, there must be at least one whitespace character (typically a space). In contrast, the following statement,
    
    fruit = grapes + apples; // get total fruit
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    There are no whitespace characters required between fruit and =, or between = and grapes. However, we are allowed to include any for readability purposes.
    
    DATA TYPES IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Data types are a comprehensive framework used in the Objective-C programming language for declaring variables or functions of various sorts. A variable's type dictates how much storage space it takes up and how the bit pattern recorded is interpreted.
    
    Objective-C types can be classed as follows:

    Basic types
    They are arithmetic types divided into two categories:  
    (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
    Enumerated types
    They are arithmetic types once more, and they are used to 
    construct variables that can only be allocated discrete 
    integer values throughout the program.
    The type void
    The type specifier void signifies that there is no accessible 
    value.
    Derived types
    Among them are pointer types, array types, structure types, 
    union types, and function types.
    
    The aggregate types are the array and structure types combined. A 
    function's type indicates the type of the function's return value.

    The sizeof operator can determine the precise size of a type or variable on a specific platform. The phrase sizeof(type) returns the object or type's storage size in bytes. The following is an example of determining the size of an int type on any computer.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main() {
       NSLog(@"The Storage size for int : %d \n", 
    sizeof(int));
       return 0;
    }
    
    TYPES OF FLOATING-POINT
    
    The table below contains information on typical float-point types, includ-
    ing storage sizes, value ranges, and precision.
    
    Type | Storage Size | Value Range | Precision
    ---|-------------|------------|---------
    float | 4 byte | 1.2E − 38 to 3.4E + 38 | 6 decimal-places
    double | 8 byte | 2.3E − 308 to 1.7E + 308 | 15 decimal-places
    long double | 10 byte | 3.4E − 4932 to 1.1E + 4932 | 19 decimal-places
    
    The float.h header file includes macros that let us use these values and other information about the binary representation of real numbers in our applications. The following example will output the storage space occupied by a float type and its range values.

    The void type indicates that there is no value available. It is used in three different contexts.
    
    Sr. No. | Types and Description
    ---|---
    1 | Function returns as void
    Several Objective-C functions do not return a value or return a void. The return type of a function with no return value is void. As an example, consider void exit (int status).
    2 | Function arguments as void
    Some Objective-C functions do not accept any parameters. A void can be accepted by a function that has no parameters. For instance, int rand(void).
    
    VARIABLES IN OBJECTIVE-C

    A variable is just the name assigned to a storage location that our programs may access. In Objective-C, each variable has a type that governs the amount and layout of the variable's memory, the range of values stored inside that memory, and the set of operations that can apply to the variable.
    A variable's name can be letters, numbers, and the underscore character. Start it with a letter or an underscore. Because Objective-C is case-sensitive, upper and lowercase letters are different.

    16    ◾    Objective-C
    
    The Objective-C programming language also defines different sorts of variables, which we will discuss in later chapters, such as Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. Let us look at fundamental variable types in this section.
    
    OBJECTIVE-C VARIABLE DEFINITION
    
    In Objective-C, a variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to generate for the variable. A variable description describes a data type and includes a list of one or more variables of that type, as seen below.
    
    type variablelist;
    
    In this case, a type must be a valid Objective-C data type, such as char, w char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object. The variable list can have one or more identifier names separated by commas. Here are some examples of valid declarations.
    
    int    c, d, e;
    char   k, kh;
    float  g, salary;
    double q;
    
    The line int c, d, e; declares and defines the variables c, d, and e; and tells the compiler to create variables of type int called c, d, and e.

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text, with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:
    
    ---
    
    In their declaration, variables can be initialized (given an initial value).  
    The initializer is made of an equal sign followed by a constant expression,  
    as seen below.
    
    type variablename = value;
    
    Example:
    
    extern int c = 3, d = 5;    // declaration of c 
    and d. 
    int c = 3, d = 5;           // definition and 
    initializing c and d. 
    byte k = 22;                // definition and 
    initializes k. 
    char y = 'y';               // the variable y has 
    the value 'y'.
    
    ---
    
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    17
    
    For variables declared without an initializer, variables with static storage duration are automatically initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0). In contrast, the initial value of all other variables is indeterminate.
    
    OBJECTIVE-C VARIABLE DECLARATION
    
    A variable declaration assures the compiler that there is at least one variable with the specified type and name, allowing the compiler to continue with further compilation without requiring more information. A variable declaration only has significance at the time of compilation; the compiler requires the actual variable declaration when linking the program.
    
    A variable declaration is essential when you are utilizing many files. You specify your variable in one of the files accessible at the time of program linking.  To define a variable at any location, you will utilize the extern keyword. Variables are declared several times in Objective-C programs, but they can only be defined once per file, function, or code block.
    
    Example: Try out the following example, in which variables are declared 
    
    at the top but defined and initialized inside the main function.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    // Variable-declaration:
    extern int x, y;
    extern int z;
    extern float f;
    
    int main () {
      /* variable-definition: */
      int x, y;
      int z;
      float f;
    
      /* actual-initialization */
      x = 10;
      y = 20;
    
      z = x + y;
      NSLog(@"The value of z : %d \n", z);
    
      f = 70.0/3.0;
      NSLog(@"The value of f : %f \n", f);
    
      return 0;
    }

    </think>
    
    The same idea applies to function declarations, where we offer a func-
    tion name at the time of declaration, and its actual definition is provided 
    afterward. The following example uses a C function, and as we may know, 
    Objective-C also supports C style functions.
    
    // function-declaration
    int func();
    
    int main() {
       // function-call
       int k = func();
    }
    
    // function-definition
    int func() {
       return 0;
    }
    
    OBJECTIVE-C lvalues AND rvalues
    
    In Objective-C, there are two types of expressions.
    
    •  lvalue: Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" 
    expressions.  An  lvalue  can  be  on  either  the  left  or  right  side  of  an 
    assignment.
    
    •  rvalue: The word rvalue refers to a data value stored in memory at 
    some address. An rvalue is an expression that cannot be assigned a 
    value; therefore, it can occur on the right but not the left side of an 
    assignment.
    
    Variables are lvalues and can thus appear on the left side of an assign-
    ment.  Because  numerical  literals  are  rvalues,  they  cannot  be  allocated 
    and  cannot  appear  on  the  left-hand  side.  The  following  is  a  correct 
    statement:
    
    int k = 20;
    
    However, the following is not a legitimate statement and would result in 
    
    a compile-time error.

    CONSTANTS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    The constants denote values that the program cannot modify during its 
    execution. These values are also known as literals.
    
    Any  fundamental  data  type  may  include  integer  constants,  floating 
    constants, character constants, and string literals. Additionally, there are 
    enumeration constants.
    
    The constants are processed identically to regular variables, except their 
    
    values are not altered once they are defined.
    
    INTEGER LITERALS
    
    An integer literal may be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. The 
    base or radix is specified by a prefix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, 
    and nothing for decimal.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    A literal integer may also include a suffix consisting of U and L, which  
    stand for unsigned and long, respectively. Write the suffix with uppercase  
    or lowercase letters and in any sequence.
    
    The following are instances of integer literals:
    
    414         /* Legal */
    235u        /* Legal */
    0xFeeL      /* Legal */
    068         /* Illegal: 8 is not octal digit */
    032UU       /* Illegal: cannot repeat suffix */
    
    Other types of Integer literals are illustrated below.
    
    95         /* decimal */
    0215       /* octal */
    0x6b       /* hexadecimal */
    50         /* int */
    50u        /* unsigned int */
    50l        /* long */
    50ul       /* unsigned long */
    
    FLOATING-POINT LITERALS
    
    An integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part 
    comprise a floating-point literal. Floating-point literals can be represented 
    in either decimal or exponential form.
    
    When representing in decimal form, including the decimal point, expo-
    nent, or both; when representing in exponential form, include the integer 
    portion, fractional part, or both. e or E introduces the signed exponent.
    
      20    ◾    Objective-C
    
    The following are some instances of floating-point literal:
    
    3.14159       /* Legal */
    314159E-5L    /* Legal */
    510E          /* Illegal: the incomplete exponent */
    210f          /* Illegal: no-decimal or exponent */
    .e55          /* Illegal: missing integer or the 
    fraction */
    
    CHARACTER CONSTANTS
    
    Character literals, such as ‘x,' are contained in single quotes and may be 
    kept in a simple char variable.
    
    A character literal in Objective-C can be a simple character (for exam-
    ple, ‘x'), an escape sequence (for example, ‘\t'), or a universal character (for 
    example, ‘u02C0').
    
    Certain letters in C have unique significance when followed by a back-
    slash and signify things like newline (\n) or tab (\t). A list of some of these 
    escape sequence codes is as follows.

    STRING LITERALS
    
    Double  quotes  ""  are  used  to  surround  string  literals  or  constants. 
    Characters  in  a  string  are  comparable  to  character  literals  in  that  they 
    are plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters. We can 
    divide  an  extensive  line  into  numerous  lines  using  string  literals  and 
    whitespaces.
    
    Here are some string literal instances. The strings in all three variants 
    
    are identical.
    
    "hello, sweetie"
    
    "hello, \
    
    sweetie"
    
    "hello, " "s" "sweetie"
    
    CONSTANT DEFINITION
    
    In C, there are two straightforward ways to define constants.
    
    •  Using #define preprocessor
    
    •  Using const keyword
    
    #define Preprocessor
    
    The following is the syntax for using the #define preprocessor to declare a 
    constant:
    
    #define identifiervalue
    
    Example:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    #define LENGTH 10   
    #define WIDTH  5
    #define NEWLINE '\n'
    
    int main() {
       int area;
    
     
     
     
     
     
    
    22    ◾    Objective-C
    
       area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
       NSLog(@"The value of area : %d", area);
       NSLog(@"%c", NEWLINE);
       return 0;
    }
    
    const Keyword
    
    Constants of a specific type can be declared with the const prefix, as seen 
    below.
    
    const typevariable = value;
    
    Example:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    int main() {
       const int  LENGTH = 20;
       const int  WIDTH  = 15;
       const char NEWLINE = '\n';
       int area;

    An operator in Objective-C is a symbol that instructs the compiler to do particular mathematical or logical operations. The Objective-C language has several built-in operators, including the following:
    
    • Arithmetic Operators
    
    • Assignment Operators
    
    • Relational Operators
    
    • Bitwise Operators
    
    • Logical Operators
    
    • Misc Operators

    This session will walk us through arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and other operators.
    
    ARITHMETIC OPERATORS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    The table mentioned below lists all the arithmetic operators offered by the Objective-C programming language. Assume variable A has a value of 20, and variable B has a value of 30, then.
    
    Operator        Description
    
    +               Adds the two operands
    -               Subtracts the second operand from the first
    *               Multiplies both the operands
    /               Divides numerator by the denominator
    %               Modulus Operator and the remainder of after integer division
    ++             The increment operator increases the integer value by one
    −−             The decrement operator decreases the integer value by one
    
    Example
    
    C + D will give 30
    C − D will give −12
    C * D will give 100
    D / C will give 3
    D % C will give 0
    
    C++ will give 14
    
    C−− will give 7
    
    RELATIONAL OPERATORS
    
    The table below lists all the relational operations provided by the Objective-C programming language. Assume variable C has a value of 20 and variable D has a value of 30, then.
    
    Operator        Description
    
    ==              Compares the values of two operands; if they are equal, the condition becomes true.
    !=              Compares the values of two operands; if the values are not equal, the condition evaluates to true.
    >               If value of the left operand is larger than the value of the right operand, the condition is determined to be true.
    <               The condition is true if value of the left operand is smaller than the value of the right operand.
    >=              The condition is true if value of the left operand is larger than or equal to the value of the right operand.
    <=              The condition is true if value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand.
    
    Example

    (C == D) is not true.
    
    (C != D) is true.
    
    (C > D) is not true.
    
    (C < D) is true.

    LOGICAL OPERATORS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    The table mentioned below lists all of the logical operators provided by the 
    Objective-C programming language. Assuming variable C is 1 and vari-
    able D is 0, then.
    
    Operator Description
    
    &&
    
    ||
    
    !
    
    Defined as the Logical AND operator. If both operands 
    are non-zero, the condition is satisfied.
    Defined as the Logical OR Operator. If any of the two 
    operands are non-zero, the condition is satisfied.
    Defined as the Logical NOT Operator. In Objective-C to 
    reverse the logical state of its operand, use. When a 
    condition is true, the Logical NOT operator returns 
    false.
    
    Example
    
    (C && D) is false.
    
    (C || D) is true.
    
    !(C && D) is true.
    
    BITWISE OPERATORS

    C&D = 0000 1100
    C|D = 0011 1101
    C^D = 0011 0001
    ˜C = 1100 0011
    
    The bitwise operations provided by Objective-C are given in the table 
    below. Assume variable C has a value of 70 and variable D has a value of 
    23, then.

    Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
    If bit exists in both operands, the binary OR operator copies it.
    If bit is set in one operand but not both, the binary XOR operator replicates it.
    Binary Ones Complement Operator is a unary operator that 'flipping' bits.
    
    Left Shift Binary Operator: The left operand's value is shifted left by the number of bits given by the right operand.
    Right Shift Binary Operators: The value of the left operand is shifted right by the number of bits given by the right operand.
    
    (C & D) will give 12, which is 0000 1100
    (C | D) will give 61, which is 0011 1101
    (C ^ D) will give 49, which is 0011 0001

    C >> 2 will give 15, which is 0000 1111
    
    ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    
    The Objective-C language supports the following assignment operators:
    
    Operator Description
    
    Example
    
    =
    +=
    -
    =
    *
    =
    /
    =
    %
    =
    A simple assignment operator assigns the right operands' values to the left operand.
    It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the resulting value to the left operand.
    It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the resulting value to the left operand.
    Multiplication AND assignment, This operation multiplies the right operand by the left operand and assigns the product to the left operand.
    Divide AND assignment divide the left operand by the right operand and assign the resulting value to the left operand.
    AND assignment operator, modulus. It uses two operands to calculate the modulus and assigns the result to the left operand.
    
    Z = X + Y will assign value of X + Y into Z
    
    Z += X is equivalent to Z = Z + X
    
    Z -= X is equivalent to Z = Z – X
    
    Z *= X is equivalent to Z = Z * X
    
    Z /= X is equivalent to Z = Z / X
    
    Z %= X is equivalent to Z = Z % X

    sizeof(x), where a is an integer, will 
    return 4.
    &x; will give the actual address of the 
    variable.
    *x; will pointer to a variable.
    If the Condition is true ? Then value A : 
    Otherwise value B.
    
    OPERATORS' PRECEDENCE IN THE OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Operator precedence controls how words in an expression are grouped. 
    This influences the evaluation of an expression.
    
    Certain operators have greater precedence than others; for instance, the 
    multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator. 
    For example, c = 17 + 3 * 4; here, c is assigned 29, not 80, because operator 
    * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*4 and then 
    added into 12.
    
    Here, operators with the most significant precedence are positioned at 
    the top of the table, while those with the lowest precedence are positioned 
    at the bottom. Within an expression, operators with higher precedence 
    will be evaluated first.

    LOOPS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    There may be events when we need to execute a code block numerous times. 
    In general, statements are performed in the following order: the first state-
    ment in a function is executed first, then the second, and so on. Control 
    structures in programming languages allow for more sophisticated execu-
    tion routes. A loop statement allows us to run a statement or collection of 
    statements many times. The Objective-C programming language includes 
    the following loop types to address looping needs.

    while loop
    While a specific condition is true, a sentence or set of statements is repeated. 
    Before running the loop body, it checks the condition.
    for loop
    The code that maintains the loop variable is abbreviated when a series of 
    statements is executed many times.
    do...while loop
    It's similar to a while statement. Only it checks the condition after the loop body.
    nested loops
    A while, for, or do while loop can include one or more loops.
    
    CONTROL STATEMENTS FOR LOOPS
    
    Loop  control  statements  alter  the  execution  sequence.  All  automated 
    objects produced in that scope are deleted when execution exits that scope.
    Objective-C supports the following control statements. To learn more

    If condition never becomes false, loop becomes endless. Traditionally, the  
    for loop is used for this purpose. Because none of the three for loop expres-
    sions are necessary, we may create an infinite loop by leaving the condi-
    tional expression empty.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

       for( ; ; ) {

    It  is  believed  to  be  true  when  the  conditional  statement  is  miss-
    ing.  Although  we  may  use  an  initialization  and  increment  expression, 
    Objective-C programmers prefer to use them for(;;) construct to represent 
    an endless loop.
    
    DECISION MAKING IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    The programmer must define one or more conditions to be evaluated or 
    tested by the program, a statement or statements to be performed if the 
    condition is discovered to be true, and optionally, further statements to be 
    run if the condition is decided to be false.
    
    The general shape of a common decision-making framework in most 
    
    programming languages is shown below.
    
    Decision making in Objective-C.
    
    The Objective-C programming language treats any non-zero and non-
    
    null value as true, but any zero or null value is false.
    
    The  Objective-C  programming  language  has  the  following  decision-

    One if or else if statement can use inside another if or else if statement(s).
    switch statement
    A switch statement checks a variable for equality against a set of values.
    nested switch statements
    One switch statement can be used inside another switch statement(s).
    
    THE ? : OPERATOR
    
    We discussed the conditional operator?:, which may be used to replace if…
    else expressions. It takes the overall shape shown below.
    
    Exp1?  Exp2 : Exp3;
    
    Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Take note of the colon's 
    
    use and location.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    A? expression's value is decided as follows: Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true,  
    Exp2 is evaluated and the value of the entire? Expression is determined. If  
    Exp1 is false, Exp3 is evaluated, and its value becomes the expression's value.
    
    FUNCTIONS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    A function in Objective-C is a collection of statements that execute a par-
    ticular activity. Every Objective-C program has one C function, called 
    main(), and even the simplest applications may declare extra functions.
    
    We may break up your code into various functions. It is up to us how we 
    split our code across distinct functions, but logically, each function should 
    fulfil a particular task.
    
    A function declaration informs the compiler about the function's name, 
    return type, and arguments. The body of a function is specified by its definition.
    
    In Objective-C, the function is referred to as a method.
    The Objective-C base framework contains various built-in methods 
    that our application may call. For instance, the appendString() function 
    appends one string to another.
    
    A method is recognized by several names, including function, subrou-
    tine, process, etc.
    
    
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    31
    
    CREATING A METHOD
    
    The following is the general form of a method definition in the Objective-C 
    programming language:
    
    - (returntype) methodname:( argumentType1 )
    argumentName1 
    joiningArgument2:( argumentType2 )argumentName2 ....
    joiningArgumentn:( argumentTypen )argumentNamen {
       body of function
    }
    
    A method specification consists of a method header and a method body 
    in the Objective-C programming language. Here are all of the components 
    of a method:
    
    • Return type: In Objective-C a method may return a value as its 
    returntype. The function's data type of value is specified by return 
    type. Some methods carry out the necessary tasks but do not return 
    a value. The term void is used as the returntype in this scenario.
    
    • Method name: This is the method's actual name. The method signa-
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    •  Arguments: An argument functions similarly to a placeholder. When  
    we call a function, we pass an argument with a value. This value is  
    known  as  the  actual  parameter  or  argument.  A  method's  param-
    eter  list  specifies  the  type,  order,  and  the  number  of  parameters.  
    Arguments are optional; a method may not have any arguments.
    
    •  Joining argument: A joining argument makes it easier to read and  
    
    more explicit while invoking it.
    
    •  Method body: The method body comprises statements that describe  
    
    what the method performs.
    
    Example: The following is the source code for the max() method. This 
    function  accepts  two  parameters,  numb1  and  numb2,  and  returns  the 
    greater of the two:
    
    /* function returning max between two numbers */
    - (int) max:(int) numb1 secondNumber:(int) numb2 {
    
       
    32    ◾    Objective-C
    
        /* the local variable declaration */
        int result;
    
        if (numb1 > numb2) {
           result = numb1;
        } else {
           result = numb2;
        }
    
        return result; 
     }
    
    DECLARATIONS OF METHOD
    
    A method declaration gives the compiler the function's name and how to 
    invoke it. The function's actual body in Objective-C method can be speci-
    fied independently.
    
    A  method  declaration  in  Objective-C  consists  of  the  following 
    
    components:
    
    - (returntype) functionname:( argumentType1 )
    argumentName1 
    joiningArgument2:( argumentType2 )argumentName2 ....
    joiningArgumentn:( argumentTypen )argumentNamen;
    
    The method declaration for the above-described function max() is as 
    
    follows:
    
    -(int) max:(int)numb1 andNum2:(int)numb2;
    
    When defining a method in one source file and calling it in another, 
    method declaration is necessary. In this scenario, the function should be 
    declared at the start of the file invoking the function.
    
    CALLING A METHOD
    
    When creating an Objective-C method, we define what the function must 
    accomplish. We must invoke that function to complete the specified oper-
    ation to utilize a method.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    When a program invokes a function, program control is passed to the
    invoked method. A called method performs a stated task and returns
    
      
      
      
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    33
    
    program control to the main program when its return statement or func-
    tion-ending closing brace is reached.
    
    To call a method, simply give the needed arguments along with the 
    method name, and if the method returns a result, we may save it. As an 
    example,
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface SampleClass:NSObject
    /* method-declaration */
    - (int)max:(int)numb1 andNumb2:(int)numb2;

    @implementation SampleClass
    
    /* method returning max between two numbers */
    - (int)max:(int)numb1 andNumb2:(int)numb2 {
    
       /* the local variable declaration */
       int result;
    
       if (numb1 > numb2) {
          result = numb1;
       } else {
          result = numb2;
       }
    
       return result; 
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main () {
    
       /* the local variable definition */
       int x = 200;
       int y = 100;
       int ret;
    
       SampleClass *sampleClass = [[SampleClass alloc]
    init];
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
       
       
     
    
    34    ◾    Objective-C

    FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
    
    If a function accepts arguments, it must define variables that accept the 
    arguments' values in Objective-C. In Objective-C, these variables are 
    known as the function's formal parameters.
    
    The formal parameters operate similarly to other local variables within 
    
    the function, generated upon entrance and removed upon departure.
    
    There are two methods for passing arguments to a function when call-
    
    ing it.

    Call by value  
    This method replicates the real value of an argument into the function's formal parameter. Changes to the parameter within the function do not affect the argument in this case.  
    Call by reference  
    This method inserts an argument's address into the formal parameter. The address is utilized within the function to obtain the actual parameter used in the call. This signifies that changes to the parameter affect the argument.  
    
    To pass arguments, Objective-C employs call by value by default. In general, this implies that code within a function cannot change the arguments used to call the function, and the preceding example is utilized the same way when using the max() function.  
    
    BLOCKS IN OBJECTIVE-C  
    
    An Objective-C class is a type of object that combines data with associated functionality. It is sometimes more appropriate to express a single job or unit of action rather than the collection of methods.  
    
    The addition of blocks to C, Objective-C, and C++ has made it possible to create separate chunks of code that can be handed to methods and functions like values. Add blocks to collections like NSArray or NSDictionary as they are Objective-C objects. They are comparable to closures or lambdas in other programming languages since they may also catch values from the surrounding scope.

    ARRAYS IN OBJECTIVE-C
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The array data structure in the Objective-C programming language may  
    hold a fixed-size sequential collection of the elements of the same type. A  
    collection of data is stored in an array, although it is generally more con-  
    venient to conceive an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
    
    Instead of defining individual variables like number0, number1,…, and 
    number99, we define one array variable like numbers and use numbers[0], 
    numbers[1,…,  and  numbers[99]  to  represent  individual  variables.  An 
    index is used to access a specific element in an array.
    
    All arrays are made up of contiguous memory locations. The first ele-  
    ment refers to the lowest address, while the last element corresponds to the 
    highest address.
    
    Array in Objective-C.
    
    DECLARING ARRAYS
    
    In Objective-C, a programmer defines an array by describing the kind of 
    elements and the quantity of elements needed by the array as follows:
    
    type array_Name [ array_Size ];
    
     
     
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    39
    
    This is referred to as a single-dimensional array. The arraySize constant 
    must be bigger than zero, and the type can be any acceptable Objective-C 
    data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array of type double named 
    balance, use the following statement:
    
    double balance[20];
    
    Balance  is  now  a  variable  array  that  can  store  upto  ten  double 
    
    numbers.
    
    ARRAYS INITIALIZATION
    
    In Objective-C, we may initialize an array one by one or with a single line, 
    as seen below.
    
    double balance[5] = {2000.0, 3.0, 4.4, 19.0, 56.0};
    
    The number of values between the braces { } cannot exceed the number 
    of items declared for the array between the square brackets [ ]. The follow-  
    ing is an example of assigning a single array element.
    
    If the array size is not specified, an array only large enough to accom-  
    modate the initialization is generated. As a result, if we write:
    
    double balance[] = {2000.0, 3.0, 4.4, 19.0, 56.0};
    
    We will construct the same array as in the previous example.
    
    balance[4] = 56.0;
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The preceding statement assigns a value of 56.0 to the array's fifth member. Because all arrays have 0 as the index of their first element, also known as the base index, the array with the fourth index will be the fifth, that is, the last element.
    
    ACCESSING ARRAY ELEMENTS
    
    The array name is indexed to find an element. This is accomplished by following the array name with the element's index enclosed in square brackets. As an example,
    
    double salary = balance[8];
    
    
    40    ◾    Objective-C
    
    The above code will choose the 9th member from the array and assign its value to the salary variable. The following is an example that employs all three concepts mentioned earlier: declaration, assignment, and array access.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main () {
       int nm[ 10 ];   /* nm is an array of 10 integers */
       int x,y;
    
       /* initialize elements of array nm to 0 */         
       for ( x = 0; x < 10; x++ ) {
          nm[ x ] = x + 100;    /* set element at location 
    x to x + 100 */
       }
    
       /* output each array element's value */
       for (y = 0; y < 10; y++ ) {
          NSLog(@"The Element[%d] = %d\n", y, nm[y] );
       }
    
       return 0;
    }

    POINTERS IN OBJECTIVE-C
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Objective-C pointers are simple and enjoyable to learn. Some Objective-C  
    programming  tasks  are  easier  to  accomplish  with  pointers,  while  oth-
    ers,  such  as  dynamic  memory  allocation,  cannot  be  performed  without 
    them.  As  a  result,  learning  pointers  are  required  to  become  a  proficient 
    Objective-C  programmers.  Let  us  begin  by  studying  them  in  small  and 
    easy steps.
    
    As you may know, each variable is a memory location. Each mem-
    ory location has an address in Objective-C that can be accessed using 
    the ampersand (&) operator, representing a memory address. Consider 
    the  following  example,  which  prints  the  addresses  of  the  variables 
    specified.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main () {
       int  var1;
       char var2[10];
    
       NSLog(@"The Address of var1 variable is: %x\n", 
    &var1 );
       NSLog(@"The Address of var2 variable is: %x\n", 
    &var2 );
    
       return 0;
    }
    
    WHAT EXACTLY ARE POINTERS IN OBJECTIVE-C?
    
    A  pointer  in  Objective-C  is  a  variable  whose  value  is  the  address  of 
    another variable, i.e., the memory location's direct address. Like any vari-
    able or constant, a pointer must be declared before using them to hold any 
    variable address. A pointer variable declaration has the following general 
    form:
    
    type *var_name;
    
    In  Objective-C  the  pointer's  base  type  is  type,  which  must  be  a  valid 
    Objective-C data type, and the pointer variable's name is var_name. The 
    asterisk * in Objective-C is used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk 
    
     
     
     
    42    ◾    Objective-C
    
    used for multiplication. In this case, though, the asterisk indicates a vari-
    able as a pointer. The valid pointer declarations are as follows:
    
    int    *ip;    /* pointer to integer */
    double *dp;    /* pointer to double */
    float  *fp;    /* pointer to float */
    char   *ch     /* pointer to character */
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The true data type of all pointer values, whether integer, float, character  
    or otherwise, is a lengthy hexadecimal number representing a memory  
    location. The sole distinction between pointers of various data types is the  
    data type of the variable or constant pointed to by the pointer.
    
    How Do Pointers Work?
    
    There are just a handful of significant actions that we will do regularly  
    using pointers. (a) we create a pointer variable, (b) we assign the address of  
    a variable to a pointer, and (c) we ultimately access the value at the address  
    accessible via the pointer variable. This is accomplished using the unary  
    operator *, which returns the variable's value at the location given by its  
    argument. The following illustration employs these operations:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main () {
       int var = 30;    /* actual variable-declaration */
       int *ip;         /* pointer variable-declaration */
    
       ip = &var;       /* store address of var in the 
    pointer variable*/
    
       NSLog(@"Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );
    
       /* address stored in the pointer variable */
       NSLog(@"Address stored in the ip variable: %x\n", 
    ip );
    
       /* access value using the pointer */
       NSLog(@"The Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );
    
       return 0;
    }

    OBJECTIVE-C NULL POINTERS
    
    In Objective-C, it is usually a good idea to assign a NULL value to a 
    pointer variable if the allocated address is unknown. This is done during 
    variable declaration. A null pointer is a pointer in Objective-C that has 
    been assigned the value NULL.
    
    The NULL pointer in Objective-C is a zero-valued constant declared in 
    
    numerous standard libraries. Take a look at the following program:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main () {
       int *ptr = NULL;
       NSLog(@"Value of the ptr is : %x\n", ptr  );
       return 0;
    }

    Here is the corrected text with all formatting errors fixed:
    
    ---
    
    and executed in Objective-C:
    
    Value of ptr is: 0
    
    Most operating systems prohibit applications from accessing memory at address 0 because the operating system reserves that memory. However, memory address 0 is significant since it indicates that the pointer is not meant to point to an accessible memory region. However, if a pointer has the null (zero) value, it is presumed to point to nothing.
    
    To check for a null pointer, use the following if statement:
    
    if(ptr)     /* succeeds if x is not null */
    if(!ptr)    /* succeeds if x is null */

    **STRUCTURES IN OBJECTIVE-C**
    
    Arrays in Objective-C enable us to construct types of variables that may store many data items of the same kind. Still, the structure is another user-defined data type accessible in Objective-C programming that allows us to mix data items of various types.
    
    Structures are used to represent data. Assume we wish to keep track of your library books. We might wish to keep note of the following characteristics of each book:
    
    • Title
    • Author
    • Subject
    • Book ID
    
    ```
     
    ``` 
    
    **CREATING A STRUCTURE**
    
    The `struct` statement is required to define a structure. The `struct` statement creates a new data type for our code with more than one member. The `struct` statement format is illustrated below.
    
    ```c
    struct [structure tag] {
        member-definition;
        member-definition;
        ...
        Member-definition;
    } [one or more structure variables];
    ```
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The structure tag is optional in Objective-C, and each member definition is a standard variable definition, such as int i; float f; or any other acceptable variable definition. Although this is optional, we can declare one or more structure variables after the structure's definition, before the final semicolon. This is how we would declare the Book structure.
    
    struct Books {
        NSString *title;
        NSString *authors;
        NSString *subjects;
        int   bookid;
     } book;  
    
    ACCESS TO STRUCTURE MEMBERS
    
    The member access operator is used to gain access to any structure member ( . ). The member access operator in Objective-C is represented by a period between the name of the structure variable and the name of the structure member that we want to access. To define variables of the structure type, we would use the struct keyword. The example below demonstrates how to use structure.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    struct Books {
       NSString *title;
       NSString *authors;
       NSString *subjects;
       int   bookid;
    };

       struct Books Book2;        /* Declare Book2 of the 
    type Book */
    
       /* book1 specification */
       Book1.title = @"Objective-C Programming";
       Book1.authors = @"Luka Mli"; 
       Book1.subjects = @" Tutorial of Objective-C 
    Programming";
       Book1.bookid = 4387307;
    
       /* book2 specification */
       Book2.title = @"Telecom Billing";
       Book2.authors = @"Sara Ali";
       Book2.subjects = @" Tutorial of Telecom Billing";
       Book2.bookid = 9875701;
    
       /* print Book1 info */
       NSLog(@"Book 1 title : %@\n", Book1.title);
       NSLog(@"Book 1 authors : %@\n", Book1.authors);

    FUNCTION ARGUMENTS AS STRUCTURES
    
    A structure can be sent as a function parameter as any other variable or 
    pointer can. We would access structural variables in the same way we did 
    in the preceding example.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    As seen below, we may define pointers to structures in the same way that  
    define pointers to any other variable.
    
    struct Books *struct-pointer;
    
    The address of a structural variable can now be stored in the above-  
    described pointer variable in Objective-C. In Objective-C to find the  
    address of a structure variable, use the & operator before the structure's  
    name, as shown below.
    
    Struct-pointer = &Book1;
    
    To access the structure members from a pointer to that structure, use 
    
    the -> operator as shown below.
    
    Struct-pointer->title;
    
    Let us rewrite the above example using a structure pointer; perhaps,

    BIT FIELDS
    
    Bit Fields allow data to be packed into a structure. This is especially helpful 
    when memory or data storage is limited.
    
    Packing several objects into a machine word, such as, 1 bit flags can be 
    
    compacted.
    
    External  file  formats  can  be  read  in  if  they  are  not  standard.  As  an 
    
    example, consider 9-bit integers.
    
    We may achieve this in an Objective-C structure declaration by putting: 
    
    bit length after the variable. As an example,
    
    struct packed_struct {
        unsigned int f1:1;
        unsigned int f2:1;
        unsigned int f3:1;
        unsigned int f4:1;
        unsigned int type:4;
        unsigned int my_int:9;
     } pack;
    
    The packed_struct, in this case, has six members: Four 1-bit flags f1..f3, 
    
    a4 bit type, and a 9-bit my_int
    
    The bit mentioned above fields are automatically packed as compactly 
    as  feasible  by  Objective-C,  provided  the  field's  maximum  length  is  less 
    than or equal to the computer's integer word length. If this is not the case, 
    specific compilers may allow for field memory overlap, while others may 
    store the next field in the following word.
    
    PREPROCESSORS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    The  Objective-C  Preprocessor  is  a  distinct  step  in  the  compilation  pro-
    cess, not part of the compiler. An Objective-C Preprocessor is just a text 
    replacement tool that informs the compiler to perform the necessary pre-
    processing before actual compilation. The Objective-C Preprocessor will 
    be referred to as the OCPP.
    
    A pound sign (#) precedes all preprocessor commands. It must be the 
    first non-blank character, and a preprocessor directive should begin in the 
    first column for readability. The section that follows lists all of the key pre-
    processor directives.

    #include

    #ifdef
    If this macro is defined, it returns true.
    #ifndef
    If this macro is not defined, it returns true.
    #if
    Checks if a compile-time condition is true.
    #else
    Alternative for #if

    Else if, an #if in the one statement.

    Issues special commands to the compiler using standardized method.
    
    EXAMPLES OF PREPROCESSORS
    
    Examine the samples below to understand various directives better.
    
    #define MAXARRAY_LENGTH 22
    
    This directive instructs the OCPP to replace MAXARRAY_LENGTH 
    instances with 20. To improve readability, use #define for constants.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    #include "myheader.h"
    
    These directives instruct the OCPP to retrieve foundation.h from the 
    Foundation Framework and insert it into the current source file. The next 
    line instructs OCPP to retrieve myheader.h from the local location and 
    insert it into the current source file.
    
    #undef FILE_SIZE
    #define FILE_SIZE 41
    
    This instructs the OCPP to undefine the current FILE_SIZE to 41.
    
    #ifndef MESSAGE
       #define MESSAGE "We wish"
    #endif
    
    This instructs the OCPP to define MESSAGE only if it has not already 
    been defined.
    
    #ifdef DEBUG
    /* Our debugging statements here.. */
    #endif
    
    If DEBUG is defined, this instructs the OCPP to process the statements 
    contained. This is essential if the -DDEBUG option is passed to the gcc 
    compiler during compilation. This defines DEBUG, allowing us to toggle 
    debugging on and off during compilation.

    OPERATORS OF PREPROCESSORS
    
    To  assist  us  in  constructing  macros,  the  Objective-C  preprocessor  pro-
    vides the following operators.
    
    Macro Continuation (\)
    
    A macro must typically be confined to a single line. Use the macro con-
    tinuation operator in Objective-C to continue a macro that is too long for 
    a single line. As an example,
    
    #define  message_for(x, y)  \
       NSLog(@#x " and " #y ": We miss you\n")
    
    Stringize (#)
    
    The  stringize  or  number-sign  operator  ("#")  transforms  a  macro  argu-
    ment into a string constant when used within a macro definition. Use this 
    operator in a macro with a predefined argument or parameter list. As an 
    example,
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    #define  message_for(x, y)  \
       NSLog(@#x " and " #y ": We miss you\n")
    
    int main(void) {
       message_for(Carole, Debra);
       return 0;
    }
    
    Token Pasting (##)
    
    The token-pasting operator (##) joins two parameters within a macro dec-
    laration. It enables the joining of two different tokens in the macro specifi-
    cation into a single token. As an example,
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
       
     
     
     
    
    56    ◾    Objective-C
    
    #define tokenpaster(n) NSLog (@"token" #n " = %d", 
    token##n)
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text with all formatting errors fixed:
    
    ```c
    int main(void) {
       int token24 = 60;
    
       tokenpaster(24);
       return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    **defined() Operator**
    
    The preprocessor defined operator is used in the constant expressions to verify if an identifier is defined using #define. The value is true if the provided identifier is defined (non-zero). The value is false if the symbol is not specified (zero). The following is the definition of the defined operator:
    
    ```c
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    #if !defined(MESSAGE)
       #define MESSAGE "We wish"
    #endif
    
    int main(void) {
       NSLog(@"Here message is: %s\n", MESSAGE);  
       return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    **PARAMETERIZED MACROS**
    
    Simulating functions using parameterized macros is one of OCPP's most powerful features. For example, we may have the following code to square a number:
    
    ```c
    int square(int a) {
        return a * a;
    }
    ```
    
    We may modify the preceding code using a macro as follows:
    
    ```c
    #define square(a) ((a) * (a))
    ```
    
    Before using them, macros with parameters must be specified with the #define directive. The parameter list enclosed by parentheses must come immediately after the macro name. Spaces are not permitted between the macro name and the open parenthesis. As an example,
    
    ```c
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    #define MAX(x,y) ((x) > (y)?  (x) : (y))
    
    int main(void) {
       NSLog(@"The Max between 30 and 20 is %d\n", MAX(20, 
    30));  
       return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    **Typedef in Objective-C**
    
    The Objective-C programming language includes a typedef keyword used to rename a type. Below mentioned is an example of how to define the term BYTE for one-byte numbers:
    
    ```c
    typedef unsigned char BYTE;
    ```
    
    Following this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for instance:
    
    ```c
    BYTE by1, by2;
    ```
    
    Uppercase letters are used by convention for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is only a symbolic abbreviation. However, lowercase letters can also be used, as seen below.
    
    ```c
    typedef unsigned char byte;
    ```
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    We may also use typedef to assign a name to a user-defined data type.  
    For example, we may use typedef with the structure to build a new data  
    type  and  then  use  that  data  type  to  declare  structure  variables,  as  seen 
    below explicitly.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    typedef struct Books {
       NSString *title;
       NSString *authors;
    
     
     
     
    58    ◾    Objective-C
    
       NSString *subjects;
       int bookid;
    } Book;
    
    int main() {
       Book book;
       book.title = @"Objective-C Programming";
       book.authors = @"TutorialsPoint";
       book.subjects = @"Programming-tutorial";
       book.bookid = 200;
    
       NSLog( @"Book title : %@\n", book.title);
       NSLog( @"Book authors : %@\n", book.authors);
       NSLog( @"Book subjects : %@\n", book.subjects);
       NSLog( @"Book Id : %d\n", book.bookid);
    
       return 0;
    }
    
    typedef vs #define
    
    The  #define  directive  is  an  Objective-C  directive  that  is  used  to  declare 
    aliases  for  various  data  types,  similar  to  typedef  but  with  the  following 
    differences:
    
    Typedef can only give symbolic names to types, but #define may also be 
    
    used to define aliases for values, such as 1 as ONE, etc.
    
    The compiler interprets typedef declarations, whereas the pre-processor 
    
    processes #define statements.
    
    The following is the most basic use of #define.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    #define TRUE  1
    #define FALSE 0
    
    int main( ) {
       NSLog( @"The Value of TRUE : %d\n", TRUE);
       NSLog( @"the Value of FALSE : %d\n", FALSE);
    
       return 0;
    }

    TYPE CASTING IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Type casting is a method of converting a variable from one data type to 
    another. For example, if we want to convert a long number to a basic inte-
    ger, we may use the type cast long to int. As seen below, we may explicitly 
    use the cast operator to change values from one type to another.

    In Objective-C, we often use `CGFloat` for floating-point operations, derived from the fundamental type of `float` in 32-bit cases and `double` in 64-bit cases. Consider the following example, in which the cast operator divides one integer variable by another in a floating-point operation:
    
    ```objc
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main() {
       int sum = 27, count = 15;
       CGFloat mean;
    
       mean = (CGFloat) sum / count;
       NSLog(@"The Value of mean : %f\n", mean );
    
       return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    Note that the cast operator takes precedence over the division operator. Thus, the sum value is first changed to type `double` before being divided by count, returning a `double` value.
    
    Type conversions can be implicit (done automatically by the compiler) or explicit (expressed explicitly using the cast operator). When type conversions are required, it is considered good programming practice to utilize the cast operator.
    
    INTEGER PROMOTION
    
    Integer promotion is when values of the integer type "smaller" than `int` or `unsigned int` are upgraded to `int` or `unsigned int`. Consider adding a character to an `int`.
    
    ```objc
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main() {
    
       int x = 27;
       char c = 'c';  
       int sum;
    
       sum = x + c;
       NSLog(@"The Value of sum : %d\n", sum );
    
       return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    USUAL ARITHMETIC CONVERSION
    
    The usual arithmetic conversions are done implicitly to cast their values in a common type. If operands continue to be of various types, the compiler converts them to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy.
    
    Usual arithmetic conversions.
    
    The assignment operators and the logical operators `&&` and `||` do not undergo the standard arithmetic conversions. To further comprehend the concept, consider the following example.
    
    ```objc
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main() {
       int x = 27;
       char c = 'c';  
       CGFloat sum;
    
       sum = x + c;
       NSLog(@"The Value of sum : %f\n", sum );
       return 0;
    }
    ```

    LOG HANDLING IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    In this section, we will describe log handling and provide appropriate examples.
    
    NSLog METHOD
    
    We utilize the NSLog function in the Objective-C programming language to print logs, which we first used in the Hello World example.
    
    Consider a simple code that prints the words "Hello Everyone."
    
    DISABLING LOGS IN THE LIVE Apps
    
    Because we utilize NSLogs in our application, it will be written in device logs, which is not good in a live build. As a result, we employ a type definition for printing logs, as illustrated below.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    #if DEBUG == 0
    #define DebugLog(...)
    #elif DEBUG == 1
    #define DebugLog(...) NSLog(__VA_ARGS__)
    #endif
    
    int main() {
       DebugLog(@"Debug log, our custom addition gets \
       printed during the debug only" );
       NSLog(@"The NSLog gets printed always" );     
       return 0;
    }

    ERROR HANDLING IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Error handling in Objective-C programming is handled via the Foundation 
    framework's NSError class.
    
    An NSError object has more detailed and extensible error information 
    than an error code or error text. An NSError object has three fundamental attributes: an error domain (expressed by a string), a domain-specific error code, and a user info dictionary providing application-specific information.
    
    NSError
    
    NSError objects are used in Objective-C programs to provide information about runtime faults that users should be aware of. Typically, a program will display this error information in a dialog or sheet. However, it may interpret data and either request that the user attempt to recover from the error or seek to repair the issue on its own.
    
    The NSError Object consists of:
    
    • Domain: The error domain must not be nil and can be one of the preset NSError domains or an arbitrary string specifying a new domain.
    
    • Code: The error code.
    
    • User Info: The error's userInfo dictionary, which may be null.
    
    The example below demonstrates how to generate a custom error.

    COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
    ```
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    When your Objective-C programs are executed, we can provide specific  
    values  from  the  command  line  to  them.  These  data  are  known  as  com-  
    mand-line arguments, and they are frequently helpful for your program,  
    particularly  when  we  want  to  control  our  program  from  outside  rather  
    than hard-coding those values inside the code.
    
    The command-line arguments are handled using the main() function  
    parameters, where argc is the number of arguments supplied, and argv[] is  
    a pointer array pointing to each argument passed to the program. The fol-  
    lowing is a simple example that checks for command-line arguments and  
    takes appropriate action.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
       if( argc == 3 ) {
          NSLog(@"Argument supplied is %s\n", argv[1]);
       } else if( argc > 3 ) {
          NSLog(@"supplied too many arguments.\n");
       } else {
          NSLog(@"One argument expected.\n");
       }
    }
    
    When the preceding code is built and performed with a single param-  
    eter, say "testing," the outcome is as follows:
    
    The argument supplied is testing.
    
     
    
    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    65
    
    The following result is obtained when the below code is built and per-  
    formed with two parameters, say testing1 and testing2.
    
    Supplied too many arguments.
    The  following  result  is  obtained  when  the  code  is  built  and  executed 
    
    without any arguments.
    
    One argument is expected.
    
    It should be noted that argv[0] contains the program's name, argv[1] is  
    a reference to the first command-line parameter provided, and *argv[n] is  
    the last argument. If no arguments are given, argc is set to one; otherwise,  
    argc is set at 3 if one argument is supplied.
    
    A space separates all command line parameters. However, if the argu-  
    ment contains a space, you can pass it by enclosing it in double quotes "" or  
    single quotes ‘'. Let us rewrite the above example, this time printing the pro-  
    gram name and passing a command-line parameter inside double quotes:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
       NSLog(@"Program name is %s\n", argv[0]);
    
       if( argc == 3 ) {
          NSLog(@"Argument supplied is %s\n", argv[1]);
       } else if( argc > 3 ) {
          NSLog(@"supplied too many arguments.\n");
       } else {
          NSLog(@"One argument expected.\n");
       }
    
       return 0;
    }

    OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

    As humans, we are constantly confronted with data and perceptions that we must interpret. We must separate the underlying structure from the surface features and identify the critical relationships at work. Abstractions explain causes and consequences, uncover patterns and frameworks, and distinguish between what is and is not relevant. Object orientation offers an abstraction of the data on which you work; moreover, it gives a tangible grouping between the data and the operations performed on the data – giving the data behavior.
    
    OPERATIONS AND DATA
    
    Data and actions on data have typically been separated in programming languages. Except when operations affect it, data is static and immutable.

    68    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Procedures and functions that act on data don't have a permanent state of their own; they're solely helpful for affecting data.
    
    This separation is, of course, based on how computers operate, so it's not something you can lightly dismiss. It provides the backdrop against which we labor, just as the differences between matter and energy and nouns and verbs do. All programmers, even object-oriented programmers, must specify the data structures that their programs will utilize and the functions that will operate on the data at some point.
    
    This is all there is to it in a procedural programming language like C. The language may provide multiple forms of data and function organization, but it will not divide the world. The fundamental parts of the design are functions and data structures.
    
    Object-oriented programming restructures the world at a higher level rather than disputing it. It divides processes and data into objects, then combined into organized networks to produce a complete program. Objects and object interactions are the fundamental design components of an object-oriented programming language.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Every object contains state (data) and behavior (operations on data).  
    They are similar to conventional physical things in this regard. A  
    mechanical item, such as a pocket watch or a piano, may effortlessly  
    embody state and behavior. But practically everything intended to do a  
    task does. Even basic objects with no moving elements, such as a bottle,  
    integrate state (the amount of liquid in the bottle, whether it is open, and  
    how warm the contents are) with behavior (the ability to dispense its  
    contents at various flow rates, to be opened or closed, to withstand high  
    or low temperatures).
    
    The force and attractiveness of items come from their similarity to  
    actual things. They can not only represent real-world components, but  
    they can also perform specified tasks as software components.
    
    IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERFACE
    
    We must be able to grasp abstractions and express them in program design  
    to create programs. A programming language's role is to assist us in accom-
    lishing this. The language should make it easier to innovate and design  
    by allowing you to represent abstractions that reveal how things function.  
    It should allow us to concretize our thoughts in the code we write. Surface  
    details should not obscure your program's architecture.
    
    All programming languages have tools for expressing abstractions.  
    In essence, these devices are methods of collecting implementation  
    details, concealing them, and providing them with a common interface,  
    in the same way, that a mechanical item separates its interface from its  
    implementation.
    
    Structures and functions are the primary abstraction units of the C lan-
    guage. Both conceal implementation components in various ways:
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the text with formatting errors fixed and all content extracted verbatim:
    
    C structures aggregate data pieces into bigger units that may be treated  
    as separate entities on the data side. While some programs must dive into  
    the structure and alter the fields individually, most programs may treat it  
    as a single entity, not a collection of components but the sum of those ele-
    ments. Because one structure may include others, a complex information 
    arrangement can be constructed from simpler levels.
    
    In modern C, a structure's fields have their own namespace, so their 
    names won't clash with similarly named data objects outside the struc-
    ture. Keeping implementation details out of the interface requires parti-
    tioning the program namespace. Consider the tremendous challenge of 
    giving each item of data in an extensive program a unique name while also 
    ensuring that new names do not clash with existing ones.
    
    Functions encapsulate activities that are used frequently without hav-
    ing to be re-implemented in the procedural world. Like data items local to 
    a function, fields inside a structure are protected under their namespace. 
    Complex actions are created from simpler elements because functions can 
    reference (call) other functions.
    
    Functions are reused. They are called any number of times after being 
    defined without thinking about the implementation again. The most often 
    used functions may be grouped into libraries and utilized across vari-
    ous applications. The function interface is all required of the user, not the 
    source code.
    
    Functions, unlike data components, are not divided into different 
    namespaces. Every function must have its own name. While the function 
    itself is reusable, the name is not.
    
    Although C structures and functions may express large abstractions, 
    they maintain the separation between data and data operations. The most 
    outstanding levels of abstraction in a procedural programming language 
    nevertheless reside on one side or the other of the data-versus-operations 
    split. The way the computer operates is always reflected in the applications 
    you create.
    
    Object-oriented programming languages don't give up any benefits of 
    structures and functions; instead, they add a higher-level abstraction unit 
    that conceals the interaction between a function and its data.

    Assume you have a collection of functions that interact with a specific  
    data structure. You want to make those functions easy to use by removing  
    the structure from the interface as much as feasible. So you add a couple  
    more functions to help handle the data. The functions are responsible for  
    allocating memory for the data structure, initializing it, retrieving infor-  
    mation from it, changing values inside it, keeping it up to date, and clear-  
    ing its memory. All the users of Objective-C have to do is call the functions  
    and provide them with the structure.
    
    The structure has become an opaque token due to these modifications,  
    and other programmers will never need to see inside. They may focus on  
    the functions rather than the data organization. You've started the process  
    of making an item.
    
    The next step is to implement this concept in a programming language  
    and entirely conceal the data structure so that it is not required to be pro-  
    vided between functions. All that is exposed to consumers is a functional  
    interface; the data becomes an internal implementation detail. Users may  
    conceive of objects based on their behavior since they encapsulate (hide)  
    their data.
    
    The interface to the functions has been much simplified due to this  
    stage. Callers aren't required to understand how they work (what data they  
    use). This may now be classified as an item.
    
    All functions that have access to the secret data structure are grouped.  
    As a result, an object is more than a collection of random functions; it's  
    a collection of connected behaviors backed by common data. To utilize  
    an object's function, we must first build the object (give it its internal  
    data structure) and then tell it the function it should execute. You start  
    thinking about the object's overall function rather than the individual  
    functions.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Learning object-oriented programming is all about moving from thinking about functions and data structures to thinking about object behaviors. It may seem strange at first, but as you acquire expertise with object-oriented programming, we'll discover that it's a more natural way of thinking. Lists, containers, tables, controllers, and even managers are all analogous to real-world objects in programming. Using programming objects as an example simply expands the comparison naturally.
    
    The types of abstractions that a programming language allows us to encode may be used to evaluate it. Extraneous issues should not distract us, nor should we be obliged to explain ourselves using a language that does not correspond to the reality we're attempting to depict.
    
    OOP in Objective-C ◾ 71
    
    If, for example, you must constantly attend to the business of matching the correct data with the correct method, you are compelled to be aware of the complete program at a low level of implementation at all times. While we may still create programs with a high degree of abstraction, the transition from concept to implementation can be challenging and increasingly tricky as programs become more complex.
    
    Object-oriented programming languages provide us with a more extensive vocabulary and a richer model to work in by giving a greater degree of abstraction.
    
    THE OBJECT MODEL
    
    The object-oriented programming insight is to integrate state and behavior data and data operations into a high-level unit, an object, and provide language support. A collection of related functions and a data structure that fulfils those functions form an object. The functions in Objective-C are known as the object's methods, and the data structure's fields are known as its instance variables.
    
    Model of object.
    
    If we've ever worked on a challenging programming problem, our design certainly incorporated sets of functions that work on a specific type of data implicit "objects" without language support.
    
    Object-oriented programming makes these function groups clear and allows us to think about the group rather than its components. The only

    way to access an object's data, and hence the only interface, is via its  
    methods.
    
    When both state and behavior are combined in a single thing, it 
    becomes more than either alone; the whole is greater than the sum of its 
    parts. An object is a self-contained "subprogram" having authority over a 
    specific functional area. It can function as a full-fledged modular compo-
    nent inside a bigger program design.
    
    For example, if we were to create software that simulated residential 
    water usage, we might create objects to represent the various components 
    of the water-delivery system. One example is a Faucet object, which has 
    methods for starting and stopping the water flow, adjusting the flow rate, 
    returning the quantity of water consumed in a specific period, and so on. 
    A Faucet object would require instance variables to track whether the tap 
    is open or closed, how much water is being used, and where the water is 
    coming from to perform this function.
    
    A programmatic Faucet object can be wiser than a real one (it's like a 
    mechanical faucet with many gauges and instruments). But, like any other 
    system component, a genuine faucet has both state and behavior. We'll 
    need programming units, like objects, which mix state and behavior, to 
    represent a system successfully.
    
    A program comprises a network of linked items that work together to 
    solve a puzzle piece (as illustrated in the below image). Each object has a 
    defined function in the program's general architecture and may connect 
    with other objects. Objects interact through messages, which are requests 
    for methods to be performed.
    
    Network in objects.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The network's objects will not be identical. In addition to Faucet objects, a program that replicates water use may include Pipe objects that carry water to the Faucet and Valve objects that control the flow between pipes. There may be a Building object to coordinate a system of pipes, valves, and faucets, some Appliance objects that can switch valves on and off (equivalent to dishwashers, toilets, and washing machines), and perhaps some User objects to operate the appliances and faucets. When a Building object in Objective-C is asked how much water is being utilized, it may request information from each Faucet and Valve object. When a user turns on an appliance, it must first turn on a valve to get the water it needs.
    
    THE METAPHOR OF MESSAGING
    
    Each programming paradigm has its own set of terms and metaphors. The vocabulary of object-oriented programming encourages you to consider what happens in a program from a unique viewpoint.
    
    There's a temptation, for example, to consider things to be actors with human-like motivations and capacities. It's tempting to speak about an object determining what to do in a scenario, requesting information from other objects, introspecting to get the required information, transferring responsibilities to another object, or managing a process.
    
    This metaphor requires you to conceive objects as executing their methods rather than functions or methods doing the job, as you would in a procedural programming language. Objects are the agents of the program's action rather than passive receptacles for state and behavior.
    
    This metaphor is quite helpful. An object is similar to an actor in specific ways: it has a specific job to perform in the program's overall design. Within that role, it may work somewhat independently of the other components. It interacts with other things as they perform their functions, yet it is self-contained and may operate independently. It can't deviate from the script, just like a performer onstage, yet the part it performs might be diverse and intricate.

    Objects as actors mesh well with the primary metaphor of object-oriented programming, which is that objects interact through messages. Instead of executing a method like a function, we send a message to an object and ask it to do one of its methods.
    
    This metaphor leads to a beneficial way of thinking about methods and objects; however, it takes some getting accustomed to it. It isolates procedures from the specific data they operate on and instead focuses on
    
    74    ◾    Objective-C
    
    behavior. A start method, for example, in an object-oriented programming interface, may start an operation, an archive method, and a draw method, for example, might output an image. The method name does not tell which action is started, which information is saved, or which picture is drawn. These procedures may be performed differently by distinct objects.
    
    Methods are, therefore, a vocabulary of abstract activities. To make one of those behaviors concrete, you must associate the method with an object. This is accomplished by designating the object as the message's recipient. The process that is started, the data archived, and the rendered picture are all determined by the item you choose as the recipient.
    
    Methods are called via a specific receiver since they are objects (the owner of the method and the data structure the method will act on). The same procedure might be implemented differently by different receivers. As a result, various receivers might respond to the same message differently. A message's outcome can't be determined just based on the message or method name; it additionally relies on the object that receives the message.
    
    The messaging metaphor nicely captures the concept that actions may be abstracted from their specific implementations by separating the message (the requested behavior) from the receiver (the owner of a method that can react to the request).

    Objective-C offers considerable support for designing object-oriented iOS iPad apps. However, the field of object-oriented programming is vast. It is not hyperbole to say that whole volumes have been written on the subject. As a result, a comprehensive review of object-oriented software development is outside the scope of this book. Instead, we will present the fundamental notions of object-oriented programming before describing the concept as it applies to Objective-C application development. Again, while we aim to offer the essential knowledge you need in this chapter, if we are inexperienced with Objective-C programming, we recommend reading a copy of Objective-C 2.0 Essentials.
    
    The main goal of the Objective-C programming language is to add object orientation to the C programming language, and classes, also known as user-defined types, are the central feature of Objective-C that support object-oriented programming.
    
    A class is used to specify an object's form, and it combines data representation and data manipulation methods into a single package. Members of a class are the data and methods contained within it.

    CHARACTERISTIC OF OBJECTIVE-C
    
    •  @interface and @implementation are the two sections that define the 
    
    class.
    
    •  Almost everything takes the shape of an object.
    
    •  Objects  are  often  referred  to  as  receivers  because  they  receive 
    
    messages.
    
    •  Instance variables are found in objects.
    
    •  Scope exists in objects and instance variables.
    
    •  Classes hide the implementation of an object.
    
    •  Properties  are  used  to  give  other  classes  access  to  class  instance 
    
    variables.
    
    DEFINITIONS OF OBJECTIVE-C CLASSES
    
    We create a blueprint for a data type when you create a class. This doesn't 
    define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, 
    what a class object will be made up of and what operations are performed 
    on it.

    The @interface keyword is followed by the interface(class) name and the  
    class body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces. All classes in Objective-C are  
    derived from the base class NSObject. All Objective-C classes are derived  
    from it. It includes basic memory allocation and initialization methods.  
    For  example,  using  the  keyword  class,  we  defined  the  Box  data  type  as 
    follows:
    
    @interface Box:NSObject {
       //Instance-variables
       double length;    // box Length 
       double breadth;   // box Breadth 
    }
    @property(nonatomic, readwrite) double height;  // 
    Property
    
    @end
    
     
    76    ◾    Objective-C
    
    ALLOCATING AND INITIALIZING OBJECTIVE-C OBJECTS
    
    A class supplies the blueprints for objects; hence an object is formed from 
    a class. We define objects of a class in the same way as we declare variables 
    of fundamental kinds. The statements that follow declare two Box objects.
    
    Box box1 = [[Box alloc]init];     // Create the box1 
    object of the type Box
    Box box2 = [[Box alloc]init];     // Create the box2 
    object of the type Box
    
    ACCESSING DATA MEMBERS
    
    The direct member access operator is used to access the properties of class 
    objects (.). To illustrate, consider the following example:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface Box:NSObject {
       double length;    // box Length
       double breadth;   // box Breadth
       double height;    // box Height
    }
    
    @property(nonatomic, readwrite) double height;  // 
    Property
    -(double) volume;
    @end
    
    @implementation Box
    
    @synthesize height; 
    
    -(id)init {
       self = [super init];
       length = 2.0;
       breadth = 2.0;
       return self;
    }
    
    -(double) volume {
       return length*breadth*height;
    }

       Box *box1 = [[Box alloc]init];    // Create the 
    box1 object of the type Box
       Box *box2 = [[Box alloc]init];    // Create the

    }
    
    Properties
    
    • In Objective-C, properties ensure that a class's instance variable is 
    accessed from outside the class.
    
    • The following are the various parts of the property declaration.
    
    • @property is a keyword that starts properties.
    
    • It's followed by access specifiers such as nonatomic, atomic, read-
    write, and readonly, strong, unsafe unretained, and weak. This dif-
    fers depending on the variable's type. We can use unsafe unretained, 
    
     
         
       
      
    78    ◾    Objective-C
    
    strong, or weak for any pointer type. We may also use readwrite or 
    readonly for other types.
    
    • The variable's datatype follows this.
    
    • A semicolon finally concludes the property name.
    
    • In the implementation class, we can add a synthesize statement. 
    However, in the most recent version of XCode, the program handles 
    the synthesis, and the synthesize statement is no longer required.
    
    The only way to access the class's instance variables is through the proper-
    ties. For the properties, getter and setter methods are built internally.
    
    For example, consider the property @property (nonatomic, readonly) 
    BOOL isDone. Setters and getters have been constructed under the hood, 
    as illustrated below.
    
    -(void)setIsDone:(BOOL)isDone;
    -(BOOL)isDone;

    A module in Objective-C is nothing more than a file containing source code to a C programmer. A practical technique to divide a vast (or even not-so-large) program into manageable bits is to break it down into separate files. Each item may be worked on and compiled separately and then connected after the program is completed.
    
    Using the static storage class designator to restrict the scope of names to the files where they are declared improves source module independence. This kind of module is a file system-defined unit. It's a container for source code rather than a logical language unit. Each coder decides what gets inside the container. We don't have to use them to group logically similar pieces of the code. We may put your socks in one drawer, underwear in another, and so on, or you can use another organization system or jumble everything up.
    
    Object-oriented programming languages allow us to utilize file containers for your source code, but they also have a logical module called class definitions. As you would anticipate, each class is often specified in its source file. Logical modules are paired with container modules.
    
    In Objective-C, for example, the component of the Valve class that interacts with Pipe objects may be defined in the same file as the Pipe class, resulting in a container module for Pipe-related code and the Valve class being divided into several files. No matter how many files the source code was in, the Valve class definition would still work as a modular unit inside the program's construction. It would still be a logical module.
    
    Under "Processes of Abstraction," the mechanisms that make class definitions logical components of the language are addressed in depth.
    
    Reusability
    
    In Objective-C one of the main goals of object-oriented programming is to make the code you create as reusable as possible – to have it serve many various scenarios and applications – so that you don't have to re-implement something that has previously been done even if just slightly differently.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The following elements impact reusability: how stable and bug-free the code is; how clear the documentation is; how simple and easy the programming interface is; how efficiently the code accomplishes its job; and how complete the feature set is.
    
    These considerations aren't limited to the object model. They are used to determine the reusability of any code, including standard C functions and class declarations. Functions that are efficient and well-documented, for example, are more reusable than those that are undocumented and unreliable.
    
    Nonetheless, a broad comparison reveals that class definitions favor reusable code in ways that functions do not. There are many ways to make functions more reusable, such as giving data as arguments rather than assuming particular global variables. Despite this, only a tiny portion of functions is extended beyond the purposes they were developed. In at least three ways, their reusability is constrained by design:
    
    • The names of functions are global; each function must have its own name (except for those declared static). This naming restriction makes it difficult to depend extensively on library code when developing a complicated system. The programming interface would be difficult to grasp and so large that significant generalizations would be challenging to express.
    
    In contrast, classes may share programming interfaces. When the same naming conventions are used repeatedly, a large amount of functionality is packed into a compact, easy-to-understand interface.
    
    • One by one, functions are chosen from a library. It is up to programmers to choose the specific functions they need.
    
    • On the other hand, objects are functional bundles rather than individual methods and instance variables. Users of an object-oriented library in Objective-C won't get bogged down putting together their answers to a problem since they offer integrated services.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    • Functions are usually linked to unique data structures created for a given application. Data and function interaction is an inevitable aspect of the interface. Only those who agree to utilize the same data structures as the function's arguments will find it beneficial.
    
    An object does not have this difficulty since it conceals its data. One of the main reasons classes is reused more readily than functions is this.
    
    An object's data is secured and will not be accessed by any other portion of the program. As a result, methods may rely on their reliability. They can be confident that data has not become irrational or unusable due to external access. Consequently, a data structure supplied to an object is more reliable than one passed to a function, and methods may rely on it more. As a result, reusable methods are easy to develop.
    
    A class may also be re-implemented to utilize a new data structure without altering its interface since an object's data is concealed. All applications that utilize the class may update to the new version without reprogramming; no source code changes are necessary.
    
    INHERITANCE IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Starting with something familiar is the most straightforward approach to communicating something unfamiliar. If we're describing a schooner, it helps if our audiences are familiar with sailboats. Suppose we're explaining how a harpsichord works. In that case, it's helpful if we can presume our audience has seen a piano inside or heard a guitar played, or at the very least is acquainted with the concept of a musical instrument.
    
    The same is true if we want to describe a new kind of object; starting from the definition of an existing object simplifies the description.

    In object-oriented programming, inheritance is one of the most important concepts. Inheritance in Objective-C allows us to define a class in terms of another class, making application development and maintenance easier. This also allows for the reuse of code functionality and a quick implementation time.
    
    Instead of developing entirely new data members and member functions when creating a class, the programmer can specify that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. The old class is the base class, while the new class is the derived class.
    
    The concept of inheritance establishes a connection – for instance, mammal IS-A animal, dog IS-A mammal, dog IS-A animal, etc.

    BASE AND DERIVED CLASSES
    
    Objective-C only supports multilevel inheritance, which means that it may have just one base class but supports multilevel inheritance. All Objective-C classes are derived from the superclass NSObject.
    
    @interface derivedclass: baseclass
    
    Consider the following for a base class Person and its derived class Employee:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface Person : NSObject {
       NSString *personName;
       NSInteger personAge;
    }
    
    - (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age;
    - (void)print;

    @implementation Person
    
    - (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age {
       personName = name;
       personAge = age;
    
       return self;

       NSLog(@"The Name is: %@", personName);
       NSLog(@"The Age is: %ld", personAge);

    ACCESS THE CONTROL AND INHERITANCE
    
    If a derived class is defined in the interface class, it can access all of its base 
    class's private members, but it cannot access those defined in the implementation 
    file.
    
    The different access kinds are summarized in the following fashion based on who has access to them.
    
    With the exceptions indicated below, a derived class inherits all base class methods and variables.
    
    • Variables declared with the help of extensions in the implementation file are not accessible.
    
    • Methods declared with the help of extensions in the implementation file are not accessible.
    
    • The derived class method is run if the inherited class implements the base class method.
    
    Hierarchies of Class
    
    Any class in Objective-C can be used as a superclass for defining a new 
    class. A class can be a subclass of another class and a superclass for its subclasses. As a result, any number of classes can be linked in a hierarchy of inheritance, as shown in Figure.

Only how the subclass varies from the superclass is specified in the subclass specification; everything else is assumed to be the same.
    
    Definitions of Subclass
    
    A subclass may update the definition it inherits from its superclass in three ways.
    
    It may add additional methods and instance variables to the class definition it inherits. The most typical motivation for creating a subclass is to solve a problem. Subclasses always add additional methods and instance variables if the methods demand it.
    
    Replacing an existing method in Objective-C with a new one might change the behavior it inherits. This is accomplished by simply creating a new method with the same name as an inherited one. The new version takes precedence over the previous one. (The inherited method remains valid for the class that defined it and any classes that inherit it.)
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    It may improve or expand the behavior it inherits by replacing an existing method with a new one, but it keeps the old one by integrating it into the new one. In the body of the new method, a subclass sends a message to execute the old version. Each class in an inheritance chain may influence the behavior of a method in some way. Class D, for example, may override a method specified in class C and integrate C's version, while C's version incorporates a version declared in the root class, as shown in Figure.
    
    Subclasses tend to round out the definition of a superclass, making it more particular and specialized. Instead of subtracting code, they add and occasionally change it. It's worth noting that methods and instance variables can't be deleted or overridden in most cases.

    DYNAMISM
    
    The issue of how much memory a program will take was once resolved when the source code was built and linked. As soon as the program begins, it is given the entire RAM it would ever need. This memory could not be expanded or contracted.
    
    In hindsight, it's clear that this was a significant constraint. It restricted how programs are built and what a program could perform. It limited not just the programming approach but also the design. The development of methods like malloc, which dynamically allocates memory while a program runs, opened up previously unimaginable possibilities.
    
    Compile-time and link-time limitations are restrictive because they require decisions based on information discovered in the programmer's source code rather than information gained from the user as the program runs.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Although dynamic memory allocation eliminates one such limitation,  
    many others remain, just as restrictive as static memory allocation. For  
    example, at build time, the parts that make up an application must be  
    matched to data types. And an application's bounds are usually specified  
    at link time. The whole program contains inside a single executable file.  
    New modules and types are not addable while the application is running.  
    The goal of Objective-C is to get beyond these limits and make pro-  
    grams as dynamic and fluid as possible. It moves most decision-making  
    efforts from build and link time to runtime. The idea lets programmers  
    determine what happens rather than artificially limiting their activities by  
    language demands and compiler and linker requirements.
    
    For object-oriented design, three types of dynamism are essential:
    
    • Dynamic typing involves waiting until runtime to determine an  
    object's class.
    
    • Dynamic binding involves determining which method to invoke at  
    runtime.
    
    • Dynamic loading involves adding new components to a program as  
    it runs.
    
    POLYMORPHISM IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Polymorphism is the ability of different things to react to identical signals  
    uniquely.
    
    86    ◾    Objective-C
    
    The fact that each class has its own namespace leads to polymorphism.  
    The names assigned inside a class definition are not incompatible with  
    names given elsewhere. This is true for both instance variables in an  
    object's data structure and its methods.
    
    An object's instance variables, like the fields of a C structure, are in  
    a protected namespace, as are method names. Method names, unlike C  
    function names, are not global symbols. A method name in one class can-  
    not clash with the names of methods in other classes; two classes with  
    completely distinct names may implement identically named methods.
  - |-

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text, with all formatting errors fixed:
    
    ---
    
    The interface of an object includes method names. When a message instructs an object to complete a task, the message specifies the method the object should use. Because several objects might have methods with the same name, a message's meaning is understood concerning the object that receives it. The same message might trigger two different methods when delivered to two different objects.
    
    Polymorphism's key advantage is that it simplifies the programming interface. It enables the establishment of conventions that are reused from class to class. Rather than establishing a new name for each new function, you add to a program. We may reuse existing names. Separate from the classes that implement them, the programming interface may be defined as a collection of abstract behaviors.
    
    Polymorphism is defined as having several forms. Polymorphism often happens when a hierarchy of classes is connected via inheritance.
    
    Because of Objective-C polymorphism, a call to a member function will run a different code depending on the kind of object that invokes the function.
    
    Consider the following scenario: we have a class Shape that offers the fundamental interface for all forms. The shape is the foundation class from which squares and rectangles are formed.
    
    We have the function printArea, which will display information about the OOP feature polymorphism.

    In the above example, depending on the availability of the methods `calculateArea` and `printArea`, either the method from the base class or the method from the derived class was performed.
    
    Polymorphism manages method switching between the base and derived classes based on their method implementations.

    **DATA ENCAPSULATION IN OBJECTIVE-C**
    
    We must be able to leave implementation details behind and conceptualize in terms of units that organize those elements under a standard interface to design successfully at any degree of abstraction. The barrier between interface and implementation must be absolute for a programming unit to be genuinely effective. The implementation must be encapsulated in the interface, hiding it from other portions of the program. Encapsulation shields an implementation against unintended consequences and unauthorized access.

    A function in C is explicitly encapsulated; its implementation is unavail-
    able to other portions of the program and shielded from activities outside 
    the function's body. Method implementations are similarly enclosed in 
    Objective-C, but an object's instance variables are more significant. They're 
    concealed inside the thing yet visible from the outside. Information hiding 
    is another term for the encapsulation of instance variables.
    
    At first glance, concealing information in instance variables may limit 
    our programming flexibility. It provides you with greater leeway to act and 
    frees us from restrictions that we may otherwise face. If any component 
    of an object's implementation leaks out and becomes accessible or a con-
    cern to other program sections, it ties the implementer's and users' hands. 
    Neither could make changes without consulting the other first.
    
    We're interested in the Faucet object built for a program that mimics 
    water usage and wants to utilize it in another program we're building. Once 
    we've agreed on the object's interface, we won't have to worry about others 
    working on it, fixing issues, and finding better implementation methods. 
    These enhancements help us, but none of them change what we do in our 
    program. Nothing they do can damage our code since we rely entirely on the 
    interface. The implementation of the object is isolated from our software.
    
    Furthermore, although individuals developing the Faucet object may be 
    curious about how we use it and want to make sure it fits our requirements, 
    they aren't concerned with how we write our code. Nothing we do will 
    affect the object's implementation or restrict its ability to make modifica-
    tions in future versions. The implementation is protected from whatever 
    other object users or we could do.
    
    The following two key features are included in all Objective-C programs.
    Methods are the parts of a program that perform actions, and they have 
    termed program statements (code).
    
    Program data is the information about the program that is influenced 
    by its functions.
    
    Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming concept that con-
    nects data and the functions that handle it, keeping them safe from outside 
    influence and misuse. The crucial OOP notion of data hiding was initially 
    developed from data encapsulation.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    90    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Data encapsulation and data abstraction are two mechanisms for bun-
    ding data and its functions. Data encapsulation exposes only the inter-
    faces while hiding the implementation details from the user.
    
    By constructing user-defined kinds or classes, Objective-C enables the 
    
    properties of encapsulation and data hiding. For instance,
    
    @interface Adder : NSObject {
       NSInteger total;
    }       
    - (id)initWithInitialNumber:(NSInteger)initialNumber;
    - (void)addNumber:(NSInteger)newNumber;
    - (NSInteger)getTotal;
    
    @end
    
    Total is a private variable that we can't access from outside the class. This 
    means that they can only be accessible by other Adder class members and 
    not by the other part of our program. This is one method of encapsulation.
    
    Methods in the interface file are public in scope and accessible.
    
    EXAMPLE OF DATA ENCAPSULATION
    
    Data encapsulation and data abstraction may be seen in any Objective-C 
    program  that  implements  a  class  with  public  and  private  member  vari-
    ables. Consider the following situation:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface Adder : NSObject {
       NSInteger total;
    }
    
    - (id)initWithInitialNumber:(NSInteger)initialNumber;
    - (void)addNumber:(NSInteger)newNumber;
    - (NSInteger)getTotal;
    
    @end
    
    @implementation Adder
    -(id)initWithInitialNumber:(NSInteger)initialNumber {
       total = initialNumber;
    
     
     
    
     
     
     
     
    
    OOP in Objective-C    ◾    91
    
       return self;
    }
    
    - (void)addNumber:(NSInteger)newNumber {
       total = total + newNumber;
    }
    
    - (NSInteger)getTotal {
       return total;
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
       NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool 
    alloc] init];        
       Adder *adder = [[Adder alloc]
    initWithInitialNumber:10];
       [adder addNumber:5];
       [adder addNumber:4];
    
       NSLog(@"Total is %ld",[adder getTotal]);
       [pool drain];
       return 0;
    }
    
    The total of the numbers in the above class is returned. The public mem-
    bers addNum and getTotal are class's external interfaces, and a user must 
    be familiar with them to utilize them. The private member total is hidden 
    from the outside world, but it is required for the class to function correctly.
    
    CREATING A STRATEGY
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Most of us have come to the realization that unless we have a compelling  
    reason, we should make class members private by default. That is an amaz-
    ing encapsulation.
    
    Data encapsulation is crucial because it is one of the critical aspects of all 
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages, including Objective-C.
    
    CATEGORIES IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    We might want to extend an existing class by adding behavior that is only 
    useful  in  specific  circumstances.  Objective-C  provides  categories  and 
    extensions for adding such extensions to existing classes.
    
     
     
     
     
       
    92    ◾    Objective-C
    
    The simplest way to add a method to an existing class, perhaps to add 
    functionality to make something easier to do in your application, is to use 
    a category.
    
    The  @interface  keyword  in  Objective-C  is  used  to  declare  a  category, 
    just as it is in a standard Objective-C class description, but it does not indi-
    cate any inheritance from a subclass. Instead, it uses parentheses to specify 
    the category name, such as this:
    
    @interface Class_Name (Category_Name)
    
    @end
    
    CATEGORY CHARACTERISTICS
    
    Even  if  we  don't  have  the  original  implementation  source  code,  we  can 
    establish a category for any class in Objective-C.
    
    Any methods declared in a category in Objective-C will be available to 
    
    all instances of the original class and any subclasses.
    
    There is no difference between a category-added method and one imple-
    
    mented by the original class at runtime.
    
    Let's have a look at an example of a category implementation. Let's give 
    the Cocoa class NSString a category. This category will allow us to add a 
    new method called getCopyRightString to return the copyright string. It 
    is displayed below.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface NSString(MyAdditions)
    +(NSString *)getCopyRightString;
    @end
    
    @implementation NSString(MyAdditions)
    
    +(NSString *)getCopyRightString {
       return @"Copyright Point.com 2022";
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
       NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool 
    alloc] init];
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
    93
    
       NSString *copyrightString = [NSString 
    getCopyRightString];
       NSLog(@"Accessing Category: %@",copyrightString);

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the provided text:
    
    ```objc
    [pool drain];
    return 0;
    }
    
    Even though any methods introduced by a category are available to all
    class instances and subclasses, we must import the category header file in
    any source code file where we want to utilize the new methods. Otherwise,
    you may encounter compiler warnings and failures.
    
    Because we have a single class in our example, we haven't included any
    header files; in this situation, we need to include the header files mentioned
    above.
    
    POSING IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Before discussing Posing in Objective-C, it's important to note that posing
    was declared deprecated in Mac OS X 10.5 and is no longer accessible for
    use. Those who are unconcerned about the deprecated methods can there-
    fore skip this chapter.
    
    A class in Objective-C can completely replace another class in a pro-
    gram. It is argued that the replacing class "poses as" the target class.
    Instead, the posing class receives all messages sent to the target class in
    versions that allow posing.
    
    As shown above, the poseAsClass method in NSObject allows us to
    replace the existing class.
    
    POSING RESTRICTIONS
    
    • Only one of a class's direct or indirect superclasses is used.
    
    • No new instance variables are defined in the posing class not present
    in the target class (though it may define or override methods).
    
    • Before the posing, the target class may not have received any messages.
    
    • A posing class can use super to call overridden methods, integrating
    the target class's implementation.
    
    • A posing class in Objective-C can override methods defined in
    categories.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface MyString : NSString
    
    @end
    
    @implementation MyString
    
    - (NSString *)stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:(NSString *)target
    withString:(NSString *)replacement {
       NSLog(@"Target string: %@", target);
       NSLog(@"Replacement string: %@", replacement);
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main() {
       NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
       [MyString poseAsClass:[NSString class]];
       NSString *string = @"Test";
       [string stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"a" withString:@"c"];
       [pool drain];
       return 0;

    EXTENSIONS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    A class extension in Objective-C is similar to a category, except it can only 
    be applied to a class for which the source code is available at compile time 
    (the class is compiled simultaneously).
    
    We can't declare a class extension on a framework class, such as a Cocoa 
    or Cocoa Touch class like NSString since the methods declared by a class 
    extension are implemented in the implementation block for the original 
    class.
    
    Extensions are simply categories that don't have a name. It's also known 
    
    as "anonymous categories."
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
       
    OOP in Objective-C    ◾    95
    
    @interface keyword is used to declare an extension, precisely like it is 
    in a regular Objective-C class description, but it does not show any inheri-
    tance from a subclass. Instead, as illustrated below, it just adds parenthesis.
    
    @interface ClassName ()
    
    @end
    
    EXTENSIONS' CHARACTERISTICS
    
    •  An extension is only declared for classes for which we know the orig-
    
    inal source code implementation.
    
    •  A class extension adds private methods and variables only available 
    
    to that class.
    
    •  Even  the  inherited  classes  cannot  access  any  methods  or  variables 
    
    declared inside the extensions.
    
    Example of Extensions
    
    Let's make a class called Sample_Class with an extension. Let's have a pri-
    vate variable internalID in the extension.
    
    Then, after processing the internalID, create a method called getExter-
    
    nalID that returns the externalID.
    
    The following example will not work with an online compiler.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface Sample_Class : NSObject {
       NSString *name;
    }
    
    - (void)setInternalID;
    - (NSString *)getExternalID;
    
    @end
    
    @interface Sample_Class() {
       NSString *internalID;
    }
    
    @end
     
     
     
     
     
     
    96    ◾    Objective-C
    
    @implementation Sample_Class
    
    - (void)setInternalID {
       internalID = [NSString stringWithFormat: 
       @"UNIQUEINTERNALKEY%dUNIQUEINTERNALKEY",arc4random()%100];
    }
    
    - (NSString *)getExternalID {
       return [internalID 
    stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: 
       @"UNIQUEINTERNALKEY" withString:@""];
    }
    
    @end
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ```objective-c
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
        Sample_Class *sample_Class = [[Sample_Class alloc] init];
        [sample_Class setInternalID];
        NSLog(@"ExternalID: %@", [sample_Class getExternalID]);
        [pool drain];
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    The internal ID is not returned explicitly in the preceding case. We delete the `UNIQUEINTERNALKEY` and simply make the remaining value available to the `getExternalID` function.
    
    The above example only employs a string operation, but it may include numerous features such as encryption and decryption.
    
    PROTOCOLS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Objective-C allows us to design protocols that specify the techniques utilized in a specific context. Protocols are implemented in protocol-conforming classes.
    
    A network URL handling class, for example, will have a protocol containing methods such as the `processCompleted` delegate method, which informs the caller class once the network URL fetching operation is complete.
    
    ```objective-c
    @protocol ProtocolName
    @required
    // list of the required methods
    @optional
    // list of the optional methods
    @end
    ```
    
    The methods with the keyword `@required` are implemented in the classes that adhere to the protocol, whereas the methods with the keyword `@optional` are optional.
    Here is the syntax:
    
    ```objective-c
    @interface MyClass : NSObject <MyProtocol>
    .....
    @end
    ```
    
    This implies that any instance of `MyClass` will react not just to the methods stated directly in the interface but also to the methods needed in `MyProtocol`. There is no need to redeclare the protocol methods in the class interface; simply implementing the protocol suffices.
    
    If you want a class to use several protocols, describe them as a comma-separated list. We have a delegate object that retains the reference to the protocol-implementing calling object.

    - (void) setDelegate:(id)newDelegate;
    @end
    
    @implementation PrintClass
    - (void)printDetails {
        NSLog(@"Printing Details");
        [delegate processCompleted];
    }
    
    - (void) setDelegate:(id)newDelegate {
        delegate = newDelegate;
    }
    @end
    
    @interface Sample_Class : NSObject<PrintProtocolDelegate>
    - (void)startAction;
    
    @end
    
    @implementation Sample_Class
    - (void)startAction {
        PrintClass *printClass = [[PrintClass alloc] init];
        [printClass setDelegate:self];
        [printClass printDetails];
    }
    
    - (void)processCompleted {
        NSLog(@"The Printing Process Completed");
    }
    @end
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
        Sample_Class *sampleClass = [[Sample_Class alloc] init];
        [sampleClass startAction];
        [pool drain];
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
    We saw how the delegate methods are called and performed in the preceding example. It begins with `startAction`, and after the process is finished, the delegate method `processCompleted` is called to notify the action is finished.
    
    We shall never have a program developed without a delegate in any iOS or Mac app. As a result, we must understand how delegates are used. To minimize memory leaks, delegate objects should utilize the `unsafe_unretained` property type.

    **DYNAMIC BINDING IN OBJECTIVE-C**
    
    Dynamic binding decides which method to call at runtime rather than compile time. Late binding is another term for dynamic binding. All methods in Objective-C are dynamically resolved at runtime. Both methods namely the selector and the receiving object decide the specific code run.
    
    Polymorphism is enabled through dynamic binding. Consider the following set of objects: Rectangle and Square. A `printArea` method is implemented differently for each object.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The exact code that should be performed by the expression [anObject printArea] is decided at runtime in the following code snippet. The runtime system uses selector for the method run to find the proper method in whatever class anObject turns out to be.
    
    Let's look at some basic code that demonstrates dynamic binding.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface Square:NSObject {
       float area;
    }
    
    - (void)calculateAreaOfSide:(CGFloat)side;
    - (void)printArea;
    @end
    
    @implementation Square
    - (void)calculateAreaOfSide:(CGFloat)side {
       area = side * side;
    }
    
    - (void)printArea {
       NSLog(@"The Area of square is %f",area);
    }
    
    @end
    
    @interface Rectangle:NSObject {
       float area;
    }
    
    - (void)calculateAreaOfLength:(CGFloat)length 
    andBreadth:(CGFloat)breadth;
    - (void)printArea;
    @end
    
    @implementation Rectangle
    
    - (void)calculateAreaOfLength:(CGFloat)length 
    andBreadth:(CGFloat)breadth {
       area = length * breadth;
    }
    
    - (void)printArea {
       NSLog(@"The Area of Rectangle is %f",area);
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main() {
       Square *square = [[Square alloc]init];
       [square calculateAreaOfSide:20.0];
    
       Rectangle *rectangle = [[Rectangle alloc]init];
       [rectangle calculateAreaOfLength:20.0 
    andBreadth:15.0];
    
       NSArray *shapes = [[NSArray alloc]initWithObjects: 
    square, rectangle,nil];
       id obj1 = [shapes objectAtIndex:0];
       [obj1 printArea];
    
       id obj2 = [shapes objectAtIndex:1];
       [obj2 printArea];
    
       return 0;
    }
    
    As shown in the above example, the printArea method is dynamically determined during runtime. It is an example of dynamic binding and can be beneficial in various circumstances involving similar types of objects.
    
    COMPOSITE OBJECTS IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    We may construct a subclass within a class cluster that creates a class that contains an object. These composite items are class objects. So we're probably wondering what a class cluster involves. So, initially, let's define a class cluster.

    **CLASS CLUSTERS**
    
    The foundation framework makes considerable use of class clusters as a design pattern. A collection of private concrete subclasses is grouped under a class cluster's public abstract superclass. This collection of classes simplifies an object-oriented framework's publicly visible design without decreasing its functional richness. The abstract factory design pattern in Objective-C is used to create class clusters.
    
    Instead of developing many classes for comparable tasks, we construct a single class that will handle everything depending on the input value.
    
    In NSNumber, for example, there are several clusters of classes such as char, int, bool, and so on. We combine them all into a single class that handles all of the related actions in one place. The value of these basic types is wrapped into objects by NSNumber.
    
    **WHAT EXACTLY IS A COMPOSITE OBJECT?**
    
    We build a composite object by embedding a private cluster object in an object of our design. This composite object in Objective-C can rely on the cluster object for basic functionality, intercepting messages that it wishes to handle in a certain way. This approach decreases the amount of code we must build and allows us to use the Foundation Framework's proven functionality.
    
    Composite object.
    
    **102    ◾    Objective-C**
    
    The composite object in Objective-C must declare itself to be a subclass of the cluster's abstract superclass. It must override the primitive methods of the superclass as a subclass. It can also override derived methods, although this isn't required because the derived methods make their way via the primitive ones in Objective-C.
    
    The count method of NSArray class is an example; the implementation of a method overridden by the intervening object might be as basic as
    
    - (unsigned)count {
       return [embedded_Object count];
    }
    
    **An Example of a Composite Object**
    
    Kindly see the example from the Apple documentation provided below to see a comprehensive example.

    In the above example, adding null objects to the validating array's one 
    function would result in a crash in a typical circumstance. However, our val-
    idating array handles it. Similarly, each method in the validating array adds 
    validating procedures in addition to the standard sequence of operations.
    
    FOUNDATION FRAMEWORK IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    The specifics of the Foundation framework may be found in Apple docu-
    mentation, as shown below.
    
    The Foundation framework defines a fundamental layer of Objective-C 
    classes. It includes various paradigms that specify functionality not cov-
    ered by the Objective-C language and gives a collection of helpful basic 
    object types. The Foundation structure provides these objectives.
    
    •  Provide a minimal selection of fundamental utility classes.
    
    •  Introduce standard protocols for things like de-allocation to make 
    
    software development more straightforward.

    •  Unicode strings, object persistence, and object dissemination are all 
    
    supported.
    
    •  To improve portability, provide some OS independence.
    
    The  framework  was  created  by  NeXTStep,  which  Apple  later  bought, 
    and the foundation classes are included in Mac OS X and iOS. It bears the 
    class prefix "NS" since NeXTStep created it.
    
    All of our example applications have utilized Foundation Framework. 
    
    Foundation Framework is practically a need.
    
    To  import  an  Objective-C  class,  we  usually  use  #import  Foundation/
    NSString.h>,  but  it's  all  done  in  #import  Foundation/Foundation.h>  to 
    prevent importing too many classes.
    
    All objects, including the foundation kit classes, are based on NSObject. 
    It includes memory management techniques. It also has a basic runtime 
    system interface and the ability to act like Objective-C objects. It is the 
    root of all classes and has no base classes.

    Data storage
    NSArray, NSDictionary, and NSSet provide storage for the Objective-C objects 
    of any type.
    Text and strings
    The NSCharacterSet class represents multiple character groups utilized by the 
    NSString and NSScanner classes. Text strings are represented by the NSString 
    classes, including methods for finding, combining, and comparing texts. An 
    NSScanner object scans numbers and words from an NSString object.
    Dates and times
    The NSDate, NSTimeZone, and NSCalendar classes hold and represent time 
    and date information. They provide ways for determining date and time 
    variations. They provide methods for displaying the dates and times in a 
    variety of formats and altering times and dates based on location throughout 
    the world, in collaboration with NSLocale.
    Exception handling
    Exception handling is used to deal with unforeseen occurrences, and it is 
    available in Objective-C via NSException.
    File handling
    The class NSFileManager is used to manage files.
    URL loading system
    A collection of classes and protocols allows users to access standard Internet 
    protocols.

    FAST ENUMERATION IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Fast  enumeration  is  a  feature  of  Objective-C  that  aids  in  enumerating 
    through a collection. So, to understand quick enumeration, we must first 
    understand the collection covered in the following part.
    
    COLLECTIONS IN THE OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Collections are basic constructs. Its function is to hold and handle other 
    items. The fundamental objective of a collection is to provide a standard 
    mechanism to store and retrieve things effectively.
    
    There are several sorts of collections. While they all provide the same 
    function  of  being  able  to  contain  other  items,  they  primarily  differ  in 
    how objects are retrieved. The most often used collections in Objective-C 
    are:
    
    •  NSArray
    
    •  NSSet
    
    •  NSMutableSet
    
    •  NSDictionary
    
    •  NSMutableDictionary
    
    •  NSMutableArray
    
    The syntax for fast enumeration
    
    for (class_Type variable in collection_Object ) { 
       statements 
     }
    
    Here's an example of a quick enumeration
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main() {
       NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool 
    alloc] init];
       NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc]
       initWithObjects:@"string1", 
    @"string2",@"string3",nil];

    OOP in Objective-C    ◾    107
    
       for(NSString *aString in array) {
          NSLog(@"The Value is: %@",aString);
       }
    
       [pool drain];
       return 0;
    }
    
    Fast enumeration backwards
    
    for (class_Type variable in [collection_Object 
    reverseObjectEnumerator] ) { 
       statements 
     }
    
    In fast enumeration, here's an example of reverseObjectEnumerator.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main() {
       NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool 
    alloc] init];
       NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc]
       initWithObjects:@"string1", 
    @"string2",@"string3",nil];
    
       for(NSString *aString in [array 
    reverseObjectEnumerator]) {
          NSLog(@"The Value is: %@",aString);
       }
    
       [pool drain];
       return 0;
    }
    
    MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Memory  management  is  a  necessary  procedure  in  every  programming 
    language.  It  is  the  process  by  which  objects'  memory  is  allocated  when 
    needed and deallocated when they are no longer needed.
    
    Object memory management is a performance issue; if an application 
    does not release unused objects, its memory footprint expands, and per-
    formance decreases.
    
       
     
       
       
    108    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Objective-C Memory management approaches may be divided into two 
    
    categories.
    
    •  "Manual Retain-Release" or MRR
    
    •  "Automatic Reference Counting" or ARC
    
    "MANUAL RETAIN-RELEASE" OR MRR
    
    In  MRR,  we  manage  memory  explicitly  by  keeping  track  of  the  items 
    independently. This is accomplished by using a model known as reference 
    counting, which is provided by the Foundation class NSObject in combi-
    nation with the runtime environment.
    
    The only difference between MRR and ARC in Objective-C is that we 
    handle the retain and release manually in the former while handled auto-
    matically in the latter.
    
    The diagram shown below is an example of how memory management 
    
    works in Objective-C.
    
    Manual retain-release.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The Class A object's memory life cycle is shown in the diagram above.  
    As you can see, the retain count in Objective-C is shown under the object;  
    when the retain count reaches 0, the item is liberated, and its memory is  
    reallocated for other objects to utilize.
    
    OOP in Objective-C    ◾    109
    
    The  alloc/init  function  in  NSObject  is  used  to  construct  the  class  A 
    
    object. The number of retains is now 1.
    
    Class B now keeps Class A's object, and Class A's object now has a retain 
    
    count of two.
    
    The item is then copied by Class C. It is now constructed as a new instance 
    of Class A, with the same instance variables. The retain count is 1 instead of the 
    original object's retain count. The dotted line in the diagram represents this.
    
    Class  C  uses  the  release  method  to  release  the  copied  object,  which 
    
    causes the keep count to drop to zero and the item to be destroyed.
    
    The keep count for the original Class A Object is two, and it must be 
    released twice before it may be destroyed. This is accomplished using Class 
    A and Class B release statements to set the keep count to 1 and 0, respec-
    tively. The thing is finally destroyed.
    
    Basic MRR Rules
    
    •  We own whatever we make: A method that starts with "alloc," "new," 
    
    "copy," or "mutableCopy" is used to construct an object.
    
    •  We may use retained to acquire ownership of an object: A received 
    object is usually guaranteed to stay valid inside the method in which 
    it was received. That method may also return the object to its invoker 
    securely. Retain is used in two scenarios.
    
    •  We use an accessor method or an init method to gain ownership 
    
    of an object we wish to save as a property value.
    
    •  To avoid the invalidation of an object as a result of another action.
    
    •  When we no longer need something, we must give up ownership of 
    it: A release message or an autorelease message is used to relinquish 
    control of an item. Consequently, relinquishing ownership of an item 
    is referred to as "releasing" an object in Cocoa parlance.

    • We must not give up ownership of something we don't own: This is a consequence of the previously mentioned policy norms.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface SampleClass : NSObject
    - (void)sampleMethod;
    @end
    
     
    
    110    ◾    Objective-C
    
    @implementation SampleClass
    - (void)sampleMethod {
       NSLog(@"Hello, Everyone \n");
    }
    
    - (void)dealloc  {
      NSLog(@"Object deallocated");
      [super dealloc];
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main() {
    
       /* my first program in the Objective-C */
       SampleClass *sampleClass = [[SampleClass alloc]
    init];
       [sampleClass sampleMethod];
    
       NSLog(@"Retain Count after the initial allocation: 
    %d", 
       [sampleClass retainCount]);
       [sampleClass retain];
    
       NSLog(@"Retain Count after the retain: %d", 
    [sampleClass retainCount]);
       [sampleClass release];
       NSLog(@"Retain Count after the  release: %d", 
    [sampleClass retainCount]);
       [sampleClass release];
       NSLog(@"SampleClass dealloc will call before 
    this");
    
       // Should set object to nil
       sampleClass = nil;
       return 0;
    }
    
    "AUTOMATIC REFERENCE COUNTING" OR ARC
    
    Automatic Reference Counting, or ARC, employs the same reference counting approach as MRR, but it inserts the proper memory management method calls for us at build time. For new projects, we are highly recommended to adopt ARC. If we utilize ARC, we usually don't need to know about the underlying implementation detailed in this chapter, while 
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    OOP in Objective-C    ◾    111
    
    it could be helpful in some instances. See Transitioning to ARC Release Notes for further information on ARC.
    
    We do not need to introduce release and retain methods in ARC since the compiler will take care of it. Objective-core C's methodology hasn't changed. Internally, it makes it simpler for the developer to write without worrying about the retain and release actions, reducing the amount of code written and the risk of memory leaks.

    Another notion called garbage collection is utilized in Mac OS X along-
    side MRR, but it hasn't been acknowledged since its deprecation in OS X 
    Mountain Lion. Furthermore, trash collection was never available for iOS 
    objects. Garbage collection is also not used on OS X while using ARC.
    
    Here's an example of an ARC. Because the online compiler does not 
    
    support ARC, this will not work.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface SampleClass : NSObject
    - (void)sampleMethod;
    @end
    
    @implementation SampleClass
    - (void)sampleMethod {
       NSLog(@"Hello, everyone \n");
    }
    
    - (void)dealloc  {
      NSLog(@"Object deallocated");
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main() {
       /* my first program in the Objective-C */
       @autoreleasepool {
          SampleClass *sampleClass = [[SampleClass alloc]
    init];
          [sampleClass sampleMethod];
          sampleClass = nil;
       }
       return 0;
    }

    Interface and API
    
    IN THIS CHAPTER
    
     ➢ Interfaces  
     ➢ APIs  
    
    In the previous chapter, we discussed OOP's concept in Objective-C, and  
    in this chapter, we will cover Interface and API.
    
    iOS IN OBJECTIVE-C  
    
    Objective-C  is  the  programming  language  used  in  iOS  development.  It  
    is  an  object-oriented  language.  Thus,  individuals  with  experience  with  
    object-oriented programming languages will find it simple.
    
    IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERFACE  
    
    In Objective-C, the file where the class is declared is referred to as the inter-
    face file, and the file where the class is defined as the implementation file.
    
    A basic interface file, MyExample.h, might look like this:
    
    @interface MyClass:NSObject { 
       // class-variable declared
    }
    
    // class-properties declared
    // class-methods and instance-methods declared 
    @end

    114    ◾    Objective-C  
    
    The implementation file MyExample.m might look like this:
    
    @implementation MyClass
       // class-methods defined
    @end  
    
    OBJECT CREATION  
    
    The following is how objects are created:
    
    MyExample *objectName = [[MyClass alloc]init] ;  
    
    METHODS  
    
    The following method is declared in Objective-C:
    
    -(returnType)method_Name:(type_Name) variable1 :(type_
    Name)variable2;
    
    Example:
    
    -(void)calculateAreaForRectangleWithLength:(CGfl
    oat)length
    andBreadth:(CGfloat)breadth;
    
    We may be wondering what the andBreadth string is for; it's an optional 
    string that helps us read and comprehend the method more readily, espe-
    cially when we call it. We use the following line to call this function in the 
    same class:
    
    [self calculateAreaForRectangleWithLength:40 
    andBreadth:30];
    
    As previously stated, the usage of andBreadth aids us in understanding 
    that breadth is 20. Self is used to indicate that the method is a class method.
    
    Class Methods  
    
    Class methods are accessed without first constructing a class object. They 
    are not linked with any variables or objects. An example is shown below.
    
    +(void)simpleClass_Method;
    
    
    These  are  accessed  by  using  the  class  name  (let's  say  MyExample)  as
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Interface and API    ◾    115
    
    follows:
    
    [MyExample simpleClass_Method];
    
    Instance Methods
    
    Instance methods are accessed only once a class object has been created. 
    Memory is set aside for instance variables. The following is an example of 
    an instance method.
    
    -(void)simpleInstance_Method;
    
    It may be accessed after creating a class object as follows:
    
    MyExample  *objectName = [[MyExample alloc]init] ;
    [object_Name simpleInstance_Method];

    NSString
    It is a string representation.
    CGfloat
    It represents a floating-point value (normal float is also allowed, but CGfloat is 
    preferred).
    NSInteger
    It's used to represent integers.
    BOOL
    It is used to express Boolean operations (YES or NO are BOOL types allowed).
    
    Printing Logs
    
    NSLog  –  This  function  is  used  to  print  a  statement.  In  the  release  and 
    debug modes, they will be displayed in the device logs and debug console, 
    respectively. As an example,
    
    NSlog(@"");
    
    CONTROL STRUCTURES
    
    Except for a few modifications, such as the for-in statement, most control 
    structures are the same as in C and C++.
    
    
    116    ◾    Objective-C
    
    PROPERTIES
    
    Variable properties are used to allow an external class to access the class. 
    As an example,
    
    @property(nonatomic,  strong) NSString *myString;
    
    Properties of Accessing
    
    To  access  properties,  use  the  dot  operator.  We  will  do  the  following  to 
    access the property, as mentioned earlier.
    
    self.myString = @"Test";
    
    We may also use the set approach, as seen below.
    
    [self setMyString:@"Test"];
    
    CATEGORIES
    
    Categories are used to extend existing classes with new methods. We may 
    add  methods  to  classes  that  don't  even  have  implementation  files  where 
    the real class is defined. The following is an example category for our class:
    
    @interface MyExample(customAdditions)
    - (void)sampleCategoryMethod;
    @end
    
    @implementation MyExample(categoryAdditions)
    
    -(void)sampleCategoryMethod {
       NSLog(@"Just test category");
    }
    
    Arrays
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The array classes used in Objective-C are NSMutableArray and NSArray.  
    The name implies that the former is mutable, whereas the latter is immu-  
    table. An example is shown below.
    
    NSMutableArray *bMutableArray = [[NSMutableArray 
    alloc]init];
    [anArray addObject:@"firstobject"];
    NSArray *bImmutableArray = [[NSArray alloc]
    initWithObjects:@"firstObject",nil];

    Dictionary
    
    The dictionary classes used in Objective-C are NSMutableDictionary and 
    NSDictionary. The name implies that the former is mutable, whereas the 
    latter is immutable. An example is shown below.
    
    NSMutableDictionary *bMutableDictionary = 
    [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
    [bMutableDictionary setObject:@"firstobject" 
    forKey:@"aKey"];
    NSDictionary*bImmutableDictionary= [[NSDictionary 
    alloc]initWithObjects:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:
    @"firstObject",nil] forKeys:[ NSArray 
    arrayWithObjects:@"bKey"]];
    
    ENVIRONMENT SETUP
    
    Here we will discuss the environment setup.
    
    Installation of Xcode
    
    •  Step  1:  Download  the  most  recent  version  of  Xcode  from:  https://
    
    developer.apple.com/downloads/.
    
    •  Step 2: Open the Xcode dmg file with a double-click.
    
    •  Step 3: We will discover a gadget that has been installed and opened.
    
    •  Step 4: The window will show two items: the Xcode program and the 
    
    shortcut to the Application folder.
    
    •  Step 5: Drag the Xcode to the application to copy it to our apps.
    
    
    118    ◾    Objective-C
    
    •  Step 6: Xcode will now be available as part of other apps that we may 
    
    pick and execute.
    
    INTERFACE BUILDER
    
    An interface builder is a tool that allows for the quick construction of 
    UI interfaces. We have a diverse range of UI components that have been 
    designed for usage. We just drag and drop it into our UI view. We'll learn 
    about adding UI elements, generating outlets, and creating actions for the 
    UI elements in the following pages.
    
    At the right bottom, an object library contains all the essential UI ele-
    ments. The file extension xibs is commonly used to refer to the user inter-
    face. Each of the xibs is associated with a view controller.

    An iOS emulator comprises two sorts of devices: iPhones and iPads in various versions. iPhone models include the iPhone (standard), iPhone Retina, and iPhone 5. The iPad comes in two varieties: iPad and iPad Retina.
    
    We may replicate the location in an iOS simulator to experiment with the app's latitude and longitude effects. In the simulator, we can also mimic memory warnings and in-call status. The simulator can be used for most purposes, although it cannot test device functions such as the accelerometer. As a result, we may always require an iOS device to test all application situations thoroughly.
    
    FIRST iPHONE APPLICATION
    
    Developing the First App:
    
    We'll make a simple single-view application (a blank App) to run on the iOS simulator.
    
    The procedures are as follows.
    
    • Step 1: Launch Xcode and choose to Create a new Xcode project.
    
    • Step 2: Click on Single View Application.
    
    • Step 3: Enter the product name, the application name, the organization name, and finally, the corporate identification.
    
    • Step 4: Ensure that Use Automatic Reference Counting is enabled to automatically release the resources allocated when they are no longer needed. Next, click.
    
    Interface and API ◾ 119
    
    • Step 5: Choose the project directory and click Create.
    
    • Step 6: We will be able to choose between supported orientations and build and release options. There is a field deployment goal: the device version we want to support; let's say we choose 4.3, the minimum deployment target allowed right now. These are not necessary, and we may concentrate on executing the program for the time being.
    
    • Step 7: Now, pick the iPhone simulator from the drop-down beside the Run button and press the Run button.
    
    • Step 8: We have now successfully run our first application.
    
    Let's modify the backdrop color to get started with the interface builder. Choose ViewController.xib. Change the color of the backdrop on the right side and run.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The deployment target is configured to iOS 6.0 by default, and auto-lay-
    out is enabled. We adjusted the deployment target at the start of this appli-
    cation's construction to ensure it operates on iOS 4.3 and later devices, but 
    we did not disable auto-layout.
    
    To turn off auto-layout, uncheck the auto-layout checkbox in the file 
    inspector of each nib, that is, the xib files. The parts of the Xcode project 
    IDE are listed.
    
    The file inspector is located in the inspector selector bar, and auto-lay-
    out may be unchecked there. We may utilize auto-layout when we want to 
    target iOS 6 devices. We will also be able to use several new features, such 
    as a passbook if we increase the deployment target to iOS 6. For the time 
    being, let's remain with iOS 4.3 as the deployment target.
    
    FIRST iOS APPLICATION'S CODE
    
    Five separate files were created for your application. The following is a list 
    of them:
    
    •  AppDelegate.h
    
    •  AppDelegate.m
    
    •  ViewController.h
    
    •  ViewController.m
    
    •  ViewController.xib

    imported in the future)
    @class ViewController;  
    
    // Interface for the Appdelegate
    @interface AppDelegate : UIResponder

    Important code elements:
    
    •  AppDelegate is a subclass of UIResponder, which handles iOS events.
    
    •  Implements the UIApplicationDelegate delegate methods, which 
    give critical application events such as finished launching, about to 
    terminate, etc.
    
    •  To manage and coordinate the multiple views on the iOS device 
    screen, use the UIWindow object. It's similar to the base view on top 
    of which all additional views are loaded. An application typically has 
    only one window.
    
    •  UIViewController handles the screen flow.

    ACTIONS AND OUTLETS IN iOS
    
    In iOS, actions and outlets are called ibActions and ibOutlets, respectively, 
    where ib stands for interface builder. These are UI components, and we 
    will investigate them after we have a visual understanding of how to apply 
    them.
    
    Actions and Outlets – Involved Steps: 
    
    - Step 1: Let's utilize our First iPhone Application.
    
    - Step 2: Choose the ViewController.xib file from the navigation 
    section.
    
    - Step 3: We can now choose UI components from the library pane on 
    the right side of our window.
    
    - Step 4: In our interface builder, drag and drop the UI elements to our 
    display.
    
    - Step 5: Insert a Label and a Round Rect Button into our view.
    
    - Step 6: Click the Editor Selector button in the workspace toolbar, 
    located in the upper right corner.
    
    Select the Assistant editor button.
    
    - Step 7: In the center of our editor area, we notice two windows: 
    ViewController.xib and ViewController.h.

    **Step 8:** Right-click the label and select, hold, and drag the new referring outlet.
    
    **Step 9:** Insert the ViewController.h in the space between the curly brackets. If there are no curly brackets in the file, add the ViewController first.
    
    **Step 10:** Enter the label name for the outlet, in this case, myTitleLabel. When you click connect, the ibOutlet will finish.
    
    ---
    
    **Interface and API ◾ 125**
    
    **Step 11:** To add an action, right-click the Round rect button, choose Touch up inside, and drag it below the curly braces.
    
    **Step 12:** Drop it and give it the name setTitleLabel.
    
    **Step 13:** Open the ViewController.m file and look for the function described below.
    
    ```objc
    -(IBAction)setTitleLabel:(id)sender {
    }
    ```
    
    **Step 14:** Insert the following statement within the procedure mentioned above.
    
    ```objc
    [myTitleLabel setText:@"Heyyy"];
    ```
    
    **Step 15:** Now, start the application by clicking the run button.
    
    **Step 16:** Now press the button.
    
    **Step 17:** The action on the button has updated the label that we established.
    
    **Step 18:** From the above example, IBOutlet establishes a reference to the UIElement (here for the UILabel). Similarly, the IBAction associates the UIButton with a method invoked at the event touch-up inside.
    
    **Step 19:** We may experiment with actions by selecting different events as we create them.
    
    ---
    
    **DELEGATES IN iOS**
    
    **Delegation example:**
    
    Assume that object A requests an action from object B. Object A should be aware that B has completed the task and take the appropriate action when the activity is finished. This is accomplished with the assistance of delegates.
    
    The main principles in the preceding example are:
    
    - B's delegate object is A.
    - A will be a reference for B.
    - B's delegate methods will be implemented by A.
    - B will inform A via delegate techniques.

    How to Create a Delegate
    
    •  Step 1: Create a single view application first.
    
    •  Step 2: Then choose File → New → File.
    
    •  Step 3: Select Objective-C Class and then click Next.
    
    •  Step 4: Name the class SampleProtocols, with NSObject as a subclass.
    
    •  Step 5: Then click Create.
    
    •  Step 6: Add a protocol to the SampleProtocols.h file, and the updated code looks like this:
    
    ```objc
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    // Here Protocol definition starts
    @protocol SampleProtocolsDelegate <NSObject>
    @required
    - (void)processCompleted;
    @end
    
    // Here Protocol Definition ends
    @interface SampleProtocols : NSObject {
       // Delegate to respond-back
       id <SampleProtocolsDelegate> _delegate; 
    }
    @property (nonatomic,strong) id delegate;
    
    -(void)startSampleProcess; // Instance-method
    @end
    ```
    
    •  Step 7: Put the instance method into action by changing the SampleProtocols.m file below.
    
    ```objc
    #import "SampleProtocols.h"
    
    @implementation SampleProtocols
    
    -(void)startSampleProcess {
       [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:3.0 
    target:self.delegate 
       selector:@selector(processCompleted) 
    userInfo:nil repeats:NO];
    }
    @end
    ```

    Interface and API    ◾    127
    
    •  Step 8: Drag a UILabel from the object library onto the UIView in ViewController.xib.
    
    •  Step 9: Create an IBOutlet for the label, call it myLabel, and then alter the code in ViewController.h to use SampleProtocolsDelegate.
    
    ```objc
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    #import "SampleProtocols.h"
    
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController<SampleProtocolsDelegate> {
       IBOutlet UILabel *myLabel;
    }
    @end
    ```
    
    •  Step 10: Implement the delegate method, create a SampleProtocols object, and invoke the startSampleProcess method. The updated ViewController.m file looks like this:
    
    ```objc
    #import "ViewController.h"
    
    @interface ViewController ()
    
    @end
    
    @implementation ViewController 
    
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        
        // Create an instance of SampleProtocols
        SampleProtocols *sample = [[SampleProtocols alloc] init];
        [sample startSampleProcess];
    }
    
    @end
    ```
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
       [super viewDidLoad];
       SampleProtocol *sampleProtocols = 
    [[SampleProtocols alloc]init];
       sampleProtocol.delegate = self;
       [myLabel setText:@"Processing...."];
       [sampleProtocols startSampleProcess];
       // Do any additional setup after loading view, 
    typically from nib.
    }
    
    - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
       [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
       // Dispose of any resources that can recreate.
    }
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    128    ◾    Objective-C
    
    #pragma mark - Sample protocols delegate
    -(void)processCompleted {
       [myLabel setText:@"Process-Completed"];
    }
    @end
    
    •  Step  11:  We  will  see  the  result.  The  label  initially  shows  "process-
    ing...," which is changed when the SampleProtocols object calls the 
    delegate method.
    
    UI ELEMENTS
    What Are UI Elements?
    
    UI elements are the visual components of an application's user interface. 
    Some  of  these  components  are  interactive,  like  buttons  and  text  boxes, 
    while others are instructive, like photos and labels.
    
    How Do We Insert UI Elements?
    
    We  can  add  UI  components  using  both  code  and  an  interface  builder. 
    Depending on the situation, we can use either option.

    In  our  apps,  we'll  emphasize  adding  UI  components  using  code.  The 
    interface builder is basic and straightforward; UI components are simply 
    dragged and dropped.
    
    Our Strategy
    
    We will develop a basic iOS application and use it to demonstrate some UI 
    features.
    
    •  Step 1: Create a Viewbased application, much like we did with our 
    
    first iOS app.
    
    •  Step  2:  Only  the  ViewController.h  and  ViewController.m  files  will 
    
    be updated.
    
    •  Step 3: In our ViewController.m file, we add a function for construct-
    
    ing the UI element.
    
    •  Step 4: In our viewDidLoad function, we will call this method.
    
    •  Step 5: The key lines of code in the code have been clarified using a 
    
    single-line comment above those lines.

    Text Fields  
    A user interface element allows the program to receive user input.  
    Input types – TextFields  
    Using the keyboard property of UITextField, we can specify the type of input that  
    the user can provide.  
    Buttons  
    It is responsible for managing user actions.  
    Label  
    It's used to show static content.  
    Toolbar  
    It is utilized to modify anything based on our present point of view.  
    Status Bar  
    It displays the device's vital information.
    
    7 Navigation Bar
    
    It has navigation buttons from a navigation controller and a stack of view 
    controllers that can be pushed and popped.  
    Tab Bar  
    It is typically used to switch between different subtasks, views, or models inside 
    the same view.  
    Image View  
    It's used to show a single image or a series of images.  
    Scroll View  
    It is used to display larger content than the screen's size.  
    Table View  
    It shows a scrollable list of data in numerous rows and sections.  
    Split View  
    It is used to show two panes, with the master pane controlling the information on 
    the detail pane.  
    Text View  
    It displays a scrollable list of text content that may be edited if needed.  
    View Transition  
    It describes the different view transitions between perspectives.  
    Pickers  
    It is used for showing and choosing data from a list.  
    Switches  
    It serves as a disable and enables switch for activities.  
    Sliders  
    It allows users to make changes to a value or process across a range of possible values.  
    Alerts  
    It is used to provide consumers with critical information.  
    Icons  
    It is a visual depiction of the activity or anything linked to the program.

    ACCELEROMETER IN iOS
    
    The accelerometer detects changes in the device's location in the three 
    directions x, y, and z. We can determine the device's current position con-
    cerning the ground. This example requires running on a device and does 
    not function in a simulator.
    
    Steps Involved with an accelerometer:
    
    •  Step 1: Make a basic View-based application.  
    •  Step 2: In ViewController, add three labels.

    • Step 3: Make the following changes to ViewController.h:
    
    ```objc
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController<UIAccelerometerDelegate> {
       IBOutlet UILabel *xlabel;
       IBOutlet UILabel *ylabel;
       IBOutlet UILabel *zlabel;
    }
    @end
    ```
    
    • Step 4: Make the following changes to ViewController.m:
    
    ```objc
    #import "ViewController.h"
    
    @interface ViewController ()
    @end
    
    @implementation ViewController

       // Do any additional setup after loading view, typically from nib
    }
    
    - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
       [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
    
       // Dispose of any resources that can recreate.

    **UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS IN iOS**
    
    A universal application is created in a single binary for both the iPhone and the iPad. A universal App enables code reuse and quick upgrades.
    
    Steps involved in universal application
    
    • Step 1: Make a basic View-based application.
    
    • Step 2: In the right-hand file inspector, rename the ViewController.xib file to ViewController iPhone.xib.
    
    • Step 3: Select File → New → File... then the subheading "User Interface" and View. Next, click.
    
    • Step 4: Select iPad as the device family and then click Next.
    
    • Step 5: Select Create and save the file as ViewController iPad.xib.
    
    • Step 6: In both ViewController iPhone.xib and ViewController iPad.xib, place a label in the center of the screen.
    
    • Step 7: Select the identity inspector in ViewController iPad.xib and change the custom class to ViewController.
    
    • Step 8: Update the application: In AppDelegate.m, use the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function as follows:

        self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController;
        [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
        return YES;
    }
    
    • Step 9: Change the device in the project summary to universal.
    
    CAMERA MANAGEMENT IN iOS
    
    A camera is a typical feature of a mobile device. We may snap pictures using the camera and utilize them in our program; it's also reasonably straightforward.
    
    Steps involved in camera management
    
    • Step 1: Make a basic View-based application.
    
    • Step 2: Add a button to ViewController.xib and build an IBAction for it.
    
    • Step 3: Add an image view and build an IBOutlet called imageView.
    
    • Step 4: Make the following changes to ViewController.h:
    
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController<UIImagePickerControllerDelegate> {
    
    }
    
    @property (strong, nonatomic) UIImagePickerController *imagePicker;
    @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIImageView *imageView;
    
    - (IBAction)showCamera:(id)sender;
    @end
    
    • Step 5: Make the following changes to ViewController.m:
    
    #import "ViewController.h"
    
    @interface ViewController ()
    
    @end
    
    @implementation ViewController
    
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];

    LOCATION HANDLING IN iOS
    
    We can simply find the user's current position in iOS if the user allows the application access to the information using the core location framework.
    
    Steps involved in location handling
    
    •  Step 1: Make a basic View-based application.
    
    •  Step 2: Choose our project file, then targets, and add CoreLocation.
    
    framework.
    
    •  Step 3: In ViewController, add two labels. xib and build ibOutlets 
    
    with the names latitudeLabel and longitudeLabel.
    
    •  Step 4: Select File → New → File... → select Objective-C class and 
    
    click next.
    
    •  Step 5: Give the class the name LocationHandler and the "subclass 
    
    of" as NSObject.
    
    •  Step 6: Click the Create button.
    
    •  Step 7: Make the following changes to LocationHandler.h:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    #import <CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h>
    
    @protocol LocationHandlerDelegate <NSObject>

    FILE HANDLING IN iOS
    
    Because file management cannot be demonstrated visually using the pro-
    gram,  the essential  techniques  for managing files are detailed here. It is 
    important to note in Objective-C that the application bundle only has read 
    access  and  that  we  will  not  be  able  to  edit  the  files.  You  can  still  make 
    changes to your application's documents directory.
    
    METHODS FOR FILE HANDLING
    
    The techniques for accessing and altering files are detailed further below. 
    We must change the FilePath1, FilePath2, and FilePath strings with our 
    needed complete file paths to achieve the desired action.
    
    Check to See If a File in Objective-C Exists at a Given Path
    
    NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager 
    defaultManager];

    NSString *documentsDirectoryPath = [directoryPaths 
    objectAtIndex:0];
    
    if ([fileManager fileExistsAtPath:@""]==YES) {
       NSLog(@"File exists");
    }
    
    Comparing the Contents of Two Files
    
    if ([fileManager contentsEqualAtPath:@"FilePath1" 
    andPath:@" FilePath2"]) {
       NSLog(@"Same-content");
    }
    
     
     
    Interface and API    ◾    149
    
    Check to See If It Is Writable, Readable, and Executable
    
    if ([fileManager isWritableFileAtPath:@"FilePath"]) {
       NSLog(@"isWritable");
    }
    
    if ([fileManager isReadableFileAtPath:@"FilePath"]) {
       NSLog(@"isReadable");
    }
    
    if ( [fileManager isExecutableFileAtPath:@"FilePath"]) 
    {
       NSLog(@"isExecutable");
    }
    
    Move File
    
    if([fileManager moveItemAtPath:@"FilePath1" 
       toPath:@"FilePath2" error:NULL]) {
       NSLog(@"Moved-successfully");
    }
    
    Copy File
    
    if ([fileManager copyItemAtPath:@"FilePath1" 
       toPath:@"FilePath2"  error:NULL]) {
       NSLog(@"Copied-successfully");
    }
    
    Remove File
    
    if ([fileManager removeItemAtPath:@"FilePath" 
    error:NULL]) {
       NSLog(@"Removed-successfully");
    }
    
    Read File
    
    NSData *data = [fileManager contentsAtPath:@"Path"];
    
    Write File
    
    [fileManager createFileAtPath:@"" contents:data 
    attributes:nil];

    IN-APP PURCHASE IN iOS
    
    In-App purchases are used to acquire additional content or upgrade an 
    application's features.
    The involved steps
    
    •  Step 1: Ensure that you have a unique App ID in iTunes Connect and 
    update the application's bundle ID and code signing in Xcode with 
    the corresponding provisioning profile.
    
     
     
    Interface and API    ◾    153
    
    •  Step  2:  Create  a  new  application  and  update  its  information.  More 
    information is available in Apple's Add new apps documentation.
    
    •  Step 3: Add a new product now for In-App purchase to your applica-
    
    tion's Manage In-App Purchase page.
    
    •  Step 4: Ensure that the bank information for your application is set 
    up. This must be configured for In-App purchase to function. Create 
    a  test  user  account  using  the  Manage  Users  option  on  the  App's 
    iTunes Connect page.
    
    •  Step  5:  The following steps involve handling code and designing the 
    
    user interface for our In-App purchase.
    
    •  Step  6:  Create  a  single-view  application  with  the  bundle  identifier

    GameKit in iOS
    
    GameKit is a framework that gives a leaderboard, achievements, and more features to an iOS application. In this tutorial, we will describe the procedures required to install a leaderboard and change the score.
    
    The involved steps
    
    • Step 1: Ensure that we have a unique App ID in iTunes Connect and update the application's bundle ID and code signing in Xcode with the relevant provisioning profile.

    • Step 2: Create a new application and edit its details. We may know more about this in apple-add new applications documentation.
    
    • Step 3: Set up a leaderboard in the Manage Game Center of our application's page where add a single leaderboard and specify leaderboard ID and score Type. Here we supply leader board ID.
    
    • Step 4: The following stages are connected to handling code and developing UI for our application.
    
    • Step 5: Create a single view application and input the bundle identification as the identifier given in iTunes connect.
    
    • Step 6: Update the ViewController.xib.
    
    • Step 7: Choose our project file, then targets, and finally GameKit.

    STORYBOARDS IN iOS 
    ```
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    iOS 5 introduces storyboards. When we employ storyboards, we should  
    aim for a deployment goal of 5.0 or above. Storyboards assist us in creat-  
    ing all of the screens of an application and connecting them under a single  
    interface MainStoryboard.storyboard. It also aids in the reduction of cod-  
    ing for pushing and showing view controllers.
    
    Procedures involved
    
    •  Step 1:  Create  a  single-view  application  and  ensure  that  the  story-
    
    board checkbox is selected while creating the application.
    
    •  Step 2: Choose MainStoryboard.storyboard with a single view con-
    
    troller. Update the view controllers after adding one more.
    
    •  Step  3:  Now,  link  the  two  view  controllers.  Right-click  the  "show 
    modal"  button  and  move  it  to  the  left-side  view  controller's  right-
    view controller.
    
    •  Step 4: Choose a modal from the three options displayed.
    
    •  Step  5: Make the following changes to ViewController.h:
    
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController
    
    -(IBAction)done:(UIStoryboardSegue *)seque;
    
    @end
    
    •  Step  6: Make the following changes to ViewController.m:
    
    #import "ViewController.h"
    
     
     
    
     
     
    
    Interface and API    ◾    163
    
    @interface ViewController ()
    @end
    
    @implementation ViewController
    
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
       [super viewDidLoad]; 
    }
    
    - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
       [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
       // Dispose of any resources that can recreate.
    }
    
    -(IBAction)done:(UIStoryboardSegue *)seque {
       [self.navigationController popViewControllerAni
    mated:YES];
    }
    
    @end
    
    •  Step  7:  Choose  the  MainStoryboard.storyboard  and  right-click  on 
    the Exit button on the right side view controller, then pick done and 
    link with the back button.
    
    AUTO LAYOUTS IN iOS
    
    In iOS 6.0, auto-layouts were added. We should have a deployment goal 
    of 6.0 or greater when using auto-layouts. Auto-layouts allow us to design 
    interfaces compatible with many orientations and devices.
    
    Aim of Our Example
    
    We will add two buttons positioned at a specific distance from the screen's 
    center. Additionally, we will attempt to include a resizable text box posi-
    tioned a specific distance above the buttons.

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text you provided:
    
    ---
    
    **Our Strategy**
    
    We will add a text box, two buttons, and their respective restrictions to the code. Each UI Element's restrictions will be generated and applied to the super view. To get the desired outcome, we must deactivate auto-resizing for each UI item we add.
    
    ---
    
    **The Involved Steps**
    
    - **Step 1:** Create a basic view-based application.
    - **Step 2:** We will just modify `ViewController.m`, as seen below:

       [self.view addSubview:self.leftButton];
    
       /* 2. Constraint to the position LeftButton's X*/
       NSLayoutConstraint *leftButtonXConstraint = 
       [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:self.leftButton 
                                    attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX

                                 constant:-60.0f];
    
       /* 3. Constraint to the position LeftButton's Y*/
       NSLayoutConstraint *leftButtonYConstraint = 
       [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:self.leftButton 
                                    attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY

                                    attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY 
                                   multiplier:1.0f 
                                 constant:0.0f];
    
       /* 4. Add constraints to the button's superview*/
       [superview addConstraints:@[ leftButtonXConstraint, leftButtonYConstraint ]];

    **Important notes:** In steps 1, 5, and 8, we simply created two buttons and a text field programmatically.
    
    In the following stages, we set constraints and applied them to the relevant super views, essentially self-views. The restrictions of one of the left buttons are depicted here.
    
    ```objc
    NSLayoutConstraint *leftButtonXConstraint = 
    [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:self.leftButton 
                               attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX 
                            relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationGreaterThanOrEqual 
                               toItem:superview 
                             attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX 
                      multiplier:1.0 
                       constant:-70.0f];
    ```
    
    We have `constraintWithItem` and `toItem`, which determine the UI components we want to constrain. The `attribute` determines how the two items are connected. "relatedBy" determines how much influence the characteristics have on the components. The multiplier is the multiplication factor, and the constant is added.

    MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN iOS
    
    Initially, iOS's memory management was non-ARC (Automatic Reference 
    Counting), requiring us to retain and release objects. Now that it supports 
    ARC, we no longer need to retain and release objects. Compilation time is 
    handled automatically by Xcode.
    
    MEMORY MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES
    
    According  to  Apple  documentation,  the  two  most  significant  memory 
    management issues are:
    
    •  Releasing or erasing data that is currently in use. It typically results 
    
    in an application crash or corrupted user data.
    
    •  Memory  leaks  are  caused  by  not  releasing  inactive  data.  Memory 
    leaks  occur  when  allocated  memory  is  not  released  even  though  it 
    is  not  used  again.  Leaks  cause  your  application  to  consume  ever-
    increasing amounts of memory, which may lead to poor system per-
    formance or (in iOS) the termination of our application.
    
    RULES FOR MEMORY MANAGEMENT
    
    •  We are responsible for releasing the items we generate when they are 
    
    no longer required.
    
    •  Retain is used to acquire ownership of an object you did not create. 
    You must also release these things when they are no longer required.
    
    •  Do not release the items we do not possess.
    
    DEALING WITH MEMORY IN ARC
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the text with formatting corrected and any spelling or structural issues addressed:
    
    ---
    
    In ARC, we do not need to employ release and retain. Therefore, all of its associated objects will be freed when the view controller is deleted. Similarly, sub-objects of any object are released when their parent object is released. Note that the whole class will not be released if other classes hold a strong reference to an object of a class. Therefore, poor qualities are advised for delegates.
    
    MEMORY MANAGEMENT TOOLS
    
    With the use of Xcode instrumentation, memory utilization is analyzed. It has features like Activity Monitor, Allocations, Leaks, and Zombies.
    
    
    Interface and API    ◾    171
    
    ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR MEMORY ALLOCATIONS
    
    • Step 1: Launch an existing application.
    
    • Step 2: Select Product and then Profile.
    
    • Step 3: On the following page, pick Allocations and then Profile.
    
    • Step 4: We'll look at memory allocation for various objects.
    
    • Step 5: We can switch between view controllers to see if the memory is appropriately released.
    
    • Step 6: Similarly, we may utilize Activity Monitor instead of Allocations to observe the total Memory assigned to the application.
    
    • Step 7: We can access our memory use and pinpoint any leaks using these tools.
    
    APPLICATION DEBUGGING IN iOS
    
    While developing an application, we may make mistakes that lead to many faults. We must debug the program to correct these issues or flaws.
    
    CHOOSING A DEBUGGER
    
    Xcode includes two debuggers, notably GDB and LLDB. GDB is the default debugger type. LLDB is a debugger included in the open-source LLVM compiler project. The "edit active schemes" option allows you to modify the debugger.
    
    HOW TO LOCATE CODING ERRORS
    
    We must construct your application and compile the code to identify coding-related issues. If the code includes errors, the compiler will show all messages, errors, warnings, and potential causes.
    
    Click Product followed by Analyze to spot possible flaws in an application.
    
    SET BREAKPOINTS

    Breakpoints enable us to determine the various states of our application's objects, facilitating the identification of several problems, including logical errors. Simply clicking on the line number will establish a breakpoint. To remove a breakpoint, click and drag it out of the document.
    
    172    ◾    Objective-C
    
    When we launch the program and press the playVideo button, it will halt at the line number where we put the breakpoint. It allows users to assess the current condition of the application when the breakpoint is hit. It is simple to determine which thread triggered the breakpoint. You can see objects like self, sender, and so on down the bottom, which carry the values of the relevant objects, and we can expand some of these objects to see their state.
    
    Click the continue button (leftmost button) to proceed with the application.

    We also have exception breakpoints, which cause an application to halt where the exception occurs. After selecting the debug navigator, we can put exception breakpoints by clicking the Add button. Then we must choose Add Exception Breakpoint.
    
    IN AN iOS App, WE MAY USE GOOGLE APIs
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    Some Google services in Objective-C, such as Drive, Gmail, and many more, have public APIs used to build apps that enable users to interact with their data in these services. To use these services, applications must implement one of the OAuth 2.0 client flows to gain user approval and access tokens that provide access to the APIs.
    
    To obtain access tokens for the signed-in user, we may use the Google Sign-In library, which implements the OAuth 2.0 procedure.
    
    Before we begin
    We must first finish the basic Google Sign-In integration.
    
    1. Determine which scopes have been granted: Before calling a Google API, use the `grantedScopes` property of `GIDGoogleUser` to see which scopes have been given to our app.
    
    ```objective-c
    NSString *driveScope = @"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly";
    
    // Check if user has granted Drive scope
    if (![user.grantedScopes containsObject:driveScope]) {
      // request the additional drive scope
    }
    ```
    
    Whether or not the user has authorized a specific scope, we may need to request an additional scope to support a specific interaction.
    
    2. Ask for extra scopes: If we need to request more scopes, use the `addScopes:presentingViewController:callback` or `addScopes:presentingWindow:callback` methods to ask the user to allow our app to be more accessible.
    
    To request read-only access to a user's Drive via Objective-C, for example:
    
    ```objective-c
    NSArray *additionalScopes = @[ @"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly" ];
    [GIDSignIn.sharedInstance addScopes:additionalScopes
               presentingViewController:self
               callback:^(GIDGoogleUser * _Nullable user,
                                          NSError * _Nullable error) {
        if (error) { return; }
        if (user == nil) { return; }
    
        // Check if the user granted access to the scopes we requested.
    }];
    ```
    
    3. Make an API call using new tokens: Wrap your Google API requests in a `doWithFreshTokens:` block to guarantee that they always have valid access tokens.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    [ user.authentication doWithFreshTokens:^(GIDAuthentication * _Nullable authentication,
                                             NSError * _Nullable error) {
    
     
    
     
    174    ◾    Objective-C
    
        if (error) { return; }
        if (authentication == nil) { return; }
    
        // Get an access token to attach it to a REST 
    or gRPC request.
        NSString *accessToken = authentication.
    accessToken;
    
        // Or, get object that conforms to 
    GTMFetcherAuthorizationProtocol for
        // use with GTMAppAuth and Google APIs client 
    library.
        id<GTMFetcherAuthorizationProtocol> authorizer 
    = [authentication fetcherAuthorizer];
    }];
    
    Call  the  API  with  the  access  token  by  including  it  in  the  header  of  a 
    REST  or  gRPC  request  (Authorization:  Bearer  ACCESS  TOKEN)  or  by 
    using the fetcher authorizer with the Google APIs Client Library.

    Functional Programming
    
    IN THIS CHAPTER
    
     ➢ Writing Methods
     ➢ Project-based Samples
    
    In the previous chapter, we discussed interface and API in Objective-C, 
    and in this chapter, we will cover functional programming.

    Object-functional programming is a programming technique that emphasizes object transformation and employs both object-oriented and functional tools and ideas to do this. The creation of effects in general and the modification of objects and object references in particular rarely occurs, as transparently as feasible to other parts of the code and as far away from transformational code as practicable.
    
    Data and behavior are brought together, and access modifiers are uti-
    lized to enable only reasonable dependencies wherever feasible. Functional 
    features and many features traditionally provided more frequently by func-
    tional languages are used to avoid mutation of object and object references 
    as much as possible and easily remain modular even in the small, for exam-
    ple, with functions as a lightweight alternative to the Strategy Pattern. As 
    is typical for functional programming, the software is separated into code 
    mostly devoid of effects and code-producing effects, with effects being as 
    transparent to other parts of the code as possible; this ensures that large 
    portions of the code are unaffected by the disadvantages that effects entail, 
    such as for local understandability and modular composability.

    178    ◾    Objective-C
    
    In contrast to object orientation, objects are often immutable, at least 
    from the outside; methods typically calculate but do not cause visible con-
    sequences. In contrast to functional programming, functions operate less 
    on passive data structures and more frequently as methods belonging to 
    objects or object types with access to their private data and behavior.
    
    Appropriate mechanisms are utilized to achieve key outcomes, such as 
    displaying  data  on  the  screen;  these  mechanisms  might  take  on  various 
    forms.
    
    WHY OBJECT-FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?
    
    Programming  is  not  about  implementing  desired  behavior  in  an  "arbi-
    trary" manner. The creation and improvement of the software should be 
    efficient, and the outcomes should be of good quality. Object-oriented and 
    functional programming assist this objective in their unique ways.

    ---
    
    On the one hand, this approach develops positive characteristics, such as local understandability and modular composability. On the other hand, its typically imperative emphasis hinders these positive characteristics. In addition, mutable objects are not easily employed safely in a parallel setting, and pure object orientation is sometimes too cumbersome for tiny applications. In contrast, the functional method is distinguished by its lightweight characteristics and its restriction and isolation of effects.
    
    The functional method provides fewer tools for organizing software systems, abstracting data, and eliminating unwanted dependencies. In contrast, the object-oriented method provides effective replies with its associated objects and properties.
    
    Therefore, the advantages of one strategy are the disadvantages of the other. Combining both strategies combines their strengths and compensates for their respective deficiencies. We get the potential benefits of both without their downsides. The amount to which this promise is fulfilled is also contingent on the language used.
    
    OBJECTIVE-C FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
    
    This is called Objective-C:
    
    ```objc
    @interface NSArray (Map)
    - (id)map:(id (^)(id))block;
    - (id)reduce:(id(^)(^(^)(id))(id))block;
    @end
    ```

    @interface NSString (Funcs)
    @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *uppercaseString;
    - (NSString *)plus:(NSString *)string;
    @end
    ```
    
    ```objc
    int main()
    {
      Print(@[@"foo", @"bar", @"baz"].map(NSString.uppercaseString));
      // -> ( FOO, BAR, BAZ )
    
      Print(@"Hello".plus(@" I Miss you"));
      // -> Hello I Miss you

    It does compile and run.
    The methods NSArray.map, NSArray.reduce, and NSString.plus are 
    
    implemented as standard Objective-C methods:
    
    @implementation NSString (Plus)
    - (NSString*) plus:(NSString*) string
    {
        return [self stringByAppendingString:string];
    }
    @end
    
    The basic concept is to build different, parameter-less methods (such 
    as -[NSString plus] instead of -[NSString plus:]) that return a block that

    accepts an argument used as the parameter of the real method. It's OK if 
    we need to reread that phrase, but it's not that difficult.
    
    Building block wrapper implementations for every single method would 
    be tedious. With resolveInstanceMethod, the objective-C runtime allows 
    us to add methods on demand. This was almost shockingly uncomplicated.
    The whole point is made here. This hack is likely filled with problems, so 
    
    do not use it for anything important.
    
    A few random thoughts we picked up along the way:
    
    On Functional Programming
    exclamate = NSString.plus(@"!!"); is a partial application of the NSString.
    plus function in Functional Programming. It generates a new function 
    with one less parameter. (Does it refer to currying or partial application? 
    We're not sure; my impression is that it's the same for functions with two 
    or fewer parameters.)
    
    We're a noob at functional programming. These block attributes are 
    
    most likely referred to as monoids.
    
    On the ObjC Runtime
    
    To add class methods at runtime in Objective-C, adding instance methods 
    to the metaclass is necessary. Class methods are the instance methods of 
    a class's metaclass.
    
    Similarly, resolveClassMethod might be disregarded for the most 
    part. When resolveClassMethod fails, the runtime runs the metaclass's 
    resolveInstanceMethod.
    
    Because I care about my mental health, we only included support for 
    object (id) argument and return types. Using NSInvocation and va args, 
    we began experimenting with methods with more than one parameter, but 
    things were getting out of hand.

    Because YOLO, we're swizzling [NSObject resolveInstanceMethod].  
    This is strong; it is comparable to modifying the dispatch mechanism of  
    the language.
    
    Clang supports the dot notation for attributes and method signatures  
    with no arguments, including Class methods. Class.method may replace  
    [Class method]. However, they do not support autocomplete.
    
    Because we care about our personal wellbeing, we only included sup-
    port for object (id) argument and return types. Using NSInvocation and  
    va args, we had begun playing with methods with>1 parameter, but things  
    were getting out of hand.

    On Objective-C and Language Design
    
    I've said before that Objective-C is quite adaptable. Overall, it does not 
    complain excessively: dynamic languages rule. As usual, the least enter-
    taining aspect is the stupid block syntax.
    
    It is enjoyable to use a programming language with an entirely differ-
    ent coding style than what it was created for. However, if you examine 
    Objective-C source files from the mid-1990s and compare them to modern 
    UIKit, you will see that they are not the same language. In old-style ObjC, 
    the id type was inferred for arguments and return types (it still functions), 
    and methods often returned self rather than void.1
    
    In the Objective-C community, Higher-Order Messaging is hardly 
    a novel notion. Of course, there are the KVC collection operators, such 
    as [items valueForKeyPath:@"@sum.price"]; the mere existence of 
    NSInvocation demonstrates that language maintainers have long been 
    interested in this area.

    We wonder what the Cocoa Target-Action paradigm might look like if it were designed with Functional Programming in mind. The last consideration is that we implemented block methods as read-only attributes. What if method properties were read/write? At runtime, we might write `NSString.plus = <something else>` for the whole class or for a particular instance.
    
    WRITE OBJECTIVE-C CODE
    
    If we have never developed for iOS or Mac OS X, we must familiarize ourselves with Objective-C, the major programming language. Objective-C is not a difficult programming language, and once we get familiar with it, we will recognize its beauty. The Objective-C programming language permits complex object-oriented programming. It expands the conventional ANSI C programming language by adding syntax for class and method definitions. Additionally, it encourages the dynamic expansion of classes and interfaces, which any class may adopt.
    
    If we are acquainted with ANSI C, the material below should assist you in learning the fundamental syntax of Objective-C. And if we've coded in other object-oriented languages, we'll discover that Objective-C supports
    
    182    ◾    Objective-C
    
    many conventional object-oriented principles, like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    
    The Objective-C Programming Language provides a comprehensive explanation of the Objective-C language.
    
    Objective-C language is the superset of the C programming language.
    The Objective-C programming language defines a syntax for establishing classes and methods, invoking object methods, dynamically extending classes, and developing problem-specific programming interfaces. Being a superset of the C programming language, Objective-C offers the same syntax as C. We have access to all the standard components, including basic types (int, float, etc.), structures, functions, pointers, and control-flow constructs like if…else and for expressions. In addition, we have access to the standard C library functions, such as those defined in stdlib.h and stdio.h.
    
    Objective-C extends ANSI C with the following syntax and features:
    
    • Introduction of new classes
    
    • Class and instance methods
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    • Calling a method (called messaging)
    
    • Declaration of attributes (and automatic synthesizing of accessor methods from them)
    
    • Static and dynamic typing
    
    • Blocks are enclosed code portions and may be executed at any moment
    
    • Protocols and categories as extensions to the fundamental language
    
    Don't worry if we're unfamiliar with these Objective-C features right now. As we continue reading this essay, you will discover more about them. If we are procedural programmers new to object-oriented notions, it may be helpful to see an object as a structure with related methods. This concept is not too distant from the truth, especially regarding runtime implementation.
    
    In addition to offering the majority of abstractions and methods available in other object-oriented programming languages, Objective-C is a highly dynamic programming language, which is its most significant feature. It is dynamic in that it allows the behavior of an application to be decided as it is running (i.e., during runtime) as opposed to being fixed when the application is developed. Thus, the dynamic nature of Objective-C liberates a program from limitations imposed during compilation and linking; it pushes the majority of symbol resolution responsibilities to runtime when the user is in control.
    
    CLASSES AND OBJECTS
    
    As with most other object-oriented programming languages, Objective-C classes enable data encapsulation and specify the operations performed on that data. An object is a class's instance during runtime. It holds a copy of the instance variables specified by its class and pointers to the class's methods. An object is created in a two-step method known as allocation and initialization.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The Objective-C definition of a class involves two independent components: the interface and the implementation. The interface section includes the class declaration and specifies the class's public interface. Like C, we create header and source files to segregate public declarations from implementation details. (Other declarations are included in the implementation file if they are part of the programmatic interfaces but are intended to be private.) The filename extensions for these files are mentioned in the table below.
    
    Extension | Source Type
    ---------|-----------
    .h      | Files with headers. Header files include declarations for classes, types, functions, and constants.
    .m      | Files for implementation. This extension indicates that the file contains both Objective-C and C code. It is also known as a source file.
    .mm     | Files for implementation. This extension allows C++ code to be included in Objective-C and C code implementation files. Use this extension only if our Objective-C code refers to C++ classes or features.
    
    When including header files in our source code, add a pound import (#import) directive as one of the first lines in a header or source file; an #import directive is similar to C's #include directive, but it ensures that the same file is never included more than once. Import the framework's umbrella header file in Objective-C, which has the same name as the framework, if we need to import most or all of the framework's header files. The following is the syntax for importing the (fictitious) Gizmo framework's header files:
    
    ```objective-c
    #import <Gizmo/Gizmo.h>
    ```
    
    The syntax for declaring a class called MyClass in Objective-C, which inherits from the base (or root) class, NSObject, is shown below. (A root class is one from which all other classes directly or indirectly derive.) The @interface compiler directive begins the class definition and concludes with the @end directive. The name of the parent class comes after the class name (and is separated by a colon). A class in Objective-C can only have one parent.
    
    Declaration of members and method.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Declarations of properties and methods are written between @interface and @end. These declarations provide the class's public interface. ("Declared Properties and Accessor Methods" describes declared properties.) A semicolon is used after each property and method declaration. Place declarations for any custom methods, constants, or data types related to the class's public interface outside the @interface…@end block.
    
    Similar syntax applies to class implementations. It starts with a @imple-
    mentation directive followed by the class's name and concludes with a @
    end directive. Method implementations exist in the middle. (Function
    implementations should not be placed inside the @implementation… @
    end block.) Always import the interface file as one of the initial lines of
    code in an implementation.
    
    #import "MyClass.h"
    
    @implementation MyClass
    - (id)initWithString:(NSString *)aName
    
    {
        // here the code goes
    }
    
    + (MyClass *)myClassWithString:(NSString *)aName
    {
        // here the code goes
    }
    @end
    
    Objective-C provides both dynamic and static typing for variables hold-
    ing objects. The class name is included in the variable type declaration for
    statically typed variables. Instead, dynamically typed variables utilize the
    object's type id. In some cases, dynamically typed variables are employed.
    Dynamically typed variables are used in a collection object such as an
    array (where the exact types of the included objects are uncertain). Such
    variables provide for increased dynamism and flexibility in Objective-C
    programming.
    
    This example displays variable declarations that are statically and
    
    dynamically typed:
    
    MyClass *myObject1;  // Static-typing
    id       myObject2;  // Dynamic-typing
    NSString *user_Name;  // From our First iOS App 
    (static typing)
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The initial declaration has an asterisk (*). Object references in Objective-C must always be pointers. Don't be concerned if this criterion does not make total sense to us. We don't have to be a pointer specialists to start Objective-C programming. Just remember to insert an asterisk in front of the variable names for statically typed object declarations. The id type implies a pointer.
    
    METHODS AND COMMUNICATION
    
    If we are new to object-oriented programming, it may be helpful to conceive of a method as an object-specific function. We invoke its method by sending a message to, or messaging, an object. In Objective-C, there are two types of methods: instance methods and class methods.
    
    A method whose execution is restricted to a specific instance of a class is an instance method. In other words, we must construct an instance of the class before using an instance method. Instance methods are the most prevalent method type.
    
    The execution of a class method is limited to the method's class. An object instance doesn't need to be the recipient of a message.
    
    The method's declaration includes the method type identifier, a return type, one or more signature keywords, and information on the argument type and name. Here is the method declaration for insertObject:atIndex: instance.
    
    Declaration of object.
    
    A minus sign precedes the declaration of instance methods (−), whereas class methods are indicated by a plus sign (+). The section titled "Class Methods" describes class methods in greater detail.
    
    The actual name of a method (insertObject:atIndex:) is the concatenation of all signature keywords, including colons. The colon characters indicate that a parameter is present. In the preceding illustration, the method accepts two parameters. If a method has no parameters, the colon following the first and only signature keyword is omitted.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    When calling a method, a message is sent to the object that implements the method. (Although "sending a message" is commonly used as a synonym for "calling a method," the actual sending is performed by the Objective-C runtime.) A message comprises the method's name and the parameter information required (properly conforming to type). All messages sent to an object are dispatched dynamically, making the polymorphic behavior of Objective-C classes possible. (Polymorphism refers to the capacity of various object types to respond to the same message.) Occasionally, the method invoked is implemented by a superclass of the receiving object's class.
    
    ---
    
    Functional Programming    ◾    187
    
    For the runtime to dispatch a message, a message expression is necessary. A message expression encloses the message (along with any necessary parameters) within brackets ([and]) and, just inside the leftmost bracket, the object receiving the message. For instance, the following syntax is used to send the insertObject:atIndex: message to an object held by the myArray variable:
    
    [myArray insertObject:anObject atIndex:0];
    
    To avoid declaring multiple local variables to store interim results, we can nest message expressions in Objective-C. Each expression's return value is used as a parameter or as the receiving object of another message. To retrieve the values, we could, for instance, replace any of the variables used in the previous example with messages. Consequently, if we had another object named myAppObject with methods for accessing the array object and the object to insert into the array, you could have written the preceding example as follows:
    
    [[myAppObject theArray] insertObject:[myAppObject objectToInsert] atIndex:0];

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    For invoking accessor methods, Objective-C additionally supports a dot-notation syntax. Accessor methods get and set an object's state, which is critical to encapsulation, a fundamental aspect of all objects. Objects conceal or encapsulate their state and provide a standard interface for all instances to access that data. We may rewrite the preceding example using dot-notation syntax as follows:
    
    [myAppObject.theArray insertObject:myAppObject.objectToInsert atIndex:0];
    
    For assignment, we may also use dot-notation syntax:
    
    myAppObject.theArray = aNewArray;
    
    This is merely another way of saying [myAppObject setTheArray: aNewArray];. A reference to a dynamically typed object (object of type id) is not used in a dot-notation expression.
    
    We've already used dot syntax to assign a variable in our First iOS App:
    
    self.user_Name = self.textField.text;
    
    
    188    ◾    Objective-C
    
    CLASS METHODS
    
    Even though the preceding examples send messages to an instance of a class, it is also possible to send messages to the class itself. (A class is a runtime-generated object of type Class.) When communicating with a class, the method you specify must be a class method rather than an instance method. Class methods in C++ are comparable to static class methods.
    
    Class methods are frequently used as factory methods to create new class instances or to access shared information associated with the class. The syntax for a class method declaration is identical to that of an instance method, except that the method type identifier is preceded by a plus sign (+) instead of a minus sign (−).
    
    Following is an example of using a class method as a factory method for a class. In this instance, the array method is a class method on the NSArray and NSMutableArray classes that allocates, initializes, and returns a new class instance.
    
    NSMutableArray *myArray = nil;  // nil is essentially same as NULL
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    // Create new array and assign it to myArray variable.
    myArray = [NSMutableArray array];
    
    Properties and Accessor Methods Are Declared
    
    The property is some data encapsulated or stored by an object in the broadest sense. It is either an attribute or a relationship to one or more other objects, such as a name or a color. The class of an object defines an interface that allows users of its objects to retrieve and modify the values of encapsulated properties. The methods that carry out these operations are referred to as accessor methods.
    
    There are two categories of accessor methods, each of which must adhere to a naming convention. The "getter" accessor method that returns a property's value has the same name as the property. A "setter" accessor method has the form setPropertyName:, with the first letter of the property name capitalized. Properly named accessor methods are essential to several Cocoa and Cocoa Touch framework technologies, including key-value coding (KVC), a mechanism for indirectly accessing an object's properties via their names.
    
    Functional Programming ◾ 189
    
    Declared properties provide a notational convenience for the declaration and implementation of accessor methods in Objective-C. In our First iOS App, the user_Name property was declared:
    
    @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *user_Name;
    
    Declared properties avoid the need to implement getter and setter methods for each accessible property in the class. Instead, we use the property declaration to indicate the desired behavior. The compiler can then generate (or synthesis) real getter and setter methods based on that declaration. Declared properties decrease the amount of boilerplate code we have to write, making our code clearer and less prone to errors. To acquire and set items of an object's state, use defined properties or accessor methods.
    
    In our class interface, we put property declarations with method declarations. Public properties are declared in the class header files, whereas private properties are declared in a class extension in the source file. Controller objects, such as delegates and view controllers, should typically have private properties.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The @property compiler directive is used in the basic property declaration, followed by the type information and the property name. Custom options can describe how the accessor methods operate, whether the property is a weak reference and whether it is read-only. Following the @property directive, the alternatives are in parentheses.
    
    The lines of code below demonstrate a few additional property declarations:
    
    @property (copy) MyModelObject *theObject;  // Copy object during assignment.
    @property (readonly) NSView *rootView;   // Declare only getter method.
    @property (weak) id delegate;         // Declare delegate as weak reference
    
    The compiler automatically synthesizes declared properties. When a property is synthesized, it generates accessor methods for it and a private instance variable that "backs" the property. The name of the instance variable is the same as the property's name but with an underscore prefix (_). In methods for object initialization and deallocation, our App should directly access an instance variable (rather than its property).
    
    
    190    ◾    Objective-C
    
    We can override auto synthesis and explicitly synthesize a property to give an instance variable a new name. In the class implementation, use the @synthesize compiler directive to instruct the compiler to build the accessor methods and the appropriately named instance variable.† As an example:
    
    @synthesize enabled = _isEnabled;
    
    In addition, when we declare a property, we may give custom names for the accessor methods, which are commonly used to force the getter methods of Boolean properties to have a standard form, as illustrated here:
    
    @property (assign, getter=isEnabled) BOOL enabled; // Assign the new value, change name of getter method
    
    BLOCKS
  - |-

    </think>
    
    Here is the text with formatting errors fixed:
    
    A block in Objective-C is an object that encapsulates a work unit or code segment that may be performed at any moment. Essentially, they are anonymous, portable functions that may be sent as inputs to methods and functions or returned from methods and functions. Blocks contain typed argument lists and may have an inferred or stated return type. Additionally, we may assign a block to a variable and then call it like we would a function.
    
    A caret (^) is used to denote blocks syntactically. There are additional, well-known syntax norms for block arguments, return values, and body (the executed code). The following diagram illustrates the syntax for assigning a block to a variable.
    
    Blocks.
    
    † Write Objective-C Code
    
    Functional Programming ◾ 191
    
    The block variable may then be accessed as if it were a function:
    
    int result = myBlock(4); // result 28
    
    A block shares local lexical scope info. If you implement a method and that method specifies a block, the block has access to the method's local variables and arguments (including stack variables) and functions and global variables, including instance variables. If a variable is defined with the __block modifier, its value is modified inside the block. As long as there is a reference to the block, the local variables continue even after the method or function inside the block has returned and its local scope has been deleted.
    
    As arguments of a method or function, blocks might act as callbacks. When called, the method or function does some work and, at the proper times, calls back to the code that initiated it through the block to seek further information or acquire program-specific behavior. Blocks make it possible for the caller to give the callback code at invocation. Instead of encapsulating the necessary data in a "context" structure, blocks collect data from the same lexical scope as the host method or function. As the block code does not need to be implemented in a distinct method or function, the implementation code may be simplified and made easy to comprehend.

    Many Objective-C framework methods use block arguments. For instance, the Foundation framework's NSNotificationCenter class specifies the following function with a block parameter:
    
    - (id)addObserverForName:(NSString *)name object:(id)obj queue:(NSOperationQueue *)queue usingBlock:(void (^)(NSNotification *note))block
    
    This technique installs a notification center observer (notifications are discussed in Streamline our App with Design Patterns). When a notice with the specified name is posted, the block is called to handle it.
    
    ```objc
    opQ = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:@"CustomOperationCompleted"
                                                     object:nil queue:opQ

            // handle notification
        }];
    ```
    
    ---
    
    **PROTOCOLS AND CATEGORIES**
    
    A protocol specifies methods that may be implemented by any class, even if those classes do not share a superclass. Protocol methods create behavior that is agnostic to specific classes. Protocols merely specify an interface that other classes must implement. When your class implements a protocol's methods, it is said to conform to that protocol.
    
    A protocol specifies a set of methods that forms a contract between objects without needing them to be instances of a specific class. This contract allows these items to communicate with one another. One object wants to inform another object about the events it is experiencing, or it may seek guidance on these occurrences.
    
    The UIApplication class implements an application's needed functionality. Instead of requiring you to subclass UIApplication to get basic messages on the current status of the application, the UIApplication class provides these notifications by invoking particular methods of the delegate object it has allocated. An object that implements the UIApplicationDelegate protocol's methods may receive these alerts and respond appropriately.

    </think>
    
    Here is the text with formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:
    
    In the interface block, you indicate that your class adheres to or adopts a protocol by enclosing the protocol's name in angle brackets (<…>) following the name of the class from which our class inherits. In our First iOS App, you adopted the UITextFieldDelegate protocol in the following line of code:
    
    @interface HelloEveryoneViewController : UIViewController <UITextFieldDelegate> {
    
    We are not required to declare the protocol methods that we implement.
    A protocol's declaration resembles that of a class interface, with the distinction that protocols do not have a parent class and do not have instance variables (although they can declare properties). The following is a basic protocol declaration with only one method:
    
    @protocol MyProtocol
    - (void)myProtocolMethod;
    @end
    
    Adopting a protocol for many delegate protocols is as simple as implementing the techniques described by that protocol. Some protocols need us to say that you support the protocol explicitly, and protocols might have both required and optional methods.
    
    When we start looking through the header files of the Objective-C frameworks, we'll come across something like this:
    
    @interface NSDate (NSDateCreation)
    
    This line defines a category by surrounding the category's name in parentheses, per syntax standard. A category is an Objective-C language feature that allows us to expand the interface of a class without subclassing. The category's methods become part of the class type (within the program's scope) and are inherited by all subclasses of the class. We may send a message to any class instance (or its subclasses) to activate a category-defined method.
    
    Categories are used to organize similar method declarations inside a header file. Even distinct category definitions are included in separate header files. These strategies are used throughout the frameworks' header files for clarity.

    We may also use a class extension, which is an anonymous category,  
    to specify private properties and methods in the implementation (.m)  
    file. The only difference between a class extension and a category is the  
    absence of text between the parenthesis. Here is an example of a typical  
    class extension:
    
    @interface MyAppDelegate ()
    @property (strong) MyDataObject *data;
    @end
    
    Types and Coding Strategies Are Defined
    
    Several words in Objective-C cannot be used as variable names because 
    they are reserved for particular uses. These words are compiler instructions 
    with at-signs (@) prefixes, such as @interface and @end. Other restricted 
    phrases include specified types and their associated literals. Objective-C 
    employs a variety of types and literals that are not included in ANSI C. In 
    some instances, these types and literals substitute their ANSI C equiva-
    lents. The following table lists some of the essential literal types and the 
    permitted literals for each.
    
    194    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Type
    
    Description and Literal
    
    id
    
    The kind of dynamic object. For both dynamically and statically typed objects, 
    the negative literal is nil.
    
    Class The kind of dynamic class. Its negative literal is Nil.
    SEL
    
    A selector's data type (typedef); this data type reflects a method signature at 
    runtime. It is inverse literal NULL.
    
    BOOL A Boolean expression. YES and NO are the literal values.
    
    These specified types and literals are frequently used in error-checking 
    and control-flow programs. We may test the proper literal in our pro-
    gram's control-flow statements to determine how to continue. As an 
    example:
    
    NSDate *dateOfHire = [employee dateOfHire];
    if (dateOfHire != nil) {
        // handle this
    }
    
    To summarize, if the object indicating the date of hire is not nil if it is a 
    real object, then the reasoning proceeds on a certain path. Here's a quick 
    technique to perform the same branching:
    
    NSDate *dateOfHire = [employee dateOfHire];
    if (dateOfHire) {
        // handle this
    }
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    We can trim these lines of code even further (assuming we don't need a  
    reference to the dateOfHire object):
    
    if ([employee dateOfHire]) {
        // handle this
    }
    
    We handle Boolean values in a similar manner. The isEqual: method in  
    this example returns a Boolean value.
    
    BOOL equal = [objectA isEqual:objectB];
    if (equal == YES) {
        // handle this
    }
    
    Functional Programming    ◾    195
    
    Shorten this code similarly to the code that checks for the lack or exis-
    tence of nil.
    
    In Objective-C, sending a message to nil has no negative consequences.  
    There  is  no  consequence  other  than  the  runtime  returning  null  if  the  
    method should return an object. Return values from messages delivered  
    to nil are guaranteed to function as long as they are of the object type.
    
    The self and super are also key reserved concepts in Objective-C. The  
    first word, self, is a local variable that may refer to the current object inside  
    a message implementation; it is analogous to this in C++. The reserved term  
    super may be substituted for self, but only as of the recipient of a message  
    expression. If we send a message to self, the runtime first searches for the  
    method implementation in the current object's class; it searches for it in its  
    superclass if it cannot find it there. When a message is sent to a super, the  
    runtime first searches for the method implementation in the superclass.
    
    Both self and super is mostly used for transmitting messages. When the  
    self class implements the method to call, we send a message to the self. For  
    instance:
    
    [self doSomeWork];
    
    In dot notation, the self is also called the accessor method created by a  
    defined property. As an example:
    
    NSString *theName = self.name;
    
    Messages to super are frequently sent in overrides (reimplementations)  
    of methods inherited from a superclass. The method invoked in this sce-
    nario has the same signature as the method overwritten.

    At the app level, the audio session manages audio behavior. Explore the  
    AVAudioSession class in further detail.

    We will utilize AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback for this example.  
    Even when the Ring/Silence switch is silent, and the screen is locked, this  
    plays audio. To maintain simplicity, we will place this code in the App  
    Delegate.
    
    196    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Open 
    the App Delegate 
    implementation file 
    in our project 
    (AppDelegate.m).
    
    Add code to the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function to set the 
    audio session type. Ensure that the AVFoundation framework is imported.
    The following code is required to guarantee that audio is played when 
    expected. Without setting this code, we cannot hear the video while the 
    mute button is used.
    
    For simplicity in the example, we've placed this in the App delegate.
    
    //  AppDelegate.m
    //  Simple VideoPlayback
    
    #import "AppDelegate.h"
    #import <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h>

    // Override point for the customization after 
    // application run
    
    NSError *categoryError = nil;
    BOOL success = [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback 
    error:&categoryError];
    
    if (!success)
    {
            NSLog(@"AppDelegate Debug - Error setting 
    AVAudioSession category.  Because of this in

    Build View Controller Class Declaration
    
    Include the Brightcove SDK in the View Controller class.
    
    Import the Brightcove Player SDK Header File into the Program
    
    For the Brightcove Player SDK, add the following import statement:
    
    @import BrightcovePlayerSDK;
    
    Look at the Code
    
    The View Controller header has now been finished. Here is the complete 
    code:
    
    //  ViewController.h
    //  Simple VideoPlayback
    
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    @import BrightcovePlayerSDK;
    
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController
    
    @end
    
    Construct the View Controller Implementation in Objective-C
    
    In Objective-C to play a video from the Brightcove catalog service, update 
    the View Controller implementation.
    
    Customize the Project to Reflect Our Values
    
    To  access  our  Video  Cloud  account,  enter  the  token  and  playlist  id 
    values.
    
    This example displays a video returned using the Brightcove Playback 
    API, the most recent and recommended API for retrieving material from 
    our Video Cloud library.

    static NSString * const kViewControllerVideoID = @"our video id";
    
    Declare Properties
    
    Add the following class declarations to the ViewController interface section:
    
    • Brightcove delegates are added to the UI. This enables our App to respond to video playback events.
    
    • The BCOVPlaybackService class defines methods for getting data from the Playback API asynchronously.
    
    • The BCOVPlaybackController class defines methods for controlling playback capability.
    
    • Defines the Brightcove UI controllers' player view.
    
    • This property defines the video container view.
    
    @interface ViewController () 
    <BCOVPlaybackControllerDelegate>
    
    @property (nonatomic, strong) BCOVPlaybackService *playbackService;

    @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UIView *videoContainer;

    DEFINE INITIALIZATION METHOD
    
    In the ViewController implementation section, write an init function that calls the setup method defined in the next step.
    
    @implementation ViewController
    #pragma mark - Setup Methods
    
    - (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder
    {
        self = [super initWithCoder:coder];

            [self setup];
        }
        return self;
    }
    
    Setup Player
    
    • Create a setup function underneath the init function invoked when the App loads.
    
    • Creates a playback controller using the shared manager. The BCOVPlayerSDKManager class in Objective-C is a singleton that allows us to build additional SDK-related objects.
    
    • Optional: We must transmit our Video Cloud Account ID to Video Cloud Analytics if you override the BCOVVideo class or do not utilize the Brightcove player and playback service or catalog. You can now access data for this App in Video Cloud Analytics.

    Configure Player
    
    Do the following in the viewDidLoad function:
    
    •  Using the usual VOD structure, create and configure the Brightcove 
    
    player controls.
    
    •  The player view is added as a subview to the main view.
    
    •  Turn off the auto-resize mask.
    
    •  To establish dynamic constraints for the player view, use Auto Layout.
    
    •  The player view is assigned to the associated global variable.
    
    •  The player view is linked to the playback controller.
    
    •  This method invokes the requestContentFromPlaybackService func-

    Code Management
    
    IN THIS CHAPTER
    
     ➢ Frameworks
     ➢ Memory Management
     ➢ System Design
    
    In the previous chapter, we covered functional programming, and in this 
    chapter, we will discuss code management with its relevant examples.
    
    Allocate memory for each object used by our program. It must be deal-
    located when the object is no longer needed so that our application utilizes 
    memory as effectively as possible. To prevent memory leaks and references 
    to nonexistent objects, it is essential to comprehend Objective-memory C's 
    management environment.
    
    Unlike  C#,  Objective-C  does  not  employ  trash  collection.  Instead,  it 
    employs  a  reference-counting  environment  that  monitors  the  number 
    of  instances  of  an  object.  As  long  as  at  least  one  reference  to  the  object 
    exists, the Objective-C runtime guarantees that the object is in memory. 
    Nevertheless, if there are no longer any references to the object, the run-
    time is permitted to release it and utilize the memory for something else. 
    If we attempt to access an object after it has been released, your application 
    may probably crash.

    208    ◾    Objective-C
    
    In Objective-C, there are two mutually incompatible methods for man-
    
    aging object references:
    
    •  Send ways to manually add or reduce the number of references to an 
    
    object.
    
    •  Allow the new automated reference counting (ARC) mechanism in 
    
    Xcode 4.2 (and later) to perform the job for you.
    
    •  Although ARC is the recommended method for managing memory 
    in new programs, it is still vital to understand what is going on below 
    the hood. The first section of this chapter demonstrates how to man-
    ually track object references, followed by a discussion of the practical 
    ramifications of ARC.

    A framework is conceptually just a mechanism to modularize compiled  
    code. Frameworks are the best approach to sharing code reused inside and  
    outside your company. They make maintaining library dependencies sim-
    pler than managing a binary package and a global header.
    
    A framework is a specific kind of macOS bundle (and macOS bundles  
    are simply files) intended for usage by developers. Often, a framework bun-
    dle includes development resources (typically statically-built libraries and  
    interface headers), but it may also include graphics, storyboards, xibs, and  
    property list files.
    
    A compiler may extract built binaries from a framework and link them  
    during build or run time. The Finder presents bundles with a .framework  
    extension as regular folders for easy review by a developer.
    
    Due  to  these  unique  characteristics,  framework  bundles  need  precise  
    directory layouts  and file placements to function successfully, especially  
    for their most frequent use, binary code distribution.
    
    WHY MUST WE PERFORM THIS?
    
    There are several reasons why we would want to design a framework and  
    a few reasons why we must. Frameworks are the ideal approach for us and  
    our  developers  to  provide  built  libraries  for  usage  outside  our  business.  
    They  may  also  make  the  structure  of  a  large  application  much  easier  to  
    maintain since we can divide the application into many targets and man-
    age each project individually. Fundamentally, there are three fundamental  
    reasons why frameworks exist:
    
    Code Management    ◾    209
    
    •  Modularity: Remove and replace independent portions of your source  
    without worrying about weird compiler errors or linker issues. Work  
    on discrete portions of our codebase.
    
    •  Reuse:  Group-related  processes  so  that  they  are  reused  across  our  
    
    application or applications.
    
    •  Encapsulation: Develop portions of your codebase to be wholly inde-
    
    pendent and interference-free.
    
    We  are  likely  already  familiar  with  these  concepts.  However,  due  
    to the intricacies of establishing a framework, many individuals avoid  
    doing so.
    
    However,  if  we're  designing  iOS  applications  that  are  more  complex  
    
    than the most fundamental, we should consider frameworks.
    
    ANATOMY OF A FRAMEWORK
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    There are several methods to build and package a framework bundle, and  
    our decisions should be based on how you see the framework being used  
    in production. If we've never done anything like this before, it's good to  
    familiarize ourselves with Apple's instructions on framework bundles  
    before proceeding.
    
    Typically, a structure includes the following:
    
    • Compilation of binary code: A well-constructed framework should 
    
    have numerous binaries for various processor architectures.
    
    • Interface header: Since this is Objective-C, we will need to supply 
    
    headers for each class in our framework.
    
    • Different resources: Sometimes, frameworks are utilized to distrib-
    ute additional resources. There are always better methods to share 
    resources that belong to our code, such as a dedicated resources 
    package. Thus we would not recommend doing this.
    
    STATIC AND DYNAMIC FRAMEWORKS
    
    There are two types of frameworks: static and dynamic. The distinction 
    between the two is precisely as it sounds: static frameworks are connected 
    during the construction phase, while dynamic frameworks are linked dur-
    ing the compilation phase.
    
    Apple's frameworks are all dynamically linked, whereas yours may be 
    either. Before iOS 8, dynamic linking of frameworks is only supported on 
    macOS; however, it is now supported on iOS.
    
    Static frameworks might increase your application's disc size and build 
    time since the complete binary is transferred and linked during the build. 
    Dynamic frameworks only employ the necessary portions of the frame-
    work at build time and execute linking during runtime, possibly increas-
    ing your App's start time but decreasing its total disc size.
    
    A further benefit of dynamic frameworks is that frameworks are updated 
    
    without rebuilding the application since linking occurs on every startup.
    
    Dynamic frameworks are unquestionably the more current approach, 
    but there are excellent reasons to utilize static frameworks, particularly for 
    code distributed outside the enterprise.
    
    ARCHITECTURES AND SLICING OF PROCESSORS

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
     Typically, a  framework's  binaries  include  many copies of the same code 
    tailored  to  various  processor  architectures.  These  parts  are  called  slices 
    since they are combined into a single binary. To construct an appropriate 
    framework, we must include slices for each version of the ARM instruc-
    tion set used by iOS devices that we want to support and a slice for the 
    specific x86 version of iOS used by the iPhone simulator.
    
    DEVELOPING A DYNAMIC STRUCTURE
    
    Creating a dynamic framework using Xcode is far less complicated than 
    we may believe. We will create the ExampleKit framework in this example, 
    which includes the EKObject data structure and the EKSession processing 
    object. We can locate both classes in this location, but we shouldn't inter-
    act with them just yet.
    
    Create a new Xcode project to begin. Select "Cocoa Touch Framework" 
    and name our project ExampleKit. Building a git repository for our project 
    is a smart idea.
    
    SETTING UP OUR PROJECT
    
    Let's examine what Apple's template currently gives us before we continue.
    
    •  We  already  have  an  umbrella  header  with  explicit  instructions  for 
    
    importing public headers.
    
    •  All required construction stages are currently in place.
    
    •  Setting code signing to "do not code sign."
    
    Code Management    ◾    211
    
    As we'll see when we construct a static framework, these are advanta-
    geous qualities. Apple has completed the majority of the challenging tasks 
    for us. We simply need to specify a deployment target, the minimal version 
    of iOS we want to support.
    
    DEVELOPING OUR CODE
    
    If we've previously created an iOS App target, we're likely acquainted with 
    "target membership." We know that resources are included in the App's 
    "copy resources" build phase, implementation files must be included in the 
    "compile sources" build phase, and header files are not typically specified 
    in an App's build phases.
    
    Add both classes to your project and ensure that they have been copied 
    to the source directory. After doing so, ensure that both.m files are mem-
    bers of our framework's "ExampleKit" target.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    **Headers are also part of the construction process and must be target members when constructing a framework. We may have previously seen that the target membership option is accessible in the file inspector.h files. Add them as additional members of the target.**
    
    **ACCESS CONTROL**
    
    When we uploaded the header files to the target, we were also presented with an access control picker. Ensure both header files are set to "Public" as opposed to "Project" or "Private."
    
    These names are somewhat deceptive; all headings will be accessible to our customers and searchable in the finder, but headers must be expressly made public to be imported into the umbrella header. In general, we should place headers that our customers should use in "Public" and headers that are particular to our library's implementation in "Project" and "Private." They are not hidden but won't appear in code completion, won't be imported in our umbrella header, and are commonly recognized as not being used outside the framework. (This is something Swift permits that Objective-C does not – real file and project privacy.)
    
    **UMBRELLA HEADER**
    
    Regarding the umbrella header, we must return and make our newly created class interfaces visible. This allows them to be imported with a single sentence. In the ExampleKit.h file, import them as follows:
    
    ```objective-c
    #import <ExampleKit/EKObject.h>
    #import <ExampleKit/EKSession.h>
    ```
    
    **UNIVERSAL SUPPORT**
    
    We're using an Xcode template explicitly intended for developing dynamic frameworks, so most of the setting has already been completed. Compile our code once to ensure that everything is functioning properly before continuing.
    
    Remember when we were discussing the business of slicing? Xcode will only construct our framework for the specified platform and related slices. Thus, if we develop an iPhone simulator, we will get a framework with an x86 slice but no ARM slice. If we develop for iPhones, we will get a framework with arm slice(s). However, simulator support is not included.

    ### Notes:
    - I have corrected the shell script syntax (e.g., `=~` for regular expression matching instead of `=˜`).
    - Fixed the formatting and structure to make it more readable.
    - Removed any extraneous or broken formatting that was likely due to OCR errors.
    
    Let me know if you need this script adapted for a specific use case.

    Instead of simply naively copying and pasting this script, ensure we comprehend its purpose. You may need to adjust it for future Xcode releases and our project's particular settings. It may be advantageous to add the script as a separate file rather than entering it straight into Xcode so that we can more easily manage it using version control.  
    
    This step may not be necessary for every framework build throughout the development process since it might lengthen the duration of the build. Several methods exist for separating the platform binding script:  
    
    • We might manually activate and disable it in the build steps of our target.  
    • We might construct our script only to execute when the RELASE setting is used.  
    • Instead of adding the script to our main target's build phases, we might establish a new aggregate target, connect our framework target as a dependency, and add the script to that target's build phases.  
    
    The first choice is the simplest. Precede our opponent's construction stages as the final phase. Then, just construct our target for "Generic iOS Device," and we're done; however, we will need to deactivate and re-enable the script as required.  
    
    The second alternative is similarly rather straightforward. Simply enclose our script in an if statement and determine if the build configuration is configured for release:  
    
    if [ $CONFIGURATION == Release ]; then  
    # script-here  
    fi  
    
    My preferred option is the third one. Create a new aggregate target with the name "Framework." Then, add our dynamic framework target as a dependency and instead add our script to the new "Framework" target. Then, construct the "Framework" target for "Generic iOS Device" when

    building a universal binary, and only the framework target when building 
    a binary containing slices exclusively for the presently chosen platform.
    
    UTILIZING OUR DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK
    
    framework  differs  somewhat 
    
    Our  dynamic 
    from  using  Apple's 
    OS-integrated  dynamically  linked  frameworks.  Because  we're  supplying 
    the binary as part of our App, we must embed it, so the runtime knows to 
    load and link it from inside the App upon startup.
    
    DEVELOPING A STATIC FRAMEWORK
    
    Constructing a static framework is more complex than building a dynamic 
    framework since Xcode does not provide a suitable template. Due to this, 
    we must begin with Xcode's static library template and add scripting to 
    package the static library as a framework appropriately.
    
    SETTING UP OUR PROJECT
    
    Create a new Xcode Project and choose the "Cocoa Touch Static Library" 
    template  this  time.  Again,  give  this  project  the  name  "ExampleKit"  and 
    create a git repository beside it.
    
    We  will  see  some  variations  if  we  construct  the  dynamic  framework 
    before reaching this point. EmampleKit.h does not seem to be intended as 
    an umbrella header. It defines an interface for a class named ExampleKit 
    and includes a .m file for implementing the class.
    
    Start  by  addressing  this  issue:  remove  the  interface  definition  from 
    
    ExampleKit.h and delete ExampleKit.m.
    
    DEVELOPING OUR CODE
    
    As  in  the  previous  example,  our  static  framework  will  consist  of  two 
    classes: EKObject and EKSession. Both are offered here. Add all four files 
    to your project and ensure that EKObject.m and EKSession.m are included 
    in your ExampleKit static library target.
    
    ACCESS CONTROL
    
    Previously, we could apply access control to each header by adding it to the 
    target and selecting its access control level in the file and identity inspec-
    tor. Since this template was not intended to be a framework, such func-
    tionality is not included. We must manually add a headers phase.
    
    Click the plus sign (+) in the upper left corner of the "Build Phases" sec-
    tion of our target's settings to add a new "header phase."

    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text you provided, with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:
    
    ---
    
    Once this is complete, we will be able to add each heading as a member to the target and set a level of access control. Ensure that EKSession.h and EKObject.h are "public," but exclude ExampleKit.h from the target's membership.
    
    UMBRELLA HEADER
    
    Similarly to the dynamic framework, we will expose our headers in the umbrella header to import them all at once. Proceed to ExampleKit.h and import them as follows:
    
    #import <ExampleKit/EKObject.h>
    #import <ExampleKit/EKSession.h>
    
    Construct our "ExampleKit" target and ensure it builds without any issues.
    
    PACKAGING
    
    Because we're using a template intended for a static library, we'll need to modify our target to generate a static framework. Our template does not provide the required directory structure and symbolic links, so we'll need to modify our target's build settings and write a script to do some hard work.
    
    MODIFY BUILD SETTINGS TO SUPPORT STATIC FRAMEWORKS
    
    • Change the Public Headers Search Path option to include/$(PROJECT_NAME).
    
    • Change setting for Dead Code Stripping to NO.
    
    • Change the Style of the Strip to Non-Global Symbols.
    
    Rebuild our static target, then right-click on "libExampleKit.a" and choose "Show in Finder." Our static library has been condensed into a single bundle and some headers. However, there is currently no unified framework.
    
    MODULE SUPPORT
    
    The dynamic framework template automatically generates a module map at build time and installs it in the corresponding directory. Clang Modules are a superior method of importing files than #include (or #import, which is simply #include without the duplication) and are required if we want your framework to be compatible with Swift projects. Create a new empty file with the name "module.modulemap". It requires no target membership.
    
    framework module ExampleKit {
        umbrella header "ExampleKit.h"
    
        export *
        module * { export * }
    }
    
    CREATING THE BUNDLE STRUCTURE
    
    Add the following script as the last build step for our static library target:
    
    set -e
    export FRAMEWORK_LOCN="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PRODUCT_NAME}.framework"
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text you provided:
    
    ```bash
    # Create Directory for the Actual Headers Location for Version A
    mkdir -p "${FRAMEWORK_LOCN}/Versions/A/Headers"
    
    # Symbolically Link Headers to their Parse Directory
    ln -sfh A "${FRAMEWORK_LOCN}/Versions/Current"
    ln -sfh Versions/Current/Headers "${FRAMEWORK_LOCN}/Headers"
    ln -sfh "Versions/Current/${PRODUCT_NAME}" \
    "${FRAMEWORK_LOCN}/${PRODUCT_NAME}"
    
    # Copy the Public Headers Into Their Directory
    cp -a "${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${PUBLIC_HEADERS_FOLDER_PATH}/" \
    "${FRAMEWORK_LOCN}/Versions/A/Headers"
    
    # Create the Module Directory
    mkdir -p "${FRAMEWORK_LOCN}/Modules"
    
    # Copy the Module Map
    cp -f "${SRCROOT}/${PRODUCT_NAME}/module.modulemap" \
    "${FRAMEWORK_LOCN}/Modules/"
    ```
    
    ```bash
     
    218    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Now, regenerate our static library target for "Generic iOS Device." 
    Display our libExampleKit.a product in the finder and examine it! We will 
    now note that the "ExampleKit.framework" is now included in addition to 
    the regular build products. Double-clicking should reveal a package with 
    the correct structure for an Objective-C framework.
    
    UNIVERSAL SUPPORT
    
    Similarly to the Dynamic Framework, you must use a script to generate the 
    target for both platforms and combine their binaries into a single multi-
    slice binary. This script differs somewhat from the dynamic framework, 
    but only slightly. Since we're essentially merging files that a script rather 
    than Xcode generated, we'll need to refer to them using an environment 
    variable named "STATIC LIB." This script is executed each time you wish 
    to make a fat binary, similar to the dynamic framework. There are many 
    ways to decouple it from our usual build process to allow us more develop-
    ment freedom.

    Utilizing our static library in Xcode is equivalent to utilizing any of Apple's dynamically linked-platform frameworks. We do not need to mention ExampleKit.framework as an embedded binary; just add it to our App target's "Linked Libraries and Frameworks" target and verify that our framework bundle resides inside the app project folder. We may get a finished version of the static ExampleKit framework and a properly connected application.
    
    RECOMMENDATIONS
    
    Developing a universal structure is just half of the fight. Suppose we want to provide our framework for usage by more than a few individuals with particular use cases in mind. In that case, there are a few things we should do to ensure that it will operate in a completely foreign codebase regardless of the circumstances.
    
    Creating a decent framework cannot be reduced to a collection of rules; it requires a whole shift in perspective. We must consider that our user is an engineer who may attempt to accomplish various things with our framework. They may get access to secret implementations, subclass things they shouldn't, and put our custom data structures in collections in unforeseen ways. They may create terrible code, retain items in memory for too long, or apply our programming patterns poorly. Our objective is to generate as many potential situations as possible and prepare for them in advance.
    Nevertheless, there are a few solutions to a variety of typical issues.
    
    Code Management ◾ 221
    
    COMPILING AND CONSTRUCTING THE FRAMEWORK
    
    To properly construct our framework for simulators and real devices such as iPhones, we must first have appropriate architectural settings.
    
    Open our framework's .xcodeproj file, navigate the build settings tab, and search for the Valid Architectures setting. We will notice that the debug and release options already contain the values armv7, arm7s, and arm64; if not, add them; compatibility with real devices requires these architectures.
    
    We may add the Any Simulator SDK option for Simulators in Debug
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    and Release modes. Add x86 64 and other architectures to this setting.
    
    UPLOADING AN APPLICATION'S FRAMEWORK  
    TO THE APP STORE
    
    Ensure the following before creating a successful archive for our software 
    and sending it to the App Store:
    
    •  If we want to activate bitcode in our framework, ensure that the bit-
    code settings have been added to the framework. Go to the frame-
    work project settings and, for each target, change the Enable Bitcode 
    option to YES for both Debug and Release modes.
    
    Search  for  bitcode  configurations.  Add  -fembed-bitcode  to  both 
    the Debug and Release modes, or add -fembed-bitcode-marker to the 
    Debug mode and -fembed-bitcode to the Release mode.
    
    Add BITCODE GENERATION MODE to the User Defined set-
    tings  section,  and  then  add  bit  code  for  both  Debug  and  Release 
    modes, or add a marker in Debug and bitcode in Release mode.
    
    •  Open our App project, navigate to the target App settings, and then 
    to the Build Phases page, where we may add the following Run Script 
    to eliminate incompatible architecture before uploading the build.
    
    Mention the input file path as our.framework file path, such as

    MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN OBJECTIVE-C
    
    Memory  management  is  a  necessary  procedure  in  every  programming 
    language.  It  is  the  process  by  which  objects'  memory  is  allocated  when 
    needed and deallocated when they are no longer needed.
    
    222    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Object memory management is a performance issue; if an application 
    does not release unused objects, its memory footprint expands and perfor-
    mance decreases.
    
    Objective-C memory management approaches may be divided into two 
    
    categories.
    
    •  "Manual Retain-Release" or MRR
    
    •  "Automatic Reference Counting" or ARC
    
    "MANUAL RETAIN-RELEASE" OR MRR
    
    In  MRR,  we  manage  memory  explicitly  by  keeping  track  of  the  items 
    independently. This is accomplished by using a model known as reference 
    counting, which is provided by the Foundation class NSObject in combi-
    nation with the runtime environment.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The only difference between MRR and ARC is that we handle the retain and release manually in the former while handled automatically in the latter.
    The diagram shown below is an example of how memory management works in Objective-C.
    
    Manual retain-release.
    
    The Class A object's memory life cycle is shown in the diagram above. As you can see, the retain count is shown under the object; when the retain count reaches 0, the item is liberated, and its memory is reallocated for other objects to utilize.
    
    The alloc/init function in NSObject is used to construct the Class A object. The number of retains is now 1.
    
    Class B now keeps Class A's object, and Class A's object now has a retain count of 2.
    
    The item is then copied by Class C. It is now constructed as a new instance of Class A, with the same instance variables. The retain count is 1 instead of the original object's retain count. The second horizontal line in the diagram represents this.
    
    Class C uses the release method to release the copied object, which causes the retain count to drop to 0 and the item to be destroyed.
    
    The retain count for the original Class A Object is 2, and it must be released twice before it may be destroyed. This is accomplished using Class A and Class B release statements to set the retain count to 1 and 0, respectively. The thing is finally destroyed.
    
    Basic MRR Rules
    
    • We own whatever we make: a method that starts with "alloc," "new," "copy," or "mutableCopy" is used to construct an object.
    
    • We may use retain to acquire ownership of an object: a received object is usually guaranteed to stay valid inside the method in which it is received. That method may also return the object to its invoker securely. Retain is used in two scenarios.
    
    • We use an accessor method or an init method to gain ownership of an object we wish to save as a property value.

    • To avoid the invalidation of an object as a result of another action.
    
    • When we no longer need something, we must give up ownership of it: a release message or an autorelease message is used to relinquish control of an item. Consequently, relinquishing ownership of an item is referred to as "releasing" an object in Cocoa parlance.
    
    • We must not give up ownership of something we don't own: this is a consequence of the previously mentioned policy norms.

    Code Management    ◾    225
    
    "AUTOMATIC REFERENCE COUNTING" OR ARC
    
    Automatic Reference Counting, or ARC, employs the same reference counting approach as MRR, but it inserts the proper memory management method calls for us at build time. For new projects, we are highly recommended to adopt ARC. If we utilize ARC, we usually don't need to know about the underlying implementation details in this chapter, while it could be helpful in some instances.

    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    We do not need to introduce release and retain methods in ARC since  
    the compiler will take care of it. Objective-C core methodology hasn't  
    changed. Internally, it makes it simpler for the developer to write with-  
    out worrying about the retain and release actions, reducing the amount of  
    code written and the risk of memory leaks.
    
    Another notion called garbage collection is utilized in Mac OS X along-  
    side MRR, but it hasn't been acknowledged since its deprecation in OS X  
    Mountain Lion. Furthermore, trash collection was never available for iOS  
    objects. Garbage collection is also not used on OS X while using ARC.
    
    Here's an example of an ARC. Because the online compiler does not 
    
    support ARC, this will not work.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    @interface SampleClass:NSObject
    - (void)sampleMethod;
    @end
    
    @implementation SampleClass
    - (void)sampleMethod {
       NSLog(@"Hello, everyone \n");
    }
    
    - (void)dealloc  {
      NSLog(@"Object deallocated");
    }
    
    @end
    
    int main() {
       /* my first program in the Objective-C */
       @autoreleasepool {
          SampleClass *sampleClass = [[SampleClass alloc]
    init];

          [sampleClass sampleMethod];
          sampleClass = nil;
       }
       return 0;
    }
    
    Effective Procedures Prevent Memory-Related Issues
    
    There are two primary types of problems caused by improper memory 
    management: 
    
    • Releasing or erasing data that is currently in use.
    
    • This often results in the program crashing or, in the worst case, dam-
    
    aged user data.
    
    • Memory leaks result from the failure to release inactive data.
    
    • A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is not released, 
    despite never being utilized again. Our program uses ever-increasing 
    quantities of memory due to memory leaks, which may result in poor 
    system performance or the termination of our application.
    
    DEBUG MEMORY ISSUES USING ANALYSIS TOOLS
    
    We may use the Clang Static Analyzer included in Xcode to find flaws with 
    your code at compilation time.
    
    If memory management difficulties emerge, there are additional
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Tools and approaches we may use to identify and diagnose the problems.
    
    Many of the tools and approaches, including the usage of NSZombie to aid detect over-released objects, are explained in Technical Note TN2239, iOS Debugging Magic.
    
    Instruments may be used to monitor reference counting events and detect memory leaks.
    
    THE GOAL OF MEMORY MANAGEMENT
    
    The objective of any memory management system is to lower a program's memory footprint. Controlling the lifespan of objects produced inside the application accomplishes this. According to memory management best practices, objects should only live for as long as necessary and not a millisecond longer.
    
    iOS and OS X Apps have developed an object ownership model. An internal reference-counting mechanism keeps track of how many owners each object has. When an item is claimed as one's own, the reference count increases by one. The opposite also holds true. After the item is released (when it is no longer needed), its reference count is decreased. As long as the reference count is more than zero, the existence of an object is assured. However, once the count approaches zero, the operating system is permitted to delete it.
    
    Historically, developers manually managed an object's reference count using specific memory management methods supplied by the NSObject protocol. The term for this is Manual Retain Release (MRR). Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is implemented in Xcode 4.2 to insert these method calls automatically.
    
    Avoid Crashing
    
    Manually regulating object ownership may be difficult and time-consuming, mainly because a programmer must remember to surrender possession of the object when using it. This is a routine that is required but not always practicable. This implies that every alloc, retain, and copy call must be paired with a release or autorelease on the same object.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    A memory leak or a dangling pointer will happen if these calls are not balanced. If an object is not released, its underlying memory will never be removed, resulting in a memory leak. Minimal leakage will have no discernible impact on your software. However, if enough memory is used, the software will ultimately crash! In contrast, if we repeatedly attempt to release an object, we will have what is known as a dangling pointer. When we attempt to access the hanging pointer, you will be requesting an invalid memory location, and your software will likely fail once again.
    
    Strong vs Weak
    
    Both strong and weak references exist between things. A strong reference implies ownership; a strong property increments the object's reference count. The referent object is the owner of the referred item. A weak reference means that the object referred to does not possess the referenced item. Weak references do not increase the object's reference count. The lifespan of an item is defined by the number of strong references to it. An item is not released as long as it is strongly referenced. The weak identifies a reference that does not maintain the life of the referred object. If there are no strong references to an object, the weak reference is null.
    
    Strong is the default attribute for object types in ARC. An item is considered "alive" as long as a strong pointer points.
    
    ---
    
    Atomic and Nonatomic
    
    Atomicity relates to the behavior of the class or object in a multithreaded environment. Atomic accessors guarantee that the value is entirely set or retrieved in the thread that is accessing the variable.
    
    In setting or retrieving a specific property, an atomic accessor is considered thread-safe.
    
    Atomic accessors do not guarantee thread safety for the whole class. They merely assure that the property is not accessed during the set.
    
    Making accessors atomic reduces speed since the compiler must run more instructions when accessing our values.
    
    Make them atomic when threads are possible.
    If we know they are not accessed in a threaded environment, make them nonatomic.

    them non-atomic. Therefore, non-atomic is much quicker than atomic.
    
    Nonatomic  is  used  to  indicate  that  the  referenced  object  is  not 
    thread-safe. This indicates that the item cannot handle several requests 
    simultaneously. Defines a reference that does not maintain the object's 
    existence. If there are no strong references to an object, the weak refer-
    ence is null.
    
    DESIGN PATTERNS IN iOS
    
    iOS  design  patterns  aid  in  providing  reusable  solutions  to  common  dif-
    ficulties such as creating complicated code structures and managing code 
    when building Apps. In a nutshell, it's a template for reusing and under-
    standing code.
    
    There  are  several  design  patterns  available  for  creating  seamless  iOS 
    applications. We may know how to construct an iOS App, but to design 
    iOS Apps successfully and efficiently, we must first grasp iOS design pat-
    terns. Although design patterns may not be flashy, and most developers 
    may not pay much attention to them, they are pretty crucial. Design pat-
    terns  are  reusable  solutions  to  typical  software  development  challenges. 
    A design is simply a template that assists developers in writing code that 
    is simple to comprehend and reusable. In addition, the use of design pat-
    terns enables the developer to modify or replace code pieces with relative 
    simplicity and speed.
    
    As a result of how Cocoa has been constructed, Cocoa developers will 
    discover that they are already using iOS patterns. These design patterns 
    are in place to aid developers in adhering to best practices to expedite and 
    simplify the development process.
    
    Code Management    ◾    229
    
    Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design chal-
    lenges. They are templates meant to assist us in writing code that is sim-
    ple to comprehend and reuse. The following are the most frequent Cocoa 
    design patterns:
    
    •  Creational: Singleton
    
    •  Structural: Decorator, Adapter, and Facade
    
    •  Behavioral: Observer and Memento
    
    FAÇADE
    
    The  Facade  design  pattern  creates  a  unified  user  interface  for  a  compli-
    cated subsystem. Instead of providing a collection of classes and APIs to 
    the user, we just offer one basic unified API.
    
    Façade design pattern.

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    This design helps work with many classes, especially if they are challenging to use or comprehend. If the classes beneath the facade are expected to change, the facade class can keep the same API while things change behind the scenes. For example, if you decide to update our backend service, we will only need to alter the code that utilizes our API, not the code within our Facade.
    
    When to Use the Facade Pattern?
    
    • During the development of a complicated subsystem, design patterns provide a straightforward and consistent interface.
    
    • A Facade design pattern is used to split a subsystem into many levels.

    230    ◾    Objective-C
    
    An Illustration of Facade Design Pattern
    The computer startup is the best illustration of a Facade design pattern. Many components, such as RAM, hard disc, and motherboard, are required for the computer to boot. A computer will present all capabilities via a single interface to simplify the process.
    
    The Facade design pattern accomplishes the same goal by concealing the system's complexity and facilitating the client's access to the system.
    
    ---
    
    DECORATOR
    
    The Decorator design dynamically adds behaviors and responsibilities to an object without altering its code. It is an alternative to subclassing in which the functionality of a class is altered by wrapping it in another object. Category and Delegation are two typical implementations of this pattern in Objective-C. Extensions and Delegation are two extremely typical implementations of this paradigm in Swift.
    
    This is used to separate implementation-specific behavior from the generic class. Many iOS UI components, such as UIScrollView, employ delegates to control their behavior. As this is an application-specific job, the UIScrollView class is unaware of the scrolled content. To inform the application of scrolling events, the UIScrollViewDelegate is used. The application may implement the delegate and intercept the scrolling events given by UIScrollView.
    
    When Should We Use a Decorator Pattern?
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    When an expansion is required, the Decorator design pattern is used. For  
    instance, the Windows operating system features need "optional" compo-  
    nents such as the title bar, status bar, and scrollbars.
    
    Objects also implement the "decoration" extension of this design style.  
    These objects have a similar interface, characteristics, superclass, and  
    intermediate superclasses.
    
    Example of Decorator Style Design
    The Decorator dynamically assigns additional object responsibilities. The  
    decorations put on pine or fir trees are known as decorators. Decorate a  
    tree with lights, garland, candy canes, glass ornaments, etc.
    
    The decorations have little influence on the overall aesthetic of the tree,  
    which remains recognized as a Christmas tree regardless of its presence.  
    The installation of lights, which can "light up" a Christmas tree, may dis-  
    play additional functionality.
    
    Code Management    ◾    231
    
    MEMENTO
    
    Memento Pattern keeps our information someplace. This externalized  
    state is later restored without breaking encapsulation; private data stays  
    private. Archiving, Serialization, and State Restoration are examples of  
    Memento pattern implementations.
    
    ADAPTER
    
    The Adapter design pattern transforms a class's interface into another  
    interface that customers anticipate. The adapter makes it possible for  
    classes with conflicting interfaces to collaborate. It decouples the cli-  
    ent from the targeted object's class. Apple employs protocols to do its  
    tasks. Protocols like UITableViewDelegate, UIScrollViewDelegate,  
    NSCoding, and NSCopying may be familiar. Using the NSCopying  
    protocol as an example, any class may implement a standard copy  
    function.
    
    When to Use an Adapter?
    
    • When a third-party class is required, its interface does not match the  
    
    actual application's code.
    
    • In the lack of specialized functionality and limited extensibility, an  
    
    Adapter is used with existing subclasses.

    Illustration of Adapter Pattern  
    Suppose you have a Bird class with the fly() and create sound methods (). Additionally, the ToyDuck class has a squeak() function. Now that you're short on ToyDuck items, you want to replace them with Bird items. Birds possess comparable skills, but their interface is distinct; thus, we cannot use them directly. Consequently, we will use the Adapter pattern. A bird would be our client, whereas ToyDuck would be our customer.
    
    OBSERVER  
    
    The Observer design pattern establishes a one-to-many dependence between objects such that when the state of one object changes, its dependents are immediately alerted and changed. The Observer pattern is simply a publish-and-subscribe paradigm with loose coupling between the topic and its observers. There may be communication between the observer and the observed item without each party knowing a great deal about the other. The observer pattern is implemented in Cocoa in two ways: Notifications and Key-Value Observing (KVO). Delegate: This is used to prevent implementation-specific behavior from being included in the generic class. Many iOS UI components, such as UIScrollView, employ delegates to control their behavior. As this is an application-specific job, the UIScrollView class is unaware of the scrolled content. To inform the application of scrolling events, the UIScrollViewDelegate is used. The application may implement the delegate and intercept the scrolling events given by UIScrollView.
    
    When Should We Use a Decorator Pattern?
    
    When an expansion is required, the Decorator design pattern is used. For instance, the Windows operating system features need "optional" components such as the title bar, status bar, and scrollbars.

    The installation of lights, which can "light up" a Christmas tree, may dis-  
    play additional functionality.
    
    STRATEGY
    
    Strategy pattern permits the modification of an algorithm's behavior dur-
    ing runtime. We may build a family of algorithms using interfaces and 
    encapsulate and make them interchangeable, enabling us to choose which 
    algorithm to execute at runtime.
    
    FACTORY
    
    Factory method design makes adding or deleting new kinds from the 
    codebase easier. We just need a new class and a new factory to create a 
    new type.

    COMMAND
    
    The Command design pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allow-
    ing you to parameterize clients, queue or log requests, and offer undoable 
    activities. The request object connects one or more operations on a single 
    receiver. The Command pattern distinguishes between objects that make 
    a request and those that receive and execute that request. For example, 
    Mechanism of targeted action.
    
    COMPOSITE
    
    The Composite design pattern assembles linked elements into tree struc-
    tures to describe part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to handle indi-
    vidual objects and object combinations consistently. It is a component 
    of the Model-View-Controller aggregation pattern. For example, View 
    Hierarchy.
    
    ITERATOR
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The Iterator design pattern enables sequential access to the components  
    of a collection or other aggregate object without disclosing its underlying  
    representation. The Iterator pattern moves the accessing and traversal of  
    a collection's items from the collection itself to an iterator object. Iterator  
    provides an interface for accessing collection items and maintains the  
    current element's position. Different iterators may implement distinct tra-
    versal strategies. For example, Enumerators.
    
    MEDIATOR
    
    The Mediator design pattern specifies an item that encapsulates how a col-
    lection of things communicate. The mediator encourages loose coupling 
    by preventing objects from explicitly referencing one another, enabling us 
    to modify their interaction independently. This increases the reusability 
    of some items. In this paradigm, a "mediator object" centralizes compli-
    cated communication and control logic across system components. These 
    objects inform the mediator object when their status changes and reply to 
    requests made by the mediator object. Instances include Controller Classes 
    in the AppKit Framework and View Controllers in UIKit.
    
    SINGLETON
    
    The Singleton design pattern assures that a class has only one instance and 
    gives a global point of access to that instance. The class maintains track 
    of its one instance and prevents further instances from being generated. 
    
    234    ◾    Objective-C
    
    Singleton classes should be used when it makes sense for a single object 
    to offer access to a global resource. Typically, it employs lazy loading to 
    generate the instance only when required for the first time.
    
    When Should We Use the Singleton Design Pattern?
    
    If we are needed to manage resources, you should implement this design 
    technique. We must replace a Singleton with a connection pooling HTTP 
    client that is more efficient and resource-friendly.
    
    Illustration of Singleton Pattern
    The Singleton function is indicated when just one instance of a class or a 
    single object copy is required. Global access is allowed for a single instance. 
    It employs a lazy loading strategy to create a single instance on the first 
    attempt.
    
    MVC
    
    •  Models: These are in charge of the domain data or a data access layer 
    that manipulates the data; for example, consider the "Person" or 
    "PersonDataProvider" classes.

    • Views: Views are in charge of the presentation layer (GUI) in the iOS environment; consider everything beginning with the "UI" prefix.
    
    • Controller/Presenter/ViewModel: The glue or mediator between the Model and the View, in general, responsible for adjusting the Model by reacting to user actions on the View and updating the View with Model changes.
    
    MVC model.
    
    Code Management ◾ 235
    
    The ViewController is the owner of the Model and contains the View. The issue is that we used to write both the controller and view code in the ViewController. It complicates the ViewController. That's why it's known as a Massive View Controller. When developing a ViewController test, you must mimic the view and its life cycle. However, opinions are tough to ridicule. And we don't want to fake the view if we're simply testing the controller logic. All of these factors contribute to the difficulty of writing examinations.

    three elements: 
    
    Model View Presenter comprises the Presenter (UIKit-independent mediator), the Passive View (UIView and/or UIViewController), and the Model. This pattern identifies Views as the receivers of UI events, calling the required Presenter. In reality, it is the responsibility of the Presenter to update the View with the new data supplied by the Model. View has a looser connection to the model. Responsible for linking the Model to the View is the Presenter. Interface-based
    
    236 ◾ Objective-C
    
    interaction with the view facilitates unit testing. Typically, View to Presenter Means one-to-one mapping. There may be several speakers for intricate perspectives.
    
    MVVM

    </think>
    
    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and the content extracted verbatim:
    
    ---
    
    In MVVM, the View solely contains visual aspects such as layout, animation, and initializing UI components. The ViewModel is a specific layer that exists between the View and the Model. ViewModel is the authoritative representation of View. In other words, the ViewModel offers a collection of interfaces, each representing a UI component in the View. We utilize the "binding" approach to link UI components to ViewModel interfaces.
    
    Specifically, for MVVM in iOS programming, the View is represented by UIView/UIViewController. We only do:
    
    • Initiate, layout, and display UI components.
    
    • Connect UI elements to the ViewModel.
    
    In contrast, we perform the following in the ViewModel:
    
    • Create controller logic, including pagination and error handling.
    
    • Write presentational logic and give View interfaces.
    
    Feature Assessment
    
    The MVVM View has more responsibilities than the MVP View, even though this is not immediately apparent in our little example. Because the first one changes its state from the View Model by establishing bindings, the second one transmits all events to the Presenter without updating itself.
    
    Testability – the View Model is ignorant of the View, simply allowing us to test it. The View is checked, but as it is dependent on UIKit, we may wish to avoid it.
    
    Easy to use – it has the same amount of code as MVP in our example, but in the actual App, where we would have to send all events from the View to the Presenter and manually update the View, MVVM would be far slimmer if bindings are utilized.
    
    Code Management ◾ 237
    
    VIPER
    
    Difficulties with MVVM:
    
    It is compounded on iOS by the absence of bindings and the inclination to continue transferring too many tasks from a view controller class to a view model class.
    
    Without good, reusable, tested, and single-responsibility components, the use of any MVVM solution is limited.
    
    Simply stating "we're using MVVM" or having a rudimentary implementation of MVVM in a project without analyzing how it improves our code reuse, efficiency, and adherence to the single responsibility principle can mislead us on how beneficial or maintainable the design is.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    VIPER applies Clean Architecture to iOS applications. VIPER in Objective-C is an acronym that stands for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. Clean Architecture separates the logical framework of an application into different levels of responsibility. This makes it easy to separate dependencies (such as our database) and test interactions at layer boundaries.
    
    The main VIPER components are:
    
    • View: It shows what the Presenter instructs it to and communicates user input to the Presenter.
    
    • Interactor: It includes business logic given by a use case.
    
    • Presenter: It contains view logic for preparing material for display (as provided by the Interactor) and responding to user inputs (by requesting new data from the Interactor).
    
    • Entity: It stores fundamental model items used by the Interactor.
    
    • Routing: It contains navigation logic detailing the sequence in which screens are shown.
    
    WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF EMPLOYING iOS DESIGN PATTERNS?
    
    The design pattern improves the definition of interfaces and is device-specific. However, it is entirely up to us to use the code and add it to a particular template. The table below summarizes the advantages of employing iOS design patterns.

    **Optimization Tips**
    **Writing Secure Code**
    **Best Coding Practices**
    **Security and Hardening Ideas**
    
    The previous chapter covered frameworks, memory management, and system design in Objective-C. In this chapter, we will discuss code optimization.
    
    **OBJECTIVE-C CODE OPTIMIZATION AT COMPILE TIME**
    
    Code optimization is developing or rewriting code so that a program utilizes the least amount of memory or disk space, requires the least CPU time or network bandwidth, or makes the most effective use of additional cores.
    
    Code compilation is one of the necessary procedures (together with linking, bundling the resources, code signing, and so on).
    
    Our source code was initially created in a high-level programming language, such as Objective-C, Swift, or C++. It is the compiler's responsibility to convert our high-level source code into low-level machine code to generate an executable program. There are other sorts of compilers, but in the iOS/macOS ecosystem, we only deal with frontend and backend compilers. The frontend translates our source code into an intermediate language that the backend can comprehend. This intermediate representation is converted into machine code by the backend, taking into account the individual operating system and processor architecture. This is the core of these two entities.
    
    Different pipelines exist for Swift and Objective-C, although LLVM supports both.

    LLVM is a large project that consists of LLVM Core as the backend, and Clang as the "LLVM native" frontend for the C language family (C/Objective-C/C++/Objective-C ++), and an interaction protocol between the frontend and backend. The primary component of this protocol is LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) – the intermediate language that can be understood by both the front and back ends. It is irrelevant to LLVM Core whatever front-end generated the source code's IR-code. The Core simply manipulates this representation to build an executable or dynamic library.
    
    OBJECTIVE-C PIPELINE
    
    So the pipeline for good old Objective-C code looks like this:
    
    Objective-C pipeline.
    
    As you can see, the first conversion Clang does on our code is the development of an AST' (Abstract Syntax Tree) – a representation in which all of the functions, operators, variables, declarations, etc. are nodes of a massive semantic tree. Here's an AST example:
    
    $ cat test1.cc
     int f(int y) {
      int result = (y / 42);
      return result;
     }
    
    which then turns into:
    
    $ clang -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only test1.cc
     TranslationUnitDecl 0x5aea0d0 <<invalid 
    sloc>>
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    ... cutting out internal declarations of clang ...
    '-FunctionDecl 0x5aeab50 <test.cc:1:1, 
    line:4:1> f 'int (int)'
      |-ParmVarDecl 0x5aeaa90 <line:1:7, col:11> x 
    'int'
      '-CompoundStmt 0x5aead88 <col:14, line:4:1>
       |-DeclStmt 0x5aead10 <line:2:3, col:24>
       | '-VarDecl 0x5aeac10 <col:3, col:23> result 
    'int'
       |  '-ParenExpr 0x5aeacf0 <col:16, col:23> 
    'int'
       |   '-BinaryOperator 0x5aeacc8 <col:17, 
    col:21> 'int' '/'
       |    |-ImplicitCastExpr 0x5aeacb0 <col:17> 
    'int' <LValueToRValue>
       |    | '-DeclRefExpr 0x5aeac68 <col:17> 'int' 
    lvalue ParmVar 0x5aeaa90 'x' 'int'
       |    '-IntegerLiteral 0x5aeac90 <col:21> 
    'int' 42
       '-ReturnStmt 0x5aead68 <line:3:3, col:10>
        '-ImplicitCastExpr 0x5aead50 <col:10> 'int' 
    <LValueToRValue>
         '-DeclRefExpr 0x5aead28 <col:10> 'int' 
    lvalue Var 0x5aeac10 'result' 'int'
    
    The AST is then translated into LLVM IR, which is lower level 
    (less human-readable), but some parts of the source code may still 
    be understood (a comprehensive description of the language can find 
    here):
    
    int main()
    {
     return 0;
    }
    
    which then turns into

    **242 ◾ Objective-C**
    
    Clang passes LLVM IR to LLVM Core, optimizing (if appropriate) and converting the code to target-specific machine code. Consequently, we have a collection of object files (*.o) that are subsequently linked and combined into an executable or dynamic library. This final output is often referred to as a "a.out," ".dylib," or ".so" file.
    
    As was previously evident, LLVM Core is where code optimization occurs, and Intermediate Representation is the source of these optimizations.
    
    Here are the LLVM optimization levels and their short descriptions:
    
    - **None** [-O0]: The compiler does not optimize source code. With this option, the compiler aims to decrease the cost of compilation and deliver anticipated results from debugging. Statements are independent: if you pause the program with a breakpoint between statements, you may add a new value to any variable or move the program counter to any other statement in the function and get the expected results from the source code. Use this option during development when we intend to resolve logic issues and need a quick compilation time. Do not utilize this shipping option for our executable.
    
    - **Fast** [-O, O1]: The compiler performs simple optimizations to improve code performance while reducing the effect on compile time. Additionally, this option consumes more RAM during compilation.
    
    - **Faster** [-O2]: The compiler executes almost all available optimizations that do not need a trade-off between space and time. This option prevents the compiler from making loop unrolling and function inlining. This option boosts both compilation time and produced code performance.

    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text you provided:
    
    ---
    
    • Fastest [-O3]: The compiler does all optimizations to increase the resulting code's performance. This option may cause the resulting code to be larger since the compiler will aggressively inline routines. (This choice is often not advised.)
    
    • Fastest, Smallest [-Os]: The compiler does all optimizations that do not normally increase the size of the source code. This is the preferable method for shipping code since it reduces the memory footprint of the executable.
    
    ---
    
    Code Optimization ◾ 243
    
    • Quickest and Aggressive Optimisation [-Ofast]: This option allows "Fastest" and aggressive optimizations that may violate stringent standards compliance but should function well with well-behaved code.
    
    SECURE CODE
    
    • Incorrect platform usage: To save sensitive data, use adequate keychain security.
    
    • Keychain safety: Make certain that the program deletes the user's data when the user logs out.
    
    Keychain data linked with the program is not cleared off by default following uninstalling. If a user reinstalls the software and attempts to login with a different user, it may unintentionally provide access to the prior user's account. To avoid this, ensure that the related application's keychain data is checked and deleted when it is launched for the first time after reinstallation. The following code may be used to do the wiping procedure:
    
    ```objective-c
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application 
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        // Clear keychain on the first run in case of reinstallation
        if (![[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@"FirstRun"]) {
            // Delete the values from the keychain here
            [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setValue:@"1strun" forKey:@"FirstRun"];
            [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];
        }
    }
    ```
    
    According to the kSecAttrAccessible property, iOS provides the following restricted protection class:
    
    - kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly: Keychain data can always be accessed, regardless of whether the device is locked or not.
  - |-
    <think>

    Here is the text with formatting errors fixed and all content extracted verbatim:

    locked or not. These data won't include in an iCloud or local backup.
    - kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock: Keychain data can't be accessed after a restart until the device has been unlocked once by the user.
    - kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThis DeviceOnly: Keychain data can't be accessed after a restart until the device has been unlocked once by a user. This attribute items do not move to a new device. As a result, when restoring from a backup of a different device, these items will be missing.
    - kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked: Keychain data can be accessed only while the user unlocks the device.
    - kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly: The data in Keychain item can be accessed only while the user unlocks the device. The data won't include in an iCloud or local backup.
    - kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThis DeviceOnly: Keychain data can be accessed only when the device is unlocked. This protection class is only available if a passcode is set on the device. The data won't include in an iCloud or local backup.
    
    • Unsafe data storage: It is not suggested to store sensitive data on the client-side.
    
    Only the refresh token may be kept locally on the keychain if an application utilizes OAuth for login.
    
    To login while using offline authentication, use Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2.
    
    Security Breach through HTTPS Response Cache
    
    After logging out, it is best to delete any cached replies.
    
    [[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] removeAllCached Responses];
    
    Implement Empemeral configuration property of the URLSession instead of the cookie, which store session-related data in RAM instead of the local cache ..ephmeral

    The cache can also disable by setting cache policy to .notAllowed. It prevents storing cache in memory or disk.

    •  Unsafe communication: It is not suggested to utilize insecure proto-
    
    cols such as HTTP, FTP, and so on.
    
    Sending  sensitive  data  across  other  channels  should  be  avoided  (e.g., 
    
    SMS, MMS, or notifications).
    
    All communication should take place over a secure channel that sup-
    
    ports the following:
    
    SSL versions of protocols are not supported.
    Ciphers with less than 128 bits are not supported.
    Disable the cipher suites NULL, MD5, SHA1, MD4, RC4, and CBC.
    SSL certificates must be valid and issued by a CA.
    App Transport Security is enabled by default in iOS 9 and later (ATS). 
    
    Correctly implement ATS Exceptions.
    
    Ensure that no self-signed or incorrect certificates are allowed in any 
    
    NSURL calls.
    
    It is recommended that only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 be supported.
    To prevent MiTM attacks, use SSL pinning.
    
    SSL PINNING
    
    This may accomplish by developing it from scratch or by utilizing one of 
    the frameworks listed below:
    
    AFNetworking offers a comprehensive network library solution.
    TrustKit is an open-source framework that simplifies the implementa-
    
    tion of SSL pinning on both Objective-C and Swift.

    // Get the local and remote cert data  
    NSData *remoteCertificateData = CFBridgingRelease(SecCertificateCopyData(certificate));  
    NSString *pathToCert = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"github.com" ofType:@"cer"];  
    NSData *localCertificate = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:pathToCert];  
    
    // pinning check  
    if ([remoteCertificateData isEqualToData:localCertificate] && certificateIsValid) {  
        NSURLCredential *credential = [NSURLCredential credentialForTrust:serverTrust];

        completionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeCancelAuthenticationChallenge, NULL);

    •  Unsafe authentication: Implement the following session depending on the application's business requirements:
    
    •  We propose terminating the user's session if it is inactive for more than 5 minutes in highly sensitive applications.
    
    •  If the program returns from a background state, users must be re-authenticated.
    
    •  If the user hit the logout button, correctly terminate the user's session on both the client and server sides.  
    Because ephemeral sessions do not employ persistent storage, they are the best practice.
    
    •  Inadequate cryptography: The preferred technique for symmetric encryption is AES, with a key of at least 128 bits and a safe mode.
    
    Asymmetric encryption should use RSA with 2048 bits or ECC with a safe curve.
    
    Use arc4random() for random number generators instead, as it is an unsafe method in Objective-C.
    
    For safe random number generation, use SecRandomCopyBytes.  
    Avoid employing the cryptographic methods described below since they are insecure.
    
    •  DES, 3DES  
    •  RC2  
    •  RC4  
    •  BLOWFISH

    The algorithms listed below are recommended:  
    Algorithms for confidentiality: AES-GCM-256 or ChaCha20-Poly1305.  
    SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Blake2, and the SHA-3 family are examples of integrity algorithms.  
    
    Algorithms for digital signatures: RSA (3072 bits and higher), ECDSA with NIST P-384.  
    RSA (3072 bits and higher), DH (3072 bits and higher), ECDH with NIST P-384.  
    
    • Insecure authorization: Applications should avoid utilizing ID references with guessable numbers.  
    Server-side authorization checks should perform.  
    Enforce authorization checks on all server-side requests.  
    
    • Client code reliability  
    • Overflow of Buffers  
    • Avoid using unsafe functions like sprintf(), gets(), and getpw()  
    • It is recommended that a limit size be enforced for str buffer gets  
    s(str, sizeof(str));  
    • To avoid overflow or underflow attacks, provide the following security flags in your application.  
    
    – While developing Apps, enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). It is enabled by default in iOS 4.3 and macOS 10.7. Prior to this release, we had to explicitly activate it by including the -pie parameter.  
    
    – The application should build with the Non-Executable (NX) flag set (-allow stack execute). This enables the operating system to identify specific sections of memory as non-executable.  
    
    – To reduce the possibility of corruption, enable stack canaries.  
    
    – The -fstack-protector option allows stack canaries only for functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes (e.g., a string on the stack), and is enabled by default when building for macOS 10.6 and later.  
    
    – The -fstack-protector-all switch allows stack canaries to be enabled for all functions.

    –  D_FORTIFY_SOURCE:  It  adds  static  and  dynamic  bounds 
    checking to a number of routines that would otherwise have 
    none  (sprintf,  vsprintf,  snprintf,  vsnprintf,  memcpy,  memp-
    cpy,  memmove,  memset,  strcpy,  stpcpy,  strncpy,  strcat  and 
    strncat).  Only  compile-time  inspection  is  performed  if  the 
    level is set to 1 (-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1). When building 
    for macOS 10.6 and later, Level 1 is enabled by default. Level 2 
    includes extra run-time verification.
    
    –  MallocCorruptionAbort:  An  environment  variable  that 
    instructs 32-bit Apps to abort malloc calls if the heap struc-
    ture is corrupted. Aborting on heap corruption is enabled by 
    default in 64-bit Apps.
    
    •  Control flow expressions like "if," "for," "while," "switch," and "try" 
    
    should not be too nested.
    
    •  In the case of an exception, implement an appropriate error-handling 
    
    mechanism:
    
    void save() {
        try {
            saveDocument();
        } catch (const std::exception& ex) {
            log << "Exception while saving document: "  
    << ex.what();
        }
        }
    
    •  Tampering  with  the  Code:  The  Mobile  Security  Testing  Guide 
    describes the following factors that might make debugging an appli-
    cation difficult:1
    
    ptrace:  This  is  the  most  popular  system  call  used  by  Apps  to 
    
    observe and manipulate other processes.
    
    •  Excessive functionality: Remove any secret backdoor functionality 
    or other internal development security controls that are not meant to 
    be released into production.
    
    Check  all  security  protections  are turned  on  in  the  production 
    
    environment.
    
    250    ◾    Objective-C
    
    In the production environment, do not save any sensitive data in the 
    
    log file.
    
    BEST PRACTICES WITH OBJECTIVE-C CODING  
    CONVENTION
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The majority of these standards are intended to align with Apple's documentation and community-accepted best practices. Some are influenced by personal tastes. This section tries to provide a standard method of doing things so that everyone follows the same procedure. It is suggested to do something we do not particularly enjoy in order to be consistent with everyone else.
    
    This section is primarily intended for iOS development, although it also applies to Mac.
    
    Operators
    
    NSString *foo = @"bar";
    NSInteger answer = 52;
    answer += 8;
    answer++;
    answer = 50 + 2;
    
    To be consistent with other operators, the + +, − −, and so on are placed after the variable rather than before it. Unless there is just one operand, operators should always be separated by spaces.
    
    Types
    
    According to Apple's best practices and 64-bit safety, NSInteger and NSUInteger should be used instead of int, long, and so on. For the same reasons, CGFloat is recommended over float. This code is future-proofed for 64-bit systems.
    
    Apple types should be preferred over basic ones. When working with time intervals, for example, use NSTimeInterval rather than double, even if they are equivalent. This is considered recommended practice and results in more readable code.
    
    Methods
    
    - (void)someMethod {
        // Do the stuff
    }
    
     
    Code Optimization ◾ 251
    
    - (NSString *)stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:(NSString *)target withString:(NSString *)replacement {
        return nil;
    }
    
    Always leave a space between the − or + and the return type ((void) in this case). A space should never separate the return type and method name.
    
    A space should never use before or after a colon. There should always be a space between the class and the * if the argument type is a pointer.
    
    Always provide a space between the method's finish and the opening bracket. The initial bracket should never appear on the line after it.
    
    Between methods, there should always be two new lines. This corresponds to several Xcode templates (though they vary somewhat) and improves readability.
    
    Pragma Mark and Implementation Organization
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    An example of a UIView:
    
    #pragma mark - NSObject
    - (void)dealloc {
        // Release..
        [super dealloc];
    }
    
    #pragma mark - UIView
    - (id)layoutSubviews {
        // Stuff..
    }
    
    - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {
        // Drawing-code
    }
    
    Methods should group by inheritance. If some UIResponder methods 
    were utilized in the preceding example, they should be placed between 
    the NSObject and UIView methods because that is where they fall in the 
    inheritance chain.
    
    Control Structures
    
    After the control structure, there should always be a space (i.e., if, 
    else, etc.).
    
    ---
    
    If/Else
    
    if (button.enabled) {
        // Stuff..
    } else if (otherButton.enabled) {
        // Other stuff..
    } else {
        // More stuff..
    }
    
    Else statements should start on the same line as the previous if statement.
    
    // Comment explaining conditional
    if (something) {
        // Do-stuff
    }
    
    // Comment explaining alternative
    else {
        // Do the other stuff
    }
    
    If we want to include comments around the if and else statements, use 
    
    the structure shown above.
    
    Switch
    
    switch (something.state) {
        case 0: {
            // Something..
            break;
        }
    
        case 1: {
            // Something..
            break;
        }
    
        case 2:
        case 3: {
            // Something..
            break;
        }
    
        default: {
            // Something..
            break;
        }
    }
    
    Each case should have brackets surrounding it. If more than one case is 
    used, they should be on distinct lines. The default case should always be 
    the last case and present.
    
    For
    
    for (NSInteger x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
        // Do something..
    }
    
    for (NSString *key in dictionary) {
        // Do something..
    }
    
    When iterating with integers, it is preferable to begin at 0 and use rather 
    than begin at 1 and use <=. In general, fast enumeration is desired.
    
    While
    
    while (something < somethingElse) {
        // Do-something..
    }
    
    Import

    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    Always use `@class` in header files instead of `#import` whenever feasible  
    because it gives a modest compile-time performance gain.
    
    Because the `@class` directive reduces the amount of code viewed by  
    the compiler and linker, it is the easiest approach to provide a forward  
    declaration of a class name. Because it is basic, it avoids possible issues  
    that may arise when importing files that import other files. If one 
    class defines a statically typed instance variable of another class and 
    their two interface files import one other, neither class will compile 
    successfully.
    
    ---
    
    **Header Prefix**
    
    It is preferable to include frameworks that are utilized in the majority of a 
    project with a header prefix. If these frameworks are in the header prefix, 
    they should never import into project source files.
    
    For example, consider the following header prefix:
    
    ```objc
    #ifdef __OBJC__
        #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
        #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    #endif
    ```
    
    `#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>` should never occur in the project 
    
    outside of the header prefix.
    
    ---
    
    **Properties**
    
    ```objc
    @property (nonatomic, retain) UIColor *topColor;
    @property (nonatomic, assign) CGSize shadowOffset;
    @property (nonatomic, retain, readonly) 
    UIActivityIndicatorView *activityIndicator;
    @property (nonatomic, assign, getter=isLoading) BOOL 
    loading;
    ```
    
    If the attribute is nonatomic, it must come first. The next choice should 
    always be `retain` or `assign` since omitting it results in a warning. If it is given, 
    `readonly` should be the next choice. In header files, `readwrite` should never 
    be provided. Only in class extensions should `readwrite` be utilized. Last 
    should be the getter or setter. Setter should use sparingly.
    
    ---
    
    **Private Methods and Properties**
    
    **MyShoesTier.h**
    
    ```objc
    @interface MyShoesTier : NSObject {
    
        .....
    }
    
    @property (nonatomic, retain, readonly) MyShoe *shoe;
    
    .....
    
    @end
    ```
    
    ---
    
    **Code Optimization** ◾ **255**
    
    **MyShoesTier.m**
    
    ```objc
    #import "MyShoesTier.h"
    ```
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:
    
    ```
    @interface MyShoesTier ()
    - (void)_crossLace:(MyLace *)firstLace withLace:(MyLace *)secondLace;
    @property (nonatomic, retain, readwrite) MyShoe *shoe;
    @property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *laces;
    @end
    
    @implementation MyShoesTier
    
    ...
    
    @end
    
    Because a named category cannot be used if it adds or alters any properties, private methods should always be introduced in a class extension.
    
    Note: The above example demonstrates an authorized usage of a read-write attribute.
    
    Extern, Const, and Static
    
    extern NSString *const kMyConstant;
    extern NSString *MyExternString;
    static NSString *const kMyStaticConstant;
    static NSString *staticString;
    
    Naming
    
    Everything should prefix with a 2–3 letter prefix in general. Longer prefixes are permissible but not preferred.
    
    If the code is application-specific, it is a good idea to prefix classes with an application's particular name. If we want to use the code in other Apps or open-source, it is a good idea to do something unique to us or our firm for the prefix.
    
    Here are a few examples if our firm is Awesome Buckets and you have an application called Bucket Hunter:
    
    ABLoadingView // Simple view that can be used in other applications
    
    BHAppDelegate // Application specific code
    BHLoadingView // 'ABLoadingView' customized for Bucket Hunter application
    
    Enums
    
    enum {
        Foo,
        Bar
    };
    
    typedef enum {
        SSLoadingViewStyleLight,
        SSLoadingViewStyleDark
    } SSLoadingViewStyle;
    
    typedef enum {
        SSHUDViewStyleLight = 9,
        SSHUDViewStyleDark = 13
    } SSHUDViewStyle;
    
    HARDENING OF SYSTEMS
    ```
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Systems hardening refers to a set of tools, approaches, and best practices  
    for reducing vulnerability in technology applications, systems, infrastruc-
    ture, firmware, and other domains. The purpose of system hardening is to  
    decrease security risk by removing potential attack channels and compress-
    ing  the  attack  surface  of  the  system.  By  deleting  unnecessary  programs,  
    functions, Apps, ports, permissions, access, and so on, attackers and mal-
    ware have less possibilities to build a foothold within our IT environment.
    System hardening necessitates a systematic strategy to auditing, iden-
    tifying,  closing,  and  controlling  any  security  vulnerabilities  throughout  
    our firm.
    
    Hardening of Systems to Reduce the "Attack Surface"
    
    The  "attack  surface"  is  the  sum  of  all  potential  faults  and  backdoors  in  
    technology that hackers can exploit. These flaws can manifest themselves  
    in a variety of ways, including:
    
    •  Passwords, both default and hardcoded.
    
    •  Plain text files are used to store passwords and other credentials.
    
     
     
    Code Optimization    ◾    257
    
    •  Vulnerabilities in unpatched software and firmware.
    
    •  BIOS, firewalls, ports, servers, switches, routers, or other infrastruc-
    ture components that are not properly set.
    
    •  Network traffic or data at rest that is not encrypted.
    
    •  Inadequacy or lack of privileged access controls.
    
    Advantages of System Hardening
    
    Continuous work is required for system hardening; however, the invest-
    ment will pay off in significant ways across your business via:
    
    •  Enhanced system functionality: Because there are fewer applications  
    and functions, there is less danger of operational errors, misconfigu-
    rations, incompatibilities, and compromise.
    
    •  Significantly  better  security:  A  smaller  attack  surface  means  less  
    danger of data breaches, illegal access, system hacking, or malware.
    
    •  Simplified compliance and audibility: Because there are fewer pro-
    grams  and  accounts  and  a  less  complicated  environment,  auditing  
    the environment is typically more visible and accessible.

    Objective-C programming language is a general-purpose, object-oriented  
    programming language that extends the C programming language with  
    Smalltalk-style messaging. Before the introduction of Swift, it was the pri-
    mary programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operat-
    ing systems and their corresponding application programming interfaces  
    (APIs):  Cocoa  and  Cocoa  Touch.  In  the  early  1980s,  the  programming 
    language Objective-C was created. It was chosen as the primary program-
    ming language for NeXT's NeXTSTEP operating system, from which OS 
    X and iOS inherit. Portable Objective-C applications that do not utilize the 
    Cocoa or Cocoa Touch libraries, or use components that may be ported or 
    re-implemented for other platforms, can also be built for any system sup-
    ported by GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or Clang.3
    
    Objective-C "implementation" software files typically have.m filename 
    extensions, but Objective-C "header/interface" files have.h filename exten-
    sions, the same as C header files. The file extension for Objective-C++ doc-
    uments is .mm.
    
    Objective-C was built principally by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their 
    firm Stepstone in the early 1980s. Both were exposed to Smalltalk at the 
    Programming  Technology  Center  of  ITT  Corporation  in  1981.  The  first 
    work on Objective-C dates back to about that time.
    
    In  1986,  Cox  presented  the  initial  explanation  of  Objective-C  in  his 
    book Object-Oriented Programming, An Evolutionary View. Although he 
    was cautious to note that the issue of reusability involves more than sim-
    ply the language, Objective-C was often compared with feature of other 
    languages. In 1988, the language was licensed, and the NeXTSTEP code 
    library was built.
    
    Apple Computer utilized OpenStep in its new operating system, Mac 
    OS X, after purchasing NeXT in 1996. This includes Objective-C, Project 
    Builder, NeXT's Objective-C-based developer tool, and Interface Builder, 
    its  interface  design  tool  (both  now  merged  into  one  Xcode  application).

    The majority of Apple's current Cocoa API is built on OpenStep interface objects, and it is the most important Objective-C development environment in use today.
    
    Swift, which Apple launched at WWDC 2014, was described as "Objective-C without the C." The Objective-C programming language has a lengthy history. Although it has languished as a niche language for most of that time, the arrival of the iPhone has rocketed it to popularity: Objective-C was named the winner of the TIOBE Programming Language Award for 2011 in January 2012. This award is given to the language with the highest use growth over the past 12 months; in 2011, Objective-C jumped from eighth to the fifth position on the index.
    
    The origins of Objective-C may be traced to a section of International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) where Tom Love and Brad Cox sought to increase the productivity of programmers. In 1981, a special edition of Byte magazine presented Smalltalk, a breakthrough new programming language created by Alan Kay and his colleagues at Xerox PARC. Smalltalk introduced a whole new way of conceiving program development, which Kay termed "object-oriented." Instead of writing a program as a set of operations ("procedures") that accept data as inputs, a program would be re-oriented around the data itself, which would be organized into "objects." Smalltalk envisioned programs as collections of objects that would exchange messages, therefore invoking "methods" (perform actions). The invoked methods were chosen "dynamically," that is, while the program was executing. A Smalltalk application may edit itself in real-time in reaction to human input.

    Objective-C has been around for 35 years, making it older than many current macOS and iOS software developers. Swift, which debuted in 2014, is swiftly gaining momentum and displacing Objective-C from the market. Observations indicate that about half of the most popular applications in the App Store are created in Swift, which is a significant increase in just 5 years.
    
    The million-dollar issue is whether developers should consider Objective-C for new iOS projects or go for Swift from the beginning. Let's examine the present state of Objective-C.
    
    First, nobody has ever heard any official word from Apple on the deprecation of Objective-C support or even a possible date when it would be discontinued. A large amount of code created in Objective-C is still being maintained, and a large number of popular applications are built in this language. Consider: who would commit to transferring all those
    
    Appraisal ◾ 261
    
    applications to a different language simply for its purpose? Imagine the amount of time and money that such a project would need with no apparent return.
    
    Thus, we can conclude that Objective-C will continue to exist in the foreseeable future. Objective-C programmers may rest confident that their talents will continue to be in demand. With new applications and young developers picking the language to learn, the situation is different.
    
    A COMPARISON OF OBJECTIVE-C AND SWIFT
    
    Let's analyze how Objective-C compares to Swift and what might tip the scales in this matter to determine if it's a smart idea to choose it as the language for our new iOS App project.
    
    Let's explore the differences between Objective-C and Swift in further depth.
    
    • Objective-C's performance is sluggish owing to runtime code compilation. According to an official Apple release, Swift is 2.6 times more efficient than Objective-C.

    • Objective-C inherits its code structure from C and, as a result, has a syntax with several special symbols that is reasonably difficult. On the other hand, Swift is similar to plain English, making its learning curve simpler than that of Objective-C.
    
    • The primary difference in code safety is how Objective-C and Swift handle null pointers. A null pointer in Objective-C does not result in an application crash, making it challenging to identify and repair. In Swift, however, null pointers result in easily identifiable crashes. Overall, Objective-C applications may include more hidden problems than Swift applications.
    
    • Objective-C demands the maintenance of two code files: time- and effort. With Swift, we need to maintain a single code file, reducing the time and human labor required.
    
    • Objective-C often requires more lines of code than Swift.
    
    • Objective-C lacks support for dynamic libraries and instead utilizes static ones. They are bulkier and hinder application performance. Swift utilizes dynamic libraries that decrease the size of the whole application and improve its performance and quickness.

    ADVANTAGES OF OBJECTIVE-C
    
    • The language was built as a preprocessor GCC package for current C compilers.
    
    • C++ is more compatible with Objective-C.
    
    • Objective-C has more stability.
    
    • Private API use is simplified in Objective-C.
    
    NEGATIVES OF OBJECTIVE-C
    
    • Contrary to C++, Objective-C does not enable operator overloading.
    
    • The original version of Objective-C did not enable garbage collection but still utilizes a C-based runtime, which increases the application's size.
    
    Appraisal ◾ 263
    
    • Since it is based on C Compilers, it requires a header file to function properly.
    
    • Objective-C is a rather complicated language, although this is anticipated given its antiquity.
    
    SHOULD WE GO FOR OBJECTIVE-C?
    
    As can be seen, even a cursory comparison of the primary features of both languages reveals that Swift is superior to Objective-C. Moreover, one of Objective-C's last advantages over Swift has lately been eliminated.
    
    Swift 5, the most recent version of the programming language, has ABI stability, a significant step toward attaining outstanding performance and security. Swift's lack of ABI stability was a significant issue until recently, but it has been addressed.
    
    With the release of the newest version of Swift, Apple is pushing developers to utilize it for future iOS applications. The youthful language has a lot of unique benefits over the older and more demanding Objective-C, so it makes sense.
    
    WHY SHOULD WE LEARN OBJECTIVE-C IN 2022?
    Most macOS, XCode, and iOS kernel codes are written in C and C++. Since Objective-C is officially not a programming language but rather a huge preprocessor for pure C, it "fits in" with them rather well.

    Objective-C is the foundation of Apple's whole ecosystem. Swift is mainly built on top of it. Therefore it is necessary to know the "base" to understand how the system works from the inside and why Swift looks and functions as it does.
    
    Objective-C helps in understanding, for instance, that not all NSProxy objects are NSObject and the distinction between Int, NSInteger, and NSNumber. In addition to how Swizzling works, what a Selector is, how the responder chain operates, etc. This is strongly enclosed and abstracted in Swift, so it is not readily apparent.
    
    In addition, like any C language, Objective-C facilitates an understanding of the fundamental operation of links, pointers, and memory.
    
    Objective-C Is Still Used in the Development
    
    First, it seems that every project that has lasted for more than 2–3 years has Objective-C code. It may be at least a hidden layer that is made reliant 
    
    264    ◾    Objective-C
    
    and does not truly fit into the common code base, but it exists and requires periodic maintenance: bug fixes and feature additions.
    
    While certain Apps cannot be rebuilt in Swift, doing so would involve time and money that neither the firm nor the client is willing to spend. Consequently, the Objective-C database is expanding.
    
    Thirdly, if complicated work with network, memory, and device resources is required, languages with a lower level of abstraction than Swift are used. Depending on the amount of abstraction required, it may be Objective-C, Objective-C++, or just C and C++.
    
    Swift is More Complex Than Objective-C for Some Tasks
    
    Swift problem-solving may be tedious and tricky; using long-established Objective-C crutches is more convenient.
    
    Primarily, we discuss memory management: to insert a message into unauthorized memory, one must actively control memory management or threads. Let us examine some instances.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Memory allocation, handling pointers and links directly, etc., are examples of Objective-C's purely "sish" aspects. Using Objective-C, you may thus gently optimize the program and increase speed and memory estimations when you must work very carefully with memory (such as when dealing with video and audio streams). You must use ARC while programming in Swift (although there are also life hacks here).
    
    Furthermore, ARC does not resolve several issues, such as the lifetime of an object. Consider that there is a 14-minute voicemail. The customer has already listened to 12 – and they "ate up" the entire RAM. In Objective-C, they may be readily purged at the level of pointers and bytes, leaving just the current minute and the two preceding seconds. And on Swift, this will need a high degree of abstraction and a significant amount of code (or using Objective-C tricks via the Swift interface).
    
    C++ is also used to create libraries that implement video or image recognition, computer vision, and cryptographic computations. And connecting with them through Swift is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Typically, it is simpler to build a header file in Objective-C, write a few methods for a nice wrapper, and refer to them immediately. Such occurrences are prevalent when connecting with third-party libraries.
    
    OBJECTIVE-C LANGUAGE CHARACTERISTICS
    
    We should be experienced with reading Objective-C code and mentally understanding how the runtime functions. This section examines the 
    
    Appraisal    ◾    265
    
    language and its semantics in further detail; it deconstructs the mental model we've constructed based on our intuition and exposes the principles that comprise Objective-C.
    
    Strong and Weak Citations
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    A significant portion of programming Objective-C involves handling the references that running code has to objects and the references that objects hold to one another. Before introducing ARC, Objective-C used manual memory management on iOS and garbage collection on OS X. Both of these strategies have their benefits and drawbacks. Now it employs ARC, which incorporates the most advantageous elements of both approaches.
    
    Automatic Reference Counting, or ARC, is a compile-time system that inserts manual memory management calls into the code as it is con-
    structed. The compiler is quite intelligent, and the ARC code is well opti-
    mized. While ARC has liberated developers from writing manual memory 
    management code, it cannot break reference cycles like garbage collection 
    can-based platforms. For this reason, developers must instruct the com-
    piler on how to prevent reference cycles.
    
    When an item no longer receives strong references, it is deallocated. If 
    it was the last object with a solid reference for another object, that item is 
    likewise deallocated. The diagram depicts a reference cycle.
    
    Reference cycle.
    
    Object A cannot be deallocated until Object C is, and Object C is not 
    deallocated so long as Object B maintains a strong reference. Object B will 
    never be released until Object A has been released. This is a reference cycle, 
    which will lead to memory leaks in an application.
    
    266    ◾    Objective-C
    
    In below figure, the strong connection between Object C and Object 
    A (represented by a solid line) has been replaced with a weak connection 
    (symbolized by a dashed line).
    
    Breaking reference cycle.
    
    Weak references do not prevent objects from being deallocated. 
    Therefore, Object A, Object B, and Object C are deallocated in that order.
    If we have experience with C or C++, we will likely recognize an issue 
    with weak references. If an object may be deallocated and we have a weak 
    reference to it, a dangling pointer may result. With ARC compiling for iOS 
    5 and OS X 10.7, weak references to objects become null upon deallocation; 
    these are known as zeroing weak references.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    iOS 4 and OS X 10.6 do not support the weak keyword used to identify  
    weak references. Hence unsafe_unretained must be used in its place. As  
    its name suggests, it is risky to depend on a reference to an unsafe_unre-  
    tained object. As long as we know this restriction, the application code we 
    create should be safe.
    
    Let's quickly explore the various sorts of Objective-C variables. Local 
    variables belong to their enclosing scope (simply: the surrounding pair of 
    curly brackets) and are only accessible during the execution of that scope. 
    Additionally, there are instance variables, which are valid until the object 
    instance is deallocated.
    
    Local  and  instance  variables  are  both  strong  references  by  default. 
    Properties declared using the @property directive are likewise by default 
    strong. The weak keyword (or, when declaring properties, the weak key-  
    word in the qualifier list) is used to mark variables as weak.
    
    The compiler determines how objects are returned from methods based 
    on their names. Alloc, copy, init, mutableCopy, and new methods return 
    objects that pass ownership to the calling procedure. All other methods 
    
    Appraisal    ◾    267
    
    return  objects  without  transferring  ownership.  The  compiler  uses  this 
    naming convention to insert the relevant memory management code.
    
    id instanceVariable;
    ...
    -(void)performLongRunningTask
    {
    //ARC transfers ownership from copy to local variable 
    id obj = [someObject copy];
    
    //ARC makes new strong reference to obj id anotherObj 
    = obj;
    
    //Transferring to instance varable does not require 
    any memory management code
    //instanceVariable is strong and init returns strong 
    reference instanceVariable = [[SomeObject alloc] 
    init];
    
    } //anotherObj goes out of the scope, and its 
    reference is removed
    
    ARC uses many optimizations to minimize unnecessary memory man-  
    agement code, so the code here is not an exact reflection of what occurs 
    behind  the  scenes.  Nonetheless,  this  is  the  mental  picture  you  should 
    establish as a developer.

    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:
    
    Commonly, strong and weak references are "owned" and "owned by," respectively. When an item has another object, it employs a strong reference. If an item is owned by another object and has a reference to its owner, the reference is weak. This is not adequate reasoning for all references, but it is a helpful method for remembering the memory management principles of Objective-C.
    
    As a specific example, let's examine NSArray. Arrays hold robust references to every element they include. We may consider an array to be the owner of these things, even if other objects may also own them.
    
    The Delegation pattern in Objective-C provides a further illustration. Delegation is a typical technique for using loosely connected callbacks, particularly in user interface programs. A typical example of delegation in iOS is the UITableViewDataSource protocol. View controller-owned table views must know what to present to the user. The view controller must send this information to the table view.

    OBJECTIVE-C: EXCEPTIONS AND ERRORS
    
    There are two sorts of mistakes that can occur when a program runs in Objective-C. Unexpected errors are "serious" programming errors that cause your program to terminate prematurely. These are known as exceptions because they indicate a rare occurrence in your software. On the other hand, expected errors in Objective-C occur naturally throughout the execution of a program and can be utilized to evaluate the success of an activity. These are known as errors.
    
    We might also think of the contrast between exceptions and errors as distinguishing their target audiences. In general, exceptions are used to notify the programmer of a problem, whereas errors notify the user that a requested action is not being accomplished.
    
    Control flow of exception and error.
    
    For example, attempting to access a non-existent array index is an exception (a programming error), but failing to open a file is an error.
  - |-

    Appraisal    ◾    269
    
    (a user error). In the former situation, something went severely wrong in 
    our program's flow, and it should presumably shut down immediately after 
    the exception. In the latter case, we'd want to inform the user that the file 
    couldn't  be  opened  and  potentially  request  that  they  attempt  the  opera-
    tion, but there's no reason our software couldn't continue to operate after 
    the error.
    
    EXCEPTION HANDLING
    
    The primary advantage of Objective-C exception handling features is iso-
    lating error detection from error treatment. When a piece of code detects 
    an exception, it may "throw" exception to the closest error-handling block, 
    which  can  "catch"  and  correctly  handle  particular  errors.  The  ability  to 
    throw exceptions from random places avoids the need to continuously check 
    for success or failure notifications from each function engaged in a given job.
    @try, @catch(), and @finally are used to catch and handle exceptions, 
    whereas @throw is used to detect them. If we have dealt with exceptions in 
    C#, you should be acquainted with these exception-handling constructs.
    
    It is crucial to realize that exceptions in Objective-C are pretty sluggish. 
    Therefore, their usage is restricted to detecting severe programming flaws 
    and  not  for  fundamental  control  flow.  If  you  are  attempting  to  identify 
    what to do in the event of an anticipated problem (e.g., failure to load a 
    file), please refer to the section under Error Handling.
    
    THE CLASS NSException
    
    Instances of the NSException class or a subclass thereof represent excep-
    tions. This is a simple method for encapsulating all the pertinent informa-
    tion about an exception. The three characteristics of an exception are as 
    follows:
    
    •  name – An instance of NSString identifying the exception uniquely.
    
    •  reason – An instance of NSString that describes the exception in a 
    
    human-readable format.
    
    •  userInfo – An instance of NSDictionary containing application-specific 
    
    data about the exception.
    
    The Foundation framework defines several variables defining "standard" 
    exception  names. These  strings  are  used  to  determine  the  kind  of  caught 
    exception.
    
    270    ◾    Objective-C
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    We can also construct new exception objects with custom data using  
    the initWithName:reason:userInfo: initialization method. Custom excep-  
    tion objects may be caught and thrown using the same techniques detailed  
    in the following sections.
    
    MAKING EXCEPTIONS
    
    Let's begin by looking at a program's default exception-handling behavior.  
    When we try to access an index Objective-C that does not exist, the objec-  
    tAtIndex: function of NSArray throws an NSRangeException (a subclass  
    of NSException). So, if we request the tenth item in an array with just three  
    components, we'll have an exception to play with:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        @autoreleasepool {
    
            NSArray *crew = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:
                             @"Shave",
                             @"Lywood",
                             @"Frank", nil];
    
            // throw an exception.
            NSLog(@"%@", [crew objectAtIndex:10]);
    
        }
        return 0;
    }
    
    When an uncaught exception is encountered, Xcode stops the applica-
    
    tion and shows you the line that caused the problem.
    
    NSLog(@"%@", [crew objectAtIndex:10]); thread1: signal 
    SIGABRT
    
    CATCHING EXCEPTIONS
    
    Any code that may result in an exception should be placed in a @try block 
    to  manage  it.  The  @catch()  directive  is  then  used  to  capture  particular 
    exceptions. If we need to run any housekeeping code, we may do so in a 
    
     
     
     
     
    
    @finally block. All three of these exception-handling directives are illus-
    trated in the following example:
    
    Appraisal    ◾    271
    
    @try {
        NSLog(@"%@", [crew objectAtIndex:10]);
    }
    @catch (NSException *exception) {
        NSLog(@"Caught an exception");
        // We will just silently ignore exception.
    }
    @finally {
        NSLog(@"Cleaning-up");
    }
    
    The [crew objectAtIndex:10] message causes the software to throw an 
    NSRangeException, captured by the @catch() command. The real excep-
    tion handling occurs inside the @catch() clause. In this instance, we just 
    show  a  descriptive  error  notice,  but  we'll  likely  need  to  create  code  to 
    address the issue in other situations.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the provided text:
    
    ---
    
    When an exception is detected in the @try block, the program goes to  
    the matching @catch() block, preventing the execution of any code after  
    the exception. This is problematic if the @try block requires cleanup (e.g.,  
    if it opened a file, it needs to be closed). The @finally block resolves this  
    issue since its execution is assured regardless of whether an exception was  
    thrown. This makes it the ideal location to resolve any outstanding issues  
    from the @try block.
    
    After the @catch() directive, the parenthesis allows you to specify the  
    kind of an exception to capture. The exception is an NSException, the basic  
    exception class in this instance. However, an exception may be any type,  
    not simply NSException. The following @catch() directive, for example,  
    will handle a generic object:
    
    @catch (id genericException)
    
    EXCEPTION THROWING
    
    When an exceptional circumstance is detected in our code, we create an  
    instance of NSException and populate it with the necessary details. Then,  
    using the appropriately titled @throw directive, we throw it, causing the  
    nearest @try/@catch block to handle it.

    272    ◾    Objective-C
    
    The following example creates a function for generating random inte-
    gers between a defined interval. The function throws a custom error if the 
    caller supplies an improper interval.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int generateRandomInteger(int minimum, int maximum) {
        if (minimum >= maximum) {
            // Create exception.
            NSException *exception = [NSException
                exceptionWithName:@"RandomNumberIntervalEx
    ception"
                reason:@"*** generateRandomInteger(): "

    than minimum parameter"
                userInfo:nil];
    
            // Throw exception.
            @throw exception;
        }
        // Return a random integer.
        return arc4random_uniform((maximum - minimum) + 1) 
    + minimum;
    }
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        @autoreleasepool {
    
            int result = 0;
            @try {
                result = generateRandomInteger(0, 10);
            }
            @catch (NSException *exception) {
                NSLog(@"Problem!!! Caught exception: %@", 
    [exception name]);
            }
    
            NSLog(@"The Random Number is: %i", result);
    
        }
        return 0;
    }

    This code will not throw an error since it supplies a valid interval (0, 10) to generateRandomInteger(). Change the interval to something like (0, −10), and we'll see the @catch() block in action. When the framework classes receive exceptions, this is what happens beneath the hood (e.g., the NSRangeException raised by NSArray).
    
    We may also re-throw exceptions that you've already caught. This is handy if we want to be notified when an exception occurs but do not want to handle it ourselves. We may easily omit the argument to the @throw directive as a convenience:
    
    @try {
        result = generateRandomInteger(0, -10);
    }
    @catch (NSException *exception) {
        NSLog(@"Problem! Caught exception: %@", [exception name]);
    
        // Re-throw current exception.
        @throw
    }
    
    The caught exception is then sent up to the next-highest handler, which in this case is the top-level exception handler. This should show the output of our @catch() block and the standard Terminating program due to an uncaught exception … message, followed by an abrupt shutdown.
    
    The @throw directive isn't restricted to NSException objects; it may throw anything. Instead of a standard exception, the following example throws an NSNumber object. Also, observe how we may target distinct objects by following the @try block with numerous @catch() statements:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int generateRandomInteger(int minimum, int maximum) {
        if (minimum >= maximum) {
            // Generate number using the "default" 
            // interval.
            NSNumber *guess = [NSNumber
                               numberWithInt:generateRando
    mInteger(0, 10)];
    
     
     
     
    274    ◾    Objective-C
    
            // Throw number.
            @throw guess;
        }
        // Return random integer.
        return arc4random_uniform((maximum - minimum) + 1) 
    + minimum;
    }
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        @autoreleasepool {

    } @catch (NSNumber *guess) {
        NSLog(@"Warning: Used default interval");
        result = [guess intValue];
    } @catch (NSException *exception) {

    }
    
    NSLog(@"The Random Number: %i", result);
    }
    return 0;
    ```
    
    The `generateRandomInteger()` attempts to create a new integer between the specified "default" boundaries rather than producing an NSException object. The example demonstrates how to use `@throw` with various objects, but it isn't the ideal application architecture, nor is it the most efficient use of Objective-C exception-handling facilities. If we truly want to use the thrown value, as the preceding code does, we would be better served with a simple conditional check using NSError, as detailed in the next section.
    
    Furthermore, several of Apple's core frameworks anticipate an NSException object to be thrown, so use caution when integrating with the standard libraries.

    **ERROR HANDLING**
    
    Errors are intended to be an efficient and easy method to determine if an activity was successful or not, while exceptions are intended to alert programmers when something has gone wrong. In contrast to exceptions, errors are intended to be utilized in routine control flow statements.
    
    ---
    
    **THE NSError CLASS**
    
    The only similarity between mistakes and exceptions is that they are both implemented as objects. The `NSError` class incorporates all information required to indicate errors:
    
    - **code** – An `NSInteger` that provides a unique identification for the error.
    - **Domain** – An instance of `NSString` that defines the error's domain (described in more detail in the next section).
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    • userInfo – An instance of NSDictionary containing application-specific data about the problem. This is used far more often than the userInfo dictionary of NSException.
    
    In addition to these essential characteristics, NSError contains many variables that help in displaying and processing errors. These are all shortcuts into the userInfo dictionary given in the preceding list.
    
    • localizedDescription – An NSString holding the error's whole explanation, often including the failure's cause. Typically, this figure is shown to the user via an alert panel.
    
    • localizedFailureReason – An NSString offering an independent explanation of the error's cause. This is only used by customers that want to separate the error's cause from its entire explanation.
    
    • recoverySuggestion – An NSString provides the user with instructions on how to recover from the mistake.
    
    • localizedRecoveryOptions – An NSArray of titles for the error dialog's buttons. A single OK button to dismiss the warning is presented if this array is empty.
    
    • helpAnchor – An NSString to show when the Help anchor button is pressed in an alert panel.
    
    Similar to NSException, the initWithDomain:code:userInfo function may be used to initialize NSError objects with specific data.
    
    ERROR DOMAINS
    
    An error domain is essentially a namespace for error codes. Codes must be distinct within a single domain, although they may overlap with codes from different domains. In addition to avoiding code clashes, domains give information about the source of an issue. NSMachErrorDomain, NSPOSIXErrorDomain, NSOSStatusErrorDomain, and NSCocoaError Domain are the four primary built-in error domains. The NSCocoaError Domain includes error codes for most of Apple's standard Objective-C frameworks; however, some frameworks define their error domains (e.g., NSXMLParserErrorDomain).

    If we need to generate new error codes for your libraries and Apps, we  
    should always add them to your error domain; you should never expand  
    any predefined error domains. Creating our domain is a simple endeavor.  
    Because domains are just strings, we need to specify a string constant that  
    does not clash with any of the application's other error domains. Apple  
    recommends that domains use the form of com.<company>.<project>.  
    ErrorDomain.
    
    DETECTING ERRORS
    
    There are no language constructs devoted to handling NSError objects  
    (though several built-in classes are designed to handle them). They are  
    intended for use with functions that return an object when successful and  
    nil when unsuccessful. Following is the standard approach for capturing  
    errors:
    
    • Declare a variable named NSError. It does not need allocation or  
    
    initialization.
    
    • Pass this variable as a double pointer to a potentially error-prone  
    function. If anything goes wrong, the function will utilize this refer-
    ence to log error-related information.
    
    • Check the function's return value for success or failure. If the action 
    was unsuccessful, we may use NSError to handle or show the problem.

    ---
    
    A function does not typically return an NSError object; instead, it returns the expected result if it succeeds and nil otherwise. Always use the function's return value to discover problems; never use the existence or absence of an NSError object to determine whether an operation was successful. Error objects are intended to describe a possible error, not indicate if one happened.
    
    First, we create a file path to ~/Desktop/SomeContent.txt. Then, we construct an NSError reference and provide it to the stringWithContentsOfFile:encoding:error: method to record any issues when loading the file. We've sent a reference to the *error pointer, which indicates that the function is asking a pointer to a pointer (i.e., a double pointer). This allows the method to supply the variable with its content. Finally, we examine the return value (rather than the existence of the error variable) to determine if stringWithContentsOfFile:encoding:error: succeeded or failed. If it does, we may work with the content variable's value; otherwise, we utilize the error variable to show information about what went wrong.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        @autoreleasepool {
    
            // Generate desired file path.
            NSString *filename = @"SomeContent.txt";
            NSArray *paths = 
    NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(
                                 NSDesktopDirectory, 
    NSUserDomainMask, YES
                             );
            NSString *desktopDir = [paths 
    objectAtIndex:0];
            NSString *path = [desktopDir
                              stringByAppendingPathComponent:filename];
    
            // Try to load the file.
            NSError *error;
            NSString *content = [NSString 
    stringWithContentsOfFile:path
    
    encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding
                                 error:&error];
    
        }
        return 0;
    }

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the provided text:
    
    ```objective-c
    // Check if it is worked.
    if (content == nil) {
        // Some kind of the error occurred.
        NSLog(@"The Error loading file %@!", path);
        NSLog(@"Description: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
        NSLog(@"Reason: %@", [error localizedFailureReason]);
    } else {
        // Content the loaded successfully.
        NSLog(@"Content-loaded!");
        NSLog(@"%@", content);
    }
    }
    return 0;
    }
    
    This code will likely result in an error as the ~/Desktop/SomeContent.txt file does not exist on our computer. Create a SomeContent.txt file on our desktop for the load to succeed.
    
    CUSTOM ERRORS
    
    We may set custom errors by taking a double reference to an NSError object and filling it with your data. Remember that your function or method should return an object or nil depending on its success (do not return the NSError reference).
    
    The following example utilizes an error rather than an exception to handle erroneous arguments sent to the generateRandomInteger() method. Observe that **error is a double-pointer, allowing us to initialize the underlying value inside the method. It is crucial to verify that the user has given a genuine **error argument using if (error != NULL). This is done in functions that generate errors. Since the **error parameter is a double-pointer, the *error parameter may assign a value to the underlying variable. Again, we check for mistakes using the return value (if (result == nil)) rather than the error variable.
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    NSNumber *generateRandomInteger(int minimum, int maximum, NSError **error) {
    
        if (minimum >= maximum) {
            if (error != NULL) {
    
                // Create error.
                NSString *domain = @"com.MyCompany.RandomProject.ErrorDomain";
                int errorCode = 4;
                NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
                [userInfo setObject:@"The Maximum parameter is not greater than minimum parameter"
                             forKey:NSLocalizedDescriptionKey];
    
                // Populate the error reference.
                *error = [[NSError alloc] initWithDomain:domain
                                               code:errorCode
                                               userInfo:userInfo];
            }
            return nil;
        }
    
        // Generate a random integer between minimum and maximum (inclusive)
        int result = arc4random_uniform((maximum - minimum + 1)) + minimum;
    
        return [NSNumber numberWithInt:result];
    }

                NSLog(@"Domain: %@ Code: %li", [error domain], [error code]);

                // Safe to use returned value.

            }

        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    `NSError's` `localizedDescription`, `localizedFailureReason`, and associated attributes are kept in its `userInfo` dictionary using special keys provided by `NSLocalizedDescriptionKey`, `NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey`, and so on. So, to characterize the issue, we just add some strings to the proper keys, as demonstrated in the previous sample.
    
    Generally, we should provide constants for specific error domains and codes to ensure consistency between classes.

    **THE OBJECTIVE-C LANGUAGE'S FEATURES**
    
    Here is a shortlist of factors that, in my opinion, make Objective-C a strong and enjoyable programming language.
    
    **CLASSES ARE OBJECTS**
    
    Each class in Objective-C is an instance of a meta-class produced and handled automatically by the runtime. It is possible to create class methods, pass classes as arguments, store them in collections, etc. We just send a message to the class we want to instantiate to generate an instance. There is no need to redesign a "factory" system. No particular constructor mechanism is required at the language level. This helps to keep the language simple and effective.
    
    Moreover, meta-classes are also objects!
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Similar to Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, and Groovy… Extremely beneficial since we do not always know in advance what our runtime objects will be. Using dynamic typing in Objective-C is straightforward. This, for instance, defines a variable that may store a reference to an object:
    
    id myObject;
    
    
    Appraisal ◾ 281
    
    OPTIONAL STATIC TYPING
    
    Nonetheless, Objective-C also supports static typing. The ideal of both worlds.
    
    This defines a variable capable of storing a reference to an object of type NSView or a subclass:
    
    NSView *myObject;
    
    CATEGORIES
    
    Categories allow us to design new methods and add them to classes whose source code we do not know (such as the standard Cocoa classes provided by Apple). This facilitates class extension without the need for subclassing. Extremely helpful for adapting existing classes to the specifications of frameworks we want to utilize or build.
    
    MESSAGE SENDING
    
    We communicate with things through messages. Typically, the recipient of a message has a method that directly corresponds to the message (i.e., that has the same name or, in Objective-C terms, the same selector). In this situation, the method will be called. Nevertheless, this is not the only potential conclusion. An object may also handle a message by forwarding it to another object, broadcasting it to many objects, introspecting it, applying custom logic, etc.
    
    The Syntax for Expressing Messages
    
    Objective-C's message patterns are similar to natural language phrases with gaps (prefixed with colons). When we create code to convey a message to an object, we fill in the blanks with real data to form a coherent statement. This expressing message is derived from Smalltalk and makes the code extremely expressive.
    
    Sending a message to an ordered collection, for example, requesting it to insert a specified item at index 10:
    
    [myCollection insert:myObject atIndex:10]
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    A message sending expression may be interpreted as a sentence, with  
    the subject being the receiver and the message being the remainder of the  
    sentence (e.g., an action that we want the recipient to perform): "myCollec-  
    tion insert myObject at index 10."
    
    282    ◾    Objective-C
    
    INTROSPECTION
    
    Object introspection is simple. For example, we may ask an object for its  
    class using the following syntax:
    
    [myObject class]
    
    Determine whether an object contains the method "foo":
    
    [myObject respondsToSelector:@selector(foo)]
    
    Request the signature of an object's method "foo":
    
    [myObject methodSignatureForSelector:@selector(foo)]
    
    Ask whether a class is a subclass of another:
    
    [class1 isSubclassOfClass:class2]
    
    DYNAMIC OPERATING TIME
    
    Objective-C has a dynamic runtime. It permits the creation of messages  
    at runtime, the dynamic creation of classes, the dynamic addition of  
    methods to existing classes, the modification of method implementations, etc.
    
    AUTOMATIC GARBAGE COLLECTION
    
    The automated garbage collector works simultaneously with the applica-  
    tion code on its thread. It employs a generational approach to increase effi-  
    ciency by focusing on memory zones that are more likely to contain trash.  
    It works for both objects and raw C memory blocks allocated using the  
    NSAllocateCollactable() method and equivalent techniques. The malloc()  
    operates as expected, enabling access to memory that the collector does  
    not maintain.
    
    The garbage collector is an opt-in service; our application may instead  
    depend on a reference counting mechanism if we prefer not to utilize it.  
    This system has an inventive approach for delayed release that significantly  
    reduces the effort of human reference counting.
    
    Note that the iPhone does not support the automated trash collector at  
    
    the time of writing.

    C INSIDE
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Objective-C programming language is an object-oriented extension of the  
    C programming language and a superset of C. This implies that the raw  
    power of C is accessible and that C libraries may be used directly (there  
    are quite a few!). In addition, this provides a symbiotic link between the  
    language  and  the  operating  system  since  Mac  OS  X,  a  UNIX  system,  is 
    written mainly in C and Objective-C for the higher-level portions.
    
    C++ FLUENT
    Objective-C is not simply a superset of C, but it can also interpret and exe-
    cute C++ code. In this setup, the language is referred to as Objective-C++ 
    and permits the blending of Objective-C and C++ code statements. It also 
    permits the direct use of C++ libraries.
    
    SIMPLICITY
    
    The Smalltalk-inspired object system of Objective-C tends toward simplic-
    ity. Many characteristics that tend to make languages difficult (templates, 
    overloading, multiple inheritances, etc.) are missing in Objective-C, which 
    provides  simpler  programming  paradigms  by  leveraging  its  dynamic 
    nature.
    
    ACCESS TO APPLE'S PRODUCTS
    
    Each  new  version  of  Mac  OS  X  via  Objective-C,  and  now  the  iPhone 
    OS,  is  loaded  with  exciting  new  capabilities  that  are  accessed  straight 
    from Objective-C. This makes Objective-C substantially more enjoyable 
    to use.
    
    WORKING WITH OBJECTIVE-C FILES
    
    In  Objective-C,  we  looked  at  the  NSFileHandle,  NSFileManager,  and 
    NSData  Foundation  Framework  classes  in  Working  with  Directories  in 
    Objective-C.  We  examined  how  the  NSFileManager  class,  in  particular, 
    allows  us  to  interact  with  directories  in  Objective-C.  This  chapter  pro-
    gresses  from  dealing  with  directories  to  going  through  the  specifics  of 
    working with files utilizing all three of these classes.
    
    OBTAINING AN NSFileManager REFERENCE
    
    First, we must review the processes required to gain a reference to create 
    an instance of the NSFileManager class.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The defaultManager is used to create an instance of the class. As an 
    
    example: get a hold of the NSFileManager object instance:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    Checking to See If a File Exists
    
    The NSFileManager class has a fileExistsAtPath instance function that 
    determines if a particular file already exists. The method accepts an 
    NSString object providing the path to the file as an input and returns a 
    boolean YES or NO result indicating the presence or absence of that file:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    if ([filemgr fileExistsAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt" ] 
    == YES)
            NSLog (@"The File is exists");
    else
            NSLog (@"The File does not found");
    
    Comparison of Two Files' Contents
    
    The contentsEqualAtPath function compares the contents of two files for 
    equivalence. This method accepts the paths to the two files to be compared 
    as parameters and returns a boolean YES or NO indicating if the file con-
    tents match:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    if ([filemgr contentsEqualAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt" 
    andPath: @"/tmp/sales.txt"] == YES)
            NSLog (@"The File contents is match");
    else
            NSLog (@"File contents don't match");
    
    Checking in Objective-C If a File Is Readable, Writable,  
    Executable, and Deleteable
    
    The majority of operating systems include some kind of file access con-
    trol. These often take the form of properties that govern the degree of

    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:
    
    access each user or user group has to a file. As a result, it is not guaranteed that our software will have read or write access to a certain file and the necessary rights to delete or execute it. Using the isReadableFileAtPath, isWritableFileAtPath, isExecutableFileAtPath, and isDeletableFileAtPath methods is the easiest way to determine whether our application has a certain access permission. Each method accepts a single input in the form of the file's path and returns a boolean value of YES or NO. For instance, the following code fragment verifies if a file is writable:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    if ([filemgr isWritableFileAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt"] == YES)
            NSLog(@"The File is writable");
    else
            NSLog(@"The File is read only");
    
    File Moving/Renaming
    
    The moveItemAtURL function is used to rename a file (given proper permissions). This function gives a boolean YES or NO result and accepts as inputs the pathname of the file to be relocated, the destination path, and an optional NSError object with information about any issues found during the operation. This option is set to NULL if no error description information is required. This procedure will fail if the destination file path already exists.
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    NSURL *oldPath = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/tmp/myfiles.txt"];
    NSURL *newPath= [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/tmp/newfiles.txt"];
    
    [filemgr moveItemAtURL: oldPath toURL: newPath error: nil];
    
    
    
    Making a File Copy
    
    The copyItemAtPath function is used to copy files. Like the move method, this function takes as arguments the source and destination pathnames and an optional NSError object. The returned boolean result indicates whether or not the operation was successful:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];

            NSLog(@"Copy-successful");
    else
            NSLog(@"Copy-failed");
    
    Delete a File
    
    The removeItemAtPath function deletes the file supplied by the path from 
    the file system. The pathname of the file in Objective-C is to be deleted, 
    and an optional NSError object is sent as parameters to the procedure. The 
    operation's success is reported as usual in the form of a boolean YES or 
    NO return value:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    if ([filemgr removeItemAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt"

    else
            NSLog(@"Remove-failed");
    
    Making a Symbolic Connection
    
    The createSymbolicLinkAtPath function makes a symbolic link to a specific file. This function accepts the symbolic link's path, the path of the file to which the link should point, and an optional NSError object. The following code, for example, generates a symbolic link from /tmp/Users/demo/myfiles21.txt to the pre-existing file /tmp/myfiles.txt:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    if ([filemgr createSymbolicLinkAtPath: @"/tmp/
    myfiles2.txt"
                    withDestinationPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.
    txt" error: NULL] == YES)
            NSLog(@"Link-successful");
    else
            NSLog(@"Link-failed");
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    if ([filemgr createSymbolicLinkAtPath: @"/Users/demo/
    files1.txt" 
                    withDestinationPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.
    txt" error: NULL] == YES)
            NSLog(@"Remove-successful");
    else
            NSLog(@"Remove-failed");
    
    Reading and Writing Files with NSFileManager
    
    The NSFileManager class provides essential file reading and writing functionality. These features are reasonably restricted compared to the possibilities supplied by the NSFileHandle class, but they can still be helpful.

    To begin, the contents of a file may be read and stored in an NSData object using the contentsAtPath method:
    
    NSFileManager *filemgr;
    NSData *databuffer;
    
    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    
    databuffer = [filemgr contentsAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt" ];
    
    After storing the contents of a file in an NSData object, the data may be written to a new file with the createFileAtPath method:
    
    databuffer = [filemgr contentsAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt" ];
    
    [filemgr createFileAtPath: @"/tmp/newfiles.txt" 
    contents: databuffer attributes: nil];

    <google>IOSBOX</google> In the preceding example, we transferred the contents of an existing file to a new file. However, we cannot control how much data is read or written, and we cannot add data to the end of an existing file. If the file/tmp/newfiles.txt had previously existed in the preceding example, it and any data it contained would have been replaced by the source file's contents. A more adaptable system is necessary. The Foundation Framework provides this in the form of the NSFileHandle class.
    
    Managing Files Utilizing the NSFileHandle Class
    
    The NSFileHandle class has a variety of methods intended to give a more sophisticated mechanism for interacting with files. This class is used to manage devices and network sockets, and files. In the following sections, we will examine some of the most frequent applications of this class.
    
    Creating an Object of Type NSFileHandle
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text from your PDF:
    
    When a file is opened for reading, writing, or modification, an NSFileHandle object is produced (reading and writing). The fileHandleForReadingAtPath, fileHandleForWritingAtPath, and fileHandleForUpdatingAtPath functions do this. After opening a file, it must be closed using the closeFile method after we are through working with it. If an attempt to open a file fails, such as when a non-existent file is attempted to be opened for reading, these methods return nil.
    
    The following code sample, for instance, opens a file for reading and writing and then closes it without actually modifying the file:
    
    NSFileHandle *file;
    
    file = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForWritingAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt"];
    
    if (file == nil)
            NSLog(@"Failed to open the file");
    
    [file closeFile];
    
    NSFileHandle File Offsets and Seeking
    
    NSFileHandle objects keep track of the current location inside a file. This is known as file offset. When a file is opened for the first time, its offset is 0 (the beginning of the file). This indicates that all read or write operations using the NSFileHandle methods will begin at offset 0 in the file. To conduct actions at various positions inside a file, such as appending data to the end, it is essential to first seek for the desired offset. Use the seekToEndOfFile function to relocate the current offset to the end of the file. For instance, seekToFileOffset enables us to define the specific place inside the file where the offset should be positioned. The last way to identify the current offset is the offsetInFile method. The offset is saved as an unsigned long to accommodate large file sizes.
    
    The following example opens a file for reading and then uses a series of methods to shift the offset to various locations, printing the current offset after each change:
    
    NSFileHandle *file;
    
    file = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForUpdatingAtPath:  
    @"/tmp/myfiles.txt"];
    
    if (file == nil)
            NSLog(@"Failed to open the file");
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Here is the text extracted verbatim from the PDF with all formatting errors fixed:
    
    ```
    NSLog(@"Offset = %llu", [file offsetInFile]);
    
    [file seekToEndOfFile];
    
    NSLog(@"Offset = %llu", [file offsetInFile]);
    
    [file seekToFileOffset: 30];
    
    NSLog(@"Offset = %llu", [file offsetInFile]);
    
    [file closeFile];
    
    File offsets are an important component of working with files with
    the NSFileHandle class, so take the time to ensure we grasp the notion. 
    It is difficult to predict where data will be read or written in a file without
    knowing the current offset.
    
    READING DATA FROM A FILE
    
    After opening a file and assigning it a file handle, the contents of that file
    are read from the current offset point. The readDataOfLength function
    reads a specified number of bytes from a file, beginning at the current
    
    offset. For example, the code below reads 5 bytes from offset 10 in a file.
    The data read is returned in the form of an NSData object:
    
    NSFileHandle *file;
    NSData *databuffer;
    
    file = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:  
    @"/tmp/myfiles.txt"];
    
    if (file == nil)
            NSLog(@"Failed to open the file");
    
    [file seekToFileOffset: 10];
    
    databuffer = [file readDataOfLength: 5];
    
    [file closeFile];
    
    DATA SAVING TO A FILE
    
    The writeData method writes the data in an NSData object to the file
    beginning at the offset point. In Objective-C, it should be noted that this
    does not insert data but rather replaces any existing data in the file at the
    relevant spot.
    
    To see this in action, we must first create a file. Create a file called
    quickfox.txt in the/tmp directory, enter the following content, and save it:
    
    The quick brown fox overtook the sluggish hound.
    Next, we'll develop a program that opens the file for updating, navigates
    
    to position 10, and then adds some data there:
    
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    ```

        return 0;
    }
    
    FILE TRUNCATION
    
    The  truncateFileAtOffset  method  truncates  a  file  at  the  supplied  offset. 
    When invoking this function, give an offset of 0 to remove the entire con-
    tents of a file:

    HOW TO WORK AS AN iOS DEVELOPER
    
    An iOS developer is a technology professional who creates mobile applica-
    tions. They produce Apps that people use daily by applying their expertise 
    in the iOS operating system and computer programming languages. If we 
    appreciate utilizing technology to build new things, we might want to con-
    sider a career as an iOS developer. This piece in Objective-C will look at 
    some of the most typical job tasks of an iOS developer and their average 
    compensation and the measures that may take to become one.

    WHAT EXACTLY IS AN iOS DEVELOPER?
    
    An  iOS  developer  is  someone  who  builds  software  for  mobile  operating 
    systems.  They  employ  computer  languages  to  create,  test,  and  optimize 
    programs  that  users  may  easily  download  and  use.  iOS  developers  can 
    work as part of a team of other software engineers and IT experts at a soft-
    ware firm or as freelancers.

    The primary Objective of an iOS developer is to design mobile Apps that are pleasant to users. While the day-to-day responsibilities of an iOS developer may vary, they are often responsible for accomplishing specific tasks. Among the responsibilities you might anticipate doing in this position are the following:
    
    • Testing, optimizing, and debugging programs to guarantee quality
    
    • Recognizing possible concerns and overcoming challenges
    
    • Coding and designing application architectures
    
    • Publishing programs for download by customers
    
    • Continuously doing maintenance to enhance application performance
    
    • Developing and implementing modifications to an application
    
    • Working with other members of the team to design and create new features.
    
    iOS DEVELOPER INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT FORECAST
    
    The average annual income for an iOS developer is $115,556. This might vary depending on our degree of education, job experience, and skill set. The sector we work in, the size of the company we work for, and the cost of living in our area may all influence our salary. In addition to their yearly income, many iOS developers get employer-provided perks. The most prevalent advantages include:
    
    • Health insurance
    
    • Health savings account
    
    • Remote work opportunities
    
    • Stock options
    
    • Paid time off
    
    • Commuter assistance
    
    The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the employment of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers will expand by 22 percent from 2019 to 2029, which is much higher than the average rate of growth for all professions. According to the BLS, this rise may be attributable to the growing need for computer software.
    
    HOW TO BECOME AN iPhone PROGRAMMER
    
    Here are some measures we may take to begin our iOS development career:
    
    1. Pursue an undergraduate degree: Although it is possible to become an iOS developer without a bachelor's degree, finishing a bachelor's program in software engineering, computer science, or mathematics will help us acquire the knowledge and abilities necessary to flourish in this field. Additionally, many businesses choose people with formal training in a related profession. We may study the following courses throughout our undergraduate education to prepare for a job as an iOS developer:

    • Embedded systems  
    • Computer programming languages  
    • Assembly language  
    
    2. Take Swift and Objective-C classes: As an iOS developer, you must have a solid grasp of Swift, SwiftUI, and Objective-C. Swift is a fundamental programming language that enables the creation of variables and the writing of functions to develop professional Apps in SwiftUI, a popular iOS framework. These packages give us all the resources necessary to develop user-friendly Apps. Objective-C classes are also available to acquaint students with another popular iOS programming language.
    
    Swift and Objective-C use the same iOS foundations, yet the languages are somewhat distinct. Many iOS developers opt to study Swift first because it is more straightforward and more popular, but exploring Objective-C might give you a more well-rounded candidate for employment. Start by searching for online Swift and Objective-C courses.
    
    3. Develop our software: Creating our apps is one of the most effective methods to progress as an iOS developer. This will allow us to experiment with various ways and acquire practical experience working with various programming languages. Providing samples of the apps we've developed may help impress hiring managers and illustrate our degree of expertise.
    
    Install Xcode on our computer to apply your Swift, Objective-C, and other programming language expertise. Xcode in Objective-C is the integrated development environment (IDE) used by iOS application developers. This tool allows you to write code, design user interfaces, and publish our Apps for people.

    In today's age of ubiquitous mobile devices and constant Internet connections, networking is a fundamental issue. On iOS alone, many Apps use the network in one way or another, either by utilizing built-in mechanisms such as iCloud synchronization or GameKit's communication architecture or by communicating directly with Internet-based servers. In addition, customer expectations often conflict with the capabilities and constraints of wide-area mobile networks like EDGE, 3G, and HDPSA+, leaving you, the application developer, to optimize a high-latency, low-throughput network channel.
    
    Fortunately, I have vast knowledge and expertise to contribute to this subject. This section presented the URL loading mechanism and asynchronous, synchronous, and synthetic-synchronous network access. We will learn the best practices for handling various forms of data transmitted via the network and how to handle system-independent binary data effectively. We will also learn how to identify services on the network and establish your services and make their information accessible in the same way.
    
    Probably most significantly, we will discover the reasoning behind the following network-centric programming fundamentals on the Mac and iOS:
    
    • The main thread should never visit the network.
    
    • When feasible, use asynchronous network primitives.
    
    • Use streams for all data processing.
    
    • Ensure that data processing and transport handling are ignorant of one other.
    
    BASIC PRINCIPLES
    
    While the data access APIs on the Mac and iOS are typically storage-agnostic, there might be significant differences between loading a file from a disc and reading it through the network. To reinforce the teachings of this section, we'll take a few moments to clarify these distinctions and provide a solid foundation for whatever we may learn about networking in the future.
    
    With both network and local file access, several issues might affect the performance of our program. These fall into two major categories:
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    Latency in Objective-C refers to the length of time required to reach the desired resource. This often refers to the seek-time of the underlying storage media when discussing local drives. This refers to the round-trip time of a network command packet.
    
    Throughput is the rate at which data may be sent to or retrieved from a resource. Typically, local drives have a fast throughput and may transfer hundreds of megabytes per second. This might range from tens of gigabytes per second to a few kilobytes per second on a network.
    
    Bandwidth availability is also related to these two categories. For local storage, reads and writes often pass across a hardware bus, which offers a much greater throughput than hard drives. Therefore, unless many discs are used concurrently, the total throughput is likely to equal that of the physical media utilized by a specific process. This indicates that if we read or write to numerous devices simultaneously, we will likely not see a significant increase in the throughput of each device compared to if we handled each device individually.
    
    296    ◾    Objective-C
    
    However, on the network, available bandwidth is often far more limited, and a single activity may rapidly use all available bandwidth, saturating the connection. Therefore, conducting multiple processes in parallel would likely result in a slowdown of all activities as the available bandwidth is divided among them. In addition, there are other nodes, such as wireless access points and routers, between your device and the real resource. Any of them may have bandwidth issues and any number of other clients, and they may impose particular restrictions to prevent anyone client from using excessive bandwidth. Many popular access points and routers, for instance, only let four concurrent HTTP requests from a single client to a single destination resource; all others are denied until some of the first four are completed. Therefore, it is generally advantageous for HTTP client software to apply the same restriction internally to prevent several concurrent activities from spinning their wheels and using local resources like memory, CPU, and battery life.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    In contrast, there is often minimal difference when requesting several resources from the same place through the network, although doing so with files on the same local disc might cause a significant slowdown. The seek time is the root source of delay in disk-based storage systems. When reading a single huge file, the disc will search the file once and then read a (mostly) contiguous stream of data. When multiple files are being read and written concurrently, the disk's read head must repeatedly travel back and forth across the magnetic platter to switch between the files, resulting in disc thrashing. These clunking and clicking noises are audible during moments of intense computer activity. Recent advancements in solid-state storage have led to the widespread use of solid-state drives (SSDs) over platter-based magnetic hard disc drives; therefore, the latency issue is far less of a concern in such storage systems. The iPhone employs solid-state storage.
    
    NETWORK DELAY
    
    The most common causes of latency in network transmissions are network congestion (which may occur at any point along the path) or inefficiency of the underlying transmission protocol. Both wired and wireless network connections employ variants of the Ethernet protocol. This protocol is responsible for identifying other devices on the local network and efficiently transporting data between them. However, mobile devices using the cellular network use a protocol such as GSM or HSDPA, which must sustain data throughput even when devices are traveling fast between endpoints such as cell towers. Consequently, these protocols have substantial overhead compared to Ethernet. This is exacerbated because most Ethernet or Wi-Fi devices have throughputs in the tens or hundreds of megabits per second, but HSDPA+ and "4G"1 cellular networks are only starting to surpass the 15 Mbit threshold. Consequently, it is usual to delay up to a full second (or even two!) while establishing a connection via a cellular network, especially with slower protocols such as GSM and 3G.

    If your application makes many connections, such as when retrieving data from a server using the HTTP protocol, the latency might be a significant issue. Imagine you must make around 20 distinct calls to get a complete list of 200 comments (the server returns 10 per page). By default, each call will establish a new connection, and each connection will have significant latency. If the latency is high, regardless of the actual throughput speed, this will take between 10 and 40 seconds, which is not a pleasant experience. If throughput is similarly sluggish, the situation worsens. I've seen an implementation of synchronizing data from such an API take over an hour when many calls are to be performed, with network delay accounting for over half of that time.
    
    ASYNCHRONICITY
    
    With so many possible problems awaiting that, we must interact with network resources in an entirely asynchronous manner. We cannot emphasize this point enough: it must always be asynchronous, regardless of the circumstances.
    
    It is easy to convince oneself in Objective-C that something does not need asynchronous execution. Possibly we use the network seldom; perhaps we only transmit or receive minimal quantities of data. Maybe we merely transfer data and do not wait for a response, or we only do network activities in reaction to user interaction. We've heard all these justifications, but we have some bad news: the network will still catch us. For instance:
    
    • We seldom use the network: If we do it seldom, the user is probably not anticipating it. Our user is more likely to be frustrated if our infrequent action causes the program to become unresponsive than if it were a regular occurrence since they cannot anticipate when it will occur.
    
    • We only transmit tiny data packets: Little packets may travel relatively rapidly on networks with limited capacity, but network delay disregards packet size. Establishing the connection may take so long that the program becomes unresponsive, even for a short time, which is a Bad Thing.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    • We simply send messages; we never wait for a response: Even if we  
    are not expecting a response, our send operation will not finish until  
    the network stack gets confirmation that the data has been received  
    successfully. We might employ a protocol with unguaranteed data  
    transport, but for delivering user data, this is a terrible choice; we  
    need to ensure the data arrives securely.
    
    • It is always triggered by human input. Thus users have learned to  
    anticipate a little wait: The user may alter their decision. If every-
    thing is performed synchronously, there is no way to abort an action  
    asynchronously if the user determines it takes too long.
    
    SOCKETS, PORTS, STREAMS, AND DATAGRAMS
    
    The OS X and iOS networking systems use the BSD sockets technology.  
    This makes a network connection seem similar to a file: data is delivered  
    and received by writing to or reading from a normal file handle, and the  
    kernel handles the rest. There are additional capabilities, but it is doubt-
    ful that we will need to examine them for our objectives. When dealing  
    with network connections, the primary distinction is that neither data nor  
    space to write is accessible on demand. Incoming data is not accessible  
    until it has arrived over the transport medium, and outgoing data is tem-
    porarily kept in a system buffer until the system can transmit it over the  
    wire. We examined NSStream and observed events and methods based on  
    these concepts: data accessible to read and space available to write.
    
    The file handle of a network connection is known as a socket. Once  
    constructed, they may be used very identically to conventional file handles  
    until an NSFileHandle object is wrapped around them. The primary dis-
    tinction is the inability to search inside the data stream; it is purely an  
    ordered-access system.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    There are two fundamental types of sockets.
    
    Stream sockets are meant to transmit vast volumes of ordered data between two ends of a connection. Typically, the underlying transport guarantees material delivery in the right sequence.
    
    On the other hand, Datagram sockets do not give any delivery or ordering assurances. Each datagram is treated as an independent entity, and no effort is taken to guarantee that all datagrams follow the same path across 
    
    Appraisal ◾ 299
    
    the network. Depending on each node's circumstances and travel, each datagram might take a different path.
    
    Datagram sockets, typically utilizing the Unified Datagram Protocol (UDP) over the Internet Protocol (IP), are typically used for streaming media. A datagram from a specific location in the underlying data stream is expected to arrive at a specific time. Still, the data is reassembled without receiving every byte in order. If we've ever seen a live webcast, we've likely seen the speaker's picture replaced with fragments of an earlier frame, looking twisted and wrapped to follow the speaker's movement. This demonstrates the absence of datagrams. Occasionally, the video data offers a whole frame, and in between, the data consists simply of alterations to apply to the previous frame to form the current frame. When a whole frame is missing, the picture of the incorrect frame is warped to construct a new one, resulting in the aforementioned aesthetic effect.
    
    Streaming sockets and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over IP are used for most network communication. TCP guarantees delivery at the expense of time-to-destination guarantees. If a problem occurs during the transfer, the receiving endpoint may verify that it got the packet correctly and request a resend if necessary.
  - |-
    <think>
    
    </think>
    
    The TCP protocol also guarantees that order is preserved even if some  
    packets arrive properly and others do not; if packet A fails and packet B  
    succeeds, the contents of packet B are held until the contents of packet A  
    are successfully delivered.
    
    TCP provides transmission windows as well. These let each endpoint transmit the amount of data it can effectively handle to the other.  
    Consequently, unlike UDP (Unified Datagram Protocol), an endpoint  
    never transmits data that the recipient cannot presently process. On the  
    other hand, Datagram protocols are intended to send data as quickly as  
    possible (or at least at a constant pace), enabling the receiver to simply  
    ignore any packets that come before it can process them.
    
    We shall use TCP/IP rather than datagrams in the following instances.  
    Datagram protocols often need additional application-level work to effec-
    tively handle failures such as missing packets, which is outside the scope  
    of this book.
    
    The Internet Protocol sits underneath the TCP and UDP protocols. This  
    is the origin of many items we may already recognize: IP addresses with  
    dotted octets, such as 192.168.23.5, derive from IP protocol version 4. Each  
    connection endpoint is made accessible by a port on the IP address, a 16-bit  
    integer identifying a specific endpoint. There are a variety of standard  
    
    300    ◾    Objective-C
    
    port assignments recorded with the appropriate authorities, so some ser-
    vices are often available through a well-known port number. HTTP, for  
    instance, uses port 80, while HTTPS utilizes port 443. When provided  
    over TCP/IP, Apple Filing Protocol utilizes port 548, and there are many  
    more common assignments in use, representing a significant portion  
    of the protocol's 65535 available ports.

    The 32-bit addressing mechanism used by IPv4 only permits around 
    4.3 billion different addresses. Add to that the fact that significant areas 
    of these addresses are restricted from general use exclusively as local-network private addresses or for other communication, such as multicast IP, 
    and it's not unexpected that we've run out. Early in 2012, service providers picked up the last available IPv4 addresses. The solution is the current implementation of IPv6, the most recent standard version. This upgrade employs a 128-bit addressing method, which is predicted to outlast the lives of everyone living now by a significant margin. From the software's perspective, the only difference is how an address is given.
    
    AUTHENTICATION
    
    Using two techniques, the URL connection tells its delegate of an authentication challenge. First, it will determine if the built-in credential storage is used to automatically search up login information by invoking – connection. When the connection is initiated, ShouldUseCredentialStorage is true. The connection will presume that the response is YES if the delegate does not implement this method.
    
    This value will be used to generate a default challenge response if an authentication challenge is received from a remote service. This answer may already include valid credentials if the credential storage is accessed. If implemented, the – connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: method of the delegate will provide data on the challenge and any relevant stored credential that the system will try to use to satisfy the challenge. This is the most common technique for adding credentials to the store for subsequent usage. Thus, we should typically implement it.
    
    The second argument is an instance of NSURLAuthenticationChallenge, 
    which contains all known information on the challenge. We may identify the authentication mechanism, the suggested credential (if one was accessible from the store or if a protocol supports a common "anonymous" credential), the number of prior unsuccessful tries, and more using this object.

    For instance, we can access an NSURLProtectionSpace object that describes the domain against which the credential is applied; this typically refers to the host, port, and protocol used and (depending on the protocol) may also specify a realm to restrict the authentication's applied scope further. For example, a conventional HTTP connection would provide a protocol of HTTP, a host of www.apple.com, and a port of 80 (the default port for HTTP services).
    
    An example realm for HTTP may be a subfolder: presumably, most of the host is available, but accessing www.testsite.com/secure/ needs a credential. In this case, the realm would be "secure" since the credential would only provide access to objects inside the folder resource. The protection area also offers data such as the certificate trust chain for a secure connection and information on whether the credential will be transferred securely. We may use any of these to determine whether or not to return a valid credential to the server.
    
    The essence of the issue is the generation of an NSURLCredential object. To authenticate against a service, we must generate a credential and present it to the sender of the authentication challenge, available through the -sender method. The authentication challenge sender is any object that conforms to the protocol NSAuthenticationChallengeSender, which defines the methods.

    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTIVE-C AND OTHER LANGUAGES
    
    C AND OBJECTIVE-C
    
    C Language
    
    Objective-C
    
    It is a language based on procedures.  
    Problems are resolved sequentially.
    
    C language may be referred to as  
    Objective-C's subset
    
    The C language's pointers are  
    susceptible to security threats.
    It is fundamentally a low-level

    The computer language Objective-C is an  
    object-oriented language. It provides syntax and  
    semantics to enable an object-oriented  
    programming language. It does not, however,  
    enable multiple inheritance properties.  
    Objective-C is the superset of the C programming  
    language. It also has classes and objects in  
    addition to the C programming language.  
    Objective-C utilizes null pointers and is hence  
    type-safe compared to C.  
    Objective-C is a high-level programming language  
    that combines C with a small-talk messaging  
    style.

    The C programming language does  
    not provide classes. Bjarne  
    Stroustrup created the C++  
    programming language to bring  
    object-oriented capabilities such as  
    classes to the C programming  
    language.  
    It uses a top-down programming  
    methodology.  
    Large program code is broken down  
    into smaller chunks called  
    functions in this programming  
    language.
    
    It only supports pointers.  
    Declaring variables at the beginning  
    of a program is required.  
    The C programming language  
    doesn't provide exception  
    handling.  
    C prohibits the definition of  
    functions with default parameters.  
    C cannot execute Objective-C code.  
    C includes malloc(), calloc(), and  
    free() for dynamic memory  
    allocation and deallocation,  
    respectively.  
    Data is not protected in the C  
    programming language.  
    There is no facility for inline  
    function.  
    C does not permit the overloading  
    of functions and operators.  
    It is often referred to as function-  
    driven language.  
    Encapsulation, Data hiding,  
    inheritance, polymorphism, and  
    abstraction are not supported.  
    The C language lacks support for  
    templates.  
    It is beneficial for embedded  
    services.
    
    Objective-C is an object-oriented programming  
    language that supports classes and a dynamic  
    runtime.
    
    It uses a bottom-up programming methodology.
    
    Large program code is broken down into smaller  
    codes known as Objects and Classes in this  
    programming language.
    
    Both pointers and references are supported.  
    Variables are specified anywhere in this  
    programming language.  
    Exception handling in Objective-C may be  
    implemented using catch and try sections.
    
    It permits function definitions with default  
    parameters.  
    Objective-C is capable of executing C code.  
    Objective-C includes the new and deleted  
    operators for memory allocation and  
    deallocation.
    
    Using the notion of encapsulation, Objective-C  
    security is implemented.  
    It supports the function inline.
