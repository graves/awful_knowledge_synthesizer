Since this is a single point of\n       failure, the ability to configure an additional hot-standby FSM is\n       supported.  This redundant configuration is called High Availability\n       (HA).  An HA cluster comprises two identically configured server-class\n       computers operating as metadata controllers (MDC).  Either MDC in an HA\n       cluster can serve as the primary MDC for the purposes of configuring\n       the cluster and for running the processes that provide the Stornext\n       Storage Manager (SNSM) features.  The alternate MDC is called\n       secondary.\n\n       All SNSM HA clusters must have one (HaShared) unmanaged Stornext file\n       system dedicated to configuration and operational data that is shared\n       between the MDCs.  The MDC running the active HaShared FSM is the\n       primary MDC by definition.  The primary MDC runs the active FSMs for\n       all the managed file systems (HaManaged), as well as the HaShared file\n       system, and it runs all the management processes together on one MDC.\n       In the event that an HaManaged FSM process fails, another FSM process\n       for that file system will be started and activated on the primary.\n       There are no redundant FSM processes on the secondary MDC for HaManaged\n       file systems.  Non-managed file systems (HaUnmanaged) can be active on\n       either MDC.  There is a redundant standby FSM ready to take control\n       through the activation protocol for each HaUnmanaged file system."

    Manpage text:

    HA cluster configurations guard against data corruption that could
           occur from both MDCs simultaneously writing metadata or management data
           by resetting one of the MDCs when failure conditions are detected.  HA
           resets allow the alternate MDC to operate without risk of corruption
           from multiple writers.  HA reset is also known as Shoot Myself in the
           Head (SMITH) for the way that resets are triggered autonomously.  HA
           resets occur when an active FSM fails to update the arbitration control
           block (ARB) for a file system, which prevents the standby from
           attempting a takeover, but also fails to relinquish control.  HA reset
           also occurs when the active HaShared FSM stops unless the file system
           is unmounted on the local server, which ensures that management
           processes will only run on a single MDC.

           There are three major system components that participate in a failover
           situation. First, there is the FSM Port Mapper daemon, fsmpm(8).  This
           daemon resolves the TCP access ports to the server of the volume. Along
           with this daemon is the Node Status Server daemon (NSS). This daemon
           monitors the health of the communication network and the File System
           Services.  The third component is the FSM that is responsible for the
           file system metadata.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `cvfs_failover`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWhenever a file system driver requests the location of a file system\n       server, the NSS initiates a quorum vote to decide which of the FSMs\n       that are standing by should activate. The vote is based on an optional\n       priority specified in the FSM host configuration list, fsmlist(4), and\n       the connectivity each server has to its clients.  When an elected FSM\n       is given the green light, it initiates a failover protocol that uses an\n       arbitration block on disk (ARB) to take control of metadata operations.\n       The activating server brands the volume by writing to ARB block,\n       essentially taking ownership of it. It then re-checks the brand twice\n       to make sure another server has not raced to this point. If all is\n       correct, it lets the server take over. The new server re-plays the\n       volume journal and publishes its port address to the local FSM Port\n       Mapper.\tOnce these steps are taken, clients attempting connection will\n       recover their operations with the new server."

First, hardware connectivity must\n       be planned. It is recommended that servers have redundant network\n       connections.  In order to failover, the metadata must reside on\n       shareable storage.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       This section will show how to set up a Xsan configuration in a way that\n       will support failover.\n\n       File System Name Server Configuration\n\t      The fsnameservers(4) files should have two hosts described that\n\t      could manage the File System Name Services.  This is required to\n\t      ensure that the name service, and therefore the NSS voting\n\t      capabilities, do not have a single point of failure. It is\n\t      recommended that these server machines also be named as the name\n\t      servers.\tIt is important to note that the fsnameservers list be\n\t      consistent and accurate on all of the participating SAN clients.\n\t      Otherwise some clients may not correctly acquire access to the\n\t      volume. In other words, be sure to replicate the fsnameservers\n\t      list across all Xsan clients."
