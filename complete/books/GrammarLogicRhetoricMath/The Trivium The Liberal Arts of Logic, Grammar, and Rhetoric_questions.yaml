    Editor's Introduction

    "In true liberal education...the essential activity of the student is to
    relate the facts learned into a unified, organic whole, to assimilate them
    as...the rose assimilates food from the soil and increases in size, vitality,
    and beauty."

    The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric

    What is language? How does it work? What makes good language? Co-
    leridge defined prose as "words in their best order" and poetry as "the
    best words in the best order." Plain but apt, his definitions provide a
    standard, but where can a reader and a writer find the tools to achieve
    this standard? My search drew me to Sister Miriam Joseph's book, The
    Trivium. I knew that the skills I had learned as a liberal arts student,
    taught as a high school English teacher, and use as a writer and editor
    derived from the medieval and Renaissance approach to grammar,
    logic, and rhetoric, the three "language arts" of the liberal arts known
    as the trivium. However, a study of the original trivium showed me that
    the hodgepodge of grammar rules, literary terms, and syllogistic formu-
    las offered as "language arts" differs from the original conception of the
    trivium that offered tools to perfect the mind.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Language and Logic**\n\nUsing the definitions of prose and poetry from the text, explain how the principles of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the trivium) contribute to the creation of ''words in their best order.''\n- **Step 1**: Define prose and poetry according to the text.\n- **Step 2**: Relate each component of the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) to its role in achieving the best order of words.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of a sentence that demonstrates the application of all three trivium components.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly connect the trivium to the standard of ''words in their best order'' and include a concrete example.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Trivium and Liberal Education**\n\nThe editor''s introduction emphasizes the importance of relating facts into a unified whole, drawing an analogy to a rose assimilating nutrients. How does the original trivium, as described in the text, align with this idea of unification?\n- **Step 1**: Summarize the original trivium''s purpose as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the trivium''s role in education to the process of a rose assimilating food.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the trivium''s integration of grammar, logic, and rhetoric ensures a unified understanding of language.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly link the trivium to the concept of unification and demonstrate an understanding of the educational philosophy described.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Language Arts**\n\nThe text discusses the differences between the modern and original trivium. Construct an argument about why the original trivium is more effective in cultivating a ''perfect mind'' than the modern approach.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key differences between the original and modern trivium as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use the text''s examples of the modern trivium (hodgepodge of rules, formulas) to contrast with the original''s purpose.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your argument with logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of the trivium''s role in education.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured logically, reference the text''s descriptions, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the trivium''s educational philosophy.'

    Sister Miriam Joseph rescued that integrated approach to unlocking
    the power of the mind and presented it for many years to her students
    at Saint Mary's College in South Bend, Indiana. She learned about the
    trivium from Mortimer J. Adler, who inspired her and other professors
    at Saint Mary's to study the trivium themselves and then to teach it to
    their students. In Sister Miriam Joseph's preface to the 1947 edition of
    The Trivium, she wrote, "This work owes its inception...to Professor
    Mortimer J. Adler of the University of Chicago, whose inspiration and
    instruction gave it initial impulse." She went on to acknowledge her
    debt to Aristotle, John Milton, and Jacques Maritain. William Shake-
    speare, Thomas Aquinas, and Thomas More also make frequent ap-
    pearances in The Trivium. This is good company indeed.

    Editor's Introduction

    The Trivium teaches us that language evolves from the very nature of
    being human. Because we are rational, we think; because we are social,
    we interact with other people; because we are corporeal, we use a phys-
    ical medium. We invent symbols to express the range of practical, theo-
    retical, and poetical experiences that make up our existence. Words
    allow us to leave a legacy of our experience to delight and to educate
    those who follow us. Because we use language, we engage in a dialogue
    with the past and the future.

    How does The Trivium help us use language to engage in such a di-
    alogue with the past and the future and to negotiate our own lives? Aris-
    totle's theories of language and literature underlie this work. His ten
    categories of being provide a central focus. Words are categorized by
    their relationship to being and to each other. When a speaker or writer
    uses a word, thus assigning it a particular meaning, it becomes a term
    and enters the realm of logic. Aristotle's categories enable us to trans-
    late the linguistic symbol into a logical entity ready to take its place in
    a proposition. From propositions, the reader moves to syllogisms, en-
    thymemes, sorites, formal fallacies, and material fallacies.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Trivium''s Core Principles**\n\nHow does the Trivium''s integration of logic, grammar, and rhetoric enable the process of dialogue with the past and future as described in the text?\n- **Step 1**: Explain the role of each of the three branches (logic, grammar, rhetoric) in the Trivium.\n- **Step 2**: Connect each branch to its function in facilitating dialogue with the past and future.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how these three components work together in this process.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the Trivium''s structure and its application to the concept of dialogue with the past and future, using specific references from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Language and Logic in the Trivium**\n\nUsing the text''s discussion of Aristotle''s categories of being and the transition from linguistic symbols to logical entities, explain how the Trivium allows us to engage in dialogue with the past and future.\n- **Part A**: Describe the process of how a linguistic symbol becomes a logical entity according to Aristotle''s categories.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this transformation enables the use of language to connect with past and future ideas.\n- **Part C**: Provide a logical example from the text that illustrates the use of syllogisms or enthymemes in this dialogue process.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly show how the transformation of language into logic facilitates the dialogue with the past and future, using specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on the Trivium''s Purpose**\n\nThe text emphasizes the Trivium''s role in teaching language as a means to engage with the past and future. Considering the examples of Shakespeare, Thomas Aquinas, and Thomas More in the text, explain how the Trivium helps us negotiate our own lives.\n- **Part A**: Discuss the significance of including literary and philosophical figures in the Trivium.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the Trivium''s three components (logic, grammar, rhetoric) contribute to negotiating personal and societal lives.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that connects the Trivium''s principles to modern communication and decision-making processes.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of the Trivium''s role in personal and societal engagement, using the text''s examples and reasoning to support your argument.'

    The Trivium explains that logic is the art of deduction. As thinking beings, we know something and from that knowledge can deduce new knowledge. Where does the initial knowledge come from? The section on induction answers that question as it explores the process by which we derive general principles from individual instances.

    Examples from the literary canon and Shakespeare, in particular, illuminate the explanations of grammar and logic. Sister Miriam Joseph, who was also a Shakespearean scholar, actually wrote about Shakespeare as a master of the trivium. For example, he often used litotes, the figure of speech based on the obversion of a proposition. The Tempest shows one instance of this. Sebastian, expressing his concern over the fate of Ferdinand, the king's son, says, "I have no hope that he's undrowned." Shakespeare makes the rhetorical decision to use obversion to dramatize that Sebastian faces a reality he cannot describe in direct speech.

    Rhetoric concerns the choices a speaker or writer makes from the options grammar and logic offer. Sister Miriam Joseph reviews the history of rhetoric and presents Aristotle's perspective on the means of persuasion. She includes poetics—communication through the narrative created by the author—in addition to rhetoric or direct communication. Here, the reader will find Aristotle's six elements of poetics. The section on plot is extensive and includes a detailed analysis of structure in Guy de Maupassant's "The Piece of String." In the service of rhetoric and poetics, Sister Miriam Joseph explains figurative language according to the classical topics of invention from which they are derived, poetry and versification, and the essay. The chapter ends with a brief guide to composition.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Deduction and Literary Analysis**\n\nUsing the text''s explanation of litotes in *The Tempest*, analyze how Shakespeare''s use of this figure of speech contributes to the character of Sebastian.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the specific instance of litotes in Sebastian''s dialogue.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the use of litotes reflects the character''s emotional state and rhetorical strategy.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this to the Trivium''s explanation of logic as the art of deduction, and explain how Shakespeare''s choice aligns with or challenges the concept of logical deduction in rhetoric.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate literary analysis with the Trivium''s principles of logic and rhetoric, demonstrating an understanding of how Shakespeare uses litotes to convey meaning through indirect speech.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetoric and Poetics**\n\nUsing Aristotle''s six elements of poetics as outlined in the text, create a rhetorical analysis of Guy de Maupassant''s *The Piece of String*.\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain each of the six elements (character, plot, theme, etc.) in the story.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the narrative structure (plot) serves as a rhetorical device to convey the story''s theme.\n- **Part C**: Compare the use of narrative structure in Maupassant''s story to the Trivium''s discussion of rhetoric and poetics, and explain how this relates to the broader purpose of communication in literature.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of Aristotle''s elements and their application to the story, linking them to the Trivium''s perspective on rhetoric and poetics.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Figurative Language**\n\nExplain how the text''s discussion of invention in figurative language relates to the classical topics of poetry and versification.\n- **Part A**: Define the classical topic of invention and its role in the development of figurative language.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from the text (e.g., Shakespeare''s use of litotes) that illustrates how invention leads to the use of poetic devices.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that connects the Trivium''s principles of logic, grammar, and rhetoric to the creation of effective poetic and rhetorical communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the Trivium''s three components (logic, grammar, rhetoric) with the classical topics of invention, poetry, and versification, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of their interrelationship.'

    As this summary indicates, The Trivium provides a comprehensive view of grammar, logic, and rhetoric as well as of induction, poetics, figurative language, and poetry. The reader could, however, use parts of the book separately. Chapters One to Three: "The Liberal Arts," "The Nature and Function of Language," and "General Grammar" offer a guide to an integrated view of language. The logic section comprises Chapters Four to Nine. Chapter Ten, "A Brief Summary of Induction," presents the types of induction and scientific method. Chapter Eleven, "Reading and Composition," explains concepts of rhetoric and other literature. The few references to logic in Chapters Ten and Eleven are explained in the notes.

    The notes are a new feature in this edition of The Trivium. Todd Moody, Professor of Philosophy at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, provided commentary and amplification on the logic chapters. His notes are designated TM. My notes give etymologies, the source for quotations, and clarifications. Some notes repeat information from earlier chapters that I thought would be helpful to the reader.

    The original publication had sketchy documentation of quotations. I researched all the quotations, and I used contemporary standard editions for frequently cited sources, such as Shakespeare's plays or the Bible. In a few cases, I could find the work cited but not the actual quotation. Saint Thomas More's Confutation Concerning Tyndale's Answers, for example, is a three-volume work in Renaissance prose. In one case, however, I was delighted not only to find the actual book, an out-of-print and now little-known book on logic, but to find the actual quotation.

    The issue of gender and language occasioned several discussions among the editorial staff. In The Trivium, Sister Miriam Joseph uses he and man to refer to all human beings; that was the accepted procedure in the 1930s and the 1940s, and it suited a book that used classical, medieval, and Renaissance sources. I left the text unchanged except for occasional substitutions of plural words or expressions like human being for man.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Trivium''s Core Components**\n\nThe Trivium is described as encompassing grammar, logic, and rhetoric, along with related disciplines like induction, poetics, and figurative language. Using the information provided, construct a three-part analogy that compares the Trivium to a three-legged stool. Each leg must represent one of the core components (grammar, logic, rhetoric), and the stool must be stable (i.e., the components must be interrelated).\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Define the role of each leg (component) in the analogy.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the interrelation of the three legs ensures the stability of the stool, mirroring the integrated nature of the Trivium.\n- **Part C**: Reference the text''s mention of ''the integrated view of language'' in the first three chapters to justify why the Trivium cannot be reduced to just one component.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analogy must be coherent, and your explanation must draw explicitly from the text''s descriptions of the Trivium''s structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Logical Structure in The Trivium**\n\nThe text describes the Trivium as comprising ''The Liberal Arts,'' ''The Nature and Function of Language,'' and ''General Grammar'' in the first three chapters, followed by the logic section from Chapters Four to Nine. Using this structure, answer the following questions:\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the hierarchical relationship between the first three chapters and the logic section. Explain how the first three chapters provide a foundation for the logic section, citing specific content from the text.\n- **Part B**: The logic section includes Chapters Four to Nine. Based on the text''s description of the logic chapters being commented on by Todd Moody, explain how the notes (TM) contribute to the understanding of the logic chapters.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the role of the notes in the text. How do they enhance the reader''s understanding of the Trivium, especially considering the text''s mention of ''clarifications'' and ''etymologies'' in the notes?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s structure and the purpose of the notes, using specific references from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Language and Gender in The Trivium**\n\nThe text notes that Sister Miriam Joseph uses ''he and man'' to refer to all human beings, a practice consistent with the 1930s and 1940s conventions. However, the text also mentions discussions about gender and language among the editorial staff.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the use of ''he and man'' was appropriate for the text''s time period, referencing the text''s explanation of historical conventions.\n- **Part B**: Propose an alternative phrasing that would be more inclusive of gender diversity, while maintaining the historical context. Justify your choice based on the text''s discussion of language conventions.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the implications of the text''s decision to leave the language unchanged, despite the potential for modern inclusivity. How does this decision reflect the text''s commitment to historical and cultural context, as mentioned in the text?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must address the historical context, the text''s stated reasons for maintaining the original language, and the broader implications of preserving versus adapting language conventions.'

    In her edition of The Trivium, Sister Miriam Joseph used an outline form. This edition adapts that outline by using equivalent headings and

    ix

    X = Editor's Introduction

    by providing transitions. I also made distinctions between information
    and examples; in the original text, examples, illustrations, analogies,
    and notes were incorporated into the outline. In my own study of this
    trivium, I found that certain sections were key to understanding the
    work as a whole or were valuable additions to my understanding of lan-
    guage. I have presented these sections as displays in this edition, and
    they should serve the reader both in a first reading of The Trivium and
    also in a review of the text.

    The author chose wonderful, literary examples for every chapter of
    the book. This edition keeps those selections. Occasionally, poems were
    mentioned but not included; this edition includes the poems. In some
    cases, Sister Miriam Joseph used quotations from, or references to, con-
    temporary periodicals. Because they have lost their relevance, I substi-
    tuted literary references.

    I would like to thank the many people who helped bring this new
    edition of The Trivium to publication. John Kovach, librarian at Saint
    Mary's College, found the original Trivium and sent it to Paul Dry
    Books. Professor John Pauley of Saint Mary's College wrote Sister
    Miriam Joseph's biography for this edition. Todd Moody provided an
    invaluable service in reading and commenting on the logic chapters.
    He helped me clarify the text, and he answered all my questions affa-
    bly and quickly. Darryl Dobbs, Professor of Political Science at Mar-
    quette University, read drafts at various stages and provided helpful
    commentary. Martha Robinson, a member of the Christian Trivium
    Board, reviewed a draft, and her advice helped me sharpen the focus. I
    would also like to thank Thomas McGlinn, my husband, who patiently
    sat through evening meals peppered with conundrums about grammar
    and logic as I worked my way through this project.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Trivium Structure and Purpose**\n\nBased on the editor''s introduction, explain how the structure of The Trivium reflects its purpose as a trivium in the liberal arts tradition.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the three core components of the trivium (logic, grammar, rhetoric) as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the organization of the book''s chapters aligns with these components.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the inclusion of literary examples and the adaptation of Sister Miriam Joseph''s outline with transitions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of the trivium''s purpose and demonstrate an understanding of how the book''s structure supports its educational goals.'

    In editing *The Trivium*, I tried to do no harm to the original text and
    to be true to the vision and learning of the author and of her teachers.
    In the "Prologue" to *The Canterbury Tales*, Chaucer asks the audience
    to forgive him if he offends anyone or makes a mistake. He concludes
    by explaining, "My wit is short, ye may wel understonde." I invoke the
    same defense.

    Ultimately, Sister Miriam Joseph speaks the most eloquently about
    the value of this book. She explains that studying the liberal arts is an
    intransitive activity; the effect of studying these arts stays within the
    individual and perfects the faculties of the mind and spirit. She com-
    pares the studying of the liberal arts with the blooming of the rose; it
    brings to fruition the possibilities of human nature. She writes, "The

    Editor's introduction xi

    utilitarian or servile arts enable one to be a servant—of another per-
    son, of the state, of a corporation, or of a business—and to earn a liv-
    ing. The liberal arts, in contrast, teach one how to live; they train the
    faculties and bring them to perfection; they enable a person to rise
    above his material environment to live an intellectual, a rational, and
    therefore a free life in gaining truth."

    THE LIBERAL ARTS

    THE LIBERAL ARTS

    The liberal arts denote the seven branches of knowledge that initiate
    the young into a life of learning. The concept is classical, but the term
    liberal arts and the division of the arts into the trivium and the quadrivium
    date from the Middle Ages.

    The Trivium and the Quadrivium

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.

    The trivium! includes those aspects of the liberal arts that pertain to
    mind, and the quadrivium, those aspects of the liberal arts that pertain
    to matter. Logic, grammar, and rhetoric constitute the trivium; and
    arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy constitute the quadrivium.
    Logic is the art of thinking; grammar, the art of inventing symbols and
    combining them to express thought; and rhetoric, the art of communi-
    cating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language
    to circumstance. Arithmetic, the theory of number, and music, an ap-
    plication of the theory of number (the measurement of discrete quanti-
    ties in motion), are the arts of discrete quantity or number. Geometry,
    the theory of space, and astronomy, an application of the theory of
    space, are the arts of continuous quantity or extension.

    The Trivium: The three arts of language pertaining to the mind

    bachelor of arts is awarded to those who demonstrate the requisite
    proficiency in these arts, and the degree master of arts, to those who
    have demonstrated a greater proficiency.

    Today, as in centuries past, a mastery of the liberal arts is widely rec-
    ognized as the best preparation for work in professional schools, such
    as those of medicine, law, engineering, or theology. Those who first per-
    fect their own faculties through liberal education are thereby better pre-
    pared to serve others in a professional or other capacity.

    The seven liberal arts differ essentially from the many utilitarian arts
    (such as carpentry, masonry, plumbing, salesmanship, printing, editing,
    banking, law, medicine, or the care of souls) and from the seven fine
    arts (architecture, instrumental music, sculpture, painting, literature,
    the drama, and the dance), for both the utilitarian arts and the fine arts
    are transitive activities, whereas the essential characteristic of the liberal
    arts is that they are immanent or intransitive activities.

    The utilitarian artist produces utilities that serve the wants of hu-
    manity; the fine artist, if he is of the highest order, produces a work that
    is "a thing of beauty and a joy forever"? and that has the power to ele-
    vate the human spirit. In the exercise of both the utilitarian and the
    fine arts, although the action begins in the agent, it goes out from the
    agent and ends in the object produced and usually has a commercial
    value; and therefore the artist is paid for the work. In the exercise of
    the liberal arts, however, the action begins in the agent and ends in the
    agent, who is perfected by the action; consequently, the liberal artist,
    far from being paid for his hard work, of which he receives the sole and
    full benefit, usually pays a teacher to give needed instruction and guid-
    ance in the practice of the liberal arts.

    The intransitive character of the liberal arts may be better under-
    stood from the following analogy.

    ANALOGY: The intransitive character of the liberal arts

    The carpenter planes the wood.
    The rose blooms.
    The action of a transitive verb (like planes) begins in the agent but "goes across* and ends in the ob-
    ject (the wood). The action of an intransitive verb (like blooms) begins in the agent and ends in the
    agent (the rose, which is perfected by blooming).

    Classes of Goods
    The three classes of goods—valuable, useful, and pleasurable—illus-
    trate the same type of distinction that exists among the arts.

    Valuable goods are those which are not only desired for their own
    sake but which increase the intrinsic worth of their possessor. For in-
    stance, knowledge, virtue, and health are valuable goods.

    Useful goods are those which are desired because they enable one to
    acquire valuable goods. For instance, food, medicine, money, tools, and
    books are useful goods.

    Pleasurable goods are those which are desired for their own sake be-
    cause of the satisfaction they give their possessor. For instance, happi-
    ness, an honorable reputation, social prestige, flowers, and savory food
    are pleasurable goods. They do not add to the intrinsic worth of their
    possessor, nor are they desired as means, yet they may be associated
    with valuable goods or useful goods. For instance, knowledge, which
    increases worth, may at the same time be pleasurable; ice cream,
    which is nourishing food, promotes health, and is, at the same time,
    enjoyable.

    The utilitarian or servile arts enable one to be a servant—of another
    person, of the state, of a corporation, or of a business—and to earn a liv-
    ing. The liberal arts, in contrast, teach one how to live; they train the
    faculties and bring them to perfection; they enable a person to rise
    above his material environment to live an intellectual, a rational, and
    therefore a free life in gaining truth. Jesus Christ said, "You shall know
    the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32).3

    The new motto of Saint John's College, Annapolis, Maryland, ex-
    presses the purpose of a liberal arts college with an interesting play on
    the etymology of liberal: "Facio liberos ex liberis libris libraque." "I make
    free men of children by means of books and a balance [laboratory ex-
    periments]."4

    Science and Art
    Each of the liberal arts is both a science and an art in the sense that
    in the province of each there is something to know (science) and
    something to do (art). An art may be used successfully before one
    is able to understand the science.

    has a formal knowledge of its precepts. For example, a child of three
    may use correct grammar even though the child knows nothing of
    formal grammar. Similarly, logic and rhetoric may be effectively used
    by those who do not know the precepts of these arts. It is, however,
    desirable and satisfying to acquire a clear knowledge of the precepts
    and to know why certain forms of expression or thought are right
    and wrong.

    The trivium is the organon, or instrument, of all education at all levels because the arts of logic, grammar, and rhetoric are the arts of communication itself in that they govern the means of communication
    —namely, reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Thinking is inherent in these four activities. Reading and listening, for example, although relatively passive, involve active thinking, for we agree or disagree with what we read or hear.

    The trivium is used vitally when it is exercised in reading and composition. It was systematically and intensively exercised in the reading of the Latin classics and in the composition of Latin prose and verse by boys in the grammar schools of England and the continent during the sixteenth century. This was the training that formed the intellectual habits of Shakespeare and other Renaissance writers. The result of it appears in their work. (See T.W. Baldwin, William Shakespeare's Small Latine and Lesse Greeke. Urbana: The University of Illinois Press, 1944.5) The trivium was basic also in the curriculum of classical times, the Middle Ages, and the post-Renaissance.

    In the Greek grammar of Dionysius Thrax (ca.166 B.C.), the oldest extant book on grammar® and the basis for grammatical texts for at least thirteen centuries, grammar is defined in so comprehensive a manner that it includes versification, rhetoric, and literary criticism.

    Grammar is an experimental knowledge of the usages of languages as
    generally current among poets and prose writers. It is divided into six
    parts: (1) trained reading with due regard to prosody [versification]; (2)
    exposition, according to poetic figures [rhetoric]; (3) ready statement of

    (1) study of dialectical peculiarities and allusion; (2) discovery of etymologies; (3) the accurate account of analogies; (4) criticism of poetical productions, which is the noblest part of grammatical art.

    Because communication involves the simultaneous exercise of logic, grammar, and rhetoric, these three arts are the fundamental arts of education, of teaching, and of being taught. Accordingly, they must be practiced simultaneously by both teacher and pupil. The pupil must cooperate with the teacher; he must be active, not passive. The teacher may be present either directly or indirectly. When one studies a book, the author is a teacher indirectly present through the book. Communication, as the etymology of the word signifies, results in something possessed in common; it is a oneness shared. Communication takes place only when two minds really meet. If the reader or listener receives the same ideas and emotions that the writer or speaker wished to convey, he understands (although he may disagree); if he receives no ideas, he does not understand; if different ideas, he misunderstands. The same principles of logic, grammar, and rhetoric guide writer, reader, speaker, and listener.

    Education is the highest of arts in the sense that it imposes forms (ideas
    and ideals) not on matter, as do other arts (for instance carpentry or
    sculpture) but on mind. These forms are received by the student not
    passively but through active cooperation. In true liberal education, as
    Newman' explained, the essential activity of the student is to relate the
    facts learned into a unified, organic whole, to assimilate them as the
    body assimilates food or as the rose assimilates food from the soil and
    increases in size, vitality, and beauty. A learner must use mental hooks
    and eyes to join the facts together to form a significant whole. This
    makes learning easier, more interesting, and much more valuable. The
    accumulation of facts is mere information and is not worthy to be called
    education since it burdens the mind and stultifes it instead of devel-
    oping, enlightening, and perfecting it. Even if one forgets many of the
    facts once learned and related, the mind retains the vigor and perfec-
    tion gained by its exercise upon them. It can do this, however, only by
    grappling with facts and ideas. Moreover, it is much easier to remem-
    ber related ideas than unrelated ideas.

    Each of the liberal arts has come to be understood not in the narrow
    sense of a single subject but rather in the sense of a group of related sub-
    jects. The trivium, in itself a tool or a skill, has become associated with
    its most appropriate subject matter—the languages, oratory, literature,
    history, philosophy. The quadrivium comprises not only mathematics
    but many branches of science. The theory of number includes not
    merely arithmetic but also algebra, calculus, the theory of equations,
    and other branches of higher mathematics. The applications of the
    theory of number include not only music (here understood as musical
    principles, like those of harmony, which constitute the liberal art of
    music and must be distinguished from applied instrumental music,
    which is a fine art) but also physics, much of chemistry, and other forms
    of scientific measurement of discrete quantities. The theory of space in-
    cludes analytic geometry and trigonometry. Applications of the theory
    of space include principles of architecture, geography, surveying, and
    engineering.

    The discovery of the planet Pluto in 1930 illustrates the relationship between metaphysics and the language arts. The planet Pluto had been a real entity, traveling in its orbit about our sun, for centuries; its discovery in 1930 did not create it. By being discovered, however, it became in 1930 for the first time a logical entity. When it was named Pluto, it became a grammatical entity. When by its name Knowledge of it was communicated to others through the spoken word and also through the written word, the planet Pluto became a rhetorical entity.71

    Rhetoric is the master art of the trivium, for it presupposes and makes use of grammar and logic; it is the art of communicating through symbols ideas about reality.

    Comparison of Materials. Functions, and Norms of the Language Arts
    The language arts guide the speaker, writer, listener, and reader in the correct and effective use of language. Phonetics and spelling, which are allied to the art of grammar, are included here to show their relationship to the other language arts in materials, functions, and norms.

    Phonetics prescribes how to combine sounds so as to form spoken words correctly.
    Spelling prescribes how to combine letters so as to form written words correctly.
    Grammar prescribes how to combine words so as to form sentences correctly.

    Rhetoric prescribes how to combine sentences into paragraphs and paragraphs into a whole composition having unity, coherence, and the desired emphasis, as well as clarity, force, and beauty.

    Logic prescribes how to combine concepts into judgments and judgments into syllogisms and chains of reasoning so as to achieve truth.

    and appropriate and that sentences be varied in structure and rhythm.
    It recognizes various levels of discourse, such as the literary (maiden or
    damsel, steed), the common (girl, horse), the illiterate (gal, hoss), the
    slang (skirt, plug), the technical (homo sapiens, equus caballus), each
    with its appropriate use. The adaptation of language to circumstance,
    which is a function of rhetoric, requires the choice of a certain style and
    diction in speaking to adults, of a different style in presenting scientific
    ideas to the general public, and of another in presenting them to a
    group of scientists. Since rhetoric is the master art of the trivium, it may
    even enjoin the use of bad grammar or bad logic, as in the portrayal of
    an illiterate or stupid character in a story.

    Just as rhetoric is the master art of the trivium, so logic is the art of
    arts because it directs the very act of reason, which directs all other
    human acts to their proper end through the means it determines.

    In the preface to his Art of Logic, the poet Milton remarks:

    The general matter of the general arts is either reason or speech. They
    are employed either in perfecting reason for the sake of proper think-
    ing, as in logic, or in perfecting speech, and that either for the sake of
    the correct use of words, as in grammar, or the effective use of words,
    as in rhetoric. Of all the arts the first and most general is logic, then
    grammar, and last of all rhetoric, since there can be much use of rea-
    son without speech, but no use of speech without reason. We gave the
    second place to grammar because correct speech can be unadorned;
    but it can hardly be adorned before it is correct.!3

    Because the arts of language are normative, they are practical stud-
    ies as contrasted with speculative. A speculative study is one that merely
    seeks to know—for example, astronomy. We can merely know about the
    heavenly bodies. We cannot influence their movements.

    A practical, normative study is one that seeks to regulate, to bring
    into conformity with a norm or standard—for example, ethics. The
    norm of ethics is the good, and its purpose is to bring human conduct
    into conformity with goodness.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetoric and Logic in Discourse**\n\nCompose a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that demonstrates the interplay between rhetoric and logic as described in the text. Your paragraph must include examples from the text and illustrate how the ''master art of the trivium'' (rhetoric) and ''art of arts'' (logic) function together in a real-world scenario.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definition of rhetoric as the ''master art of the trivium'' and the description of logic as the ''art of arts''. Additionally, your paragraph must integrate at least two examples from the text, such as the portrayal of illiterate characters or the regulation of speech in ethics.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Language Normativity**\n\nExplain why the text considers the arts of language (grammar, rhetoric, logic) as ''normative'' and contrast this with a ''speculative'' study like astronomy. Use the text''s definition of a practical study as one that ''seeks to regulate, to bring into conformity with a norm or standard'' to support your argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between normative and speculative studies based on the text. Include at least one example from the text (e.g., ethics as a practical study) and one example from the text''s discussion of astronomy. Ensure your explanation directly ties the concept of ''normative'' to the purpose of each art.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Language Arts in Real-World Contexts**\n\nCreate a scenario where a public speaker (e.g., a politician) uses rhetoric to persuade an audience, while a logician evaluates the argument''s validity. Your scenario must include the following elements:\n- The speaker''s use of rhetorical devices (e.g., appeal to emotion, ethos, pathos) as discussed in the text.\n- The logician''s analysis of the argument''s structure, referencing the text''s description of logic as the ''art of arts''.\n- A conclusion that illustrates how both arts work in concert to achieve a purpose.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must explicitly reference the text''s definitions of rhetoric and logic. It should include at least two rhetorical strategies mentioned in the text and demonstrate how logic ensures the argument is valid. The scenario must be coherent and demonstrate an understanding of the interdependence of the three trivium arts.'

    Correctness is the norm of phonetics, spelling, and grammar.
    Effectiveness is the norm of rhetoric.

    Truth is the norm of logic. Correctness in thinking is the normal means to reach truth, which is the
    conformity of thought with things as they are—with reality.

    1-4 Language Arts: Their Norms

    The Liberal Arts 11

    The intellect itself is perfected in its operations by the five intellec-
    tual virtues, three speculative and two practical. Understanding is the
    intuitive grasp of first principles. (For example, of contradictory state-
    ments, one must be true, the other false.) Science is knowledge of prox-
    imate causes (physics, mathematics, economics, etc.). Wisdom is
    knowledge of ultimate causes— metaphysics in the natural order, the-
    ology in the supernatural order. Prudence is right reason about some-
    thing to be done. Art is right reason about something to be made.!

    2 THE NATURE AND FUNCTION
    OF LANGUAGE

    THE FUNCTION OF LANGUAGE

    The function of language is threefold: to communicate thought, voli-
    tion, and emotion.

    Man, like other animals, may communicate emotions such as fright,
    anger, or satisfaction by means of cries or exclamations which in
    human language are called interjections. Dumb animals use different
    kinds of cries to express different emotions. Dogs bark in one way
    when they are angry, and in another when they are pleased. So also
    the mews of cats and the neighs of horses vary in order to express var-
    ious feelings. |

    Although they may be repeated, animal cries can never be united to
    form a sentence; they are always mere interjections, and interjections,
    even in human speech, cannot be assimilated into the structure of a
    sentence. Human beings, however, are not limited, as other animals
    are, to expressing their feelings by interjections; they may use sentences.

    Volition (desires) or appetition (appetites) may be expressed by cries
    or exclamations, as when a baby cries or a dog barks for food. Since,
    however, desires multiply as knowledge increases, humans usually ex-
    press their desires, choices, and commands in sentences.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Intellectual Virtues and Language Functions**\n\nUsing the text, explain how the five intellectual virtues (understanding, science, wisdom, prudence, and art) relate to the three functions of language (communication of thought, volition, and emotion).\n- **Step 1**: Identify which virtue corresponds to each function of language.\n- **Step 2**: Justify your assignment using the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from everyday life that illustrates the intersection of a virtue and a function of language.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s definitions and demonstrate a clear logical connection between the virtues and language functions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Language and Emotion**\n\nThe text discusses how animals use cries to express emotions, while humans use sentences. Consider the following scenario: A person is feeling anxious and decides to write a letter to a friend.\n- **Part A**: Explain how this action reflects the function of language as the communication of emotion.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the expression of emotion in animals (e.g., a dog barking) with human expression (e.g., writing a letter).\n- **Part C**: Discuss the role of ''interjections'' in human speech as mentioned in the text and how they relate to the function of expressing emotion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion on animal vs. human expression of emotion and demonstrate an understanding of the three functions of language.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Intellectual Virtues**\n\nThe text defines understanding as the intuitive grasp of first principles. Consider the following statement: ''Understanding is the intuitive grasp of first principles, such as the principle that a whole is greater than its parts.''\n- **Part A**: Use the text''s definition to evaluate the validity of this statement.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the virtue of wisdom (knowledge of ultimate causes) differs from understanding (intuitive grasp of first principles).\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that demonstrates the relationship between the virtues of prudence and art. Your argument must reference definitions from the text and use clear reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s definitions and demonstrate a clear logical connection between the virtues and their functions.'

    Only humans can utter sounds which unite in a sentence to express
    thought because humans alone among animals have the power to
    think. Consequently, they alone have language in the proper sense of
    the word.! This follows from their nature, for they are rational and
    therefore have something to say, social and therefore have someone to
    say it to, and animal and therefore require a physical mode of commu-
    nicating ideas from one mind, which is isolated from all others in the
    body, to another mind likewise isolated.

    Pure spirits, such as angels, communicate thought, but their com-
    munication is not properly called language because it does not employ
    a physical medium.?

    The Nature and Function of Language 13

    MEANS OF COMMUNICATION

    There are possible only two modes of communicating ideas through a
    physical or material medium — by imitation or by symbol.

    Imitation
    An imitation is an artificial likeness, for example: a painting, photo-
    graph, cartoon, statue, pantomime, a gesture such as threatening with
    a clenched fist or rejecting by pushing away with the hands, and pic-
    ture writing. There is no mistaking the meaning of a picture; it means
    what it resembles. The picture of a horse or a tree cannot represent a
    man or a dog. Even though imitation is a clear means of communica-
    tion, it is limited, difficult, slow, and unable to express the essences of
    things. Imagine picture writing your next letter to a friend. Within lim-
    its, however, imitation is a vivid and effective mode of communication.

    Symbol
    A symbol is an arbitrary sensible sign having a meaning imposed on it
    by convention. A sign is sensible, for it can be perceived by the senses.
    Every sign has meaning either from nature or from convention. A
    cloud, which is a sign of rain, and smoke, which is a sign of fire, have
    meaning from nature. A green light, which is a sign that traffic should
    move, has meaning from convention.

    SYMBOLS: MEANING FROM NATURE OR CONVENTION
    By convention or arbitrary agreement, symbols are devised that are ei-
    ther temporary or permanent.?

    ILLUSTRATION: Symbols

    Temporary symbols: signals adopted by a football team, the password necessary to get through
    military lines, school or team colors.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Communication Modes and Symbolic Meaning**\n\nCompare and contrast the modes of imitation and symbolism in the context of human communication, using the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define imitation as an artificial likeness and symbol as an arbitrary sensible sign with conventionally imposed meaning.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the limitations of imitation, such as its inability to express essences of things, and the flexibility of symbols in conveying complex ideas.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of a symbol with natural meaning and one with conventional meaning, explaining how each type functions in communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between imitation and symbolism, demonstrating understanding of both concepts as defined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Language and Communication**\n\nBased on the text''s assertion that only humans have language due to being rational, social, and animal, construct an argument that supports or challenges this claim.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the three characteristics (rationality, sociability, and animal nature) that the text attributes to humans.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a counterexample or supporting example that either reinforces or questions the necessity of these traits for language.\n- **Step 3**: Use the text''s definitions of imitation and symbolism to justify your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically coherent and directly reference the text''s definitions of communication modes and the nature of language.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Symbolic Communication**\n\nDesign a symbolic system for a hypothetical animal species that communicates through symbols, using the text''s definitions of symbols and their origins (natural or conventional).\n- **Step 1**: Define the purpose of the symbolic system for the animal species.\n- **Step 2**: Choose at least two symbols, one with natural meaning and one with conventional meaning.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how each symbol would be used in the animal''s communication and how it aligns with the text''s classification of symbols.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of the text''s definitions of symbols and their origins, with clear examples that reflect the concepts discussed.'

- prompt: |-
    Permanent symbols: traffic lights, flags, a soldier's salute, a nod of affirmation, heraldry, hieroglyphics, chemical formulas, numbers.

    All words are symbols with the exception of a very few imitative or onomatopoeic words, such as boom, buzz, hiss, plop, ticktock.

    We are likely to undervalue our precious heritage of symbols and to underestimate their convenience. Some symbols are less convenient than others for the same purpose. For example, Roman numerals are less convenient for computation than Arabic numerals.

    ILLUSTRATION: Computation with Roman numerals

    In a work by Alcuin (735-804), CCXXXV is multiplied by IV in this manner.4

    cc x IW—DCCC
    XXX × IV—CXX
    V × IV—XX

    Roman numerals were used in all computations necessary in carrying on the business of the vast Roman Empire.

    SYMBOLS: SPECIAL OR COMMON

    Special symbols are designed by experts to express with precision ideas in a special field of knowledge, for example: mathematics, chemistry, music. Such special languages are international and do not require translation, for their symbols are understood by people of all nationalities in their own language. The multiplication table is a set of symbols understood by a French person in French, by a German in German, etc. The same is true of chemical formulas and equations and of musical notation.

    Common symbols or words, such as French, German, Chinese, or Greek words, constitute the common languages. A common language is one invented by the common people to meet all their needs of communication in the course of life. Accordingly, it is a more adequate mode of communication than the special languages, although it is less precise and more ambiguous in the sense that one word may have either of two or more meanings. The common languages are not understood internationally but require translation.

    Two attempts to provide an international language may be mentioned. Esperanto is an artificial amalgam based on words common to the chief European languages. Basic English is a careful selection of 850 English words, which through paraphrase are designed to do duty for a wider vocabulary.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Symbol Classification and Function**\n\nThe text distinguishes between special symbols and common symbols. Choose two examples from the text that represent each category and explain their functions in their respective fields.\n- **Special Symbols**: Provide an example from the text and explain its purpose.\n- **Common Symbols**: Provide an example from the text and explain its purpose.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the two categories based on the text''s definitions and demonstrate understanding of their distinct roles in communication.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Symbol Convenience and Ambiguity**\n\nThe text argues that symbols can be more convenient for specific purposes but less precise. Using the examples of Roman numerals and Arabic numerals, explain why Roman numerals are less convenient for computation and how this relates to the concept of "convenience" in the text.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Compare the computational process of multiplying CCXXXV by IV using Roman numerals versus Arabic numerals.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the convenience of a symbol system affects its practicality in real-world applications, referencing the text''s mention of Roman numerals in the Roman Empire''s business operations.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s example of Roman numerals and link it to the broader concept of convenience in symbol systems.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Reasoning on International Symbol Systems**\n\nThe text discusses the limitations of common languages and presents two attempts at creating an international language: Esperanto and Basic English.\n- **Part A**: Explain why these systems might be considered "international" despite the text''s assertion that common languages require translation.\n- **Part B**: Construct a hypothetical international symbol system that combines elements of both special symbols (e.g., mathematical notation) and common symbols (e.g., words).\n- **Part C**: Justify why such a system might be more efficient than either purely special or purely common languages, based on the text''s discussion of precision and convenience.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s arguments about the advantages and limitations of different symbol systems and demonstrate creative problem-solving based on the provided examples.'

- prompt: |-
    A common language may be native or foreign according to place, or living or dead according to usage. Every dead language, such as Latin, was at one time a living common language. It may be serviceable for special uses, such as liturgy or doctrine, from the very fact that it is a dead language and, therefore, not subject to changes or to a variety of interpretations as a living language is. A dead language is more likely to be understood in exactly the same way in all times and places.

    According to the mode of expression, a common language may be a system of either spoken symbols or of other signs. The spoken language is the original and fundamental system of symbols for which all other signs are merely substituted. The written language is the most important substitute and the only one ordinarily understood. Among other substitute signs are Braille, sign language, the semaphore code. Each of these substitutes merely renders into its own system of signs words of a common language.

    THE NATURE OF LANGUAGE

    It is the nature of language to communicate through symbols. Language is a system of symbols for expressing our thoughts, volitions, and emotions.

    A word, like every other physical reality, is constituted of matter and form. A word is a symbol. Its matter is the sensible sign; its form is the meaning imposed upon it by convention. Matter and form are metaphysical concepts necessary to the philosophical understanding of any material whole, for together they constitute every such whole. Matter is defined as the first intrinsic and purely potential principle of a corporeal essence; as such, it cannot actually exist without form, for it is not a body but a principle of a body, intrinsically constituting it. Form is the first intrinsic and actual principle of a corporeal essence.

    ILLUSTRATION: Matter and form

    In animals, the body is the matter and the soul is the form.

    In water, the matter consists of hydrogen and oxygen; the form is the precise mode of their union in a molecule of water and may be expressed by the chemical formula H₂O.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Language as a Symbolic System**\n\nUsing the text''s definitions of language as a system of symbols for expressing thoughts, volitions, and emotions, explain how the following examples demonstrate the dual nature of language as both a spoken symbol and a written substitute:\n1. A spoken word like ''hello'' and its written form ''hello''\n2. The use of Braille to represent spoken language\n3. The semaphore code as a substitute for spoken language\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each example, identify the ''matter'' and ''form'' as defined in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the text''s distinction between ''matter'' and ''form'' supports the idea that language is a system of symbols.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the definitions of matter and form from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how spoken and written language relate to the concept of a common language.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Language and Metaphysics**\n\nThe text describes language as a system of symbols where ''a word is a symbol. Its matter is the sensible sign; its form is the meaning imposed upon it by convention.'' Using this definition, analyze the following statements:\n1. ''The word ''water'' is a symbol whose matter is the spoken sound /wɔːtər/ and whose form is the concept of liquid H₂O.''\n2. ''The chemical formula H₂O is a symbol whose matter is the arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms and whose form is the specific chemical bond between them.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each statement, evaluate whether it correctly applies the text''s definition of a symbol.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the two examples. How do they illustrate the text''s claim that ''language is a system of symbols for expressing our thoughts, volitions, and emotions''?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the text''s metaphysical framework and how it applies to both linguistic and chemical symbols.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Language and Communication**\n\nThe text states that a dead language, such as Latin, is ''not subject to changes or to a variety of interpretations as a living language is.'' Using this concept, design a hypothetical scenario where a common language is used for a specific purpose, and explain why the language''s status as a dead language would be advantageous in that context.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Describe the scenario, including the purpose of the language and the environment in which it is used.\n- **Part B**: Justify why the language''s status as a dead language makes it more suitable for the described scenario.\n- **Part C**: Contrast this with a situation where a living language would be more appropriate, and explain the reasons for this contrast.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of dead languages and demonstrate an understanding of how the stability of a dead language affects its utility in specific contexts.'

    The matter of words in spoken language is the sound. This aspect of language is treated in phonetics. The matter of words in written language is the mark or notation. It is treated in orthography or spelling. The form of words is their meaning, and it is treated in semantics.

    2-1 Matter and Form in Language

    Matter of Language
    Voice is the sound uttered by an animal. The voice of irrational animals has meaning from nature, from the tone of the utterance. The human voice alone is symbolic, having a meaning imposed upon it by convention.

    Human beings have articulate voice by which they add to their simple voice modifications that are produced by the organs of speech: tongue, palate, teeth, lips. The capacity of the articulate voice to produce such modifications in almost limitless variety makes possible the many symbols needed to communicate the wide range of human thought.

    The alphabet8 of the International Phonetic Association is a system of written symbols aiming at an accurate and uniform representation of the sounds of speech. It distinguishes twenty vowel sounds, six diphthongs, and twenty-seven consonant sounds. The English language lacks three of the vowel sounds (those present in German grün and schön and in French seul) and two of the consonant sounds (those present in German ich and Scottish loch).

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Language''s Matter and Form**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, explain how the distinction between the ''matter'' and ''form'' of language relates to the three branches of the trivium: grammar, rhetoric, and logic.\n\n- **Step 1**: Define the ''matter'' of language as per the text (sound and mark) and the ''form'' of language as per the text (meaning).\n- **Step 2**: Relate the matter of language (sound and mark) to the study of grammar.\n- **Step 3**: Relate the form of language (meaning) to the study of rhetoric and logic.\n- **Step 4**: Justify how the trivium as a whole reflects the unity of matter and form in language.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions and demonstrate an understanding of how each trivium branch corresponds to matter or form.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Phonetics and Orthography**\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is described in the text as a system for representing speech sounds. Consider the English language''s lack of certain vowel and consonant sounds compared to German and French.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the IPA is essential for studying the ''matter'' of language, particularly in the context of spoken language.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the implications of English lacking certain vowel and consonant sounds for the study of orthography (spelling).\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that the study of phonetics and orthography together provides a more complete understanding of the ''matter'' of language than studying either alone.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the text''s descriptions of phonetics and orthography and demonstrate an understanding of their interdependence in representing language''s matter.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Language Classification**\n\nThe text describes language as a system of symbols for expressing thoughts, volitions, and emotions. Consider the following statements: \n- Statement 1: ''The voice of irrational animals has meaning from nature.''\n- Statement 2: ''Human voice is symbolic, having meaning imposed by convention.''\n\n- **Part A**: Use the text''s definitions to explain the difference between the meaning of animal voices and human speech.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that human speech, as described in the text, is a form of symbolic communication.\n- **Part C**: Disprove the claim: ''All symbolic communication is human-made.'' Use the text''s definitions and examples to support your argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions of symbolic communication and demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between natural and conventional meaning in language.'

- prompt: "Form of Language  \nThe form of language is meaning. Words can symbolize both individuals and essences. In metaphysics or ontology, the science of being, one can distinguish the individual and the essence. The individual is any physical being that exists. Only the individual exists in the sense that every material being that exists or has existed is an individual, is itself and not another, and is, therefore, in its individuality unique. Every man, woman, tree, stone, or grain of sand is an individual. Bucephalus, the horse which belonged to Alexander the Great, was an individual horse. Essence is that which makes a being what it is and without which it would not be the kind of being it is.

    An individual animal or flower belongs to a genus only by being a
    member of a species within that genus. The abstract character of genus
    is such that one cannot draw a picture, for example, of animal but only
    of a particular kind or species of animal such as a horse or a dog. Yet,
    even species is abstract, for one cannot photograph the species horse or
    dog; one can photograph only an individual horse or dog since every
    horse or dog that exists is an individual.

    In every individual is the specific essence or class nature which it has
    in common with every other member of its species and also the generic
    essence or class nature which it has in common with every member of
    the genus to which its species belongs. The generic essence is merely
    the specific essence with the more definite characteristics of the latter
    omitted. In addition to the essence which makes it like other members
    of its species and its genus, the individual has individuating character-
    istics which make it different from every other individual in its species
    or its genus.

    18 The Trivium

    An aggregate or group of individuals must be clearly distinguished
    from a species or a genus. An aggregate is merely a particular group of in-
    dividuals, such as the trees in Central Park, the inhabitants of California,
    the Philadelphia Orchestra, the items on a desk, the furniture in a house.

    A species or a genus always signifies a class nature or essence and in-
    cludes all the individuals of every place and time having that nature or
    essence. For example, man is a species and includes all men and
    women of every place and time—past, present, and future. Tree is a
    genus and includes every tree. On the other hand, an aggregate is a par-
    ticular group of individuals that may or may not have the same essence
    or class nature; but in either case, the aggregate does not include all the
    members that have that nature.

    ILLUSTRATION: Aggregate

    The women of the nineteenth century constitute an aggregate of individuals belonging to the same
    species, but they are only a part of the species, namely, those who existed at a particular time.

    The things in a room constitute an aggregate of individuals belonging to different species, such as
    chair, desk, table, book, heat vent, window, etc., but they are only a small part of each species.

    An individual is one. An aggregate is simply a group consisting of two or more individuals.

    Essence is what makes a being what it is.

    Species is a class made up of individuals that have in common the same specific essence.
    Genus is a wider class made up of two or more different species.

    Aggregate is a group consisting of two or more individuals.

    2-2. Essence Terms

    Language and Its Symbols
    Language employs four important kinds of symbols to represent reality:
    two to symbolize the individual, two to symbolize the essence which is
    common to all the individual members of a class.
    Language can symbolize an individual or an aggregate by either a
    proper name or a particular or empirical description. A particular or empirical description is a common name to which is joined a definitive
    The Nature and Function of Language 19

    which limits its application to a particular individual or group. Empirical
    means founded on experience. Since only individuals exist, our experi-
    ence is directly concerned with them. Throughout this book the word
    empirical is used with reference to our knowledge of individuals as such.

    ILLUSTRATION: Language used to symbolize empirical information

    A proper name, such as Eleanor Roosevelt, the Mississippi River, Halloween, London, the United States
    Senate, the Rotarians, the Mediterranean Sea, can symbolize the individual or an aggregate.

    A particular or empirical description, such as the present store manager, this computer, the woman
    who made the flag, the furniture in this house, the microbe now dividing in the petri dish, can sym-
    bolize the individual or an aggregate.

    If language could not symbolize the individual, one could not des-
    ignate particular persons, places, or times. This would be extremely in-
    convenient. For example, people could not direct emergency vehicles
    to their houses.

    On the other hand, if language could symbolize only the individual,
    people would be in a worse plight. Every word would be a proper name,
    and it would therefore be necessary to give a different proper name to
    every object spoken of—not only to people and places but to every-
    thing—to every tree, blade of grass, chair, fork, potato, coat, shoe, pen-
    cil, etc.

    No one would understand except those who had shared through simultaneous sense experience acquaintance with the identical individual objects described. Hence, the language of every town, even of every home, would be different and would be unintelligible to outsiders. The reader may have had a similar experience when three or four friends were reminiscing about an earlier time not known to the reader. The outsider would take little or no interest in the conversation because even though the words could be understood, the proper names of the absentees sprinkled plentifully through the conversation would have no meaning. But if every word were a proper name, unless the listener had personal experience of the very objects being spoken of, he would be not only bored but completely baffled by the conversation.

    Words, being all proper names, would become meaningless at the time of the destruction of the objects they symbolized. They could not even be explained the way proper names are now explained by means of common names (for example, William Caxton, 1422-1491, first English printer; translator), for there would be no common names. Therefore, there could be no history, no literature. What authors wrote would be as dead as their voices in their graves.

    General or universal ideas could not be expressed in language. Therefore, there could be no books on science or philosophy.

    Language can symbolize essence by either of two kinds of symbols, both of which are applicable to all the members of a class. A common name, such as child, tree, chair, square, hour, can symbolize essence. Most of the words listed in the dictionary are common names. Obviously, then, the bulk of language is made up of common names; they symbolize either species or genus.° For example, jump names a species of movement; whereas move means the genus of jump, fly, creep, walk.

    A general or universal description such as a rational animal, an equilateral triangle, an organ of sight can symbolize essence. The definitions given in the dictionary are general descriptions of the single-word entries. They clarify the meanings of the common names. A general description is itself made up wholly of common names.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Symbolic Language and Meaning**\n\nThe text discusses how language can symbolize essence through common names and general descriptions. Using the example of the word ''child'' as a common name and ''rational animal'' as a general description, explain how these two forms of symbolism work together to convey meaning.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''child'' as a common name and ''rational animal'' as a general description using the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the combination of these two forms allows for the expression of universal ideas, such as ''child'' being a species of movement (jump) and ''rational animal'' being a general description of a human.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text emphasizes that general descriptions are made up of common names.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanation of how common names and general descriptions work together to express both specific and universal ideas.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Language and Object Destruction**\n\nThe text argues that words become meaningless when the objects they symbolize are destroyed. Consider the example of the word ''William Caxton'' and the historical events surrounding his death in 1491.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the word ''William Caxton'' would become meaningless if the objects he symbolized (his works, his printing press, his life) were destroyed.\n- **Part B**: Using the text''s argument, argue why there could be no history or literature if all words were proper names.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical scenario where the word ''child'' (a common name) remains meaningful even after the physical objects (children) are destroyed. Explain how this scenario aligns with the text''s explanation of common names as symbols of essence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s argument about the relationship between language, objects, and meaning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Logical Reasoning to Language Structure**\n\nThe text states that general descriptions are made up of common names. Using the example of ''rational animal'' as a general description of a human,\n- **Part A**: Break down ''rational animal'' into its component common names and explain how each contributes to the definition of a human.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the text argues that general descriptions cannot be expressed without common names.\n- **Part C**: Provide a counterexample to the claim that ''all general descriptions are exclusively made up of common names.'' Your counterexample must reference the text''s explanation of symbols and essence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate an understanding of how general descriptions function within the framework of the text''s language theory.'

    Words that represent no reality are not symbols; they are only empty
    words devoid of meaning. A proper name or an empirical description
    must symbolize an individual or an aggregate existing in fact (past or
    present) or in fiction (wherein are characters, places, etc. created by the
    imagination). Otherwise, it is devoid of meaning, as are the present
    King of France or the Emperor of Iowa. The following, however, are
    truly symbols: Hamlet, Sidney Carton, Rapunzel, Nathan Hale, Queen
    Elizabeth I. So also are all the symbols given above as examples of an
    individual or an aggregate.

    A common name or a general description must represent an essence
    or class nature which is intrinsically possible although it need not ac-
    tually exist. Otherwise, it is devoid of meaning as are a square circle or
    a triangular square. The following, however, are truly symbols because
    they express something conceivable: a mermaid, a purple cow, an in-
    habitant of another planet, a regular polygon with one hundred sides,
    an elephant, a rose. So also are the symbols given above as examples of
    the essence, or class nature, of either a species or a genus.

    2-3 Four Kinds of Language Symbols

    Creating Symbols from Reality
    Words are symbols of ideas about reality. How does one derive ideas
    from reality and how does one classify them? Generating a universal
    idea or concept involves several steps, a process more fully treated in
    the study of psychology.

    GENERATION OF A CONCEPT

    First the external senses—sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste—operate
    on an object present before us and produce a percept. The internal
    senses, primarily the imagination, produce a phantasm or mental
    image of the individual object perceived, and this phantasm is retained
    and can be reproduced at will in the absence of the object.

    ILLUSTRATION: Percept and phantasm

    A percept is like a portrait being painted by the artist while she looks at the model.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Symbolic Representation**\n\nExplain the distinction between symbols that represent individuals or aggregates (e.g., Hamlet, Queen Elizabeth I) and symbols that represent essences or classes (e.g., a mermaid, a regular polygon with one hundred sides) as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the defining characteristics of each category.\n- **Step 2**: Provide examples from the text and justify why they belong to their respective categories.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the implications of this distinction for the nature of language and symbolic representation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate the two types of symbols and demonstrate an understanding of their roles in language.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of the Concept Generation Process**\n\nDescribe the process by which a universal idea or concept is generated, as outlined in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Outline the steps from sensory perception to the formation of a concept.\n- **Step 2**: Explain the role of the imagination in this process.\n- **Step 3**: Relate this process to the creation of symbols in language.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the psychological process described and its connection to symbolic representation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Symbolic Meaning**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''words that represent no reality are not symbols'' based on the text.\n- **Part A**: Define what the text considers a symbol.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the example of ''the present King of France'' as a case of a word representing no reality.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that supports the text''s position that certain symbols can represent things that do not exist in reality.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions and provide a logical defense of the text''s position on symbolic representation.'

- prompt: |-
    A phantasm is like that same portrait possessed and looked at whenever one wishes for years after-
    ward although the person painted is absent or even dead.

    There are four internal senses: the imagination, the sensuous memory, the common or central or synthesizing sense, and instinct.

    The intellect through abstraction produces the concept. The imagination is the meeting ground between the senses and the intellect. From the phantasms in the imagination, the intellect abstracts that which is common and necessary to all the phantasms of similar objects (for ex-
    ample, trees or chairs); this is the essence (that which makes a tree a tree or that which makes a chair a chair). The intellectual apprehension of this essence is the general or universal concept (of a tree or a chair).

    A general concept is a universal idea existing only in the mind but
    having its foundation outside the mind in the essence which exists in the
    individual and makes it the kind of thing it is. Therefore, a concept is not
    arbitrary although the word is. Truth has an objective norm in the real.

    22 = ‘The Trivium

    Percept: the image created by the external senses upon encountering reality
    Phantasm: the mental image created by the internal sense, primarily the imagination
    Concept: the abstraction created by the intellect through recognition of the essence

    2-4 Generating a Concept

    A general concept is universal because it is the knowledge of the
    essence present equally in every member of the class, regardless of time,
    place, or individual differences. For example, the concept "chair" is the
    knowledge of the essence "chair," which must be in every chair at all
    times and in all places, regardless of size, weight, color, material, and
    other individual differences.

    The real object (a tree or a chair) and likewise the corresponding
    percept and phantasm, is individual, material, limited to a particular
    place and time; the concept is universal, immaterial, not limited to a
    particular place and time.

    Only human beings have the power of intellectual abstraction;!!
    therefore, only human beings can form a general or universal concept.
    Irrational animals have the external and internal senses, which are
    sometimes keener than those of humans. But because they lack the ra-
    tional powers (intellect, intellectual memory, and free will), they are in-
    capable of progress or of culture. Despite their remarkable instinct,
    their productions, intricate though they may be, remain the same
    through the centuries, for example: beaver dams, bird nests, anthills,
    beehives.

    ANALOGY: Intellectual abstraction

    Flowers contain honey. Butterflies, ants, bees, mosquitoes, and other insects may light upon the
    flower, but only bees can abstract the honey, for only bees have the power to do so. As the bee ab-
    stracts honey from the flowers and ignores everything else in them, so the intellect abstracts from
    the phantasms of similar objects the essence of that which is common and necessary to them and

    ignores everything else, namely, the individual differences.

    There is nothing in the intellect that was not first in the senses ex-
    cept the intellect itself, Human intellectual powers need material to
    work upon. This comes from nature through the senses. Nature
    The Nature and Function of Language 23

    provides the materials, and the human intellect conceives and con-
    structs works of civilization which harness nature and increase its value
    and its services to the human race.

    ANALOGY: Raw material for Intellect

    There is nothing in fine cotton, lace, organdy, or heavy muslin that was not in the raw cotton from
    which they were made. To produce these, the manufacturer requires raw material obtained from na-
    ture by cotton planters. Likewise, the intellect requires for thought the raw material obtained from
    nature through the senses.

    Abstract, or intellectual, knowledge is clearer although less vivid than
    concrete or sense knowledge. For example, circles and squares of various
    sizes and colors can be perceived by the senses and can, consequently,
    be perceived by a pony as well as by a man. A pony in a circus act might
    be trained to respond in various ways to colored disks and squares.

    Only a human being, however, can derive from these various circles and squares the definition of a circle and of a square. A person can also know by abstraction the properties of these figures, such as the relation of the circumferences of a circle to its radius, which he expresses in the abstract formula C = 2πR. Such abstract knowledge is clearer although it is less vivid than the sense apprehension of the colored figures, which the pony can share with a human being.

    Thomas More,1 in his defense of the uses of statues and pictures, contrasts them with words as a means of instruction.2 He points out that words are symbols of phantasms and concepts, as has been explained above:

    Images are necessary books for the uneducated and good books for the learned, too. For all words be but images representing the things that the writer or speaker conceives in his mind, just as the figure of the thing framed with imagination, and so conceived in the mind, is but an image representing the very thing itself that a man thinks of.

    As for example, if I tell you a tale of my good friend, the imagination that I have of him in my mind is not himself but an image that represents him. And when I name him, his name is neither himself nor yet the figure of him in my imagination, but only an image representing to you the imagination of my mind. If I be too far from you to tell it to you, then is the writing not the name itself but an image representing the name. And yet all these names spoken, and all these words written, be no natural signs or images but only made by consent and agreement of men, to betoken and signify such thing, whereas images painted, graven, or carved, may be so well wrought, and so near to the quick and the truth that they shall naturally, and much more effectually represent the thing than shall the name either spoken or written. For he that never heard the name of my friend, shall if ever he saw him be brought in a rightful remembrance of him by his image.

    Once the human intellect creates symbols from reality, those symbols
    or words can be manipulated and catalogued to increase our under-
    standing of reality. Aristotle's ten categories of being classify words in re-
    lationship to our knowledge of being. These metaphysical categories
    have their exact counterpart in the ten categories or praedicamenta!> of
    logic, which classify our concepts, our knowledge of being.

    Every being exists either in itself or in another. If it exists in itself, it
    is a substance. If it exists in another, it is an accident. We distinguish
    nine categories of accident; these, with substance, constitute the ten
    categories of being.

    1 Substance is that which exists in itself, for example, man.

    2 Quantity is a determination of the matter of substance, giving it
    parts distinct from parts, for example, tall.

    3 Quality is a determination of the nature or form of a substance,
    for example: dark, handsome, intelligent, athletic, chivalrous.

    4 Relation is the reference which a substance or accident bears to
    another, for example: friend, near.

    5 Action is the exercise of the faculties or power of a substance so
    as to produce an effect in something else or in itself, for example: click-
    ing a camera, standing up, smiling.

    6 Passion is the reception by a substance of an effect produced by
    some agent, for example: being invited to return, being drafted.

    7 When is position in relation to the course of extrinsic events
    which measure the duration of a substance, for example, Sunday after-
    noon.
    The Nature and Function of Language 25

    8 Where is position in relation to bodies which surround a sub-
    stance and measure and determine its place, for example: on a bench,
    beside the lake.

    9 Posture is the relative position which the parts of a substance
    have toward each other, for example: sitting, leaning forward.

    10 Habiliment consists of clothing, ornaments, or weapons with
    which human beings by their art complement their nature in order to
    conserve their own being or that of the community (the other self), for
    example, in gray tweeds.

    The categories can be organized into three subcategories by what
    they predicate!6 about the subject.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Metaphysical and Logical Categories**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, classify the concept "knowledge" into one of the ten categories of being. Justify your classification by explaining how "knowledge" relates to the subject (the thing being described) and the predicate (the attribute being described).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s definitions of the categories and demonstrate an understanding of how the subject-predicate relationship is structured in metaphysics and logic.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Categories**\n\nGiven the text''s classification of categories into three subcategories based on what they predicate about the subject, construct a logical argument that uses three different categories.\n- **Step 1**: Choose three categories from the ten.\n- **Step 2**: Define each category using the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a syllogism that logically connects these categories to demonstrate a valid inference.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must explicitly reference the text''s definitions and demonstrate mastery of how categories function within the metaphysical and logical framework described.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analysis of Category Function and Hierarchy**\n\nThe text describes the ten categories of being and their relationship to the subject and predicate. Analyze the functional hierarchy of these categories by comparing the roles of substance, quantity, and quality.\n- **Part A**: Explain how substance serves as the foundation of the other categories.\n- **Part B**: Compare the roles of quantity and quality in determining the nature of a substance.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical example that illustrates how a change in quality affects the classification of a substance into a different category.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s definitions and demonstrate an understanding of how categories are interconnected and function within the metaphysical system described.'

    1 The predicate is the subject itself. If the predicate is that which
    is the subject itself and does not exist in the subject, the predicate is a
    substance. (Suzanne is a human being.)

    2 The predicate exists in the subject. If the predicate exists in the
    subject absolutely as flowing from matter, the predicate is a quantity.
    (Suzanne is tall.) If the predicate exists in the subject absolutely as flow-
    ing from form, the predicate is a quality. (Suzanne is intelligent.) If the
    predicate exists in the subject relatively with respect to another, the
    predicate is in the category relation. (Suzanne is Mary's daughter.)

    3 The predicate exists in something extrinsic to the subject. If the
    predicate exists in something extrinsic to the subject and is partially ex-
    trinsic as a principle of action in the subject, the predicate is an action.
    (Suzanne analyzed the data.) If the predicate exists in something ex-
    trinsic to the subject and is a terminus of action in the subject, the pred-
    icate is a passion. (Suzanne was injured.) If the predicate exists in
    something extrinsic to the subject and is wholly extrinsic as a measure
    of the subject according to time, the predicate is in the category when.
    (Suzanne was late.) If the predicate exists in something extrinsic to the
    subject and is wholly extrinsic as a measure of the subject according to
    place, the predicate is in the category where. (Suzanne is here.) If the
    predicate exists in something extrinsic to the subject and is wholly ex-
    trinsic as a measure of the subject according to the order of parts, the
    predicate is in the category posture. (Suzanne is standing.) If the pred-
    icate exists in something extrinsic to the subject and is merely adjacent
    to the subject, the predicate is in the category habiliment. (Suzanne is
    in evening dress.)

    LANGUAGE AND REALITY
    Seven important definitions emerge from a consideration of language

    and reality.

    1 The essence is that which makes a being what it is and without
    which it would not be the kind of being it is.

    2 Nature is essence viewed as the source of activity.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Categorization of Predicates in Statements**\n\nClassify the predicate in the following statements according to the hierarchy described in the text.\n\n1. "Suzanne is a human being."\n2. "Suzanne is tall."\n3. "Suzanne is intelligent."\n4. "Suzanne is Mary''s daughter."\n5. "Suzanne analyzed the data."\n6. "Suzanne was injured."\n7. "Suzanne was late."\n8. "Suzanne is here."\n9. "Suzanne is standing."\n10. "Suzanne is in evening dress."\n\n**Task**: For each statement, identify the category of the predicate (subject itself, quantity, quality, relation, action, passion, when, where, posture, or habiliment) based on the text''s definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must strictly follow the text''s categorization system and justify your answer using the definitions provided.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Essence and Nature**\n\nExplain the distinction between "essence" and "nature" as defined in the text.\n\n1. Define essence according to the text.\n2. Define nature according to the text.\n3. Relate essence and nature to the example of a human being.\n4. Contrast the concept of essence with the concept of a "property" of a human being (e.g., being tall).\n\n**Task**: Use the definitions provided in the text to construct a logical argument that demonstrates how essence and nature differ in their relationship to a being''s identity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must directly reference the text''s definitions and clearly differentiate essence from nature in the context of a human being.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Interpretation of Language and Reality**\n\nUsing the definitions from the text, analyze the statement: "Suzanne is in evening dress."\n\n1. Determine the category of the predicate (habiliment) according to the text.\n2. Explain why this predicate is classified as habiliment rather than another category (e.g., relation, action, or passion).\n3. Compare this classification to the classification of "Suzanne is here" (category: where) and "Suzanne is standing" (category: posture).\n4. Construct a sentence that would be classified under the category "posture" and explain why it fits.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s definitions and demonstrate an understanding of how predicates are classified based on their relationship to the subject.'

    3 The individual is constituted of essence existent in quantified matter plus other accidents. Essence is that which makes the individual like other members of its class. Quantified matter is that which makes the individual different from other individuals in its class because matter, extended by reason of its quantity, must be this or that matter, which by limiting the form individuates it. Accidents are those notes (shapes, color, weight, size, etc.) by which we perceive the difference between the individuals of a class. The individuals within a species (for example, all human beings) are essentially the same. But they are not merely accidentally different; they are individually different. Even if individuals were as alike as the matches in a box of matches or the pins in a paper of pins, they would be nonetheless individually different because the matter in one is not the matter in the other but is a different quantity or part even though of the same kind and amount.

    4 A percept is the sense-apprehension of an individual reality (in its presence).

    5 A phantasm is the mental image of an individual reality (in its absence).

    6 A general concept is the intellectual apprehension of essence.

    7 An empirical concept is the indirect intellectual apprehension of an individual. The intellect can know individual objects only indirectly in the phantasms because individuals are material, with one exception, the intellect itself; because it is a spiritual individual, the intellect can know itself directly and reflexively. (See Saint Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Part I, Question 86, Articles 1 and 3.)

    In a natural object the following are similar but distinct: substance, essence, nature, form, species. The knowledge of these is the concept, which is expressed fully in the definition and symbolized by the common name.

    Since man cannot create substance but can merely fashion substances that are furnished by nature, an artificial object such as a chair has two essences: the essence of its matter (wood, iron, marble, etc.) and the essence of its form (chair). The essence of the form is expressed in the definition (of chair).

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Substance and Essence in Artificial Objects\n\nConsider an artificial object like a chair. Using the definitions provided in the text, explain how a chair possesses two essences: the essence of its matter (e.g., wood, iron, marble) and the essence of its form (chair).\n- **Step 1**: Define ''substance'' and ''essence'' based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the essence of matter is determined by the material used (e.g., wood, iron, marble).\n- **Step 3**: Describe how the essence of form is expressed in the definition of a chair.\n- **Step 4**: Justify why the chair''s existence as a chair depends on both essences.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must integrate the concepts of substance, essence, and form as outlined in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how artificial objects are composed of both material and formal essences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical Analysis of Perception and Concept Formation\n\nUsing the definitions of ''percept,'' ''phantasm,'' ''general concept,'' and ''empirical concept'' from the text, analyze the process by which a person forms the concept of a ''chair.''\n- **Step 1**: Describe how a percept is formed when a person sees a chair.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how a phantasm is formed after the chair is no longer present.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how a general concept of ''chair'' is formed from the phantasm.\n- **Step 4**: Justify why the intellect can only know individual objects indirectly, except for itself, based on the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must connect the process of perception, phantasm, and concept formation as outlined in the text and demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between direct and indirect knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Critical Reasoning on Classification of Natural Objects\n\nThe text states that in natural objects, ''substance, essence, nature, form, species'' are similar but distinct. Using this information, evaluate the claim: ''A tree is a substance, and its species is its essence.''\n- **Part A**: Define ''substance,'' ''essence,'' and ''species'' based on the text.\n- **Part B**: Argue whether a tree is a substance and whether its species is its essence, using the definitions provided.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a natural object that illustrates the distinction between ''nature'' and ''form'' as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must integrate the definitions of substance, essence, and species as outlined in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of the relationships between these concepts in natural objects.'

    Frequently, a common name symbolizes a concept that is not simple nor equivalent to the essence of the natural species, like human being, but is a composite, like lawyer or athlete, including in its definition certain accidents which determine not natural species but classes that differ only accidentally. A composite concept may be called a construct.

    Lawyer and athlete are constructs, for their definition adds to the simple concept human being certain accidents such as knowledge of law or physical agility, which are essential to the definition of lawyer or of athlete although not essential to the definition of a construct. For example, a particular lawyer may be tall, blond, irritable, generous, etc., but these accidents are not more essential to being a lawyer than they are to being a human being.

    A construct may be analyzed into its components by showing in what categories its essential meanings lie.

    ILLUSTRATION: Analysis of constructs

    Carpenter
    Substance—human being
    Quality—skill in building with wood

    Legislator
    Substance—human being
    Action—making laws
    Relation—to an electorate

    Blizzard
    Substance—water
    Quality—cold

    Passion—vaporized, frozen into snow, blown about by a high wind

    In the English language a construct is usually symbolized by a single word which does not make explicit the composite character of the construct. In an agglutinated language like German, a construct is more commonly symbolized by a compound word which does make explicit its composite character, for example, Abwehrflammenwerfer (defensive flame-thrower). Also, the English word tank in German is Raupenschlepperpanzerkampfwagen (a caterpillarlike, self-moving, armored war wagon). This has been shortened to panzer, a term familiar through films and books.

    Logical and Psychological Dimensions of Language
    Language has logical and psychological meanings which may be illustrated through a closer look at the words house and home.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Construct Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the construct ''lawyer'' using the provided definitions and examples in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the essential meaning of ''lawyer'' based on the text''s definition of a construct.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the term ''lawyer'' is a composite concept, incorporating both a substance and essential qualities.\n- **Step 3**: Compare and contrast ''lawyer'' with ''carpenter'' as constructs, highlighting the difference in their essential qualities.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of the text''s distinction between substance and essential qualities, and clearly articulate how each construct is a composite of these elements.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Construct Components**\n\nUsing the text''s analysis of constructs, determine whether the following terms are constructs or simple concepts. Justify your answer using the criteria provided in the text.\n- **Term 1**: ''Tree''\n- **Term 2**: ''Democracy''\n- **Term 3**: ''Sailor''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a clear explanation of why each term is or is not a construct, referencing the text''s examples and definitions. Additionally, you must explain how the concept of a construct is related to the idea of a ''composite concept'' as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Construct Analysis and Counterexample**\n\nThe text discusses how constructs are symbolized by single words in English but may be more explicitly represented in languages like German.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the English word ''tank'' symbolizes a construct, using the text''s example of the German term ''panzer''.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that all constructs are ''composite concepts''. Use the text''s definition of a construct and the examples provided to support your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the text''s distinction between ''logical'' and ''psychological'' meanings of language. How does the concept of a construct relate to both dimensions?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of language, constructs, and the distinction between logical and psychological meanings, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.'

    If house is represented as a b, then home may be represented as a b x.

    Objectively, the definition (the logical dimension) of house and home
    are similar and may be represented by the lines ab; but subjectively,
    home is a much richer word, for to its logical content is added an emo-
    tional content (the psychological dimension) associated with the word
    and represented by the line bx. The fact that house has practically no psy-
    chological dimension while home has much accounts for the different
    effects produced by the following lines, which are equivalent in the log-
    ical dimensions.

    ILLUSTRATION: Psychological dimension of language
    House, house, loved, loved house!
    There's no place like my house! There's no place like my house!

    "Home, Home, sweet, sweet Home!
    There's no place like Home! There's no place like Home!'
    —John Howard Payne, "Clari, the Maid of Milan'

    LOGICAL DIMENSIONS OF LANGUAGE

    The logical or intellectual dimension of a word is its thought content,
    which may be expressed in its definition, given in the dictionary. In
    rhetoric this is called the denotation of the word.

    ANALOGY: Logical and psychological dimensions of language

    The logical dimension of language may be compared to the incandescent electrified wire in a
    transparent bulb; the wire is obvious and its limits are clearly defined. The psychological dimension
    may be compared to a frosted bulb, in which all the light, it is true, comes from the incandescent
    wire within, but the light is softened and diffused by the bulb, which gives it a more beautiful and
    psychologically warmer glow.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: |-
    **Synthesis of Logical and Psychological Dimensions**\n\nGiven the analogy in the text where the logical dimension is like an incandescent wire and the psychological dimension is like a frosted bulb, explain how the lines:

    "House, house, loved, loved house!\nThere's no place like my house! There's no place like my house!\n\nHome, Home, sweet, sweet Home!\nThere's no place like Home! There's no place like Home!\n\n"\n
    demonstrate the difference between the logical and psychological dimensions of language.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the analogy provided in the text and explain how the psychological dimension adds emotional content to the logical meaning of the words. You must also connect this to the concept of denotation and connotation as defined in the text.
  finalExamQuestion2: |-
    **Application of Analogy to Language Dimensions**\n\nUsing the analogy of the incandescent wire and frosted bulb, create your own example that illustrates the difference between the logical and psychological dimensions of language. Your example must:

    - Be based on a real-world object or concept
    - Clearly demonstrate the logical (denotative) meaning and the psychological (connotative) meaning
    - Show how the psychological dimension 'softens' and adds emotional depth to the logical meaning

    **Answer Requirement**: Your example must be original and clearly demonstrate the distinction between the two dimensions, using the analogy provided in the text to explain your reasoning.
  finalExamQuestion3: |-
    **Logical Reasoning with Language Classifications**\n\nIf 'house' is represented as 'ab' and 'home' as 'ab x', as shown in the text, explain how this representation supports the idea that 'home' has a richer psychological dimension than 'house'. Your explanation must:

    - Reference the text's definition of the logical and psychological dimensions
    - Explain how the addition of 'x' to 'ab' changes the meaning of the word
    - Justify why this change results in a more complex and emotionally rich concept

    **Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of denotation, connotation, and the analogy of the frosted bulb to explain the difference between the two words.

     Language with a purely logical dimension is desirable in legal doc-
    uments and in scientific and philosophical treatises, where clarity, pre-
    cision, and singleness of meaning are requisite. Consequently,
    synonyms, which usually vary in shades of meaning, ought to be
    avoided, and the same word should be employed throughout to convey
    the same meaning; or if it is used with a different meaning, that fact
    should be made clear. Abstract words are usually clearer and more pre-
    cise than concrete words, for abstract knowledge is clearer, although
    less vivid, than sense knowledge. Yet to communicate abstract knowl-
    edge, one should employ concrete illustrations from which the reader
    or listener can make the abstraction for himself since by so doing he
    grasps the abstract ideas much better than if the writer or speaker gave
    them to him ready-made.

    PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS OF LANGUAGE

    The psychological dimension of language is in its emotional content —
    the related images, nuances, and emotion spontaneously associated
    with words. In rhetoric this is called the connotation of the word. Pro-
    pagandists often abuse the connotative value of words.

    Language with a rich psychological dimension is desirable in poetry
    and other literature, where humor, pathos, grandeur, and sublimity are
    communicated.

    In literary composition, one should employ words that are concrete
    rather than abstract, that are rich in imagery and idiomatic. Synonyms
    should be used in order to avoid monotony of sound and to convey sub-
    tle shades of meaning that vary in both the logical and the psychologi-
    cal dimension.

    A sensitive awareness of the subtleties of language, particularly in its
    psychological dimension, enables one to recognize good style in the
    speech and writing of others and to cultivate good style in one's own
    composition, both oral and written.

    The substance of a given composition may be translated almost per-
    fectly from one language to another in the logical dimension. Transla-
    tion is seldom satisfactory, however, in the psychological dimension.

    30 = The Trivium

    That is why poetry in translation is usually less pleasing than in the
    original.

    Sound and the Psychological Dimension

    Various characteristics of words affect the psychological dimension
    of language.

    The mere sound of a word may produce a pleasing effect which another word of the same meaning lacks. In "Silver" by Walter de la Mare, the poet's substitution of words like shoon for shoes and casements for windows are examples of the poet's use of sound to create a psychological effect.

    ILLUSTRATION: The psychological value of sound

    SILVER

    Slowly, silently, now the moon
    Walks the night in her silver shoon;
    This way, and that, she peers, and sees
    Silver fruit upon silver trees;
    One by one the casements catch
    Her beams beneath the silvery thatch;
    Couched in his kennel, like a log,
    With paws of silver sleeps the dog:
    From their shadowy cote the white breasts peep
    Of doves in a silver-feathered sleep;
    A harvest mouse goes scampering by,
    With silver claws and a silver eye;
    And moveless fish in the water gleam,
    By silver reeds in a silver stream.
    —Walter de la Mare

    Pedantic Style
    A pedantic or pompous style is psychologically displeasing. Compare these sentence pairs, identical in logical meaning.

    ILLUSTRATION: Pedantic style

    Behold! The inhabitants have all retired to their domiciles.
    Look! The people have all gone home.

    The vaulted dome of heaven is cerulean.
    The sky is blue.

    The Nature and Function of Language 31

    Idiom and Emotional Effect

    The emotional effect of a word, often a by-product of its historical
    development, belongs to the idiom of language and would often be lost
    in translation. The following examples show that sentences alike in log-
    ical dimension can be quite different in psychological dimension.

    ILLUSTRATION: Idiom

    A young man tells a young woman, "Time stands still when I look into your eyes."
    Another tells her, "You have a face that would stop a clock."
    A young man tells a woman, "You are a vision." Another, "You are a sight."

    At a meeting of the United Nations, an American produced bewilderment among the translators by

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sound and Psychological Effect in Poetry**\n\nIn ''Silver'' by Walter de la Mare, the poet uses specific words like ''shoon'' for ''shoes'' and ''casements'' for ''windows'' to create a psychological effect.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the substitution of words with similar sounds (e.g., ''shoon'' for ''shoes'') enhances the poem''s mood.\n- **Part B**: Compare this technique to the use of alliteration in the line ''A harvest mouse goes scampering by, With silver claws and a silver eye.'' How does the repetition of ''silver'' affect the reader''s perception of the scene?\n- **Part C**: Justify why the poet might choose such substitutions over more direct language, using the text''s discussion of sound''s psychological impact.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concept of sound''s psychological effect and provide specific textual evidence from the poem.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Pedantic Style in Language**\n\nThe text contrasts a pedantic style with a more natural, expressive style.\n- **Part A**: Compare the two sentences from the text: ''Behold! The inhabitants have all retired to their domiciles.'' and ''Look! The people have all gone home.'' How does the use of ''domiciles'' instead of ''home'' contribute to the psychological effect?\n- **Part B**: Explain why the sentence ''The vaulted dome of heaven is cerulean.'' is considered pedantic, while ''The sky is blue.'' is not. Use examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that demonstrates pedantic style, and another that demonstrates a natural, expressive style. Justify your choices based on the text''s definition of pedantic style.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the psychological impact of language style and provide specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Idiom and Emotional Effect**\n\nThe text explains that idioms often carry emotional or historical connotations that may be lost in translation.\n- **Part A**: Compare the two sentences: ''Time stands still when I look into your eyes.'' and ''You have a face that would stop a clock.'' How do these sentences differ in emotional effect, and what idiom is being used in the second?\n- **Part B**: Analyze the phrase ''pork barrel floating on a pink cloud'' from the text. Explain how this idiom conveys a specific emotional or political meaning that might not be clear in a literal translation.\n- **Part C**: Create an idiom that conveys a similar psychological effect to ''a vision is a sight.'' Explain your choice based on the text''s discussion of idioms and their emotional impact.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concept of idiom and its emotional effect, using specific examples from the text.'

    Ms. Smith and Ms. Baker had dinner together. Asked by Mr. Schofield, "What kind of meat did you have for dinner?" Ms. Smith replied, "I had roast pork." Ms. Baker replied, "I had roast swine meat."

    We find Ms. Baker's answer revolting because swine has been regarded as a word unfit for polite discourse in English, certainly unfit to name meat, ever since the Norman Conquest in 1066. After that, the conquered and deposed Anglo-Saxons tended the live animal and called it swine, but the aristocratic Normans to whom it was served at the banquet table called it pork, a word derived from the Latin through the French, and in those languages applied to the live animal as well as to the meat. The associations built into the word swine in the history of the language are felt by modern English-speaking people who do not even know the occasion of the emotional response which they, nonetheless, experience.

    Allusion

    An allusion is a passing reference to phrases or longer passages which the writer takes for granted will be familiar to the reader. Sometimes the writer changes the phrases somewhat, but whether the same or modified, they depend for their effect on reminding the reader of the original; for instance, With Malice Toward Some is a title deliberately intended to remind the reader of the phrase in Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, "with malice toward none."

    An allusion depends for much of its effect on the psychological dimension of language, for it enriches the passage in which it occurs with emotional overtones and associated ideas derived from the context in which it originally appeared. The following examples show the importance of allusion.

    ILLUSTRATION: Allusion

    Most of the paper is as blank as Modred's shield.
    —Rudyard Kipling, "The Man Who Would Be King"

    Bores make cowards of us all.

    Friend, on this scaffold Thomas More lies dead
    Who would not cut the Body from the Head.

    For those whose literary background is inadequate and who there-
    fore are unfamiliar with the source of the allusion, a work such as the
    concordance to the Bible or to Shakespeare, both frequent sources of
    allusion, will prove helpful. A dictionary of people and places men-
    tioned in Greek and Latin literature will explain classical allusions.

    The writers who make allusions expect, of course, that their readers
    will be familiar at first hand with the literature to which they refer. One
    of the rewards of literary study is the possession of a heritage of poetry
    and story which causes many names and phrases to echo with rich re-
    verberations down the centuries. The language of allusion often pro-
    vides a sort of shorthand which links and communicates in a few words
    experiences shared by people facing similar situations in all periods of
    human history.

    Combination of Words

    The psychological dimension of words is especially affected by their
    combinations.

    Some combinations, particularly of adjectives and nouns and of
    nouns and verbs, are "just right," for example, the following combinations
    in Milton: "dappled dawn," "checkered shade," "leaden-stepping hours,"
    "disproportioned sin jarred against nature's chime." It is fitting to speak of
    azure light or the azure sky or an azure evening gown, but not of an azure
    apron because azure and apron clash in the psychological dimension.
    The combination is disharmonious. It is certainly not "just right."

    The Nature and Function of Language 33

    Certain combinations of words and thoughts produce a vivid con-
    centration of meaning rich in the psychological dimension.

    ILLUSTRATION: Combination of words

    Logical and Poetic Understanding

    What is false when taken literally in the purely logical dimension
    may be true when understood imaginatively or figuratively in the psychological dimension.

    ILLUSTRATION: Poetic use of language

    Song

    Go and catch a falling star,
    Get with child a mandrake root,
    Tell me where all past years are,
    Or who cleft the devil's foot,
    Teach me to hear mermaids singing,
    Or to keep off envy's stinging,
    And find
    What wind
    serves to advance an honest mind.

    If thou be borne to strange sights,
    Things invisible to see
    Ride ten thousand days and nights,
    Till age snow white hairs on thee,
    Thou, when thou return'st wilt tell me
    All strange wonders that befell thee,
    And swear
    Nowhere
    Lives a woman true, and fair.

    If thou findst one, let me know,
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet—
    Yet do not, I would not go,
    Though at next door we might meet;
    Though she were true, when you met her,
    And last, till you write your letter,
    Yet she
    Will be
    False, ere I come, to two, or three.
    —John Donne

    This poem understood literally, in its logical dimension, is false and
    even ridiculous. But understood imaginatively, as it is meant to be
    since it is metaphorical, the poem has emotional truth. The very sound
    and movement of the words and the symmetry—the parallel grammatical and logical structure—of the three stanzas contribute to the pleasing effect.

    The Ambiguity of Language

    Since a word is a symbol, an arbitrary sign whose meaning is imposed
    on it, not by nature, not by resemblance, but by convention, it is by its
    very nature subject to ambiguity; for, obviously, more than one meaning may be imposed on a given symbol. In a living language, the common people from time to time under changing conditions impose new meanings on the same word, and therefore words are more subject to ambiguity than are the symbols of mathematics, chemistry, or music, whose meaning is imposed on them by experts.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Logical and Poetic Understanding\n\nConsider the poem by John Donne as presented in the text.\n- **Part A**: Analyze the poem''s logical dimension. Identify one statement that, when taken literally, is illogical or absurd. Explain why this statement is false in the logical dimension.\n- **Part B**: Examine the poem''s poetic dimension. Identify one metaphor or symbolic element and explain its emotional or imaginative significance. How does this element contribute to the poem''s overall theme?\n- **Part C**: Compare the logical and poetic dimensions. Discuss how the poem''s structure (e.g., parallelism) enhances the imaginative meaning while potentially undermining the logical interpretation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both dimensions and their interplay, using examples directly from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Ambiguity in Language and Meaning\n\nUsing the text''s explanation of linguistic ambiguity,\n- **Part A**: Provide an example of a word that has multiple meanings in common usage, similar to how words in a living language can acquire new meanings over time. Explain how this reflects the text''s concept of ambiguity.\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with the ambiguity in mathematical or scientific symbols. Give an example of a symbol that, while defined by experts, may still be subject to interpretation. How does this difference align with the text''s discussion of ambiguity?\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the ambiguity of language affects the interpretation of poetry. Discuss how a reader''s personal experience or cultural context might influence the meaning of a poetic line.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of linguistic ambiguity and its implications for interpretation, using examples from the text.'

Using this idea,\n- **Part A**: Analyze a line from the poem that, when taken literally, seems illogical. Explain why this line is false in the logical dimension but holds emotional truth in the poetic dimension.\n- **Part B**: Construct a metaphor that, when taken literally, is absurd but has a meaningful figurative interpretation. Explain how this metaphor aligns with the text''s assertion about the relationship between logical and poetic understanding.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the structure of the poem (e.g., parallelism, rhythm) contributes to its poetic truth. How might this structure be interpreted logically, and what does that reveal about the poem''s purpose?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to analyze and synthesize the concepts of logical and poetic truth as presented in the text.'

    The ambiguity of a word may arise from: (1) the various meanings imposed on it in the course of time, constituting the history of the word; (2) the nature of a symbol, from which arise the three impositions of a word and the two intentions of a term; (3) the nature of the phantasm for which the word is originally a substitute (see Chapter Two, Generation of a Concept).

    AMBIGUITY ARISING FROM THE HISTORY OF WORDS
    The symbol or word acquires various meanings during the course of time. The fact that one sound or word can have many meanings can create ambiguity because it might not be known which meaning is symbolized. Such words are homonyms, ambiguous to the ear, and they may or may not differ in spelling when written. The ambiguous sound may be within the same language, or it may be in different languages.

    ILLUSTRATION: Ambiguity in sound

    The ambiguous sound may be within the same language.

    road, rode: right, wright, rite, write:
    sound "that which is heard" and sound "a body of water"

    The ambiguous sound may be in different languages.

    pax (Latin, "peace") and pox (English, "eruption")

    hell (German, "bright," and English, "abode of wicked spirits")

    nix (Latin, "snow"; English slang, "nothing") and nicks (English, "notches"
    bright (English, "shining") and bre/t (German, "broad")

    bower (English, "a leafy shelter") and Bauer (German, "farmer")

    Note that the above pairs of words would be spelled alike if written in the alphabet of the International Phonetic Association whereby one can write such directions as "Spell [tul three ways' without giving away the answer: "two, too, to."

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Ambiguity in Sound**\n\nConsider the word ''right'' as an example of a homonym with multiple meanings.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the different meanings of ''right'' as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the ambiguity arises from the fact that the word is pronounced the same but has different meanings.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this ambiguity to the example of ''pax'' and ''pox'' from the text, explaining how the same sound can have different meanings in different languages.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define the two meanings of ''right'' and demonstrate an understanding of how linguistic history and pronunciation lead to ambiguity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Ambiguity in Symbols**\n\nExamine the word ''nix'' as discussed in the text.\n- **Part A**: List the two different meanings of ''nix'' as presented in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the same spelling and pronunciation can lead to confusion in understanding the word''s meaning.\n- **Part C**: Using the concept of ''intentions of a term'' from the text, argue whether the word ''nix'' should be considered a single term or multiple terms. Justify your reasoning based on the text''s discussion of word ambiguity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must address both the linguistic and conceptual ambiguity of ''nix'' and incorporate the text''s ideas about the nature of symbols and terms.'

    A given notation is ambiguous when it symbolizes different meanings, whether in the same or in different languages. Some homonyms lose their ambiguity when they are written, for example, road, rode, bright, breit. Some retain it, for example, sound, hell. Some words, unambiguous when spoken, become ambiguous when written, for example, tear "rend," and tear "a drop from the lachrymal gland."

    The dictionary records the meanings that have been imposed on a given notation in the history of the language. The dictionary does not legislate but merely records good usage. A work like Fowler's A Dictionary of Modern English Usage concentrates particularly on present usage. The Oxford English Dictionary undertakes to give the dates, if possible, when new meanings were imposed on a word and to cite passages illustrating that particular use.

    An instance of a new imposition is that on swastika, both the word and the graphic symbol. After the revolution of 1918 in Germany, the swastika, which was an ancient symbol of good luck, was adopted by the Nazi Party.

    Still another instance is the imposition of the meaning "treasonous group, working from within" on fifth column. In 1936, during the Spanish civil war, General Emilio Mola declared that he would capture Madrid since in addition to his four columns of troops outside the city, he had a fifth column of sympathizers within the city.

    The relationship between the various meanings that have been imposed on a given notation may be equivocal, having nothing in common—for example, sound "a body of water" and sound "that which is heard" —or analogical, having something in common—for example, march "a regular measured step" and march "a musical composition to accompany marching."

    AMBIGUITY ARISING FROM IMPOSITION AND INTENTION
    Ambiguity is caused by the very nature of a symbol, from which arise the three impositions of a word and the two intentions of a term.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Ambiguity in Language**\n\nConsider the word ''sound'' as discussed in the text. The text notes that ''sound'' can mean ''a body of water'' or ''that which is heard.'' Analyze the ambiguity of the word ''sound'' by:\n- **Part A**: Identifying the two distinct meanings based on the text''s explanation of equivocal relationships.\n- **Part B**: Creating a scenario where the word ''sound'' could be used in both meanings without confusion. Explain how the context resolves the ambiguity.\n- **Part C**: Drawing a parallel between the ambiguity of ''sound'' and the ambiguity of the word ''tear'' as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between equivocal and analogical relationships, and demonstrate an understanding of how context resolves ambiguity in language.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Meaning Imposition**\n\nExamine the imposition of the meaning ''treasonous group, working from within'' on the word ''fifth column'' as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the term ''fifth column'' was historically imposed with this meaning, citing the example from the Spanish Civil War.\n- **Part B**: Compare this with the imposition of the meaning ''ancient symbol of good luck'' on the swastika. Discuss the difference between the two impositions in terms of intention and historical context.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s discussion of dictionary entries as records of usage rather than legislation applies to the ''fifth column'' and ''swastika'' examples.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how meanings are imposed on words and how dictionaries record these impositions without dictating them.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Ambiguity**\n\nThe text discusses ambiguity arising from the three impositions of a word and the two intentions of a term. Using this framework, construct a scenario where a word has both equivocal and analogical relationships, and where the two intentions of the term are clearly defined.\n- **Part A**: Choose a word that has multiple meanings with both equivocal and analogical relationships.\n- **Part B**: Define the two intentions of the term based on the text''s explanation.\n- **Part C**: Create a real-world example where the ambiguity of the word is resolved by context, and explain how the context clarifies the intended meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s concepts of ambiguity, intention, and context, and demonstrate a clear understanding of how meaning is determined in language.'

    The ultimate purpose of words and terms is to convey to another one's ideas about reality. But between the reality as it exists and as one apprehends it and expresses it are a number of intermediate steps: the creation of the phantasm, the creation of the percept, and the creation of the concept.

    If one uses a word or a term to refer directly to a reality not itself, to what we know, it is used predicatively (that is, said of another, or referring to another, to the reality which it symbolizes). This is the ordinary use of a word or a term, and it is then used in first imposition and in first intention. If, however, one uses a word or a term to refer to itself as an instrument in any one of the intermediate steps by which we know or by which we symbolize what we know, it is used reflexively (that is, referring to itself, as a concept, a sound, a mark, a noun, etc.). This is the peculiar use of a word or a term in an imposition or an intention different from the ordinary use, as may be seen in the following examples.

    ILLUSTRATION: Imposition and intention

    Jane married a man. (Here the word man refers to another, a real man who exists; therefore, man is here used in first imposition and first intention.)

    Man is a monosyllable. (Here the word man refers to itself as a mere sound. One can know man is a monosyllable without even knowing its meaning; therefore man is here used in zero imposition. It is false to say, "A man is a monosyllable," because when the article is added the word man refers to a real man, not to a mere sound. Jane did not marry a monosyliable.)

    Man has three letters. (Here man refers to itself as a mere notation or mark. One can see that man, when written or printed, has three letters without knowing its meaning; therefore man is here used in zero imposition. It is false to say, "A man has three letters," because, with the article, man refers to a real man, not a mere notation. Jane did not marry three letters.)

Justify your answer based on the text''s explanation of zero imposition.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the claim that ''Man is a man'' is a tautology. Does this statement exemplify the ordinary or peculiar use of the word ''man''? Explain your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the stages of knowledge acquisition and demonstrate an understanding of how words function as symbols in the trivium framework.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Terminological Use**\n\nThe text discusses the difference between referring to a word as a symbol (peculiar use) and referring to it as an object (ordinary use).

Justify your answer by referencing the text''s explanation of zero imposition.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that ''All words are symbols.'' Your example must reference the text''s distinction between ordinary and peculiar use and clarify how words can refer to reality or to themselves.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s distinction between the two uses of words and apply it to construct a logical argument about language and symbolism.'

    Zero imposition is the reflexive use of a word with reference only to itself as a sensible sign (a sound or a notation) without adverting to its meaning, which need not even be known. When a word is used in zero imposition, it is like a window or like eyeglasses at which we look in stead of through which we look to see something else. This is not the ordinary use of words or windows or eyeglasses. Phonetics is concerned with the word as a sound, for it deals with its correct pronunciation, with the likeness of terminal sounds in words that rhyme, etc. Spelling, or orthography, is concerned with the word as a notation.

    ILLUSTRATION: Zero imposition

    Exquisite is often mispronounced.

    Ally is accented on the second syllable.
    Hamora has three syllables.

    Do not mispronounce fire; it is not a dissyllable.
    You use too many ana's in your writing.

    Erase much and substitute many.

    Similes has seven letters, not eight.

    Zero imposition is the basis of a certain type of conundrum.

    ILLUSTRATION: Zero imposition In conundrums

    Nebuchadnezzar, King of the Jews!
    Spell that with four letters and |‘l! tell you the news.

    Which word in the English language is most often pronounced incorrectly?
    Answer: incorrectly.

    Second imposition is the reflexive use of a word; it refers to itself precisely as a word, with reference both to the sensible sign and to the meaning. This use of the word is confined to grammar; a word cannot be classified in grammar if its meaning is not known. Grammar is therefore the science of second impositions.

    ILLUSTRATION: Second Imposition

    Jump is a verb.

    Hamora is a noun, genitive plural (Old English).
    On the hiffis a phrase.

    Cake is the direct object of is eating.

    Any word, phrase, or clause, no matter what part of speech it is in or-
    dinary usage, becomes a noun when used in second imposition or in
    zero imposition because then it names itself. Words in zero or in sec-
    ond imposition should be italicized, and they form their plural by
    adding the apostrophe and s, for example: and's, 2's, p's, and q's.

    Words of the science of grammar and words of the sciences of pho-
    netics and spelling, like all other words, can be used in each of the three
    impositions.

    AMBIGUITY ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE PHANTASM

    The phantasm is a mental image of an object or objects outside the
    mind (the designation, or extension, of the term); from this image the
    intellect abstracts the concept (the meaning, or intension, of the term)
    within the mind. Because of this threefold character of the phantasm,
    for which the word is originally a substitute, the word is subject to three

    kinds of ambiguity:

    1. Ambiguity can arise from the image the word evokes. The word
    dog spontaneously evokes a different image in, for instance, a Swiss
    mountaineer, an Arctic explorer, a British hunter, an Illinois farmer.
    The power of words thus to evoke images affects the psychological di-
    mension of language and is especially important in literary composi-
    tion.

    2. Ambiguity can arise from a word's extension or designation —the ob-
    ject or the objects to which the term can be applied, its external refer-
    ence. The primary purpose of a proper name is to designate a particular
    individual or aggregate; yet a proper name is sometimes ambiguous in
    designation because the same name has been given to more than one
    individual or aggregate within the same species, for example, William
    Shakespeare, dramatic poet, 1564-1616, and William Shakespeare, a
    carpenter.

    To make proper names unambiguous is a special problem in draw-
    ing up legal documents such as wills, deeds, contracts. If a man were
    to leave half of his estate to Tom Jones, many claimants would ap-
    pear, unless the heir were designated with less ambiguity so as to ex-
    clude every person except the Tom Jones whom the testator had in
    mind.

    Telephone books add addresses, empirical descriptions, to proper
    names in an effort to make them unambiguous in their reference. The
    identification cards of criminals are attempts to make a proper name
    unambiguous by supplementing it with an empirical description, a
    photograph, and fingerprints, which are regarded as unique in the
    truest sense of the word, because no two are exactly alike.

    An empirical description is less ambiguous in designation than a
    proper name, for example, the first president of this country.

- prompt: |-
    4 Ambiguity can arise because a common name, such as man,
    ship, house, hill, is meant to be applicable to every object of the class
    named and therefore to be general, or universal, in its designation. For
    example: the full extension, or designation, of ocean is five; of friend,
    with reference to you, is the number of your friends; of mountain, tree,
    book, is the total number of objects past, present, or future to which the
    term can be applied.

    3 Ambiguity can arise because both common and proper names
    acquire many meanings; in other words, the intension2? or meaning or
    concept can be many. The primary purpose of a common name is to
    be precise in meaning, or intension; yet a common name is often am-
    biguous in intension because a number of meanings have been im-
    posed on it. For example, sound may mean "that which is heard" or "a
    body of water." Each of these explanations of sound is called a general,
    or universal, description. The general description is less ambiguous in
    meaning than is the common name.

    A definition is a perfect general description. The dictionary lists the
    various meanings that constitute the intensional ambiguity of words.
    The words defined are common names; the definitions are general, or
    universal, descriptions. A common name is used primarily in intension
    (although it has extension) in contrast to a proper name, which is used
    primarily in extension (a]though it has intension).

    A proper name, like George Washington, although used primarily to
    designate an individual, must designate an individual of some particu-
    lar species, for example, a man, a bridge, a ship, a hotel, a university,
    because every individual is a member of some class.

    Inasmuch as the individual designated may be one of various differ-
    ent species, a proper name may be ambiguous in intension. For exam-
    ple, Bryn Mawr may designate a college or a town in Pennsylvania.
    Madeira may designate a group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean near
    Morocco, a river in Brazil, or a fortified wine.

    Although ambiguity is a fault to be carefully guarded against in purely
    intellectual communications, it is sometimes deliberately sought in aesthetic or literary communication.

    Irony is the use of words to convey a meaning just the contrary of the
    one normally conveyed by the words. (It is a form of deliberate ambiguity in intension.)

    A pun is the use of a word simultaneously in two or more meanings.
    (It too is a form of deliberate ambiguity in intension.) The pun is commonly regarded in our time as a trivial form of humor. It was, however, held in esteem by Aristotle, Cicero, and Renaissance rhetoricians (who classified puns among four different figures of speech). It was used by Plato, the Greek dramatists, and Renaissance preachers and writers, often in a serious way.

    Metaphor is the use of a word or a phrase to evoke simultaneously
    two images, one literal and the other figurative. (It is deliberate ambi-
    guity of images.)

    The metaphor is of great value in poetry and in all imaginative writ-

    garded the metaphor as a compressed proportion, a statement of
    equality between two ratios. The full proportion may be represented

- prompt: "A dead metaphor is one which at one time evoked two images  \nbut which now fails to do so, usually because the one-time figurative meaning has completely supplanted what was once the literal meaning. In the quote, \"Your sorrows are the tribulations of your soul,\" tribulation is a dead metaphor. At one time tribulum meant threshing flail. The full proportion then was: Your sorrows are to your soul as a threshing flail is to wheat (a:b::c:d). This metaphor, first used by an early Christian writer, was so good that tribulation came to mean sorrow and lost its original meaning, threshing. Its metaphorical use has become its ordinary use. We do not recognize the  \none-time metaphor. Tribulation now evokes only one image; the sentence is, therefore, a dead metaphor.\n\nMan-of-war is a dead metaphor. Originally it had the force of the following proportion: A ship is to a sea battle as a warrior is to a land battle (a:b::c:d). Therefore, a battleship is a man of war (a is c). The figurative meaning has become the literal meaning, for man-of-war now means only a battleship. Candidate \"clothed in white\" and skyscraper are other dead metaphors that have lost their original meaning.\n\nIn the series of meanings attached to a word like spring, one can observe how new meanings, derived from the fundamental one by figurative use later became ordinary meanings having lost their figurative quality. The dictionary lists the following meanings for spring: (1) To leap, bound (2) To shoot, up, out, or forth; to issue as a plant from seed, a stream from its source, etc. (3) An issue of water from the earth (4) An elastic device that recovers its original shape when released after being distorted (5) A season when plants begin to grow (6) Time of growth and progress. (Although the dictionary lists this as an ordinary meaning of spring, to say \"Youth is the spring of life\" is still felt, at least mildly, as a metaphor.)\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."

    THE TRIVIUM

    After the preceding considerations, the reader can better understand
    the comparative scope of the three arts of the trivium: logic, grammar,
    and rhetoric, which were discussed in the preceding chapter.

    One can distinguish the powers of the mind: cognition, appetition,
    and emotion. Cognition includes the lower or sensuous cognition,
    which produces percepts, and the higher or rational cognition, which
    produces concepts. Appetition includes the lower or sense appetites,
    which seek primarily food, clothing and shelter, and the higher or ra-
    tional appetite, the will, which seeks the good, and unity, truth, and
    beauty under the aspect of good.

    The Nature and Function of Language 45

    Emotion is a pleasurable or painful tone which may accompany
    the exercise of both sensuous and rational powers. Pleasure is the
    concomitant of the healthy and normal exercise of any of our pow-
    ers. Pain is the concomitant of either the excessive or the inadequate
    or inhibited exercise of any of our powers.

    Logic is concerned only with operations of the intellect, with ra-
    tional cognition, not with volition nor with the emotions.

    Grammar gives expression to all states of mind or soul—cognitive,
    volitive, emotional—in sentences that are statements, questions,
    wishes, prayers, commands, exclamations. In this sense, grammar has a
    wider scope than logic; and so does rhetoric, which communicates all
    these to other minds.

    Rhetoric judges which one of a number of equivalent grammatical
    symbols for one idea is best for communication in the given circum-
    stance, for example, steed, horse; silver, argent. Grammar deals only
    with the sentence, with one thought; logic and rhetoric deal with ex-
    tended discourse, with relations and combinations of thoughts.

    Logic is addressed only to the intellect; rhetoric, including poetry, is
    addressed not only to the intellect but also to the imagination and the
    affections in order to communicate the pleasant, the comic, the pa-
    thetic, the sublime.

    General grammar! is concerned with the relation of words to ideas and
    to realities, whereas a special grammar, such as English or Latin or
    French or Spanish grammar, is concerned principally with the relation
    of words to words, as, for example, with the agreement of subject and
    verb in person and number or the agreement of adjective and noun in
    number, gender, and case.

    General grammar is more philosophical than the special grammars
    because it is more directly related to logic and to metaphysics or ontol-
    ogy. Consequently, it differs somewhat from the special grammars in
    point of view and in resulting classification both in the part-of-speech
    analysis and in the syntactical? analysis.

    PARTS OF SPEECH IN GENERAL GRAMMAR

    From the point of view of general grammar, the essential distinction be-
    tween words is that between categorematic words and syncategorematic
    words.

    Categorematic words are those which symbolize some form of being
    and which may accordingly be classified in the ten categories of
    being—substance and the nine accidents.3 Categorematic words are
    therefore of two great classes: (1) substantives, which primarily symbol-
    ize substance, and (2) attributives, which symbolize accidents.+ From
    this point of view, verbs and adjectives are properly classified together
    as attributives, as accidents existing in substance because action as well
    as quality or quantity must exist in substance. These distinctions are an
    outstanding illustration of the difference in point of view between gen-
    eral grammar and the special grammars.

    Syncategorematic words are those which have meaning only along
    with other words, for, taken by themselves, they cannot be classified in
    the categories. They do not symbolize being. Rather, they are mere
    grammatical cement by means of which we relate in a sentence the
    categorematic words which do symbolize being. For that reason, they
    are sometimes called form words. Syncategorematic words are of two
    classes: (1) definitives, which point out substances, and (2) connec-
    tives, which join either words or sentences or subject and predicate.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Differentiation of Categorematic and Syncategorematic Words**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, identify and classify the following words as either categorematic or syncategorematic:\n1. ''John''\n2. ''is''\n3. ''quick''\n4. ''the''\n5. ''run''\n\n**Task**:\n- For each word, explain your classification based on the text''s distinction between words that symbolize being (categorematic) and those that serve as grammatical cement (syncategorematic).\n- Provide specific examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s explanation of the ten categories of being and the role of syncategorematic words as ''form words'' that relate categorematic words in a sentence.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Parts of Speech in General Grammar**\n\nAccording to the text, substantives primarily symbolize substance, while attributives symbolize accidents. Using this framework, classify the following words as substantives or attributives:\n1. ''Tree''\n2. ''Tall''\n3. ''Book''\n4. ''Red''\n5. ''Happy''\n\n**Task**:\n- Justify your classification by referencing the text''s explanation that verbs and adjectives are grouped as attributives because they symbolize accidents existing in substance.\n- Explain how the concept of ''accidents'' in the text relates to the idea of ''qualities'' or ''actions'' in a sentence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must align with the text''s categorization of substantives and attributives, and your explanation must directly reference the text''s discussion of the ten categories of being.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Grammar and Logic**\n\nThe text states that general grammar is more philosophical because it relates to logic and metaphysics, while special grammars focus on word relations. Using this distinction, construct an argument that explains why the concept of ''substance'' in general grammar is fundamental to understanding logical structure.\n\n**Task**:\n- Define ''substance'' according to the text''s framework.\n- Explain how the classification of words into substantives and attributives reflects logical relationships in a sentence.\n- Provide an example from the text or your own knowledge to illustrate how syncategorematic words (like ''the'' or ''and'') function as ''form words'' that connect substantives and attributives.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate the text''s distinction between general and special grammar, and your example must demonstrate how logical structure is maintained through the interplay of categorematic and syncategorematic words.'

    In music the notes are categorematic symbols, while marks of time, of phrasing, of staccato or legato, etc. are syncategorematic symbols of operation. In mathematics, the numbers, figures, angles, etc. are categorematic symbols, while +, —, x, %, =, etc. are syncategorematic symbols of operation indicating how the categorematic symbols are related.

    Accordingly, in general grammar we distinguish four fundamental parts of speech: substantives, attributives, definitives, and connectives.

    We may subdivide these, however, and distinguish nine true parts of speech; and, if we add the interjection, which for reasons stated below cannot be regarded precisely as a part of speech, we list ten, as follows:
    nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, definitives, prepositions, conjunctions, the pure copula, and interjections.

    General Grammar 49

    Interjections are named with the parts of speech only because it is desirable that there be a name for every class of words. Interjections are not, however, true parts of speech for two reasons. They cannot be assimilated into the structure of a sentence and therefore have no grammatical import. They express emotion, not thought, and therefore have no logical import.

- prompt: "Substantives: Nouns and Pronouns  \nAccording to the kind of reality it refers to, a substantive symbolizes either a concrete substance or an abstraction. A concrete substance is an object as it exists in itself, whether natural or artificial. Tree, stone, and horse are examples of natural substance, and chair, glass, and clock are examples of artificial substance.  \n\nAn abstraction is an accident® conceived by the mind, for the sake of emphasis, as if it existed by itself apart from the concrete substance in which alone it can really exist; for instance, smoothness, quantity, shape, or prudence actually exist as part of substance. An abstraction is also substance regarded in its essence, for the sake of emphasis apart from its concrete existence; for instance, humanity, corporeity, womanhood, chairness, treeness actually exist as part of substance.  \n\nAbstract substantives symbolize ideas in every one of the ten categories, for example: animality, length, whiteness, similarity, motion, sensitivity, futurity, ubiquity, erectness, accouteredness. In fact, the very names of seven of the nine categories of accident are examples of abstract substantives.  \n\nThe human ability thus to distinguish, to select, to abstract one aspect of reality and to make it the object of thought has been the indispensable means whereby the limited human mind has been able to advance in the search for truth. Each of the various sciences and branches of philosophy abstracts from reality a selected aspect; for instance, mathematics deals only with quantity; physics, with motion; metaphysics, with being. The human power to abstract and to study a selected aspect of reality is the measure of intellectual progress which contrasts strikingly with the utter absence of such progress among irrational animals despite their wonderful instincts, which are often superior to the instincts of man. As human civilization advances, the proportion of abstract substantives in the language increases.8  \n\n50s The Trivium  \n\nAccording to its logical classification, a substantive symbolizes either an individual, a species, or a genus.  \n\nILLUSTRATION: Logical classification of a substantive  \n\nindividual Species Genus  \nEleanor Roosevelt man animal  \nExcalibur sword weapon  \nAtlantic ocean body of water\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."

    GRAMMATICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBSTANTIVES

    Number

    A substantive naming a species or a genus has number; that is, it
    may be either singular or plural because it may designate either one or
    more than one of the individuals that constitute the species or the
    genus. Such a substantive is either a common name or a general de-
    scription.

    Strictly speaking, a substantive naming an individual has no number
    because an individual is unique and cannot be pluralized in respect to
    that which makes it individual but only in respect to that which makes
    it a member of its species or its genus. A substantive that names an in-
    dividual is either a proper name or an empirical description.

    Gender

    A substantive may be masculine, feminine, neuter, or common.
    The nouns in modern English have natural gender; the nouns in
    French, Latin, German, and many other languages have grammatical
    gender.

    Person

    This is a characteristic much more important to pronouns than to
    nouns. It has its natural origin in conversation, for first person is the
    speaker; second person is the one spoken to; and third person, the one
    spoken of.

    A pronoun agrees in person, as well as in number and gender, with
    its antecedent, the noun to which it refers; its case, however, is deter-
    mined by its use in its own clause.

    General Grammar

    The relative pronoun simultaneously performs three functions: (1)
    It stands for a noun. (2) It connects clauses. (3) It subordinates one
    clause to another.

    Case

    Case shows the relationship of a noun or a pronoun to other words
    in the sentence. Four cases of substantives are distinguished in general
    grammar, for these are the relationships necessary in every language, al-
    though not in every sentence.

    Four Cases of Substantives

    Nominative is the case of the subject. It is the only case necessary to every sentence.
    Genitive is the case which names the possessor.

    Dative is the case which names the term to which the action proceeds.

    Accusative is the case which names the object which receives the action.

    The special grammar of a particular language may distinguish fewer or more cases than these four, the number usually depending on inflectional forms, rather than on the underlying relationships of ideas and words. Thus, modern English grammar distinguishes only three cases: nominative, genitive, and accusative. It is obvious, however, that the uses of the dative case are present in the English language as clearly as in the Latin language; moreover, the dative case and the instrumental, which is analogous to the ablative in Latin, had inflectional forms and distinctive uses in the Old English period of our language (before 1150 A.D.).

    Cases of nouns may be expressed by word order, prepositions, or case endings.

    ILLUSTRATION: Case

    Word order: John killed the snake. The snake killed John.
    Prepositions: Mother is in the garden. The decision of the umpire was applauded.
    Case endings: Father's, him, my, puero, noctis.13

    THE TEN GRAMMATICAL FUNCTIONS OF SUBSTANTIVES

    Substantives can act as subject, subjective complement, direct object of a verb or verbal, indirect object of a verb or verbal, objective complement, object of a preposition, possessive modifier, nominative absolute, nominative of direct address, or an appositive of any of these.

    ILLUSTRATION: Grammatical functions of substantives

    Cobb whacked the ball into the outfield and gave the spectators a thrill by making a home run, thereby tying the score.

    Cobb is the subject. Ball is the direct object of whacked; thrill is the direct object of gave; home run is the direct object of the gerund making; score is the direct object of the participle tying. Spectators is the indirect object of gave. Outfield is the object of the preposition into; making, a gerund, is the object of the preposition by.

    Jane, my uncle's law partner considers that man to be a scoundrel.16

    Jane is the nominative of direct address. Uncie's is a possessive modifier of partner. Scoundrel is
    a subjective complement, or predicate noun, for it completes the copula'? to be and refers to the
    subject man; it agrees in case with man, which is here accusative because it is the subject of an in-
    finitive'8 in indirect discourse.12

    The class elected John president.

    President is an objective complement, for it completes the verb efected and refers to John, the
    direct object of elected. (Elected is one of a group of words including choose, name, painted
    which take two accusatives to complete their meaning.) The sentence is really a condensed combi-
    nation of two sentences: The class elected John. John is president. In the second of these two sen-
    tences, president is a subjective complement, for it completes the copula fs and refers to the sub-
    ject John, its relation to Jonn is the same as in the combined statement above, but there it is called
    an objective complement because it refers to the object of the verb.

    The audience insistently applauding, Lawrence Tibbett, noted baritone, graciously consented to sing
    the song "Edward" again.

    Audience is the nominative absolute, for the phrase of which it is a part has no grammatical relation
    to any word in the rest of the sentence. In Latin, the absolute construction is expressed by the ab-
    lative case; in English, by the nominative. Song is the direct object of the infinitive to sing. Baritone
    is in apposition with the subject Lawrence Tibbett. "Edwara" is in apposition with the direct object
    song.

    Attributives
    Attributives are words which express the accidents that exist in sub-
    stance. Primary attributives include verbs, verbals, and adjectives.

    VERBS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS

    There are four functions of a verb. A verb expresses an attribute along
    with the notion of time. A verb indicates tense. A verb expresses mode
    or mood. A verb asserts.

- prompt: |-
    Expressing an attribute along with the notion of time is the essential function of a verb and constitutes its definition. Aristotle, in the Organon, defines a verb as that which, in addition to its proper meaning, carries with it the notion of time. It is by this characteristic of carrying with it the notion of time or change that he distinguishes it from the adjective and from every other part of speech.

    To understand this definition, it is necessary to understand what is meant by time. Time is the measure of change. The year measures a change, the movement of the earth around the sun. The day measures a change, the movement of the earth turning on its axis. The hour measures an artificial movement such as that of sand from the upper to the lower half of an hourglass or of the minute hand around a clock.

    Since action is change, and change involves time, a verb, which expresses action, necessarily involves time. The particular action expressed varies from verb to verb, as in jump, speak, sing, swim. Each of these has its own proper meaning, but since change is common to all of them, every verb carries with it the notion of time. The verb exist, when predicated of contingent beings, involves having been moved from potency to actuality and continuance in that actuality. Therefore it involves duration or time.

    Thus, time is a concomitant of the meaning of verbs, not their principal meaning. When we wish to make time the principal meaning, we do so by means of abstract nouns like year, day, hour or by means of adverbs like yearly, daily, hourly, instantly, gradually.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Verb Definition and Time**\n\nGiven the text''s definition of a verb as ''that which, in addition to its proper meaning, carries with it the notion of time,'' explain how the verb ''swim'' fits this definition.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the proper meaning of the verb ''swim.''\n- **Step 2**: Relate this meaning to the concept of change, which is tied to time.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the verb ''swim'' must involve the notion of time, based on Aristotle''s distinction between verbs and other parts of speech.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly link the verb''s action to the concept of change and time, using the text''s definitions as the basis for your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Time as a Measure of Change**\n\nThe text defines time as ''the measure of change,'' using examples such as the year, day, and hour. Consider the example of a clock''s minute hand moving from 12 to 1.\n- **Part A**: Explain how this movement measures change and relates to the definition of time given in the text.\n- **Part B**: Compare the measure of time by the movement of the earth around the sun (a year) with the movement of the earth''s axis (a day). How do these examples illustrate the text''s claim that time is a measure of change?\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implication of time being a ''concomitant of the meaning of verbs'' on the use of adverbs like ''instantly'' or ''gradually'' in modifying verbs.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between time, change, and verbs, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Verbs and Abstract Nouns**\n\nThe text states that abstract nouns like ''year'' and adverbs like ''yearly'' can make time the principal meaning of a verb. Consider the phrase ''the year is a time of change.''\n- **Part A**: Explain how the abstract noun ''year'' transforms the verb ''is'' into a statement that involves time as its principal meaning.\n- **Part B**: Construct a sentence using the adverb ''instantly'' that illustrates how it makes the notion of time the principal meaning of a verb.\n- **Part C**: Refute the claim that ''the verb ''be'' has no notion of time'' by providing an example from the text or reasoning based on the text''s definitions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answers must integrate the text''s discussion of verbs, time, and the use of abstract nouns and adverbs to convey time.'

- prompt: |-
    Tense is the relation between the time of the act spoken of and the time of speaking of it. If I speak of an action while it occurs, I use present tense (The bird flies); if after it occurs, past tense (The bird flew); if before it occurs, future tense (The bird will fly). In addition to these, there are the present perfect, past perfect, and future perfect tenses. In English grammar there are two forms for every tense: the simple (I think) and the progressive (I am thinking). In the present and past tenses there is a third form, the emphatic (I do think, I did think).

    We must be careful not to confuse tense with time. Time is essential to the verb. Tense is not essential. It is a mere accidental variation. Aristotle likens the tenses of verbs to the cases of nouns.

    In the statement of a general truth there is, strictly speaking, no tense at all. Examples are: Fire burns. Acids contain hydrogen. Man acquires knowledge by reasoning. Good ought to be done. Evil ought to be avoided. A triangle has three sides. Fishes live in water. Planets move around the sun.

    54 = The Trivium

    Such general statements express a relation which, so far as our observation goes, does not cease to be nor come to be; it is continuous. Therefore, the relation between the time of the act spoken of and the time of speaking of it never varies. The use of the past or future tense would violate the truth of such general statements. Nor can one truly say that the present tense is used, for that has a temporal signification not here intended. Although the grammatical form of the present tense is used, the statements of general truths are really tenseless.

    Mode or mood asserts the manner in which the subject and predicate20 are related as certain, possible, conditional, etc.

    1 Indicative mood asserts the relation as a matter of fact, with certainty. Examples are: The car raced past. He wished me success.

    2 Potential mood asserts the relation as possible, or contingent. Examples are: A rose may be white. This acorn may become an oak tree. The brakes might have been defective.

    3 Interrogative mood requests information, and it requires a response in words. For example: Who spoke? English idiom requires that either the progressive or the emphatic form be used in asking questions about matters of fact in the present or past tense active, unless the question has as its subject an interrogative pronoun, and then the simple form may be used. Examples are: Is she coming? Where did you find that? Who thinks so? The following are not idiomatic: Comes she? Where found you that?

    4 Volitive mood seeks the gratification of volitions, and it requires a response, usually in deeds. It has direct reference to the future only. So true is this that the future indicative often has the force of command, as in the Decalogue: Thou shalt not steal.

    The tone of the volitive may be imperative or optative. Imperative relates to a command, issued usually to inferiors.24 For example: John, close the door. Optative or hortatory2? relates to a wish, expressed usually to equals or to superiors. Examples are: May you be successful. Would that I had the means to help them!

    Here again, in distinguishing the moods of verbs, we see a difference in the points of view of general grammar and the special grammars. The special grammars, which are principally concerned with the relations of words to words, distinguish (in English, Latin, etc.) three moods marked by a difference in grammatical form: (1) the indicative mood, which expresses the relation as a matter of fact, whether in statement or question; (2) the subjunctive mood, which expresses the potential, the subjunctive, and the optative relations, and sometimes the interrogative, as in asking permissions; (3) the imperative mood, which expresses a command.

- prompt: |-
    It is reasonable in English grammar, or in Latin or French or Span-
    ish grammar, not to distinguish between the interrogative and the in-
    dicative moods but to treat them as one, because the same grammatical
    forms of the verb are ordinarily used for both question and answer. In
    general grammar, however, it is reasonable and even necessary to dis-
    tinguish between these two moods because from the point of view of
    logic, to which general grammar is intimately related, these two moods
    differ essentially: the indicative mood expresses a statement which must
    either be true or false; the interrogative mood expresses a question
    which is incapable of being either true or false.

    Only the indicative and the potential moods are capable of express-
    ing either truth or falsity; the interrogative and the volitive moods are
    not. The potential mood asserts not a fact but a possibility, or contin-
    gency; therefore, its truth or falsity depends on conformity not to fact,
    as that of the indicative mood does, but to possibility, or contingency.
    For example, "It may rain tomorrow" is a true assertion of a possibility.
    Its truth is not dependent on whether it actually does or does not rain
    the day after the statement is made.

    A verb asserts. This function is necessary to form a sentence, which
    must express a complete thought.

    Classes of Verbs: Transitive and Intransitive

    The transitive verb expresses action that begins in the subject (agent)
    and "goes across" (trans + ire) to the object (receiver). The object may
    be the same as the subject, for example: He cut himself. But it need
    not be the same, for example: He cut the cake. He rowed the boat. A
    transitive verb always requires a complement, that is, a word which
    completes the meaning of the predicate. Every transitive verb requires
    at least one complement, the direct object; some transitive verbs, like
    give, require both a direct and an indirect object; others, like elect,
    require two accusatives to complete their meaning, one the direct ob-
    ject, the other the objective complement.

    The intransitive verb expresses action that begins and ends in the
    agent, the subject; consequently, the subject must be both agent and

    patient, for example: The bird flies. There are two classes of intransitive
    verbs: (1) Some express action complete in itself, for example, blooms,
    withers; (2) Some require a complement, a word to complete the mean-
    ing of the predicate, for example, becomes.?+ An intransitive verb which
    requires a complement is a copulative verb.2°

    COPULA: A SPECIAL CASE

    A copula is a word that links an attributive or a substantive to the sub-
    ject. Such an attributive (adjective or verbal) or substantive is vari-
    ously named by grammarians the predicate adjective or predicate
    noun, the predicate complement, the attribute complement, the sub-
    jective complement (meaning that it completes the predicate and
    modifies the subject).

    The pure copula is is not a verb because it does not express an at-
    tribute along with the notion of time. It is a syncategorematic word of
    operation, and it will be discussed with that category of words.

    The intransitive verb is, which is a categorematic word and a syn-
    onym for the verb exists but which is not a copulative verb, must be dis-
    tinguished from the copula is. Like other verbs, the verb is is capable of
    having an adverbial modiher, which it could not have unless the verb
    is expressed an attribute, for an adverb is an attribute of an attribute, as
    will be explained more fully.

    ILLUSTRATION: Intransitive verb to be

    John is. (John exists.)
    John is in the garden. (John exists in the garden.)

    A copulative verb is one which performs simultaneously the func-
    tions of a copula and of a verb. There are two classes of copulative verbs:
    the true copula and the pseudocopula.

    The true copula, for instance, becomes, is a true copula and a true
    verb. For example: The green leaves become yellow. (1) Becomes is a
    true verb because it expresses an attribute along with the notion of time.
    It involves change. In fact, it expresses change itself. (2) Becomes is a
    true copula because it links an attributive or a substantive to the sub-
    ject; it links the before and the after of change.

    The pseudocopula is a true verb and expresses sense-perception, for
    example: looks, sounds, tastes, smells, feels. "The apple tastes sour."

    General Grammar

    Here tastes acts as a copula in linking sour to apple. The sentence
    represents good English idiom, even though it is illogical and literally
    false, for the apple cannot taste at all. In its primary meaning, the
    pseudocopula is a transitive verb. The sentence is a grammatical con-
    densation of two sentences: I taste the apple. The apple is sour. Here
    taste is a transitive verb.

    yulives: Verbals
    There are three classes of verbals: the infinitive, the participle, the
    gerund. Like the verb, the verbal: (1) expresses an attribute along with
    the notion of time; (2) indicates tense.

    Unlike the verb, the verbal: (1) does not assert; (2) does not express
    mood. Because the verbal does not assert, it is a frequent occasion of
    the fragmentary sentence error.27

    The infinitive is an abstract substantive and can therefore perform all
    the grammatical functions of a substantive, for example: To think is to
    exercise the mind.28

    The gerund is a verbal which, like the infinitive, may perform all the
    functions of a substantive. The gerund has the same form as the par-
    ticiple,29 but it differs in function, for example: Thinking is exercising
    the mind.

    The participle is a verbal functioning grammatically as an adjective,
    for it modifies a substantive, for example: John, thinking clearly, solved
    the problem.

    yutives; Adjectives

    The essential difference between the adjective and the verb or verbal is
    that the verb or verbal expresses an attribute of substance along with the
    notion of time and hence involves change, whereas the adjective ex-
    presses an attribute simply.

    adary Attributives: Adverbs

    Secondary attributives function as attributes of attributes—namely, ad-
    verbs, for example: The man walks swiftly. Walking is an action exist-
    ing in the man; hence it is an attribute of substance. Swiftness is a
    quality existing in the walking; hence swiftly expresses an attribute of an
    attribute of a substance. The reality spoken of is a swiftly walking man.

    3-3 Categorematic Parts of Speech

    SYNCATEGOREMATIC PARTS OF SPEECH

    Syncategorematic parts of speech refer to words which are only significant with other words. Definitives and connectives are syncategorematic parts of speech.

    Definitives

    A definitive is a word which, when associated to a common name, is capable of singling out an individual or a group of individuals from the whole class designated by the common name. This is the essential function of the definitive. The definitive joined to a common name is called an empirical description. Definitives include articles and pronomials.
    James Harris?9 notes that a definitive may designate individuals such as:

    Known: the man

    Definite: a certain man

    Present and near: this man

    Present and distant: that man

    A definite multitude: a thousand men

    An indefinite multitude: many men, some men

    The ones of a multitude taken with distinction: each man

    The ones of a multitude taken in order: the first man, the second

    THE ARTICLE
    The article never stands alone. It may be either indefinite or definite.
    An indefinite article singles out an individual but does not designate which one; it also signifies first acquaintance. For example: I saw a tall, red-haired, hook-nosed man downtown today.

    The repetition of the article is often an aid to clarity. For example,
    the sentence, "He entertained a poet and philosopher," is unclear. Is
    the same person both a poet and philosopher or are there two people?
    General Grammar 59

    The sentence "He entertained a poet and a philosopher" is unambiguous in showing that two people were entertained.

    The definite article singles out a particular individual. It may also
    signify preestablished acquaintance or eminence.

    ILLUSTRATION: Use of the definitive article

    preestablished acquaintance: There goes the tall, red-haired, hook-nosed man | saw downtown
    yesterday.

    Eminence: the poet: the philosopher; the Mrs. Jamieson

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Grammar and Logic**\n\nIn the text, the definitive is defined as a word that singles out an individual or group when combined with a common name. Using this definition, analyze the sentence: ''The man who is tall and red-haired is the one who saw downtown yesterday.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the definitive in the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the definitive functions to distinguish this man from others.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this usage to the example given in the text about ''the tall, red-haired, hook-nosed man.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate understanding of the role of definitives in grammar and logical distinction. You must explicitly reference the text''s definition of definitives and provide a logical comparison to the given example.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Syncategorematic Parts of Speech**\n\nThe text classifies articles and pronomials as syncategorematic parts of speech. Analyze the sentence: ''He entertained a poet and a philosopher.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the syncategorematic parts of speech in the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the addition of the second article ''a'' clarifies the meaning of the sentence, referencing the text''s discussion on the role of articles in distinguishing between singular and plural references.\n- **Part C**: Construct a similar sentence using a different syncategorematic part of speech (e.g., a pronomial) and explain how it functions in the sentence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanation of syncategorematic parts of speech and demonstrate an understanding of how they contribute to clarity and logical meaning.'

''This poet is the one who wrote the book.''\n3. ''He wrote the book.''\n- **Part A**: For each statement, identify whether the definitive or pronomial is used and explain its function.\n- **Part B**: Compare the definitives ''the'' and ''this'' in terms of their reference to preestablished acquaintance or eminence, as discussed in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that uses both a definitive and a pronomial, and explain how they work together to convey meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinctions between definitives and pronomials as outlined in the text, and your logical reasoning must be based solely on the definitions provided.'

- prompt: "The pronomial's primary function is to act as a definitive, that is, to limit  \na common name. Sometimes, however, it stands alone and thereby per-  \nforms the functions of a pronoun. For example, in the phrase \"this pen-  \ncil,\" this is a definitive. In the sentence \"This is a pencil,\" this is a  \npronoun.\n\nPronomials used as definitives may be employed to express antithe-  \nsis, for example: This hat I like, but that one I dislike.\n\nA modifier of a substantive, whether it be a word, a phrase, or a  \nclause, is either definitive or attributive (adjectival) in function. The de-  \nfinitive modifier is essentially associated to the subject, whereas the at-  \ntributive modifier is essentially a predicate.\n\nFor example, in the phrase \"this apple,\" this is a definitive because  \nthis is associated to the subject; this does not predicate something about  \nthe subject. In the phrase \"red apple,\" red is attributive because red  \ncould be predicated of the apple.\n\nThis essential and profound difference in function between the de-  \nfinitive and the adjective requires that they be sharply distinguished in  \ngeneral grammar. So great is the difference between them that the ad-  \njective is a categorematic word and the definitive is syncategorematic.\n\nHere again we see that the point of view of general grammar differs  \nradically from that of the special grammars. The latter, such as Latin,  \nGerman, or French grammar, treat the definitive as an adjective since  \nit has inflectional endings like those of the adjective and must likewise  \nagree in number, gender, and case with the noun it modifies. The de-  \nfinitive is not one of the eight parts of speech distinguished in the spe-  \ncial grammars, but in them it is classified as an adjective.\n\nRules for Punctuating the Definitive and the Attributive Modifier™'\n\nSince its function is to point out, the definitive modifier is restrictive,32 and it is never separated  \nby commas from the substantive it modifies, for example: The man who is standing nearest the  \nwindow is a labor Jeader.  \n\nSince its function is to describe, the attributive modifier is nonrestrictive, and if it is a clause, it\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Differentiating Definitive and Attributive Modifiers**\n\nClassify each of the following phrases as containing a definitive modifier or an attributive modifier, and explain your reasoning based on their functional roles:\n1. "The book on the table"\n2. "A red car"\n3. "The man who is wearing a blue shirt"\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must directly reference the text''s explanation of definitive and attributive modifiers. For example, in "The book on the table," the word "the" is a definitive modifier because it points to a specific book and is associated with the subject, not describing it.\n\n**Answer**:\n1. Definitive modifier: "the" in "The book on the table" points to a specific book and is associated with the subject, not describing it.\n2. Attributive modifier: "red" in "A red car" describes the car and could be predicated about it.\n3. Definitive modifier: "The man" in "The man who is wearing a blue shirt" points to a specific man and is associated with the subject.\n\n**Note**: Ensure that your explanation clearly differentiates between the two functions as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing the Role of Definitive Modifiers in Grammar**\n\nExplain the grammatical distinction between the following two sentences, focusing on the function of the definitive modifier in each:\n1. "This is the book I found on the table."\n2. "This is a book I found on the table."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly distinguish between the two based on the text''s explanation that definitive modifiers are syncategorematic and serve to point out, while attributive modifiers are categorematic and describe. For example, in the first sentence, "the" is a definitive modifier because it points to a specific book, whereas in the second sentence, "a" is an attributive modifier because it describes the book.\n\n**Answer**:\nIn the first sentence, "the" is a definitive modifier that points to a specific book, making the sentence more precise. In the second sentence, "a" is an attributive modifier that describes the book as indefinite, indicating it is not specifically identified.\n\n**Note**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of the functional difference between definitive and attributive modifiers.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Applying Punctuation Rules to Definitive and Attributive Modifiers**\n\nApply the punctuation rules for definitive and attributive modifiers as described in the text to the following sentences. For each sentence, indicate whether a comma should be used and explain your reasoning based on the text''s explanation of restrictive vs. nonrestrictive modifiers:\n1. "The woman who is standing near the door is the teacher."\n2. "The woman, who is standing near the door, is the teacher."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s explanation that definitive modifiers are restrictive and never separated by commas, while attributive modifiers (if clauses) are nonrestrictive and may be separated by commas. For example, in the first sentence, "who is standing near the door" is a definitive modifier because it points to a specific woman and is not set off by a comma.\n\n**Answer**:\n1. No comma: "who is standing near the door" is a definitive modifier, which is restrictive and not set off by a comma.\n2. Comma: "who is standing near the door" is an attributive modifier (a clause) that is nonrestrictive and is set off by commas.\n\n**Note**: Ensure that your explanation clearly differentiates between restrictive and nonrestrictive modifiers as explained in the text.'

    A definitive modifier should be separated by commas from the substantive it modifies, for example: John Lewis, who is standing nearest the window, is a labor leader.

    3-4 Punctuating the Definitive and Attributive Modifier

    It is to be noted that the distinction between a definitive and an at-
    tributive modifier is functional. If a modifier describes in order to point
    out, it is a definitive, as in the first example above. If the individual is
    already designated by a proper name, the modifier, no longer needed
    to point out the individual, becomes attributive—descriptive, nonre-
    strictive, merely additive, as in the second example above.

    It is important to distinguish between functional and part-of-speech
    analyses. For instance, a definitive modifier need not contain a single
    definitive. For example: The girl with red hair is my cousin. With red
    hair is a definitive modifier of girl, but not a single word in this phrase
    is a definitive.

    Connectives
    Connectives are syncategorematic parts of speech which associate
    words to other words. Connectives include prepositions, conjunctions,
    and the pure copula. Connectives are words analogous to cement, for
    they hold the categorematic parts of speech together in the unity of
    thought expressed in the sentence.

    PREPOSITIONS
    Prepositions join words. A preposition unites substantives, which do not
    naturally coalesce. In nature, accidents exist in substance, and in
    grammar, attributives and substantives naturally coalesce, for example,
    red rose. But substances do not unite with one another in nature,33 nor
    do substances coalesce in grammar, hence the need of prepositions, the
    verbal cement for uniting substantives, for example, "the curtain on the
    window." On joins curtain and window.

    If you add five apples, three tables, four chairs, and two dogs, what
    is the sum? The answer is five apples, three tables, four chairs, and two
    dogs. It is true that there are fourteen objects, or things, or substances,

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Modifier Types**\n\nIdentify the type of modifier (definitive or attributive) in the sentence: "John Lewis, who is standing nearest the window, is a labor leader."\n- **Step 1**: Determine whether the modifier "who is standing nearest the window" is definitive or attributive.\n- **Step 2**: Justify your conclusion based on the text''s explanation that definitive modifiers point out the individual, while attributive modifiers are descriptive and non-restrictive.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this with the example given in the text: "The girl with red hair is my cousin." Explain why "with red hair" is a definitive modifier, even though it doesn''t contain a single definitive word.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly classify the modifier type and provide a logical explanation based on the text''s definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Prepositions**\n\nExplain the role of prepositions in the sentence: "the curtain on the window."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the preposition and the words it connects.\n- **Step 2**: Use the text''s explanation that prepositions act as "verbal cement" to unite substantives.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this function with the example given in the text: "red rose." Explain why prepositions are necessary in the sentence "the curtain on the window" but not in "red rose."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define the function of prepositions and provide a logical comparison based on the text''s explanation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Connectives**\n\nConstruct a sentence using the connective "and" that demonstrates its function as a syncategorematic part of speech.\n- **Step 1**: Write a sentence that includes the word "and" and at least two categorematic words.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how "and" functions as a connective, similar to "cement," by joining the categorematic words into a unified thought.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this with the example given in the text: "the curtain on the window." Explain why "and" is necessary in your sentence but not in that example.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of connectives and their role in unifying thoughts, as described in the text.'

    and under this most general aspect the sum may be stated as fourteen;
    but to so lump objects together is to ignore their specific nature. One
    can, however, say, Two dogs, chasing each other, knocked five apples
    off three tables under four chairs. The prepositions express a relation
    between these substances without robbing them of their specific nature.

    Prepositions show the precise relation between substances. For ex-
    ample: The dog ran around the table, crept under the table, jumped
    over the table, lay beside the table, stood near the table.

    The repetition of the preposition is often a means to secure clarity. Ex-
    amples are (1) The invasion of the Angles and the Saxons (one invasion),
    (2) The invasion of the Danes and of the Normans (two invasions).

    Relationships, especially those of place, may undergo transfer to in-
    tellectual relationships. Examples are: to come under authority; to rule
    over minds; to act through jealousy. Such relationships may also enter
    into compounds— overlook as compared to look over; understand as
    compared to stand under. Prepositions are often used to express the
    genitive (of the children) and dative (to the children) relationships of
    nouns.

    Prepositions may lose the connective function and become adverbs;
    then, of course, they become categorematic words. Adverbs derived
    from prepositions convey a meaning more vague, less specific, than the
    corresponding prepositional phrase.

    ILLUSTRATION: Same word as preposition and adverb

    He walked around the house. He walked around.
    They gazed up the shaft. They gazed up.

    CONJUNCTIONS
    Conjunctions join sentences. The sentences joined may be either ex-
    plicit or implicit.

    ILLUSTRATION: Conjunctions Joining sentences

    Explicit: The guests arrived, and dinner was served.
    Implicit: The army and navy prepared for war.

    Pure conjunctions are coordinating. They join independent clauses or sentences. They may conjoin or disjoin. For instance, and conjoins; that is, and joins both sentences and meaning. Conjunctions like but, or, either... or, neither . . . nor disjoin; that is, they join sentences but not meaning.

    Rule for punctuation of coordinating clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction

    Unless the coordinate clauses joined are very short, use a comma before the coordinating conjunc-
    tion.

    3-5 Punctuating Coordinating Clauses

    Conjunctive adverbs may be coordinating. These conjoin independ-
    ent clauses or sentences. Examples include hence, consequently, there-
    fore, then, nevertheless. Conjunctive adverbs may be subordinating.
    These subjoin a dependent clause to an independent clause, forming
    a complex sentence. Examples include while, where, when, although,
    unless, if.

    Rules for punctuation between clauses with a conjunctive adverb

    Use a semicolon or a period between clauses or sentences conjoined by a conjunctive adverb, for
    example: it rained; therefore, we postponed the picnic. The violation of this rule results in the very
    serious error of the run-on sentence or comma splice, two sentences punctuated as if they were
    one.

    Use either a comma or no punctuation where a dependent clause is subjoined to an independent
    clause by an adverbial conjunction, for example: Because it rained, we postponed the picnic. The vi-
    olation of this rule results in the very serious error of the sentence fragment or half-sentence, punc-
    tuated as if it were a complete sentence.

    The relation between a subject and a predicate, both of which are categorical. It is to be noted that in general grammar, as in logic, the pure copula is neither the predicate nor a part of the predicate, but is completely distinct from the predicate. The predicate itself is equivalent in the broad sense to a subjective complement which completes the pure copula.

    Every simple declarative sentence is made up of subject, pure copula, and predicate. The pure copula and the subjective complement, or predicate, are either explicit or implicit.

    If the sentence contains an explicit copula, it will, of course, also contain an explicit subjective complement, which may be either an adjective, a verbal, or a noun. Examples are: The grass is green. The rose is blooming. The horse is an animal.

    If the sentence contains the simple verb form, the copula and the subjective complement are implicit in the verb and may be made explicit in English by changing the simple verb form to the progressive form. If the verb has modifiers, or if it is either a transitive or a copulative verb, the subjective complement is a construct of which the modifiers and the direct object or other complements form parts.

    ILLUSTRATION: Simple verb form to progressive verb form

    The sun shines, The sun is shining.

    The green leaves become yellow. The green leaves are becoming yellow.

    The wind bends the trees. The wind is bending the trees.

    The girl swam gracefully in the lake. The girl was swimming gracefully in the lake.
    He gives her a book. He is giving her a book.

    "The wind bends the trees" illustrates a construct.44 Bending the trees is a construct because it is an attributive joined by the pure copula is to wind. The reality spoken of is a tree-bending wind.

    In the progressive verb form, the pure copula links the attributive (a participle, which is a verbal) to the subject. Consequently, it makes clear and explicit the precise nature and functions of both the pure copula and the verb (or verbal). In the simple verb form, these functions are not so clear.

    3-7. Conversion of Simple Form to Progressive Form

    The progressive form makes clear that the pure copula is, undergoing inflection, performs three functions important in general grammar:
    (1) it asserts; (2) it expresses mood; (3) it indicates tense.

    The verb, which in the progressive form is reduced to a verbal, a participle, performs its one, genuine, and essential function, which is to express an attribute along with the notion of time; flying involves change and hence involves time.

    The bird's flying requires time, but tense is inconsequential to the act; tense indicates merely that the speaker chooses to make the remark either during, after, or before the act. Hence tense is not an essential characteristic of a verb.

    The pure copula is is strictly syncategorematic; the only reality symbolized here is the flying bird. On the other hand, there is a different meaning in the following: The flying bird is. The flying bird was. In these two sentences is and was are verbs, meaning exists and existed; they are not copulas at all. The second sentence might imply that the bird was shot; in any case, it states that the bird has ceased to be.

    Any simple sentence or complex sentence may be divided into the com-
    plete subject and the complete predicate. A compound sentence can be
    divided into simple sentences.

    In the study of logic, the important analysis of a simple declarative
    sentence is that which divides it into complete subject, pure copula,
    and complete predicate, as explained above.

    A less important but more detailed syntactical analysis is that which
    divides a sentence into a maximum of five functional units as follows:

    1. Simple subject.

    2. Simple predicate, including the complement or complements,
    if present. There are four kinds of complements: the subjective, the ob-
    jective, the direct object, the indirect object.

    3. A clause. This is a group of words which contains a subject and
    a predicate and which functions as either a substantive, an attributive,
    or a definitive.

    4. A modifier of a modifier.

    5. Connectives to join these parts or to join simple sentences so as
    to form a compound sentence.

    Another type of syntactical analysis is one which shows that each
    functional unit must be classified materially as either:

    1. A word.

    2. A phrase. This is a group of words which does not contain a sub-
    ject and a predicate, which functions as either a substantive, an attribu-
    tive, or a definitive, and which can be classified as either a prepositional
    or a verbal phrase. For example, on that day and into the house are prepo-
    sitional phrases. To sing, to make excuses are infinitive phrases. In the sen-
    tence, "Making excuses is the weakling's first thought," making excuses is
    a gerund phrase. In the sentence, "John stood before his employer, mak-
    ing excuses," making excuses is a participial phrase.

    3. A clause. This is a group of words which does contain a subject
    and a predicate and which functions as either a substantive, an attribu-
    tive, or a definitive.

    The difference between syntactical analysis and the analysis required
    for the study of logic can be illustrated through an analogy. Function-
    ally, a building may be a hotel, a church, a school, a home, a factory, a
    jail, a garage, a barn. Materially, it may be of brick, stone, or wood.

    The fundamental function of grammar is to establish laws for relating
    symbols so as to express thought. A sentence expresses a thought, a re-
    lation of ideas, in a declaration, a question, a command, a wish, a
    prayer, or an exclamation. Categorematic symbols are what are related;
    syncategorematic symbols are the means for relating them; the relation
    itself is the sentence.

    The rules for relating symbols govern three grammatical operations:
    substituting equivalent symbols, combining symbols, and separating
    symbols.

    Rules for Substituting Equivalent Symbols
    EXPANSION
    1 Every proper name is convertible into an empirical description,
    for example: Benjamin Franklin = the man who discovered that light-
    ning is electricity = the inventor of the lightning rod = the diplomatic
    representative of the Continental Congress to France during the Revo-
    lutionary War.

    2 Every common name is convertible into a general description,
    for example: cat = a small, furry, sharp-clawed, whiskered animal that
    mews.

    3 A word can be expanded into a phrase, a group of words, for
    example: horseshoe = a shoe for a horse; bookseller = a seller of books.
    Not every compound word, however, can be thus expanded without a
    change of meaning. Consider: wallflower, moonshine, streetwalker,
    goldenrod, sheepskin, greenhorn, greenback.
    General Grammar 67

    4 A phrase can be expanded into a sentence or a group of sen-
    tences, for example: this clock = This object is a clock. Cloudy sky =
    Sky is cloudy. The cheerful, wounded soldier = The soldier is cheer-
    ful. The soldier is wounded. Compare in meaning a large hot dog; a
    large, hot dog; a juicy hot dog; an angry, hot dog.

    CONTRACTION

    1 Theoretically, every empirical description is convertible into a
    proper name. Actually we have not invented proper names for every ex-
    istent object.

    2 Theoretically, every general description is convertible into a
    common name, for example: a rushing, roaring, violent stream = torrent; walked with long and measured steps = strode; walked slowly and
    aimlessly = sauntered.

    3 A sentence may be contracted into a phrase, for example: The
    man has a red beard = the man with a red beard = the red-bearded
    man.

    4 A phrase may be contracted into a word, for example: man who
    sells = salesman; light of day = daylight; herder of sheep = shepherd.
    Contraction of some phrases creates a change in both the logical and
    the psychological dimensions, for example: man fearing God, God-
    fearing man; man of God, godly man.

    Contraction and expansion are devices determining style and its ef-
    fects. Contraction should characterize language addressed to adults; ex-
    pansion, that addressed to children.

    Rules for Combining Symbols
    There are five means of combining symbols: form words, inflections,
    word order, stress, intonation.

    1 Form words are syncategorematic words of operation: the pure
    copula, verbal auxiliaries,3> conjunctions, prepositions, definitives.
    Form words are the most important means of relating words in a sen-
    tence. They are indispensable to every language.

    2  Inflections have the same grammatical functions as form words.
    For example, puero expresses the dative relation by means of an
    inflectional ending; to the boy expresses the dative relation by means of
    form words.

    3 Word order is very important in a comparatively uninflected lan-
    guage like English or Chinese. Probably the reliance of English on
    word order has given rise to some of its illogical idioms, such as the so-
    called retained object.36

    The following sentence illustrates active voice: She gave me a pen-
    cil. (Pencil is the direct object.) In true passive voice the direct object of
    the action is the subject. For example: A pencil was given to me by her.
    (Pencil is the subject.)

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Contraction and Expansion in Language**\n\nCompare and contrast the contraction and expansion of the phrase "man who fears God" as presented in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two different contracted forms of the phrase (e.g., "God-fearing man" and "godly man").\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the contraction affects the logical and psychological dimensions of the phrase, referencing the text''s explanation of contraction''s effect on meaning.\n- **Step 3**: Expand the phrase "God-fearing man" back to its original form, and explain how the expansion reveals the original meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include at least two distinct contracted forms and demonstrate an understanding of how contraction and expansion alter meaning.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Grammatical Rules in Sentence Construction**\n\nUsing the rules for combining symbols provided in the text, analyze the following sentences: \n1. "The boy is running."\n2. "Running is the boy."\n\n- **Part A**: Identify which of the five means of combining symbols (form words, inflections, word order, stress, intonation) is primarily responsible for the difference between the two sentences.\n- **Part B**: Explain how changing the word order affects the grammatical structure and meaning of the sentence, referencing the text''s discussion of word order in uninflected languages like English.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this difference for communication, based on the text''s assertion that contraction and expansion determine the style of language addressed to adults versus children.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the five means of combining symbols and demonstrate an understanding of how word order influences meaning.

    "I was given a pencil by her" illustrates pseudopassive voice. Pencil is a retained object. Reliance on word order probably occasioned the development in English of the pseudopassive voice with the so-called retained object. True passive voice, with the word order of pseudopassive voice is illustrated by the following sentence, "Jo me was given a pencil by her." Here pencil appears in its true function as the subject, not as object, retained or otherwise, and I becomes me to express precisely its true function as the indirect object. Only the true passive voice, expressed in normal word order in the second sentence above and in abnormal word order in the fourth sentence, can be translated into a precise, logical language, such as Latin or French. Although it is illogical, the pseudopassive voice, like the pseudocopula, is correct, idiomatic English; it has been in use at least since the thirteenth century.

    4 Stress, the relative force with which a sound is uttered, is a way of expressing the relations of words. It is of importance chiefly in spoken language. The following sentences require interpretation through the use of stress.

    That that is is not that that is not.
    He was my friend.
    A tall dark man with a mustache who is he stole my purse.

    Compare the effect of stress within words by accenting each of the following on the first and then on the second syllable: record, object, converse, project, compact, august, entrance.

    5 Intonation, the controlled use of pitch, is another way of expressing the relations of words. It is of importance chiefly in spoken language. The following sentences require interpretation through intonation.

    He's a fine fellow.
    Oh she is dead.

    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
    And Brutus is an honorable man.

    —Julius Caesar 3.2.86—-87

    Macbeth. . . . If we should fail?
    Lady Macbeth. We fail!
    But screw your courage to the sticking place
    And we'll not fail.
    — Macbeth |.7.58-61

Then, explain why the sentence "Jo me was given a pencil by her" is considered true passive voice with the subject "Jo" performing the action.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly distinguish between pseudopassive and true passive voice, emphasizing the role of the retained object and the function of the subject in each. You must also reference the text''s claim that only true passive voice can be accurately translated into precise languages like Latin or French.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Stress Patterns in Words**\n\nExplain how the stress pattern of a word affects its meaning and interpretation, using the examples provided in the text. For each of the following words, describe how stressing the first syllable versus the second syllable changes the meaning: record, object, converse, project, compact, august, entrance.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include a clear comparison of the meanings and interpretations for each word, demonstrating an understanding of how stress functions in spoken language as described in the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Interpretation of Intonation in Sentences**\n\nThe text provides several examples of sentences that require interpretation through intonation.

    No language can dispense with form words. No language can rely exclusively on word order, stress, and intonation. English relies chiefly on word order and form words, and so does Chinese; hence English and Chinese are structurally, or morphologically, similar. Latin relies mainly on inflection. English is related to Latin genealogically because many English words are derived from Latin. Likewise, many English words are derived from Germanic, and English is therefore related to German genealogically. It is also related to German morphologically because both languages employ form words extensively. English, German, Latin, Greek, and a number of other languages are all derived from the parent Indo-European language.

    Oral Punctuation

    Marks of punctuation do for written language what phrasing, stress, and some forms of intonation, such as raising the voice for a question, do for spoken language.

    That oral punctuation does for reading what punctuation marks do for writing becomes evident if one tries to read pages unpunctuated. A passage read with grotesque phrasing, that is, with wrong methods of combining and separating, becomes almost nonsense.

    Interpret:

    There's a divinity that shapes our ends
    Rough hew them how we will.38
    — Hamlet 5.2.10-11

    That that is is that that is not is not.3?
    He said that that that that that sentence contains is a definitive.4°

    The boy said his father was to blame.*!

    70 = The Trivium

    Since languages are imperfect because they are too rich in meaning, the grammatical problem is to interpret the written page. Spoken Language is clarified by the speaker who punctuates it orally, who combines and separates the elements by phrasing, by stress, and by intonation. Difficulties in writing are identical with difficulties in reading. Students fail in expression, in speaking or writing, for the same reason that they fail in impression, in listening or reading; they do not understand or do not apply the rules of grammar which must guide both writer and reader, both speaker and listener.

    Words are symbols created to represent reality. A term is a concept communicated through a symbol. Once words are used to communicate a concept of reality, they become terms.

    Communication is dynamic; it is the conveying of an idea from one mind to another through a material medium, words or other symbols. If the listener or reader receives through language precisely the ideas put into it by the speaker or writer, these two have "come to terms" — the idea has passed successfully, clearly, from the giver to the receiver, from one end or term of the line of communication to the other.

    A term differs from a concept only in this: a term is an idea in transit, hence is dynamic, an ens communicativs; the concept is an idea representing reality, an ens mentis. A concept is a potential term; it becomes an actual term when it is communicated through a symbol. Hence a term is the meaning, the form the logical content, of words (see Chapter Two, Nature of Language). Words are therefore the symbols, the means by which terms are conveyed from mind to mind.

    ANALOGY: Reality and the symbols for reality

    The coffee in the coffee pot can reach me only by means of a conveyor, such as a cup. An idea can get from one mind to another only by means of a conveyor, a symbol. The idea is analogous to the coffee; the symbol, to the cup. The word used as a conveyor for the idea becomes a term when the thought is communicated.

    Not every word, however, can symbolize a logical term. Only categorical words (substantives and attributives) can do so. Although a

    71
    72 = = The Trivium

    syncategorematic word (a preposition, a conjunction, a definitive) cannot symbolize a logical term, it can be grammatically a part of the complete symbol, which expresses a logical term. A complete symbol, which must be either a proper name, an empirical description, a common name, or a general description, is, therefore, the grammatical equivalent of a logical term. Whether the complete symbol is one word or a group of words, it expresses only one logical term.

    A term is the element of logic, just as the word is the element of grammar and the letter is the element of spelling.

    A term is always unambiguous, or univocal because a meaning is always one: it is itself and not another. The grammatical symbol which expresses a term may, however, be ambiguous, for the same symbol is capable of expressing different terms. The dictionary lists for every word a number of meanings. Whoever uses a word normally intends but one of its various meanings; that one meaning is the term symbolized by the word in that particular instance.

    The same term, whether it signifies a particular individual or an essence, may be expressed through different symbols in the same or in different languages.

    EXAMPLES: Term expressed in different symbols

    Individual Essence

    The red-bearded man An equilateral rectangle

    The man with a red beard A rectangular equilateral

    The man who has a red beard A rectangle with equal sides
    L'homme qui a une barbe rouge A square

    Der Mann mit einem roten Barte Un carré

    El barbirroja Ein gleichseitiges Rechteck

    Dan Dravot (in Kipling's "The Man Who Would Be King") Un cuadrado

    Complete symbols that are logically equivalent in meaning, in designation, or in both, are substitutable for one another (see Chapter Three, Rules for Substituting Equivalent Symbols). Such equivalency makes possible translation from one language to another; it also makes possible a variety of styles within the same language and provides means to improve style.

    Words in different languages are usually equivalent in their logical dimension but often are not equivalent in their psychological dimension. That is why poetry is difficult to translate satisfactorily. Synonyms within the same language are seldom exactly the same in meaning. The least ambiguous of all symbols is a general description, especially one so perfect as to be a definition.

    CLASSIFICATION OF TERMS

    Empirical and General Terms
    The fundamental distinction between terms is that which classifies them according to the kind of reality signified as either an empirical term or a general term.

- prompt: |-
    An empirical term designates an individual or an aggregate of individuals. It must be symbolized by either a proper name or an empirical description, for example: Christopher Columbus, the desk in this room.

    A general term, also called a universal term, signifies essence (of either a species or a genus). It must be symbolized by a common name or a general description, for example: tree, a three-sided rectilinear plane figure.

    To be able to distinguish between an empirical term and a general term is of the utmost importance. In doing this, one cannot rely on grammatical tags; one must look through the words at the reality symbolized.

    EXAMPLES: General and empirical terms

    A bird has feathers. (Bird is a general term.)

    A bird flew past my window. (Bird is an empirical term.)

    The dance lasted until midnight. (Dance is an empirical term.)

    The dance is an art form. (Dance is a general term.)

    Contradictory Terms: Positive and Negative Terms

    Terms are contradictory when one is positive and the other is the corresponding negative. A positive term is one that expresses what is present in reality. A negative term is one that expresses what is absent. Some examples are: voter, nonvoter; Christian, non-Christian; white, nonwhite; conscious, unconscious; complete, incomplete; varnished, unvarnished.

    Some grammatically negative words symbolize logically positive terms. Examples are: infinite (the absence of limit connotes fullness of being), unkind (meaning positively cruel or harsh), and impatient (meaning positively peevish or irritable).

    A privative term is a kind of negative term which expresses a deprivation, the absence from a reality of a characteristic which belongs to its nature and which ought to be present. Examples include lame, blind, dead, and headless. A dog may be blind; a stone cannot be blind, for sight does not belong to the nature of stone.

- prompt: "Concrete and Abstract Terms  \nA concrete term is one that represents realities as they actually are in the  \norder of being. Examples are animal, fast, smooth, long, near, and warm.  \nAn abstract term is one that represents either substance or accident  \nmentally abstracted from concrete reality and regarded, for the sake of  \nemphasis, as an object of thought; it is symbolized by an abstract sub-  \nstantive. Examples are animality, speed, smoothness, length, nearness,  \nand warmth.  \nRecall that in Chapter Two the importance of abstract terms was  \nstressed. There too it was noted that concrete terms are more vivid (to  \nthe senses); abstract terms are more clear (to the intellect).  \n\nAbsolute and Relative Terms  \nAn absolute term is one that can be understood by itself without refer-  \nence to another term. Examples include man, tree, dog, field, red, and  \nhard.  \n\nA relative term is one of two terms, each of which must be under-  \nstood with reference to the other.

- prompt: |-
    A collective term is one that can be applied only to a group as a group
    but not to the members of the group taken singly. Examples are army,
    jury, crew, group, senate, family, team, flock, swarm, and herd. (Jane
    may be a member of the jury, but she cannot be a jury.) The rule of
    grammar requiring the agreement of subject and verb or copula, and
    also of pronoun and antecedent, makes it necessary to distinguish two
    uses of a noun symbolizing a collective term.

    The collective use requires that the verb or copula and the pronouns
    be singular. For example: The audience shows its pleasure by demand-
    ing encore after encore.

    The distributive use requires that the verb or copula and the pro-
    nouns be plural because the members of the group are thought of as
    acting individually rather than collectively. For example: The audience
    express uproarious approval by tossing their hats into the air and shout-
    ing with loud voices.

    A distributive term is one that can be applied to individual members
    of a group taken singly. For example, man is applicable both to every
    individual man and to the species man.

    Ten Categories of Being
    The ten logical categories of terms constitute an important classifica-
    tion. They correspond exactly to the ten metaphysical categories of
    being, namely: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, passion,
    when, where, posture, habiliment.

    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TERMS

    According to the basis of the difference, terms may be either categori-
    cally, generically, specifically, or individually different.

    76 = The Trivium

    Difference Based on Category. Genus, Species, Individual
    1 Terms are categorically different if they are in different categories
    (see Chapter Two, Ten Categories of Being). Examples include apple,
    large, red, there, now, and chosen.

    2 ‘Terms are generically different if they belong to different genera
    within the same category. Examples include round, smooth, sour;
    stone, tree, animal.

    3 Terms are specifically different if they belong to different species
    within the same genus. Examples include white, red, blue, yellow, gray,
    black; round, square, triangular; elm, oak, maple, pine; dog, elephant,
    horse; walk, creep, fly.

- prompt: |-
    4 Terms are individually different if they designate individuals
    within the same species, for every individual is unique, is itself and not
    another. Examples include: this woman, that woman, my mother; the
    Hudson River, the Mississippi River, the Snake River.

    Difference by Nature: Repugnant or Nonrepugnant
    According to the nature of the difference, terms are either repugnant or
    not. Terms are repugnant when they are incompatible, that is, when
    they signify realities that are mutually exclusive, that cannot coexist in
    the same substance at the same time and in the same period.

    1 Terms that are categorically different or generically different are
    not necessarily repugnant, for often they signify realities that can coex-
    ist in the same substance.°

    2 The following terms are necessarily repugnant:

    All terms that are individually different are repugnant. An individual
    cannot be itself and another at the same time.

    All terms that are specifically different are repugnant, for example:
    elm, oak, maple; dog, horse; square, circle, triangle.

    Contradictory terms are necessarily repugnant, for example, white,
    nonwhite.

    Contrary terms, which are pairs of terms that are either species
    within the same genus (for example, black, white [color]; long, short
    [length]), or species in contrary genera (for example, truthfulness and
    lying, the one a species of virtue, the other of vice) are repugnant.

    Contrary genera are repugnant, for example, good and evil.
    Terms and Their Grammatical Equivalents: Definition and Division 77

    Contrary terms represent extremes of difference. Not every term has
    a contrary. There are, for instance, no contraries in the following gen-
    era: animal, tree, flower, vehicle, shape. Some of the classifications of
    terms in this chapter are contrary terms which together constitute a
    genus; they are therefore specifically different and, consequently, re-
    pugnant, or incompatible. This is true of each of the following pairs:
    general and empirical terms; positive and negative terms; concrete and
    abstract terms; absolute and relative terms.

- prompt: |-
    The members of each pair of contrary terms are repugnant and,
    therefore, mutually exclusive, but a given term may be simultaneously
    a member of more than one pair because the pairs themselves are not
    mutually exclusive. Thus a given term cannot be both general and em-
    pirical, or both positive and negative, etc. It can, however, be at one and
    the same time general, positive, abstract, and absolute; for example,
    length is all of these simultaneously. My grandmother is, at one and the
    same time, empirical, positive, concrete, and relative.

    Of great importance is the distinction between contrary terms and
    contradictory terms. There is no middle ground between contradictory
    terms. For example, everything is either white or nonwhite; and every-
    thing is either a tree or a nontree. Every pair of contradictory terms thus
    performs a dichotomy, that is, cuts everything in two sharply, leaving no
    middle ground between.

    There is a middle ground between contrary terms. For example,
    everything need not be either white or black; it may be gray, or red, or
    blue.®

    Every term has its contradictory; not every term has a contrary. Con-
    trary terms represent the greatest degree of difference. Contradictory
    terms represent a necessarily clean-cut difference.

    THE EXTENSION AND INTENSION OF TERMS

    Definitions: Extension and Intension

    Every term has both extension and intension. The extension of a term
    is its designation: the total set of objects to which the term can be ap-
    plied. This is its objective, extramental reference to reality. For
    example, the extension of friend is the set of people who are friends
    to an individual; the extension of ocean is all the oceans on earth; the
    extension of tree is all trees. One uses a term in its full extension when
    applying it to all the objects it designates. One need not know the
    number.

- prompt: |-
    The intension of a term is its meaning, the sum of the essential characteristics that the term implies." This is its conceptual or logical reference. To make explicit the intension, the meaning, of a term is to define it. For example, the intension of friend is the sum of the qualities which make a friend, such as loyalty, congeniality, mutual affection, unselfish devotedness, trustworthiness, fidelity. Likewise, the intension of ocean or of tree is made explicit in its definition.

    The extension and intension of terms have their roots in the twofold reference of the phantasm, which is a mental image of the objects (extensional references) from which the intellect derives the concept (intensional reference).

    Relationship Between Extension and Intension
    There is a relation between the extension and the intension of terms as expressed in the following law.8

    Relation Between Extension and Intension of Terms
    As a term increases in intension, it decreases in extension.
    As a term increases in extension, it decreases in intension.

    4-1 Extension and intension of Terms

    The Tree of Porphyry illustrates the inverse relation between the extension and intension of terms in addition to the relation between these and definition and division. This is a progressive, essential, dichotomous division leading from the summum genus substance to the infima species man. It was devised by Porphyry (233-303 a.D.).9

    The summum genus is the highest and largest genus; it cannot become a species, for there is no higher genus of which it can form a species or part. The infima species is the lowest and smallest species; it cannot become a genus by further division into essentially different species.

    A division that proceeds from the summum genus to the infima species is, therefore, a complete series; it cannot be continued above or below these.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Extension-Intension Relationship in Classification**\n\nConsider the terms ''substance'' and ''organism'' as defined in the Tree of Porphyry.\n- **Part A**: Determine the extension-intension relationship between these two terms.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that demonstrates how the extension of ''organism'' is a subset of the extension of ''substance''.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on the inverse relationship between extension and intension affects the classification of terms in the Tree of Porphyry.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly articulate the extension-intension relationship and demonstrate understanding of the logical structure of the Tree of Porphyry, including its dichotomous divisions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Definitions**\n\nUsing the intensional definitions provided in the text, determine whether the following statements are true or false. Justify your answer based on the definitions and logical relationships described in the text:\n1. ''Tree'' is a species of ''organism''.\n2. ''Man'' is a species of ''rational animal''.\n3. ''Substance'' includes both material and immaterial substances.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the intension of the terms and demonstrate logical reasoning based on the hierarchical structure of the Tree of Porphyry.'

- prompt: |-
    In considering the Tree of Porphyry, note that every term between
    the summum genus and the infima species can be either genus or
    species because for intermediate terms, genus and species are relative
    to the point of view: a term is a genus of those below it and a species
    of those above it. A term is the proximate genus of the term directly
    below it; for example, animal is the proximate genus of man; body is
    the proximate genus of organism. All terms above a given term, but not
    immediately above it, are remote genera of that term; for example: or-
    ganism, body, and substance are remote genera of man, substance
    being the most remote.

    Accordingly, the Tree of Porphyry illustrates the law of inverse rela-
    tion of the extension and the intension of terms: as the intension of sub-
    stance is increased (by adding the attributes material, animate, sentient,
    rational), its extension is decreased. Substance, the summum genus, has
    the greatest extension and the least intension. Man, the infima species,
    has the least extension and the greatest intension, that is, the greatest
    number of characteristic notes: man is a rational, sentient, animate, ma-
    terial substance.

    DEFINITION

    Definition makes explicit the intension or meaning of a term, the
    essence that it represents. A definition is symbolized by a general
    description, not by one word. A definition is a perfect general descrip-
    tion. There are two kinds of definition constructed from a logical point
    of view: a logical definition and a distinctive definition.

    80 = The Trivium

    Logical Definition
    A logical definition expresses the essence of a species in terms of its
    proximate genus and its specific differentia. The pattern is species
    is proximate genus plus specific differentia. For example: Man is an an-
    imal possessing rationality.

    Species is the term to be defined; the subject of a definition is, there-
    fore, always species.

    The specific differentia is that part of the essence which belongs only
    to a given species and which distinguishes it from every other species in
    the same genus. For example, rationality is that part of his essence
    which makes man different from every other species of animal.

Identify the proximate genus of ''animal'' based on the Tree of Porphyry.\n2. Determine the specific differentia that distinguishes ''animal'' from its lower species (e.g., man).\n3. Construct a logical definition for ''animal'' following the pattern: ''animal is proximate genus plus specific differentia.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your definition must accurately reflect the hierarchical relationships described in the text and explicitly identify the proximate genus and specific differentia.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Inverse Relation of Extension and Intension\n\nExplain the inverse relationship between extension and intension using the example of ''substance'' and ''man'' from the text.\n\n**Steps to Answer**:\n1. Define ''substance'' and ''man'' in terms of their extension and intension.\n2. Compare their extensions and intensions, noting how the addition of attributes (e.g., material, animate, sentient, rational) affects the intension of ''man''.\n3.

Define a distinctive definition by emphasizing the unique attributes that define the species.\n3. Compare the two definitions, highlighting their purposes and applications in classification.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish the two types of definitions, using the text''s examples and explaining their distinct roles in logical classification.'

- prompt: |-
    Genus is that part of essence which is common to all the species that constitute the genus. For example, animality is that part of his essence which man shares with other species of his genus, such as horse, sparrow, oyster.

    The Tree of Porphyry provides data for the logical definition of man, animal, organism, and body.

    A logical definition cannot be constructed for every term because for some terms there is no proximate genus, or the specific differentia is not known. Such terms can be made clear, however, by a general description that is not a logical definition.

    A logical definition cannot be constructed for the following: a summum genus, a transcendental concept, or the individual.

    A summum genus, such as substance or any other of the ten categories, or a predicable cannot be defined logically. It might seem that being is the genus of substance and of the other categories, since the ten categories classify being. Being is not, however, understood in the same way of substance and of accident, nor of the different accidents; furthermore, being transcends the categories, and therefore it cannot be their genus.

    A transcendental concept is a concept that cannot be classified because it extends through and beyond all categories. The transcendentals are being and its transcendental attributes: unity, truth, goodness, res, aliquid;!9 some philosophers include beauty.!1

    The individual, as an individual, cannot be defined, for its essence is that which it shares with other individuals of its species. That which makes the individual unique, different from other individuals in its species, serves for designation rather than for signification.

    Hence only species can be defined. When a term such as animal is defined, it must be defined as species of its genus (organism), not as genus of its species (man, horse, etc.). For example, an animal is a sentient organism.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Logical Definition Limitations**\n\nExplain why the term "being" cannot be logically defined according to the text.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s explanation of "summum genus."\n- **Step 2**: Discuss the text''s argument that "being" transcends the categories.\n- **Step 3**: Compare "being" to a term that can be logically defined (e.g., "animal") and explain how the difference in definitional scope arises.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between summum genus and species, and you must explicitly connect the text''s arguments about transcendental concepts to the limitations of logical definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Individual and Species Definitions**\n\nThe text states that the individual cannot be defined logically because its essence is shared with other individuals of its species.\n- **Part A**: Provide an example of an individual that can be logically defined, and explain why it differs from the individual described in the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical definition for a species (e.g., "dog") using the text''s framework.\n- **Part C**: Argue whether the text''s assertion that only species can be defined logically is valid, using examples from the text and your own reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of species and genus, and you must clearly differentiate between the logical definability of individuals and species.'

- prompt: "Distinctive Definition  \nA distinctive definition is definition by property. The pattern is as follows:  \nspecies is genus (proximate or remote or even being) plus property. For  \nexample, man is a being (or animal or organism) capable of mirthfulness.  \nProperty is not the essence, nor a part of the essence, but it is a nec-  \nessary concomitant of the essence and follows from it. Thus, mirthful-  \nness is not man's essence, nor a part of his essence, but it follows from  \nhis essence, that is, from both the genus and the differentia: because  \nman is rational, he can see that something is funny; because he is an  \nanimal, he can laugh. A man possesses a capability for mirth, whether  \nhe exercises it or not. The laugh of a hyena is not mirthful; it is merely  \na cachinnation, a noise, hideous, not mirthful.  \n\nILLUSTRATION: Relationship between concomitant and essence  \n\nOn a sunny afternoon, my shadow is a concomitant of my body.  \nif | draw a convex line, it is concomitantly a concave line when viewed from the other side.  \n\nTaste is the concomitant of an animal's eating; it is not a concomitant of a tree's nutrition.  \n\nA distinctive definition by property is usually the best definition that  \nscience can achieve. In chemistry, an element such as hydrogen, chlo-  \nrine, sodium, copper, zinc is defined by its specific properties such as  \nnatural physical status (gas, liquid, solid), atomic weight, specific grav-  \nity, and valence. In geometry, the propositions to be proved simply  \nmake explicit the properties of the triangle, the circle, the sphere, etc.  \nIt is to be noted that a species has but one specific differentia; it may  \nhave a number of specific properties.  \n\nOther Types of Definition\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Distinctive Definitions**\n\nUsing the concept of a distinctive definition by property as described in the text, define the term "triangle" in a way that reflects its essential properties and concomitant characteristics.\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the genus (the broader category) for a triangle.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the specific differentia that uniquely define a triangle.\n- **Step 3**: Incorporate a concomitant property that is not essential but follows from the definition (e.g., the sum of interior angles).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your definition must align with the text''s explanation that a distinctive definition is a species defined by its genus plus property, and it must include at least one concomitant characteristic as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Concomitant Properties**\n\nExplain the relationship between the concomitant properties and the essence of a species, using the examples provided in the text.\n\n- **Part A**: Compare the concomitant of a shadow (being a concomitant of the body) with the concomitant of taste (being a concomitant of an animal''s eating).\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the concomitant of a triangle''s angles (sum of interior angles being 180 degrees) is not essential but follows from its definition.\n- **Part C**: Apply this reasoning to the concept of a "circle" as a species.

    A causal definition is one that makes explicit the meaning or intension of a term by naming the cause which produced the reality which the term signifies. A causal definition may name any one of the four causes: efficient, material, formal, final.12 For example, pneumonia is a disease caused by the pneumococcus (efficient cause). Water is H2O (material cause, naming the constituents; formal cause, indicating how they are related).

    82 9 The Trivium

    A definition by matter and form is sometimes called a genetic definition. Such are all chemical formulas and chemical equations. Such also are all recipes. A definition by final cause is sometimes called a purposive definition.

    A descriptive definition merely enumerates the characteristics by which the species can be recognized. For example: An elephant is a huge, thickset, nearly hairless mammalian quadruped with a long, muscular proboscis and two long tusks.

    Definition by example provides data for definition rather than the definition itself. Sometimes the presentation of familiar examples will enable the mind to make from them an abstraction clearer to it than the ready-made abstraction presented in an actual definition would be. Examples: An evergreen is a tree such as the cedar, pine, spruce, hemlock. A military genius is a man like Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Washington, Napoleon, Marshall Foch, George Patton, Jr. The only authentic and really enlightening definition of a neighbor is that by example, the parable of the Good Samaritan.

    Grammatical and rhetorical definition or nominal definition introduces the problem of making clear which term is imposed upon a given symbol, a word, or a phrase,13 rather than making explicit the meaning of a term. Consequently, the problem is the clarification of language, the getting rid of ambiguity, the "coming to terms" of reader and writer, of listener and speaker, both of whom must attach the same meaning to the given symbol.

    Definition by etymology. A word is often understood more clearly from its derivation. Examples: Infinite is derived from Latin in (not) plus finitus (limited); elect is derived from Latin e (out) plus lectus (chosen).

    Be aware that etymology is not a secure guide, for sometimes the
    present meaning does not agree with the etymological meaning. Ety-
    mologically, hydrogen means water-former, and oxygen means acid-for-
    mer. But hydrogen is really the acid-former, and oxygen is the principal
    water-former in the sense that it constitutes nearly eight times as much
    of the weight of water as hydrogen does. Their names should therefore
    be interchanged, but this will not be done, for although oxygen is mis-
    named, the name had become permanently attached to the element
    before the error was discovered. This is only one striking instance which
    shows that etymology is not a safe guide to the current meaning of
    words, even though it is usually very helpful and illuminating. By a

    ment, and goods transported in a ship are called a cargo.

    2 Definition by synonyms. This pointedly illustrates the fact that
    grammar provides a choice of nearly equivalent symbols for the same
    term. Such symbols, however, differ somewhat either in the logical or
    in the psychological dimension or in both.

    3 Arbitrary definition. There are certain words, very important
    words, about whose precise meaning there is not common agreement.
    The dictionary offers little practical help in defining such words.

    Certain legal terms such as larceny, treason, and vagrant must be de-
    fined by law for the courts of each state. Such legal definitions may dif-
    fer greatly. Thus treason as defined by the Constitution of the United
    States is a term very different from treason as defined by law under
    Henry VIII or Elizabeth I of England or under the Czars of Russia.

    Many commonly used terms, like liberty, patriotism, justice, reli-
    gion, courtesy, culture, and many literary terms, like classicism, ro-
    manticism, style, poetry, ought, for clarity, to be defined by each user of
    the word. A reader must be careful to discover just what meaning a
    writer is attaching to words as ambiguous as these; otherwise reader and
    writer cannot "come to terms." Debaters, in particular, must "come to
    terms"; otherwise they argue beside the point.

    what is included in the term and what is excluded, dealing especially
    with disputable borderline instances, not merely with those obviously
    included or excluded.

    Rules of Definition
    A definition should be:

    1. Convertible with the subject, the species, the term to be defined.
    For example: A man is a rational animal. A rational animal is a man.
    The term to be defined and its definition coincide perfectly both in in-
    tension and in extension; hence they are always convertible. Convert-
    ibility is the test of a definition. A statement is convertible if it is equally
    true with the subject and predicate interchanged.

    2. Positive rather than negative. A violation of this rule is: A good
    man is one who does not harm his fellow men. (It is not very enlight-
    ening merely to tell what something is not.)

    3. Clear, symbolized by words that are neither obscure, vague, am-
    biguous, nor figurative. A violation of this rule is Samuel Johnson's fa-
    mous definition of a network: "Network is anything reticulated or de-
    cussated, at equal distances with interstices between the intersections."

    4. Free from a word derived from the same root as the word to be
    defined. A violation of the rule is a definition like the following: Suc-
    cess is succeeding in whatever you undertake.

    DIVISION

    Division is an extremely valuable tool of thought. In Plato's Phaedrus,
    Socrates says, "I am a great lover of these processes of division and gen-
    eralization. ... And if I find any man who is able to see unity and plu-
    rality in nature, him I follow, and walk in his step as if he were a god."

    Logical division is the analysis of the extension of a term, whereas
    definition is the analysis of its intension. The Summa Theologica of
    Saint Thomas Aquinas illustrates how division deepens insight and
    manifests comprehensive order.

    Terms and Their Grammatical Equivalents: Definition and Division 85

    Logical Division Distinguished from Other Kinds of Division

    Logical division is the division of a genus into its constituent species.
    For example, tree may be divided into its species—oak, elm, maple,
    poplar, etc. The test of logical division is that the logical whole (genus)
    can always be predicated of each of its parts (species). For example, tree
    can be predicated of each of its species. Oaks are trees. Elms are trees.
    No other whole can be predicated of its parts. Logical division never
    deals with the individual. It is always the division of a group (genus) into
    smaller groups (species), never of a species into its individual members.
    This last is enumeration, not division.

    Quantitative division is the division of a singular extended whole,
    such as a line or a body, into its quantitative parts. For example, a pound
    of butter may be divided into servings.

    Physical division is the division of a singular composite whole into
    its essential diversified parts. A composite may be divided into matter
    and form. For example: a human being may be divided into body and
    soul; a human body into head, hands, feet, heart, etc.

    Virtual or functional division is the division of a potential or func-
    tional whole into its diversified virtual or functional parts.

    EXAMPLES: Virtual or functionai division

    "The human soul is wholly in the whole body and wholly in each part because it is the form or prin-
    ciple of operation; yet the whole soul is in each part of the body by totality of perfection and of
    essence but not by totality of power or function, for with regard to sight it is only in the eye, to hear-
    ing only in the ear, etc.715

    A government is a functional whole exercising a single authority in different persons and places but
    not according to the same power in each.

    Human society is a functional whole with functional parts (family, school, state, church, local com-
    munity) that together educate the individual. The school is a functional whole of which the curricu-
    lum, general lectures, drama, concerts, athletics, campus organizations, etc. are functional parts. The
    curriculum is a functional whole directed toward wisdom of which the various subjects are parts,
    each making its own contribution.

    A play or a story in which a unifying theme informs the whole expresses the theme more forcefully
    in certain scenes and characters than in others.

    Metaphysical division is the distinction between substance and ac-
    cidents or between accidents. For example, an orange (substance) is
    distinct from its accidents (color, size, shape, weight, taste, smooth-
    ness, coldness, etc.), and these are distinct from one another. A meta-
    physical division is a distinction, not a separation. It cannot be phys-
    ically performed; for example, the shape of an orange cannot be
    actually separated from the orange, nor can its taste, size, and color
    be set separately before us, apart from the orange and apart from one
    another.

    The distinctions perceived in metaphysical division are used as the
    bases of logical division; for example, we may divide fruits according to
    accidents, such as color, shape, size, sugar content, etc. Or we may di-
    vide them according to their essential nature into oranges, apples, ba-
    nanas, cherries, etc.

    Verbal division is the distinction which the dictionary makes be-
    tween the meanings that have been imposed upon a word, that is, be-
    tween the terms that a given notation can symbolize.

- prompt: "Klements of Logical Division  \nLogical division includes three elements: the logical whole, the basis of  \ndivision, and the dividing members. The logical whole, which is to be  \ndivided, is the genus. The basis of division is the metaphysical aspect,  \nthe point of view from which division is made. The dividing members  \nare the species resulting from the logical division.  \n\nKinds of Logical Division  \nLOGICAL DIVISION ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTER OF  \nTHE BASIS OF DIVISION  \nAccording to the character of the basis of division, we distinguish  \namong natural objects and among artificial objects.  \n\nNatural Objects  \n\nAmong natural objects essential division aims to determine natural  \nspecies, for example, the division of edible plants into carrots, lettuce,  \npeas, beets, spinach, potatoes, etc.  \n\nAccidental division is based on accidents that do not determine nat-  \nural species, for example: the division of edible plants according to  \ncolor, shape, or nutritive value; the division of men according to color,  \nnationality, religion, occupation, height, or weight.  \n\nNote that the infima species, such as man, resulting from natural es-  \nsential division, can undergo further division only on an accidental  \nbasis.  \n\nArtificial Objects  \n\nAmong artificial objects, essential division is based on the form im-  \nposed by man on matter. This is the division of an artificial genus into  \nartificial species, for example: the division of silverware into knives,  \nforks, spoons, ladles, etc.; the division of vehicles into wagons, trucks,  \ncars, bicycles, etc.  \n\nAccidental division is based on accidents that do not determine arti-  \nficial species, for example, the division of chairs according to size, color,  \nweight, etc.  \n\nLOGICAL DIVISION ACCORDING TO THE MANNER OF  \nAPPLYING THE BASIS OF DIVISION  \n\nAccording to the manner of applying the basis of division, we distin-  \nguish positive division and dichotomy.  \n\nPositive Division  \n\nPositive division divides a genus into its constituent species, for ex-  \nample: the division of elements into hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sul-  \nphur, carbon, silver, gold, etc.; the division of color into white, red,  \nyellow, blue, gray, black, etc. This is the type of division science aims  \nto accomplish.  \n\nDichotomy\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."

    Dichotomy is division by contradictory terms, for example: the division of elements into gold and nongold; of color into red and nonred, or white and nonwhite.

    In division by dichotomy, the negative term is unexplored in the sense that it may contain within itself either a number of positive species or only one. 'Thus, investigation reveals that nonwhite contains many positive species: red, yellow, blue, green, brown, gray, black, etc.; but noneven is a negative term which contains only one positive species, namely, odd.

    Rules of Logical Division
    1. A logical division must have one and only one basis.

    2. The constituent species must be mutually exclusive (with no overlapping).

    3. The division must be collectively exhaustive, or complete; that is, the constituent species must equal the genus.

    88 = The Trivium

    No one species may equal the genus, for then there would be no division. This is the error present in an outline when a person attempts to divide by one subtopic. Such an attempt results in no division at all; there must be at least two species, at least two subtopics.

    A shift in the basis of division is the error of applying simultaneously, but incompletely, two or more different bases of division, for example, the division of books into Latin, English, French, poetry, history, sci-
    ence, octavo, quarto, blue, red. A shift in the basis of division is the
    prime error in division, creating confusion and disorder. It makes it im-
    possible to achieve what logical division aims at—a division that is col-
    lectively exhaustive (complete) and mutually exclusive (with no
    overlapping).

    From a strictly logical point of view, although not from a scientific
    one, dichotomy is superior to positive division, because—since there is
    no middle ground between contradictory terms—dichotomy guaran-
    tees the realization of the aims of logical division as stated in the fore-
    going rules whereas positive division cannot do so with equal assurance.

    The principle of contradiction—that a thing cannot both be and not
    be at the same time and in the same respect—is an axiom of thought,
    a law of reason, of greater certitude than any law of science. Dichotomy
    employs this principle.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Dichotomy and Logical Division Analysis**\n\nThe text discusses dichotomy as a division by contradictory terms, such as ''gold and nongold'' or ''red and nonred.'' Apply this concept to the following example: Divide the set of ''colors'' into two contradictory categories.\n\n- **Part A**: Identify the two contradictory terms and explain why they are contradictory based on the text''s definition of dichotomy.\n- **Part B**: Critically evaluate the validity of this division using the rules of logical division. Specifically, address whether the division is collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast dichotomy with positive division using the text''s explanation of the principle of contradiction.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of dichotomy''s relationship to the rules of logical division and the principle of contradiction.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Error Identification in Logical Division**\n\nThe text warns against two common errors in logical division: ''shift in the basis of division'' and ''division by dichotomy leading to unexplored negative terms.'' Apply these concepts to the following faulty division: ''Books are divided into fiction, nonfiction, and science.''\n\n- **Part A**: Identify the error in this division and explain why it violates the rules of logical division.\n- **Part B**: Propose a corrected division that adheres to the rules, ensuring that the division is both collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on the principle of contradiction supports the need for logical divisions that avoid ambiguity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show an understanding of the errors and their implications for logical clarity.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Contradictory Terms**\n\nThe text states that ''nonwhite contains many positive species'' but ''noneven is a negative term which contains only one positive species, namely, odd.'' Apply this reasoning to the following scenario: Divide the set of ''even numbers'' into two contradictory categories.\n\n- **Part A**: Identify the two contradictory terms and explain why they are contradictory based on the text''s definition.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the division for logical consistency, considering the text''s rules about exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories.\n- **Part C**: Use the principle of contradiction to justify why the division must be exhaustive and mutually exclusive.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s concepts of contradiction and logical division to demonstrate a clear understanding of their interplay.'

    Positive division is based on empirical knowledge, which often re-
    quires revision because further investigation proves earlier conclusions
    to have been incomplete, inadequate, misleading. For example, the
    early Greek observers classified the elements as four: earth, water, fire,
    and air. Modern chemistry!® distinguishes more than one hundred ele-
    ments and shows that not one of the four so long regarded as elements
    is really an element; for example, water is a compound and air is a mix-
    ture. We cannot be certain how many elements science will distinguish
    five hundred years from now. Because positive division relies on inves-
    tigation, not on a principle of reason, it is inferior from a logical point
    of view.17

    The Tree of Porphyry is a division by dichotomy. By no other means
    could we achieve a progressive, essential, exhaustive, and mutually ex-
    clusive division of all substance.

    Subdivision and Codivision
    Subdivision is a division subordinate to a preceding division; it may em-
    ploy the same or a different basis of division and should result in a sin-
    gle, orderly system. An example is the Tree of Porphyry.

    Terms and Their Grammatical Equivalents: Definition and Division 89

    Codivision is a series of independent divisions of the same whole,
    each employing a different basis of division. For example, a codivision
    of books could be made by applying successively, and each time ex-
    haustively, these four bases of division: subject, language, size, color of
    binding.

    The earlier part of this chapter deals with the codivision of terms.!8
    Each of the six classifications divides all terms according to one basis of
    division into species mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

    D PROPOSITIONS AND THEIR
    GRAMMATICAL EXPRESSION

    THE PROPOSITION: DEFINITION AND DISTINCTIONS

    Proposition and Relation of Terms
    The proposition asserts a relation of terms. It consists of subject, copula,
    and predicate. The terms (the subject and the predicate) constitute the
    matter of the proposition; the copula which relates them constitutes its
    form.

- prompt: "Proposition: Modal and Categorical  \nMODAL PROPOSITION  \nA proposition may or may not assert the mode of the relation of its terms.

    Moral. Moral necessity is a normative necessity referring to a free
    agent. Because of free will, humans can act counter to these Laws. Even
    so, the laws remain, either expressing natural human tendencies, as in
    economic laws; or expressing the demands of order in society, as in civil
    laws; or, most important, expressing a duty binding on conscience, as
    in the moral law.

    ILLUSTRATION: Propositions expressing relations morally necessary

    The quality of the goods being equal, people necessarily tend to buy the goods priced lowest. This
    tendency can be counteracted to some extent by a contrary appeal to the free will, as, for instance,
    by a campaign to "Buy American."

    Cars must stop when the traffic light is red.
    Good must be done and evil avoided.

    Logical. For a consideration of the relations of necessity and con-
    tingency on strictly logical grounds, see the predicables: species, genus,
    differentia, definition, property, and accident. The predicables are fully
    explained later in this chapter.

    Contingent

    If a modal proposition does not assert the relations of its terms as nec-
    essary, then the relationship is contingent. Whatever is not necessary is
    contingent. A relation is contingent, or possible, that does not involve
    either necessity or metaphysical incompatibility; it may or may not exist
    in the natural order. It may also be contingent on future acts or events
    or on our knowledge.

    EXAMPLES: Contingent propositions

    A raven may be red.

    A lion may be tame.

    A triangle may be isosceles.

    This water may contain typhoid germs.

    Your mother may be writing you a letter now.

    Amelia Jones may win the election.

    CATEGORICAL PROPOSITION

    A categorical proposition asserts the relation of its terms as they are ac-
    tually related, without expressing the mode of their relation. If the mode
    is afterwards considered, it is, of course, found to be either necessary or
    contingent. Consequently, the copula in a categorical proposition is
    ambiguous in the sense that, if examined, the simple is means either is
    necessarily (must be) or is contingently (may be).

    Grammar Note
    The indicative mood of the copula expresses the categorical relation.

    The potential mood expresses the contingent relations.

    5-1 Mood of Categorical and Contingent Propositions

    Proposition: Simple or Compound
    A proposition is either simple or compound.

    Propositions and their Grammatical Expression 93

    A simple proposition is one that asserts the relation of two terms
    and only two.* A simple proposition is categorical if it asserts the
    relation as a matter of fact. Every categorical proposition is a simple
    proposition, but not every simple proposition is categorical. A simple
    proposition is modal if it explicitly asserts the relation as either nec-
    essary or contingent.

    A compound proposition is one that relates at least three terms. A com-
    pound proposition may be either hypothetical or disjunctive. A hypo-
    thetical proposition asserts the dependence of one proposition on
    another. For example: If he does not study, he will fail (three terms). A dis-
    junctive proposition asserts that of two or more suppositions, one is true.
    For example: A triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene (four terms).

    CHARACTERISTICS OF PROPOSITIONS

    Propositions are characterized by reference to reality, quantity, quality,
    modality, and value. Each of these characteristics divides propositions
    into two classes.

    Reference Lo Reality: General or Empirical
    Reference to reality, the fundamental distinction between propositions,
    is determined by the reference of the subject.

    A general proposition is one whose subject is a general term, refer-
    ring to an essence, symbolized by a common name or a general de-
    scription.

    An empirical proposition is one whose subject is an empirical term,
    referring to an individual or an aggregate, symbolized by a proper name
    or an empirical description.

    Quantity: Total or Partial
    The quantity of a proposition is determined by the extension of the sub-
    ject. A proposition is total if its subject is a term used in its full extension.
    A general proposition does not have quantity in the concrete sense
    because its subject is essence, a class nature. The subject of a general
    proposition is, however, used in its full extension and is, in that sense,
    regarded as total. A categorical proposition, in which the subject is used
    in its full extension and is therefore total in quantity, may be worded in
    various ways.

- prompt: |-
    Spinach is a vegetable.
    A rabbit is an animal.
    All birds have feathers. (This proposition is explicitly quantified by "All.")

    To be a square is to be a rectangle.

    When the general proposition is asserted as a necessary modal, it
    might be worded thus: A square must have four equal sides.

    A singular empirical proposition, because its subject is one individ-
    ual, is used in its full extension and is, in that sense, regarded as total.
    When the singular empirical proposition is asserted categorically, it
    might be worded thus: This man is a thief. When the singular empiri-
    cal proposition is asserted as a necessary modal proposition, it might be
    worded thus: John is necessarily mortal.

    Quantity, in the strict sense, is proper only to plural empirical propo-
    sitions. A plural empirical proposition is total when the subject is a total
    aggregate of individuals.

    EXAMPLES: Total empirical propositions

    All the members of this class are American citizens.
    No chair in this room is a rocker.
    These women are lawyers.

    Twelve horses were entered in the race.

    A proposition is partial if its subject is a term used in only part of its
    extension. In plural empirical propositions the partial extension of the
    subject is expressed by a limiting word such as "some" or an equivalent.

    EXAMPLES: Partial empirical propositions

    Some men are handsome.
    Some roses are not red.
    All violets are not purple. ("All are not' idiomatically means "Some are not.")

    Not every day is rainy. (This means: Some days are not rainy.)
    Propositions and Their Grammatical Expression 95

    When a general proposition or a singular empirical proposition is
    contingent in modality the subject is used in only a part of its extension
    (as is proved by the test of conversion).

    EXAMPLES: Contingent propositions

    A contingent general proposition: A rectangle may not be a square.
    A contingent singular proposition: John may not be sad.

- prompt: "Quality: Affirmative or Negative  \nThe quality of a proposition is determined by the copula, which joins  \nor separates, composes or divides the terms. A proposition is affirmative  \nif it asserts the inclusion of the subject (all of it or a part of it) in the  \npredicate. A proposition is negative if it asserts the exclusion of the pred-  \nicate (always all of it) from the subject.  \n\nModality: Necessary or Contingent  \nThe modality of a proposition is determined by the copula. Necessary  \nand contingent relations have been explained and illustrated at the be-  \nginning of this chapter.  \n\nValue: True or False  \nThe truth or falsity of an empirical proposition can be known only from  \ninvestigation, from experience, from an appeal to the facts.

    5-3 Forms of Propositions

    The indefiniteness characteristic of I and O propositions may be ex-
    pressed either by the indefinite some or by the contingent may. The
    quantity of a proposition is determined by its subject and hence by the
    matter, not by the form. The modality and the quality of a proposition
    are determined by the copula. Since the copula is the form of a propo-
    sition, the modal forms, determined altogether by the copula, more
    properly express propositional forms. Yet the quantitative forms are usu-
    ally more convenient and are more frequently used, for we are inclined
    to use categorical propositions more often than modal ones.

    The A E1 O designations are a Latin mnemonic. A and I are the first
    two vowels in affirmo, | affirm, and thus designate the affirmative propo-
    sitions. E and O are the vowels in nego, I deny, and thus designate the
    negative propositions.

    THE DISTRIBUTION OF TERMS

    Distribution is a characteristic of terms used in a proposition, not of a
    term standing alone. A term is distributed if it is used in its full exten-
    sion. It is undistributed if it is used in less than its full extension.

    The Formal Rules of Distribution
    The quantity (or modality) of a proposition determines the distribution
    of its subject. The quality of a proposition determines the distribution
    of its predicate.

    1 A total (or necessary) proposition distributes its subject.
    2 A partial (or contingent) proposition has its subject undistrib-
    uted.
    3 A negative proposition distributes its predicate (because it ex-
    cludes all of it from the subject).
    4 An affirmative proposition has its predicate undistributed (be-
    cause the predicate is normally a term wider in extension than the sub-
    ject).

- prompt: |-
    The predicate of an affirmative proposition is, however, distributed
    whenever the proposition is a definition, by virtue of the following rea-
    soning: (1) a definition is always an A proposition (necessary affirmative)
    and therefore its subject is distributed through the form; (2) the predi-
    cate, being the definition of the subject (whether by genus and differentia
    or by property), has not only the same intension but the same extension as
    the subject, namely, full extension, and is therefore distributed (through
    the matter, the terms, although not through the form, the copula). The
    very fact that a definition is convertible proves that the predicate has the
    same extension as the subject, and therefore, since the subject is distrib-
    uted, so is the predicate. Conversion is the test of distribution.

    Applying the Rules to the A E I O Forms
    Distribution is an important concept in logic. The formal rules of distri-
    bution can be reduced to formulas that apply to the AEI O forms. In con-
    sidering the formula, note that d means distributed, and u, undistributed.

    d ou

    1 SaP Because it is total (or necessary), an A proposition dis-
    tributes its subject; because it is affirmative, its predicate is undistrib-
    uted. (All lions are animals.)

    d d

    2 SeP Because it is total (or necessary), an E proposition
    distributes its subject; because it is negative, it distributes its predicate.
    (No lions are horses.)

    u ou

    3 SiP Because it is partial (or contingent), an I proposition
    has its subject undistributed; because it is affirmative, its predicate is
    undistributed. (Some lions are tame.)

    ud

    4 SoP Because it is partial (or contingent), an O proposition
    has its subject undistributed; because it is negative, it distributes its
    predicate. (Some lions are not tame.)

    Note that knowing the distribution of terms is as indispensable to suc-
    cess in the study of logic as knowing the basic axioms is in the study of
    geometry. If you become bewildered, or seem to get lost in a fog, go back
    to this point, grasp it clearly, and then work your way through to the light.

- prompt: |-
    Genus is that part of the essence which is common to all its constituent species. Examples are: Man is an animal. A square is a rectangle.

    The differentia is that part of the essence which belongs only to a given species and which distinguishes it from every other species in the same genus. Examples are: Man is rational. A square is equilateral.

    Definition is constituted of the genus plus the differentia; it makes explicit the essence of the species which stands as its subject, and therefore it coincides perfectly with the subject in both intension and extension. Two examples are: Man is a rational animal. A square is an equilateral rectangle.

    Property is not the essence nor a part of the essence, but it flows from the essence and is present wherever the essence is present, for it is a necessary concomitant of the essence. Therefore, it perfectly coincides with the subject in extension but not in intension. Examples are: Man is mirthful. A square is divisible by its diagonal into two equal isosceles right triangles.

    Accident is a predicate contingently related to the subject, whereas all the other predicables are related necessarily to the subject. The contingency may be either explicit or implicit. Examples are: Man may be white. A square may be large. The grass is green.

    The predicable accident must be carefully distinguished from the predicamental accident (any of the nine categories of accident).' The predicables and the categories (or praedicamenta) are codivisions of terms, each using a different principle of division, one depending altogether on the relations of terms, the other classifying terms independently.

- prompt: |-
    An inseparable accident, which is a contingent predicate, must not be confused with property, which is a necessary predicate. For example, a raven is always black, but blackness is not therefore a necessary predicate of raven. The contingent general proposition "A raven may be red" is therefore true as a possibility.

    For years whiteness was considered an inseparable accident of swans, for no swans except white ones were known until black swans were discovered in Australia. Nevertheless, even before the discovery, white was correctly regarded as a contingent, not a necessary, predicate of swan.

    The Number of the Predicables
    There are five predicables which classify the predicates of a general (or universal) affirmative proposition, and a sixth, which appears only in an empirical affirmative proposition.

    In his exposition of the predicables, wherein he shows that they analyze modality as either necessary or contingent, Aristotle distinguishes five. His analysis is applicable only to general affirmative propositions.
    Let S a P symbolize a general affirmative proposition. Then P is either convertible with S or it is not. If it is convertible, P is either the definition (signifying the essence) or a property. If it is not convertible, P is either one of the elements of the definition (genus or differentia) or it is not; if it is not one of the elements of the definition, it is an accident (Topics, 1.8).8

    Aristotle also says emphatically (Categories, 2.5)? that all predication is primarily and essentially of first substance, that is, of an individual, the object of our experience, expressed by a singular empirical term as subject. A general or universal term can stand as a subject only because it can itself be predicated of singulars, that is, of individuals. Hence Aristotle includes a sixth predicable, species, which states the class nature of an individual and can therefore be predicated normally only of individuals.
    In its extensional relation to its subject, as revealed by the test of conversion, species resembles genus in not being convertible, for its extension is greater than that of the subject. For example: Socrates is a man.

    5-5 Euler's Circles Showing Extensional Relationships of the Six Predicables

    Porphyry and the Scholastics listed five predicables, including
    species but omitting definition. It is true that species and definition are
    identical in both extension and intension, and that in order of being,
    on which Porphyry's classification is based, species, like definition, sig-
    nifies the whole essence; moreover, the Scholastics exemplify the pred-
    icable species by a predicate which is definition. Yet species, as
    commonly understood, when used as a predicate cannot be identified
    with the predicable definition, since species is the subject, the one pos-
    sible subject of the predicable definition, and species can be the pred-
    icate normally only of a singular empirical subject. Species as a
    predicate has more in common with genus than with definition because
    in both of these relations the subject is totally included in a wider pred-
    icate, as Euler's circles indicate.

    Limits of Predication
    In their narrow signification the six predicables do not represent an ex-
    haustive analysis of predication, not even of necessary predication.

    The first reason why the six predicables do not represent an exhaus-
    tive analysis of predication rests on the understanding that a predicate
    is affirmed necessarily of a subject if it is a property or the differentia of
    a remote genus of the subject; but it cannot be classified as either a
    property or the differentia of that subject. For example: A man neces-
    sarily has weight (is ponderable).

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Predicables and Euler''s Circles**\n\nGiven the extensional relationships of the six predicables as described in the text, explain how Euler''s circles represent the inclusion relationships between these predicables.\n- **Step 1**: Identify which predicables are in total inclusion (genus, species, differentia) and which are in partial inclusion (accident, coincidence).\n- **Step 2**: Draw a conceptual diagram (described in words) of Euler''s circles that reflects these relationships, ensuring that genus and species are entirely contained within the broader category of definition.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why coincidence is a partial inclusion, while genus, species, and differentia are total inclusions, using the text''s discussion of extensional relationships.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must explicitly reference the text''s description of Euler''s circles and the nature of each predicable''s inclusion.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Predication Limits**\n\nThe text states that the six predicables do not exhaustively represent all forms of predication, particularly necessary predication. Using the text''s example of ''A man necessarily has weight,'' explain why this example demonstrates that the six predicables are insufficient for an exhaustive analysis of necessary predication.\n- **Step 1**: Identify which of the six predicables could be applied to the example of ''a man having weight.''\n- **Step 2**: Explain why this example cannot be classified as a property, differentia, or species of the subject ''man.''\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the implications of this limitation for the Scholastics'' classification of predicables, referencing the text''s assertion that the six predicables do not cover all necessary predication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of the limits of predication and the specific example provided.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Predicables and Definitions**\n\nThe text notes that species and definition are identical in both extension and intension, yet species as a predicate cannot be identified with the predicable definition. Using the text''s discussion of Porphyry''s classification and the Scholastics'' approach, construct an argument explaining why species, as a predicate, has more in common with genus than with definition.\n- **Step 1**: Define species and definition according to the text, highlighting their equivalence in extension and intension.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why species, when used as a predicate, is not equivalent to definition, even though they are identical in extension and intension.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why species shares more characteristics with genus than with definition, based on the text''s discussion of Euler''s circles and the nature of extensional relationships.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must directly reference the text''s analysis of predicables, Euler''s circles, and the distinction between genus and definition.

    Weight is a property of body, and body is a remote genus of man; but
    weight is not, in the narrow sense, a property of man, for it is not a term
    convertible with man. Yet it is predicated necessarily of man. In terms
    of Aristotle's analysis, a property or the differentia of a remote genus of
    the subject would be a part of the definition, in the broad sense that it
    is included in its intension, but not in the narrow sense of being the dif-
    ferentia of that subject, or a property of that subject, as differentia and
    property are defined. (Property, as defined, is, of course, not a part of
    definition in the narrow sense, because it is not a part of the essence, al-
    though it flows from the essence.) The same is true of the Scholastic in-
    terpretation of species as a predicable.

    Secondly, because the individual is a member of a species, one can
    predicate necessarily of an individual not only species but other neces-
    sary predicates which he has by virtue of his species. For example, John
    is necessarily a man, an animal, a rational animal, capable of mirth.

    Animal is a genus of man but not of John. Rational animal is the def-
    inition of a man but not of John, for an individual cannot be defined.
    Mirthfulness is a property of man but not of John, for it is not convert-
    ible with John.

    The predicables are, moreover, a classification of the predicates in af-
    firmative propositions only, for the predicate in a negative proposition,
    always wholly excluded from the subject, obviously cannot be related to
    the subject as its species, genus, differentia, definition, property, or acci-
    dent. Yet the predicate may be necessarily excluded from the subject.
    Some of the most important propositions in philosophy are necessary
    negative propositions. Two examples are: Contradictory judgments can-
    not both be true. A square is necessarily not a circle.

    Predicates can, of course, also be classified in the categories or
    praedicamenta. When the predicate is in the same category as the
    subject, it states the species or the genus of the subject with greater
    or less determinateness.

    EXAMPLES: Subject and predicate In the same categories of being

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Analysis of Property Classification**\n\nBased on the text, explain why the term ''weight'' is considered a property of ''man'' but not a property of the individual ''John''\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s distinction between ''property'' and ''differentia''\n- **Step 2**: Apply this to the example of ''weight'' as a property of ''man''\n- **Step 3**: Justify why ''weight'' is not a property of ''John''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must directly reference the text''s definitions of ''property'' and ''differentia'' and must demonstrate an understanding of how these concepts apply to both the genus and the individual.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Necessary Predicates**\n\nExplain why the statement ''A square is necessarily not a circle'' is a necessary negative proposition according to the text\n- **Step 1**: Identify the categories involved in the proposition\n- **Step 2**: Reference the text''s explanation of necessary negative propositions\n- **Step 3**: Use the example of ''weight'' to support your argument\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must incorporate the text''s discussion of necessary negative propositions and must clearly connect it to the example of ''weight'' as a necessary predicate of ''man'' but not of ''John''.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Predicables and Categories**\n\nUsing the text, explain how the predicate ''mirthfulness'' is classified as a property of ''man'' but not of ''John''\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s classification of predicables\n- **Step 2**: Apply this to the example of ''mirthfulness''\n- **Step 3**: Justify why ''mirthfulness'' is not a property of ''John''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of predicables and categories, and must demonstrate an understanding of how these concepts differentiate between the genus (man) and the individual (John).'

    Jonn is a man, an animal, an organism, a body, a substance.
    A square is a figure, a shape, a quality.
    Prudence is a habit, a virtue, a good, a quality.

    The categories are direct metaphysical universals, called terms of first
    intention because they classify our concepts of being or reality. The pred-
    icables are reflex logical universals, called terms of second intention,
    because they are wholly mental in that they classify the relations which
    the mind perceives between our concepts of reality.

    SENTENCES AND PROPOSITIONS

    Grammatical symbols are required to express propositions.

    Grammatical Symbols and Propositions
    If a proposition is symbolized by a sentence, it must be a declarative
    sentence. A nondeclarative sentence (a command or prayer or wish or
    question or exclamation) cannot symbolize a proposition, for it is nei-
    ther true nor false; it expresses volition, not cognition, and has there-
    fore no status in logic, although it has thoroughly sound status in
    grammar.

    Because every simple declarative sentence is made up either explic-
    itly or implicitly of subject, copula, and subjective complement, it can
    symbolize perfectly the logical proposition made up of subject, copula,
    and predicate. Consequently, every declarative sentence symbolizes a
    proposition or a number of propositions, whether the copula and sub-
    jective complement are explicit or not.

    A general proposition must be symbolized by a sentence whose sub-
    ject is a common name or a general description. If the common name
    or the general description does not symbolize an essence that is possi-
    ble, it does not express a term, for one cannot have a concept of an im-
    possible essence.

    A violation of this rule is: A square circle is a curvilinear figure.
    Propositions and Their Grammatical Expression

    This sentence does not symbolize a proposition because it does not
    express a relation of two terms; it has but one term. It takes a logical
    subject, for square circle expresses no meaning whatever, although
    square and circle understood separately are words that have meaning.
    This sentence is neither true nor false, for only a proposition is true
    or false.

    An empirical categorical proposition must be symbolized by a sentence whose subject is a proper name or an empirical description. If the proper name or the empirical description does not symbolize an individual or an aggregate existent at present or in the past, in fact or in fiction, it does not express a term because one cannot experience what is nonexistent.

    A violation of this rule is: Astronauts on Mars live in underground buildings. Because it does not express a relation of two terms, this sentence does not symbolize a proposition; therefore, it is neither true nor false.

    The following two empirical modal propositions, however, are true as possibilities: Astronauts may live on Mars, and they may live in underground buildings.

    The same proposition can be expressed by different but equivalent grammatical symbols in the same or in different languages.

    EXAMPLES: Same proposition with language differences

    The first President of the United States is farmed as a great general.

    Le premier président des Etats-Unis est renommé comme un grand général.

    Der erste Président der Vereinigten Staaten ist als ein grosser General berühmt.

    El primer presidente de los Estados Unidos es renombrado como un gran general.

    A sentence which symbolizes a proposition may be ambiguous. A proposition cannot be ambiguous because the meaning, the judgment, which the mind intends to express, must be one, that is, univocal. When the listener or reader obtains from and through language the identical proposition intended by the speaker or writer, he understands; they have "come to terms."

    The purpose of translation is to express in the symbols of other languages the propositions embodied in the symbols of a given language.

    The first man elected as executive head of the United States is noted for his skill as a military leader.

    Unless the propositional content of a scientific treatise obtainable in four different languages were univocal and common to all of them, there would be four treatises, not one. These books differ in language, that is, in the symbols used to embody one and the same logical content.

    When a given composition is compared with its translation in an-
    other language, we recognize that there is something the same (the
    form, the logical content) and something different (the matter, the
    grammatical symbols). If the composition is a poem, the something dif-
    ferent includes not only the difference of symbols but differences in the
    psychological dimension of language, its sensuous and emotional qual-
    ities such as sound, rhythm, tone, associated ideas and feelings, all hav-
    ing their roots in the particular language. To embody in different
    symbols only the logical content of a poem is to translate only a part of
    the complex whole that is the poem. Consequently, poetry is in its total
    effects practically untranslatable.

    Differences of style in expressing a given logical content in the same
    language are occasioned by a difference of choice between symbols log-
    ically, but not psychologically, equivalent—between words, phrases,
    and clauses that vary in rhythm, structure, and emotional connotation.
    To improve style through revision is to substitute better equivalent sym-
    bols for those first chosen. The master art of rhetoric guides one in this
    choice.

    Propositional Content and Grammatical Symbols
    Propositional content can be symbolized through a simple declarative
    sentence, a complex declarative sentence, a compound declarative sen-
    tence, or even, in rare circumstances, a nonsentence.

    SIMPLE DECLARATIVE SENTENCE
    A simple declarative sentence may symbolize one simple proposition,
    two or more simple propositions, or a disjunctive proposition.

    An example of a simple proposition is: That chair may be uncom-
    fortable.

    An example of two or more simple propositions is: This tall, hand-
    some boy is exceptionally intelligent. There are four propositions:

    This boy is tall.
    This boy is handsome.
    Propositions and Their Grammatical Expression

    This boy is intelligent
    His intelligence is exceptional.

    Examples of disjunctive propositions are: A rectangle is either a
    square or an oblong. Either Mary or John or James will be valedicto-
    rian. Here it should be noticed that a simple sentence may have a com-
    pound subject or a compound predicate.

    COMPLEX DECLARATIVE SENTENCE

    A complex declarative sentence may symbolize one simple proposi-
    tion, two or more simple propositions, a hypothetical proposition, or a
    syllogism.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Propositional Content and Grammatical Symbols**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''This tall, handsome boy is exceptionally intelligent.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the simple propositions represented in this sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Classify the sentence as a simple declarative sentence based on the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 3**: Explain why this sentence can symbolize two or more simple propositions, even though it is a single sentence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definitions of simple declarative sentences and disjunctive propositions to justify your reasoning.'

    An example of one simple proposition is: The yellow cat which was
    prowling around our garage yesterday was run over. The clause is de-
    finitive in function, for it points out a particular cat.

    An example of two or more simple propositions is: Tall, gaunt Abraham Lincoln, who was the first Republican to become President of the
    United States and who issued the Emancipation Proclamation, was as-
    sassinated. (Five propositions.) The clauses are attributive in function,
    for they state attributes of an individual already clearly designated by a
    proper name.

    Grammatical modification except by definitives is implicit logical
    predication. Hence if the modifier is not definitive in function, that is,
    if it is not necessary to the designation of the subject, it is an implicit
    predicate, and, in relation to the subject, it symbolizes another propo-
    sition; if it is definitive in function, it constitutes but one term with the
    subject and does not symbolize another proposition. For example: That
    tall man with brown eyes, brown hair, and a small mustache, standing
    near the microphone, is a Frenchman. (This symbolizes but one propo-
    sition, for the modifiers are definitive.) Charles de Gaulle, who is a tall
    Frenchman with brown eyes, brown hair, and a small mustache, was
    standing near the microphone. (This symbolizes seven propositions, for
    the modifiers are attributive in function.)

    An example of a hypothetical proposition is: If it does not rain this
    afternoon, we shall go to the woods.

    An example of a syllogism is: Eighteen is an even number because
    it is divisible by two. This sentence symbolizes three propositions in a
    syllogistic relation (to be explained in Chapter Seven):

    107
    108 The Trivium

    Eighteen is a number divisible by two.
    Every number divisible by two is an even number.

    Therefore eighteen is an even number.

    COMPOUND DECLARATIVE SENTENCE
    A compound declarative sentence may symbolize two or more simple
    propositions or a disjunctive proposition.

    An example of two or more simple propositions is: Wages are high,
    but so are prices.

    An example of a disjunctive proposition is: Either the train is late or
    we have missed it.

    Less than a sentence may sometimes symbolize a simple proposition,
    for example: Fire! This is equivalent to, and more idiomatic than, "Fire
    has broken out." To cry "Fire!" is to give an alarm that is either true or
    false. This proves that under such circumstances the word is understood
    as a proposition. "Fire!" meaning "Shoot!" is a command and does not
    symbolize a proposition.

    A declarative sentence which is grammatically complete but which
    violates the rules governing common names and general descriptions
    or proper names and empirical descriptions (see Chapter Two, Lan-
    guage and its Symbols) symbolizes no proposition, for it symbolizes
    fewer than two logical terms.

    6 RELATIONS OF SIMPLE
    PROPOSITIONS

    From the time of Aristotle, it has been recognized that both logic and
    rhetoric, as arts of composition, have in common invention and dispo-
    sition. Invention is the art of finding material for reasoning or discourse,
    and disposition is the art of properly relating or ordering the material.

    In logic, disposition includes definition, division, the framing of
    propositions, and the relating of them. In rhetoric, disposition is the
    proper ordering of the parts of a composition—its introduction, body,
    and conclusion—according to the principles of unity, coherence, and
    emphasis.

    Cicero simplified Aristotle's treatment of invention and distin-
    guished sixteen logical topics, collectively exhaustive, by which any
    subject may be amplified through analysis: definition, division (of a
    whole, either logical or physical, into its parts), genus, species, adjuncts
    (of a subject, including all the categories of accident: quantity, quality,
    relation, action, passion, when, where, posture, and habiliment), con-
    traries, contradictories, similarity, dissimilarity, comparison (greater,
    equal, less), cause, effect, antecedent, consequent, notation (the name),
    and conjugates (names derived from the same root, as just, justice,
    justly). A seventeenth topic, testimony, is external to the subject of in-
    quiry and includes all recourse to authority, such as laws, contracts, wit-
    nesses, proverbs, apothegms, oaths, pledges, prophecies, revelation.

    Note that the relation of subject to adjuncts is broader than that of a
    substance to the accidents which inhere in it because one accident,
    while itself inhering in a substance, may become the subject in which
    another accident inheres as its adjunct; for example, The man is walk-
    ing slowly. Here man is the subject in which the adjunct walking in-
    heres, while walking is at the same time the subject in which the
    adjunct slow inheres.

    The logical topics of invention are general. The rhetorical topics are

    THE RELATIONS OF PROPOSITIONS

    The relations of propositions are four: conjunction, opposition, educ-
    tion, and the syllogism.

    Conjunction
    Conjunction is the mere joining of two or more propositions.

    IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT CONJUNCTION
    The joining may be either explicit or implicit.

    Explicit: The telephone rang and John answered it (two propositions).

    Implicit: The large, sunlit lake is tranquil (three propositions).

    BARE OR MATERIAL CONJUNCTION
    The conjunction may be either a bare conjunction or a material con-
    junction. A bare conjunction violates the unity required by rhetoric for
    the sentence, the paragraph, and the whole composition, whereas ma-
    terial conjunction is the very basis of that unity. A bare conjunction
    joins propositions unrelated in thought. For example: The cherry trees
    are in bloom, and many students are enrolled in colleges and univer-
    sities.

    A material conjunction joins propositions that have a real or a logi-
    cal relation, such as that of parts to a whole, of place, time, cause, ef-
    fect, comparison, contrast, or any of the other topics mentioned above.

    1 A temporal relation, expressed by while, before, after, then, etc.

    The child slept after her mother had given her the medicine.
    The visitors had left before the telegram was delivered.

    2 Acausal relation, expressed by because, for, since, consequently,
    etc.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical and Rhetorical Topics**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, construct a rhetorical question that incorporates both a general logical topic and a specific rhetorical topic. For example, if the logical topic is ''cause and effect,'' the rhetorical question might be: ''Was the storm caused by the unusually warm temperatures, and was that a necessary outcome of the climate patterns?''\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify one logical topic from the text (e.g., time, place, person, or circumstance).\n- Choose one rhetorical topic from the list provided (e.g., ''was it possible,'' ''was it necessary'').\n- Create a rhetorical question that logically connects these two topics.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your question must clearly integrate both a logical and a rhetorical topic, as outlined in the text, and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct roles in composition.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Propositional Relations**\n\nThe text describes four relations between propositions: conjunction, opposition, education, and syllogism. Using the definitions provided, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference between explicit and implicit conjunction, providing an example of each that is not found in the text.\n- **Part B**: Differentiate between a bare conjunction and a material conjunction, using the example given in the text (e.g., ''The cherry trees are in bloom, and many students are enrolled in colleges and universities'') to illustrate the concept of logical relation.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the relation of ''causal'' (from the text''s acausal relation) can be used to construct a syllogism. Provide a three-part syllogism that demonstrates this relationship.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define each relation and apply the concepts to create a logical, coherent syllogism.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Integration of Logical and Rhetorical Structures**\n\nThe text distinguishes between the logical topics of invention (general) and the rhetorical topics (particularized by time, place, persons, and circumstances). Using this distinction, construct a paragraph that includes both a general logical topic and three specific rhetorical topics.\n\n**Task**:\n- Choose a general logical topic from the text (e.g., ''time,'' ''cause and effect'').\n- Select three specific rhetorical topics from the list provided (e.g., ''was it possible,'' ''was it necessary,'' ''was it profitable'').\n- Write a paragraph that weaves these elements together coherently.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must integrate the chosen logical and rhetorical topics seamlessly, demonstrating an understanding of how they function within composition.'

    3. An excellent example of development by effects, along with
    cause, is Dante's description of the gates of hell:

    Through me the way is to the city of woe;
    Through me the way unto eternal pain;
    Through me the way unto the lost below.

    Justice commoved my high Creator, when
    Made me Divine Omnipotence, combined
    With Primal Love and Wisdom Sovereign.

    Before me nothing was of any kind
    Except eterne, and I eterne abide;

    Leave, ye that enter in, all hope behind!
    —Inferno, III, 1-91

    4 This paragraph from Aristotle's Rhetoric is an outstanding illus-
    tration of development by division. It will be used again as an example
    in Chapter Eight.

    Every action of every person either is or is not due to that person him-
    self. Of those not due to himself some are due to chance, the others to
    necessity; of these latter, again, some are due to compulsion, the others to nature. Consequently all actions that are not due to a man himself
    are due either to chance or to nature or to compulsion. .. . Those things
    happen through compulsion which take place contrary to the desire or
    reason of the doer, yet through his own agency. . . . All actions that are
    due to a man himself and caused by himself are due either to habit or
    to rational or irrational craving. Rational craving is a craving for good,
    that is, a wish— nobody wishes for anything unless he thinks it is good.
    Irrational craving is twofold, namely, anger and appetite. Thus every ac-
    tion must be due to one or other of seven causes: chance, nature, com-
    pulsion, habit, reasoning, anger, or appetite.

- prompt: "RULES GOVERNING VALUE IN THE CONJUNCTION OF PROPOSITIONS  \nIn Chapter Five it was stated that every proposition must be either true  \nor false, whether it is asserted categorically as a matter of fact or modally  \nas a necessity or a possibility. Whatever is probable must, of course, be  \npossible. Sometimes, however, for practical purposes, it is desirable to  \ndistinguish three values: true, probable, and false. The rules of con-  \njunction deal with these three values.  \n\n  \n112  \n\nThe Trivium  \n\nRule 1. A conjunction of propositions is true only when every propo-  \nsition conjoined is true. Conversely, if each of the propositions con-  \njoined is true, their conjunction is true.  \n\nRule 2. A conjunction of propositions is false if any one of the propo-  \nsitions conjoined is false. Conversely, if at least one proposition is false,  \nthe conjunction is false.  \n\nRule 3. A conjunction of propositions is probable if at least one of  \nthe propositions conjoined is merely probable, and none is false. Con-  \nversely, if one proposition is probable and none is false, the conjunc-  \ntion is merely probable.  \n\nApplying these rules, we find that when only two propositions are  \nconjoined, there are nine possible combinations of value; if more  \npropositions are conjoined, the number of possible combinations of  \nvalue increases accordingly.  \n\nThese rules are summarized in the following table where X and Y  \neach symbolize a proposition; 1 symbolizes truth; 0, falsity; and .n,  \n\nprobability.  \n\nRule  \n\nIN WN UNE BO NO OND RO ONS  \n\nProp.

- prompt: |-
    Note that the final formula of Rule 3 shows a conjunction of propositions in which each proposition states a probable value. When two or more propositions are merely probable, their conjunction becomes less probable, which is indicated by the formula, .n x .n. For example, if a mutilated corpse has a triangular scar on the left shin, it may or may not be the body of a certain missing man, for a number of persons are likely to have that mark; but if it also has webbed toes and an x-shaped scar on the left shoulder from an operation, and if the missing man had these marks, it becomes less probable that the corpse is that of any person other than this missing man, for it is very improbable that these three peculiar marks should be conjoined in any other one person.

    PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF CONJUNCTION

    1 In a true-false test, the rules of conjunction must be applied. A statement is to be marked true only when every part of it is true; it is to be marked false when any part of it is false.

    2 In estimating the chances of a candidate to win both nomination and election, and in estimating the probability of guilt of a person accused of a crime, one may apply the principles of the conjunction of probabilities.

    3 Often one needs to distinguish clearly which part of a conjunction he accepts and which part he rejects. Many young people will agree with Perdita that true love persists through affliction.

    Camillo. Prosperity's the very bond of love,

    Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
    Affliction alters.

    Perdita. One of those is true,

    I think affliction may subdue the cheek,

    But not take in the mind.

    When King Cymbeline declares him a banished traitor, Belarius replies:

    Indeed a banished man;

    I know not how a traitor.

    4 Misunderstandings may result from ignoring the rules of conjunction. In a group, someone remarks that Jane is a beautiful, brilliant, honest girl. Jane's friend says she doesn't agree. (She doesn't think Jane is brilliant.) A busybody later tells Jane that her friend said she wasn't honest.

    5 In discussing politics, religion, and similar subjects with others, one should remember that the human mind is made for truth and instinctively seeks truth; that it often embraces error along with truth because it fails to distinguish the error that is mixed with the truth; that seldom does the mind embrace what is all error and no truth; and never does it embrace error except under the misapprehension that it is truth. Consequently, in discussion it is a good idea to focus on truths held in common and to point out the errors that are mixed with the truth. A person naturally resents having his convictions attacked as all wrong; he will be much more receptive to the ideas of one who first takes account of what truth he does hold before proceeding to point out errors.

    Opposition of Propositions

    OPPOSITION
    Propositions are in opposition when they have the same matter, that is, the same subject and the same predicate, but differ in form, that is, in quality, in quantity, or modality, or in two of these. Remember that quality refers to affirmative and negative; quantity, to total or partial; and modality, to necessary or contingent.

    The four relations of opposition exist between the A E I O forms of any given proposition. These forms may be either quantitative or modal.

    Quantitative Forms (Categorical)

    A All S is P. All tions are animals.

    E No S is P. No lions are animals.

    I Some S is P. Some tions are animals.

    O Some S is not P. Some lions are not animals.
    Modai Forms

    A S must be P. A lion must be an animal.

    E S cannot be P. A lion cannot be an animal.

    I S may be P. A lion may be an animal.

    O S may not be P. A lion may not be an animal.

    THE FOUR RELATIONS OF OPPOSITION AND THE RULES
    GOVERNING THEM

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Opposition in Propositions**\n\nConsider the following two propositions: \n\n1. All S is P. (A proposition)\n2. No S is P. (E proposition)\n\nUsing the definition of opposition provided in the text, explain the relationship between these two propositions.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the common subject and predicate.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the difference in form (quality or quantity).\n- **Step 3**: Apply the rule of opposition to describe how these propositions contradict each other.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definition of opposition and the rules governing the four relations of opposition.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Propositional Opposition**\n\nGiven the following two propositions: \n\n1. Some S is P. (I proposition)\n2. Some S is not P. (O proposition)\n\nUsing the text''s explanation of opposition, determine the relationship between these two propositions.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the subject and predicate.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the difference in form (quality, quantity, or modality).\n- **Step 3**: Apply the rule of opposition to explain how these propositions can coexist without contradiction.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the four relations of opposition and the specific rules governing the I and O forms.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Applying Opposition Rules to Real-World Scenarios**\n\nConsider the scenario described in the text where a friend expresses disagreement with a statement about Jane, and a busybody misrepresents that disagreement. Use the concepts of opposition and logical reasoning from the text to analyze the situation.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the friend''s disagreement (not agreeing that Jane is brilliant) relates to the opposition between propositions.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the busybody''s misrepresentation (saying the friend said Jane wasn''t honest) in terms of logical fallacy and how it might relate to the text''s discussion of truth and error in discussion.\n- **Part C**: Propose a method for resolving the misunderstanding based on the text''s advice about focusing on shared truths and addressing errors.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of opposition, truth, and logical reasoning from the text to provide a coherent analysis of the scenario.'

- prompt: "1 The contradictories are A and O as well as E and I. Two propositions are opposed as contradictories if they differ both in quality and  \nin either quantity or modality. There is no middle ground between contradictory propositions (just as there is no middle ground between  \ncontradictory terms, for example, white and nonwhite). Contradictory propositions represent a clean-cut difference.\n\nRule I. Of contradictory propositions, one must be true and the  \nother must be false.\n\n2 The contraries are A and E. Two propositions are opposed as  \ncontraries if they differ in quality and if both are either total in quantity  \nor necessary in modality. There is a middle ground between contrary  \npropositions (just as there is a middle ground between contrary terms,  \nfor example, white and black). Contrary propositions represent the  \ngreatest degree of difference.\n\nRule 2. Of contrary propositions, both cannot be true, but both may  \nbe false. Hence, if one is known to be true, the other must be false; but  \nif one is known to be false, the value of the other is unknown.\n\nThe fallacy which most frequently occurs in opposition is the as-  \nsumption that if one contrary is false the other is true (instead of un-  \nknown).\n\nNote that the truth or falsity of a proposition involved in a formal re-  \nlation is said to be unknown if its value cannot be known from the form  \nalone but is determined by the matter, that is, if it must be learned from  \na knowledge of its terms.\n\nANALOGY: Comparison of form and matter\n\nStandard measures may be regarded as empty forms. For example, two pints equal one quart. Four  \nquarts equal one gallon. The truth or falsity of these statements can be known from the forms alone  \nwithout a knowledge of what these measures contain.\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Contradictory and Contrary Propositions**\n\nGiven the definitions of contradictory and contrary propositions from the text, analyze the following scenarios:\n- **Scenario 1**: Consider the propositions ''All dogs are mammals'' (A) and ''Not all dogs are mammals'' (O). Determine if these are contradictories, and explain why. Apply Rule I to evaluate the logical relationship between them.\n- **Scenario 2**: Analyze the propositions ''All birds are animals'' (A) and ''Some birds are not animals'' (O). Determine if these are contradictories or contraries, and explain your reasoning. Apply Rule 2 to assess their logical relationship.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between contradictories and contraries, apply the given rules, and demonstrate an understanding of the implications of each type of opposition on logical reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Formal Relations and Fallacies**\n\nEvaluate the following argument and identify any fallacies related to opposition:\n\nArgument: ''If it is not true that all humans are mortal, then it must be true that some humans are not mortal.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the propositions involved and determine their logical relationship (contradictory or contrary).\n- **Step 2**: Apply the appropriate rule (Rule I or Rule 2) to assess the validity of the argument.\n- **Step 3**: Explain why the argument may contain a fallacy, referencing the note about the value of propositions being unknown if determined by matter.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must connect the argument to the concepts of opposition, identify the fallacy, and explain its relevance to the distinction between form and matter.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Formal Relations**\n\nConstruct a logical scenario that illustrates the difference between contradictory and contrary propositions using the analogy of ''empty forms'' from the text:\n- **Part A**: Define two propositions that are contradictories. Explain how they differ in quality and quantity/modality, and apply Rule I to their relationship.\n- **Part B**: Define two propositions that are contraries. Explain how they differ in quality and quantity/modality, and apply Rule 2 to their relationship.\n- **Part C**: Use the analogy of ''empty forms'' (e.g., measures like pints and quarts) to explain how the truth or falsity of propositions can be determined from form alone, without knowledge of the matter.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must clearly demonstrate the distinction between contradictories and contraries, incorporate the analogy of empty forms, and show how logical relationships are determined by form rather than matter.'

- prompt: |-
    These forms may, however, contain various kinds of matter, such as milk, water, mercury, wine, nitric acid, maple syrup. About these one may make various statements. Some examples are: A quart is healthful. A galton is sickening. A pint is poisonous. A half-pint is not intoxicating. The truth or falsity of these statements cannot be known from the forms alone but is determined by the matter, that is, by the content of these forms. A pint of milk is not poisonous. A pint of nitric acid is poisonous.

    3 The subcontraries are I and O. Two propositions are opposed as subcontraries if they differ in quality and if both are either partial in quantity or contingent in modality.

    Rule 3. Of subcontrary propositions, both cannot be false, but both may be true. Hence, if one is known to be false, the other must be true; but if one is known to be true, the value of the other is unknown.

    4 The subalterns are A and I as well as E and O. A proposition is subaltern to another if it has the same quality but differs from it either in being partial instead of total or in being contingent instead of necessary.

    Strictly speaking, subalterns are not opposed, for they do not differ in quality. Traditionally, this relation has, however, been treated with opposition, for it is present among the A EI O forms of a given proposition.'

    The normal relation of subject and predicate in an I proposition was stated in Chapter Five as that of partial inclusion of the subject in the predicate, and that of an O proposition as the exclusion of part of S from P. Both I and O propositions were represented by overlapping Euler's circles; I and O differ in the parts of the circles shaded, indicating the different parts of the subject being talked about.

    In the opposition of propositions, however, I and O propositions are to be understood as including the following (the parts talked about are shaded):
    If it is true that all S is P, it must be true that some S is P. All lions are animals. Some lions are animals. (Both are true.)

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Analysis of Subcontrary Propositions**\n\nGiven the definition of subcontrary propositions (I and O propositions that differ in quality), analyze the following pair of propositions:\n\n1. "All milk is healthful."\n2. "Some milk is unhealthful."\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify whether these propositions are subcontraries based on the text''s definition.\n- **Step 2**: Apply Rule 3 to determine the truth value of the pair.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how subcontrary propositions can both be true.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must reference the text''s definitions and rules, and demonstrate understanding of how subcontrary propositions interact logically.'

    If it is true that no S is P, it must be true that some

    Cp (>) of that S is not P. No lions are elephants. Some lions
    are not elephants. (Both are true.)

    Rule 4. Of subalterns, if the total (or necessary) proposition is true,

    the partial (or contingent) must be true; but if the former is known to

    be false, the value of the latter is unknown. Conversely, if the partial (or

    contingent) proposition is false, the total (or necessary) must be false;
    but if the former is known to be true, the value of the latter is unknown.

    In categorical forms, the opposition of singular empirical proposi-
    tions is restricted to contradiction, and this relation is achieved through
    a difference of quality alone, for example: Mary is tall. Mary is not tall.

    A Mary is tall.
    E Mary is not tall.

    In modal forms, the opposition of singular empirical propositions
    includes all four relations.

    A Mary must be courteous.
    E Mary cannot be courteous.
    I Mary may be courteous.
    O Mary may not be courteous.

    THE SQUARE OF OPPOSITION
    The four relations of opposition are graphically represented by the
    square of opposition. The lines represent the four relations as num-

    bered:

    A 2 E 1 Contradictories: A and O; E and I.
    4 11 a 2 Contraries: A and E.

    3. Subcontraries: [ and O.
    | 3 ° 4 Subalterns: A and IJ; E and O.

    To use a familiar analogy, on this square of opposition, the lines be-
    tween contradictories, AO and EI, represent the only "two-way streets";
    for if A is true, O is false, and if O is false, A is true; or if A is false, O is
    true, and if O is true, A is false; the same holds for the relations of E
    and I. But all the other lines represent only "one-way streets": AE, IO,
    Al, EO; thus, if A is true, E is false, but if E is given false, the value of
    A is unknown.

    When one form is given as either true or false, one can arrive at the
    value of the other three forms by applying only two of the rules of op-
    position, namely, that of contradictories and that of contraries.

    Given A is true, then O is false, for of contradictories, one must be
    true and the other must be false (Rule 1); E is false, for of contraries
    both cannot be true (Rule 2); I is true, for it is the contradictory of E,
    which we have just shown must be false (Rule 1). (We can, of course,
    also know that I is true by applying Rule 4.)

    Given A is false, then: O is true (Rule 1); E is unknown, for of
    contraries both may be false; I is also unknown, for it is the contrary
    of E, and if the truth or falsity of one were known, that of the other
    could be known from it. (Also according to Rule 4, if A is false, I is
    unknown; that is, it may be either true or false, depending on the
    terms related.)

    In both the following sets of propositions, A is false; but in the one
    set E is false and I is true, whereas in the other set E is true and I is false.
    The possibility of having such contrasting results demonstrates that
    118 = The Triviurn

    when A is false, the truth or falsity of E and I is determined by the mat-
    ter, not by the form, for different matter involved in the same formal re-
    lation yields different results. Remember that 1 symbolizes truth and 0
    symbolizes falsity.

    Sometimes a sentence which seems to symbolize but one proposition actually symbolizes a conjunction or two or more propositions. Such a conjunction must be resolved into its constituent simple propositions before it can be expressed in A E I O forms. A conjunction is:
    All the crew save one were drowned. Its simplification is: One of the crew was not drowned. The rest of the crew were drowned.

    THE NATURE OF A FORMAL RELATION
    Since opposition is the first formal relation we have studied, and since logic is concerned chiefly with formal relations, it will be profitable to
    consider here the essential difference between a formal relation, such
    as opposition, and a material relation, such as conjunction.

    1 Unlike a conjunction of propositions, which is either true or
    false or probable, a formal relation of propositions, such as opposition,
    is neither true nor false nor probable; it is either formally correct or for-
    mally incorrect.

- prompt: |-
    2 The basic distinction between a material and a formal relation
    of propositions is this: The truth or falsity of a conjunction of proposi-
    tions depends upon the truth or falsity of each of the propositions con-
    joined, and the value of each must be ascertained independently by
    reference to the facts; but the truth or falsity of propositions formally re-
    lated is interdependent, and if the value of one proposition is known,
    the value of the others can be ascertained therefrom by applying the
    rules of the formal relation, without a knowledge of the terms related or
    any knowledge of the facts, that is, without any material knowledge at
    all. Thus the formal correctness of the opposition of the contradictory
    propositions A and O does not determine whether A is true or false or
    whether O is true or false. But it does determine that if A is true, O must
    be false, and that if A is false, O must be true; likewise that if O is true,
    A must be false, and that if O is false, A must be true.

    3 A material relation holds between any propositions, regardless of
    their forms, whereas a formal relation holds only between propositions
    having certain forms.

    4 A formal relation is really a relation of propositional forms, a for-
    mula. It holds regardless of what matter, what terms, are substituted for
    the symbols of the formula.

    ANALOGY: Opposition to algebra and conjunction to arithmetic

    A relation of propositional forms, such as opposition, is analogous to an algebraic formula. The reta-
    tions are correct, regardless of what matter, what numbers are substituted for the symbols of the
    formula.

    (X + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2

    C = mR

    In contrast, a material relation of propositions, such as coniunction, is analogous to an arithmetical
    equation; the truth or falsity of every such equation must be checked independently with the facts
    and is determined altogether by the matter, not at all by a form, for such an equation is not a
    formula.

    or the syllogism, operates as a rule of assertion thus: If a given proposition having a certain form has a given value, then another proposition related to it by a correct formula must have the value required by the formula.

    Reduction

    Eduction is the formal process of making explicit all that is implicit in a given proposition. Hence it is not an advance in knowledge. In this it differs radically from deduction, of which the syllogism is the form, for through the syllogism the mind advances to new knowledge. Through eduction we turn a proposition, as it were, inside out and upside down until we have explored all its content.

    In the following bit of doggerel, an anonymous parodist has ex-
    pressed a very simple idea with an explicit thoroughness analogous to
    that of eduction.

    Hiawatha's Mittens

    He killed the noble Mudjokivis.

    Of the skin he made him mittens,
    Made them with the fur side inside,
    Made them with the skin side outside.
    He, to keep the warm side inside,
    Put the inside skin outside;

    He, to get the cold side outside,

    Put the warm side fur side inside.
    That's why he put the fur side inside,
    Why he put the skin side outside,
    Why he turned them inside outside.

    Eduction is a formal process which never involves a change of value.
    Provided that the eductions are correctly made, if the original proposition is true, the eductions must be logically equivalent; if the original proposition is false, the eductions must be false.

    Eduction employs two processes, obversion and conversion. By applying these two processes alternately, seven eductive forms (their names appear below where they are derived) may be obtained from
    Relations of Simple Propositions

    a general or a total proposition, fewer from a partial or a contingent
    one.

    OBVERSION
    Obversion turns a proposition around by changing the quality and the
    predicate but not the meaning.

    Rules for obverting a proposition:
    1 Change the quality (determined by the copula).

    2 Substitute for the predicate (P) its contradictory (P').

- prompt: |-
    To avoid illicit obversion: Do not confuse a contradictory modifier
    of a term with the full contradictory term. Contradictory terms are al-
    ways dichotomous; they divide all being, not merely a genus. For ex-
    ample, the contradictory of starchy food is not nonstarchy food; it is
    nonstarchy-food. Pencils and doorknobs and stars are nonstarchy-food;
    they are not nonstarchy food, for they are not food at all.4

    Obversion of AE I O forms. Each of these can be obverted. In the
    following formula, P' symbolizes non-P.

    S a P is obverted to S e P'. All voters are citizens. No voters are
    noncitizens.

    S e P is obverted to Sa P'. No Mohammedans are Christians.
    All Mohammedans are non-Chris-

    tians.

    S i P is obverted to S o P'. Some chairs are comfortable. Some
    chairs are not uncomfortable.

    So P is obverted to Si P'. Some pupils are not attentive. Some

    pupils are inattentive.

    A principle of obversion is: If S is included in P, it is certainly ex-
    cluded from non-P. Obversion is an application of the Law of Excluded
    Middle: Between contradictories there is no middle ground.

    PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF OBVERSION

    The rhetorical figure named litotes, used extensively in Old English
    literature and still used widely in modern English and in other liter-
    atures, is an application of obversion. It has an important effect on
    tone.

    Not every proposition can be converted. S a P is regularly converted by
    limitation (that is, by loss of total quantity or of necessary modality) to
    Pi S in order to avoid an illicit process. An example is: All lions are an-
    imals. Some animals are lions. P a S cannot ordinarily be correctly de-
    rived from S a P, for to attempt this involves an illicit process of P.

    d u In this original proposition, P is undistributed (u),
    N) P for it is the predicate of an affirmative proposition.
    In this illicit converse, P is distributed (d), for it
    u has become the subject of a total (or a necessary)
    PaS&S proposition. The line drawn from u to d indicates

    the illicit process.

    Sa P is correctly converted to P a S when P is known to be either
    the definition or the property of S, for then P is distributed through the
    matter, not through the form. It is the test of definition and of property
    that these predicates be convertible with the subject.

    EXAMPLES: Correct conversions of $ a P

    Definition: Man is a rational animal. A rational animal is a man.
    Property: Man is mirthful. A mirthful being is a man.

    S e P is converted simply to Pe S, for since an E proposition distributes
    both S and P, an illicit process cannot occur when the terms are trans-

    phants are lions.

    S i P is converted simply to P i S, for since an I proposition distrib-
    utes neither S nor P, an illicit process cannot occur when the terms are
    transposed in converting the proposition. Some roses are red. Some red
    things are roses.

    So P cannot be converted at all, for to convert it simply would in-
    volve an illicit process of S. In the original proposition, S is undistrib-
    uted, for it is the subject of a partial (or a contingent) proposition. In an
    illicit converse, S is distributed, for it has become the predicate of a neg-
    ative proposition. It cannot be converted by limitation (as in the case of
    S a P), for S o P is already partial in quantity (or contingent in modal-
    ity). Since conversion never involves a change in quality, there is no
    possible way validly to convert O. It is a fact that often S o P remains
    true when converted to P o S, but the process is, nevertheless, always
    formally invalid.

    EXAMPLES: Invalid conversion of S o P

    Some roses are not red. Some red things are not roses.

    Here roses is distributed in the converse and is undistributed in the original proposition. Therefore,
    the conversion involves an illicit process of S. That both these propositions are materially true is
    merely an accident of the matter. Their truth cannot be guaranteed through the formal process;
    hence the process itself is always invalid, regardless of whether the proposition derived from a true
    So Pis materially true or false.

    In the following examples the converse proposition is both materially false and formaily invalid.
    Categorical: Some animals are not lions. Some lions are not animals.
    Modal: An animal may not be a lion. A lion may not be an animal.

    THE EDUCTIVE FORMS

    Seven eductive forms can be derived from S a P and from S e P, and
    three from S i P and from S o P, by alternately and successively apply-
    ing the two eductive processes, obversion and conversion; whenever,
    because of having had to convert S a P by limitation to S i P, one ar-
    tives at S o P to be converted, one can go no further but must return to
    the original proposition, applying to it the process alternate to that first
    applied. In these eductions all implications of a given proposition are
    made explicit. In the following table the word contrapositive refers to
    the proposition that results when the quality of a proposition is changed

    The formula is S is P; therefore Sa is Pa. The principle of the formula is: An added determinant decreases the extension of a term and increases its intension. This process of eduction is valid if the added determinant affects S and P to the same degree and in the same respect. The eduction is invalid if it does not modify them to the same degree or in the same respect.

    EXAMPLES: Determinant not affecting terms to the same degree

    Original: Kings are men.
    Invalid: A majority of kings is a majority of men.

    Original: An ant is an animal.
    Invalid: A large ant is a large animal.
    Valid: A small ant is a small animal.

    EXAMPLES: Determinant not affecting terms in the same respect

    Original: A contralto is a woman.
    Invalid: A low contralto is a low woman.
    Valid: A blonde contralto is a blonde woman.

    2 Eduction by omitted determinants

    The formula is S is Pa; therefore S is P. The principle of the formula
    is: A subject that is included in a more determined (less extended) pred-
    icate is necessarily included in that predicate when it is less determined
    (more extended). This principle is especially evident when the two
    predicates are related to the subject as species and genus or as proximate
    and remote genera. Examples include: Socrates is a rational animal;
    therefore Socrates is an animal. A rattlesnake is a poisonous reptile;
    therefore a rattlesnake is a reptile.

    Mere grammatical likeness (of words) must not be mistaken for true
    logical likeness (of terms). The following example may seem to disprove
    the principle stated above, but the difficulty is only verbal. Original:
    The pauper is a pretended prince. Invalid inference: The pauper is a
    prince. Only verbally do these sentences appear to exemplify the for-
    mula S is Pa; therefore S is P. Pretended prince does not express the log-
    ical term prince plus a determinant decreasing its extension; it expresses
    an altogether different term which is equivalent to impostor, a term
    which is incompatible with prince and excluded from it, certainly not
    included in it.

    The formula is S$ r! P; therefore P r2 S. (Here r! and 12 symbolize copulas with correlative modifiers, not simple copulas.) The principle of the formula is: Because relative terms necessarily imply their correlatives, the subject and predicate of a proposition with a relative copula may be transposed if the relative copula is supplanted by its correlative. Action and passion as well as genus and species are correlatives. It is also correct with propositions stating quantitative relations to draw inferences by converse relation. Hence the change from the active to the passive verb form symbolizes eduction by converse relation.

    EXAMPLES: Correlatives

    Original: Aristotle taught (or was the teacher of) Alexander the Great.
    Valid Inference: Alexander the Great was taught by (or was the pupil of) Aristotle.

    Valid Inference: The sand dunes were seen by Mary.

    Original: Lily is a species of flower.

    The Syllogism
    This is the most important of the four relations of propositions, for it is the characteristic form of reasoning. According to the kind of propositions syllogistically related, we distinguish four types of syllogism: the simple (usually categorical) syllogism, the hypothetical syllogism, the disjunctive syllogism, the dilemma. These types of syllogism will be studied in succeeding chapters.

    SUMMARY OF THE RELATIONS OF PROPOSITIONS

    There are four relations: conjunction, opposition, eduction, the syllogism. Conjunction is a material relation; the others are formal relations. A formal relation is a process of either mediate or immediate inference.

    Relations of Simple Propositions 129

    1 Immediate inference involves only two propositions; it proceeds directly from one to the other without the mediating function of a third term or of a third proposition. There are three processes of immediate inference: opposition, obversion, and conversion. Eduction is a common name given to the two processes of obversion and conversion.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Inference with Correlatives**\n\nGiven the statement: "A is greater than B," use the principle from the text to draw a valid inference.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the correlatives involved in the proposition.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the principle that "Because relative terms necessarily imply their correlatives, the subject and predicate of a proposition with a relative copula may be transposed if the relative copula is supplanted by its correlative."\n- **Step 3**: Justify the inference using the example format provided in the text (e.g., "Original: ...; Valid Inference: ...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your inference must be logically correct and directly derived from the text''s principle, with clear identification of the correlatives and the process used.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Syllogistic Reasoning and Proposition Types**\n\nConstruct a syllogism that demonstrates the relationship between the categories of propositions, using the text''s definitions of simple, hypothetical, disjunctive, and dilemma syllogisms.\n- **Step 1**: Choose one type of syllogism (e.g., simple, hypothetical, disjunctive) and define it based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Create a valid syllogism using the chosen type, ensuring that it adheres to the logical structure described in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the syllogism illustrates the principle that "the syllogism is the most important of the four relations of propositions, for it is the characteristic form of reasoning."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogism must be correctly structured and clearly demonstrate the logical relationships between the propositions, with a detailed explanation of its relevance to the text''s main argument.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Formal Relations and Immediate Inference**\n\nUsing the text''s distinction between immediate inference (opposition, obversion, conversion) and eduction, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference between immediate inference and eduction, as defined in the text.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a valid immediate inference using opposition, and another example using conversion.\n- **Part C**: Analyze the statement: "All S are P." Apply obversion to this proposition and explain the resulting proposition''s relationship to the original.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the processes of immediate inference and eduction, with accurate examples and a detailed explanation of how obversion operates within the framework of formal relations.'

    2 Mediate inference involves three terms in three propositions.
    Two terms, S and P, are related to each other by virtue of the relation
    of each to a third term M, which is the medium for relating them. The
    function of the third term, which is the middle term (M), will be fully
    explained in Chapter Seven.

    ANALOGY: Relation of propositions

    Two rods can be related to each other in length by virtue of the relation of each to a yardstick, which
    serves as a medium between them.

    4 THE SIMPLE SYLLOGISM

    THE SYLLOGISM

    Definition

    A bat is a mammal.
    No bird is a mammal.
    -. A bat is not a bird.

    130

    The syllogism is the act of reasoning by which the mind perceives that
    from the relation of two propositions (called premises) having one term
    in common there necessarily emerges a new, third proposition (called
    the conclusion) in which the common term, called the middle term

    (M), does not appear.

    EXAMPLE: The syllogism

    Since all bats are included in mammals and all mammals are ex-
    cluded from birds, all bats must be excluded from birds. It is by virtue
    of the relation of each of the terms bat and bird to the mediating term
    mammal, common to both premises, that their relation to each other is
    understood and expressed in the conclusion as one of total exclusion
    from each other.

    A premise is a proposition so related to another proposition by means
    of a common term that from their conjunction a new proposition, the
    conclusion, necessarily follows.

    The syllogism is a formal relation of three terms in three proposi-
    tions. Each term occurs twice: the middle term in each premise; each
    of the other terms, in one premise and in the conclusion. Every prem-
    ise is a proposition, but not every proposition is a premise. A proposi-
    tion becomes a premise by being joined to another proposition which
    has one term in common with it; the rules governing the valid con-
    junction of premises are stated below. The conclusion, a new truth, is
    implicit in the conjunction of the premises; it is not implicit in either

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Syllogistic Structure to Analogies**\n\nThe text compares a syllogism to two rods related by length through a yardstick. Apply this analogy to explain how the syllogism ''All bats are mammals; no mammals are birds; therefore, no bats are birds'' works.\n- **Part A**: Identify the roles of the ''rods'' (bat and bird) and the ''yardstick'' (mammal) in the syllogism.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the analogy illustrates the function of the middle term in connecting the premises.\n- **Part C**: Use the analogy to describe how the syllogism''s conclusion is derived from the premises.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly link the analogy to the syllogistic structure and demonstrate understanding of the middle term''s function.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Mediate Inference**\n\nThe text defines mediate inference as involving three terms in three propositions. Construct a mediate inference to conclude that ''No cats are birds.''\n- **Step 1**: Choose two premises that share a common term (the middle term).\n- **Step 2**: Ensure that the conclusion logically follows from the premises through the middle term.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the inference is valid based on the text''s explanation of mediate inference.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your inference must include three propositions, with the middle term appearing in both premises and the conclusion must not include the middle term.

    One of them alone. Hence the syllogism results in an advance in knowledge achieved by the conjunction of the premises.

    ANALOGY: A new truth through the syllogism

    Every wife is a woman, but not every woman is a wife. A woman becomes a wife by being joined to a husband through a bond of mutual love. The child, a new being, owes its existence to both parents, not to one alone.

    The syllogism is the very formula of reasoning. It is a relation of propositional forms. The syllogism itself is neither true nor false; it is valid or invalid. In a valid syllogism the truth or falsity of its propositions is interdependent and can be ascertained from the formula. An invalid syllogism is one whose conclusion does not follow from its premises.

    Matter and Form of the Syllogism

    1 The matter of the syllogism consists of its three propositions relating its three terms (minor, major, middle). To analyze a syllogism, we must begin with the conclusion because the placement of terms in the conclusion determines how those terms function in the first two propositions of the syllogism. S, the minor term of a syllogism, is the subject of the conclusion. P, the major term, is the predicate of the conclusion. The conclusion is always symbolized S___P (with a, e, i, or o inserted in the space left blank).

    "A bat is not a bird." Bat is the subject of the conclusion and the minor term. Bird is the predicate of the conclusion and the major term. They would be marked thus:

    S P
    A bat is not a bird.

    The minor premise is one which contains the minor term S and the middle term M. M is the term present in both premises but not in the conclusion. "A bat is a mammal" is the minor premise of the sample syllogism. Bat is the minor term, and mammal is the middle term. This premise would be marked thus:

    N) M

    A bat is a mammal.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Syllogistic Reasoning**\n\nConstruct a valid syllogism that concludes with the statement: "A whale is not a fish."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the major term (P), minor term (S), and middle term (M) in the conclusion.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the correct figure and mood for the syllogism.\n- **Step 3**: Write the three propositions (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) such that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n- **Step 4**: Justify the validity of your syllogism by applying the rules of syllogistic logic (e.g., the middle term must be distributed at least once, the conclusion cannot be more general than the premises, etc.).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogism must be logically valid, and you must explicitly state the rules of syllogistic logic that support its validity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Syllogistic Structure**\n\nConsider the syllogism: "All S are M. All M are P. Therefore, all S are P."\n- **Part A**: Identify the figure and mood of this syllogism.\n- **Part B**: Explain why this syllogism is valid based on the rules of syllogistic logic.\n- **Part C**: Create a counterexample to demonstrate an invalid syllogism with the same structure. Explain why your counterexample is invalid.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of syllogistic logic, including the rules of figures and moods, and the difference between valid and invalid syllogisms.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Syllogistic Reasoning to Analogical Arguments**\n\nThe text describes an analogy that compares a child''s existence to the union of two parents. Construct an analogy using the syllogistic form to explain how a new truth can be derived from premises.\n- **Step 1**: Define the analogy by identifying the major term (P), minor term (S), and middle term (M).\n- **Step 2**: Write the three propositions (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) that form the syllogism.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this syllogism aligns with the text''s definition of an analogy as a new truth through the syllogism.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analogy must be logically valid, and you must explicitly connect it to the text''s explanation of syllogistic reasoning as a means of discovering new truths.'

- prompt: |-
    The major premise is one which contains the major term P and the middle term M. "No bird is a mammal" is the major premise of the syllogism. Bird is the major term, and mammal is the middle term. This premise would be marked thus:

    P M

    No bird is a mammal.

    2 The form of the syllogism is the logical necessity with which the conclusion follows from the premises by virtue of their valid relation, which is achieved by a combination of figure and mood (explained below).

    Dictum de Omni et Nullo: Principle of Syllogistic Reasoning

    Whatever is affirmed of a logical whole must be affirmed of the parts of that whole; whatever is denied of a logical whole must be denied of the parts of that whole.

    This means that if P is affirmed of M, it must be affirmed of S, which is a part of M; if P is denied of M, it must be denied of S, which is a part of M (or, less frequently, if P is affirmed of M and M is denied of S, P must be denied of S). In the example, bird, the major term, is denied of mammal, the middle term, and thus is denied of bat, which is included in mammal.

    Another way of stating the relation is this: If S is included in M, and M is included in P, S must be included in P; if S is included in M, and M is excluded from P, or if S is excluded from M, and M is included in P, S must be excluded from P. These relations can be made clearer by means of Euler's circles.

    Hence the function of the middle term, the logical whole, is, as it were, to draw the meaning out of the major term and transmit it to the minor. It is a mediating term which, having served in the premises as a means of comparison, is dropped from the conclusion.

    Rules of the Syllogism and Formal Fallacies

    The following rules govern the syllogism.

    Rule 1. A syllogism must contain three and only three terms. The fallacy that results from violating this rule is four terms.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Syllogism Structure Analysis**\n\nGiven the syllogism: "No bird is a mammal. All bats are mammals. Therefore, no bat is a bird."\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify the major term, minor term, and middle term in this syllogism.\n- Determine the figure and mood of the syllogism.\n- Explain how the Dictum de Omni et Nullo applies to this syllogism, using the example of bats.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define each term and demonstrate understanding of the logical structure of the syllogism.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Euler''s Circles and Logical Relations**\n\nUsing the principles of the Dictum de Omni et Nullo and Euler''s circles, analyze the following syllogism: "All dogs are mammals. All mammals are animals. Therefore, all dogs are animals."\n\n**Task**:\n- Illustrate this syllogism using Euler''s circles.\n- Explain how the middle term functions in this syllogism.\n- Identify the logical necessity of the conclusion based on the premises.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of how the syllogism''s structure ensures the conclusion follows logically.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Syllogism Fallacy Identification**\n\nConsider the following syllogism: "All birds are animals. All animals are living things. Therefore, all birds are living things."\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify the major term, minor term, and middle term.\n- Determine the figure and mood of the syllogism.\n- Explain why this syllogism is valid or invalid, and whether it commits the fallacy of four terms.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly show whether the syllogism is valid and explain the reasoning behind your conclusion.'

- prompt: |-
    Rule 2. A syllogism must contain three and only three propositions.
    The fallacy that results from violating this rule is four propositions.

    The Simple Syllogism

    Rule 3. The middle term must be distributed in at least one of the
    premises (because it must serve as the logical whole on which the prin-
    ciple of syllogistic reasoning is based). The fallacy that results from vio-
    lating this rule is undistributed middle term.

    Rule 4. No term may be distributed in the conclusion which was
    undistributed in its own premise. The fallacy that results from violating
    this rule is illicit process of the major term or of the minor term. Note that
    a term that is distributed in its premise may, however, be undistributed in
    the conclusion, for it is not an illicit process to take out of something less
    than there is in it. There cannot be an illicit process of the middle term,
    for the two premises are independent. One premise is not derived from
    the other as the conclusion is derived from the two premises.

    Rule 5. From two negative premises no conclusion can be drawn.
    One cannot infer a relation between two given terms unless at least one
    of them is related to a common, third term; this is the very principle on
    which syllogistic reasoning is based. The fallacy that results from vio-
    lating this rule is two negative premises.

    Rule 6. If one premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative.
    Conversely, in order to prove a negative conclusion, one premise must
    be negative. If one term is included in the middle term, and the other
    is excluded from it, the two terms in the conclusion must accordingly
    be excluded from each other. The fallacy that results from violating this
    rule is a negative conclusion without a negative premise.

    Rule 7. From two partial or singular (or contingent) premises, no con-
    clusion can be drawn. (This is a corollary of Rules 3, 5, and 6.) The fallacy
    that results from violating this rule is two partial (or contingent) premises.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Syllogism Construction and Fallacy Analysis**\n\nConstruct a valid syllogism using three propositions, ensuring that all syllogistic rules are followed. Then, identify and explain the fallacy that would result from violating **Rule 2** (four propositions in a syllogism).\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Create a syllogism with three distinct propositions that is logically valid.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a syllogism that violates **Rule 2** and explain why it is a fallacy.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogism must adhere to all seven rules, and your explanation of the fallacy must reference the specific rule and its consequence.'

If it is invalid, identify which rule has been violated and explain why.\n\n**Syllogism**:\n\n1. All mammals are animals.\n2. All dogs are mammals.\n3. All dogs are animals.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Determine the middle term and check if it is distributed in at least one premise.\n- **Part B**: Analyze whether the conclusion distributes the major or minor term improperly.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must directly reference the specific rules (e.g., "Rule 3 is violated because...") and explain the logical flaw in the syllogism.'

If it is invalid, identify which rule has been violated and explain why.\n\n**Syllogism**:\n\n1. No cats are birds.\n2. No dogs are cats.\n3. No dogs are birds.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Check if the syllogism violates **Rule 5** (two negative premises).\n- **Part B**: Explain how the conclusion follows logically from the premises, or why it does not, based on syllogistic principles.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the rules and demonstrate a clear understanding of how syllogistic reasoning operates.'

- prompt: |-
    Rule 8. If one premise is partial, the conclusion must be partial.
    (This is a corollary of Rules 3 and 4.) The fallacy that results from
    violating this rule is a general conclusion in a syllogism with one or
    more partial premises.

    Rule 9. If one premise is contingent, the conclusion must be con-
    tingent. In order to prove a necessary conclusion, both premises must
    be necessary in modality. The fallacy that results from violating this rule
    is a necessary or categorical conclusion with a contingent premise.

    Rule 10. If one or both premises are empirical, the conclusion must
    be empirical. In order to prove a general conclusion, both premises
    must be general propositions. ‘The fallacy that results from violating this
    rule is a general conclusion with an empirical premise.

    Two of the general rules of the syllogism are concerned with its mat-
    ter (J and 2); two with distribution, the most important consideration
    (3 and 4); two with quality (5 and 6); two with quantity (7 and 8); two
    with modality (7 and 9); one with the reference to reality, to essence, or

    to the individual (10).

    Mood

    The A, E, I, or O forms of its three component propositions constitute
    the mood of a syllogism. The mood is designated by these letters placed
    in a definite, conventional order. We shall adopt this order: the minor
    premise, the major premise, the conclusion.

    Because there are four propositional forms, A, E, I, and O, there are
    sixteen possible combinations of premises, namely: AA, AE, AI, AO;
    EA, EE, EI, EO; IA, IE, II, IO; OA, OE, OI, OO.

    Rule 5, forbidding two negative premises, requires the elimination of
    four of these combinations: EE, EO, OE, and OO.

- prompt: |-
    Rule 7, forbidding two partial (or contingent) premises, requires the
    elimination of three more (OO is eliminated under Rule 5, but it also
    would be eliminated by Rule 7): Il, JO, and OL. We shall discover later
    that an eighth combination, EI, must be eliminated because, although
    it violates none of the general rules, it conforms to none of the special
    rules. (The special rules will be explained later in Chapter Seven.)

    There remain eight valid combinations of premises. We can deter-
    mine whether the conclusion derived from each of these combinations
    will be A, E, I, or O by applying Rules 6 and 8.

    The table below lists the valid combination of premises. The "adap-
    tation to avoid a fallacy" column anticipates the problem which arises
    from the placement of terms. The placement of terms is explained in

    It is of no consequence whether the major premise is placed first or
    second; the figure and the rules of the figure remain the same. The first
    figure is that in which the middle term is the predicate of the minor
    premise and the subject of the major; the second figure is that in which
    the middle term is the predicate of both premises; the third, that in
    which it is the subject of both; the fourth, that in which it is the subject
    of the minor premise and the predicate of the major. Note, however,
    that the diagram of Figure I and Figure [V would look different if the
    major premise was first and the minor premise second.

    The sample syllogism is in Figure II because the middle term is the
    predicate of both premises.

    Testing the Validity of a Sylogism
    To determine the validity of a syllogism, merely test it by the general
    rules, particularly those of distribution. The rules of distribution, first
    explained in Chapter Five, are repeated here to guide the reader since
    distribution is such an important component in analyzing a syllogism.

    Because an A proposition is total (or necessary), it distributes its subject. Because an A

    Because an E proposition is total (or necessary), it distributes its subject. Because an E
    proposition is negative, it distributes its predicate. (No lions are horses.)

    Because an I proposition is partial (or contingent), it has its subject undistributed. Because
    an I proposition is affirmative, its predicate is undistributed. (Some lions are tame.)

    Because an O proposition is partial (or contingent), its subject is undistributed. Because it is

    termine the mood, note the A E I O form of each of the premises.
    The combination, both the type and the order, of propositions within
    the syllogism constitutes its mood. Determine the figure of the syl-
    logism. To determine the figure of the syllogism, note the position
    of the middle term. At the right of the formula, name the figure and

    each proposition (but if one proposition is a definition, either by genus
    and differentia or by property, write def. over its predicate to indicate

    P Invalid: Two negative premises

    An enthymeme is a syllogism logically abridged by the omission of one
    proposition, either the major premise, the minor premise, or the conclu-
    sion. It contains three terms and can be expanded into a full syllogism.

    The Simple Syllogism

    An enthymeme is to be distinguished from a syllogism logically com-
    plete but grammatically abridged. An example would be: Climbing the
    Alps is a fascinating but dangerous undertaking. Therefore some fasci-
    nating undertakings are dangerous.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Syllogism Validity Analysis**\n\nEvaluate the validity of the following syllogism using the definitions and examples provided in the text:\n\n**Premises**:\n- All true gentlemen are polite.\n- Some salesmen are not polite.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Some salesmen are not true gentlemen.\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the subject, predicate, and middle term of the syllogism.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the mood and figure of the syllogism.\n- **Step 3**: Apply the rules of syllogistic logic (e.g., the middle term must be distributed at least once, the conclusion cannot have a negative predicate if both premises are affirmative, etc.) to assess validity.\n- **Step 4**: Justify your conclusion by referencing the text''s examples, such as the syllogism about squares and oblongs.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly state whether the syllogism is valid or invalid and provide a logical justification based on the text''s definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Enthymeme Expansion and Logical Reasoning**\n\nConsider the following enthymeme from the text:\n\n**Statement**:\n\nClimbing the Alps is a fascinating but dangerous undertaking.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nSome fascinating undertakings are dangerous.\n\n- **Part A**: Identify the missing proposition in the syllogism.\n- **Part B**: Expand the enthymeme into a full syllogism, including all three terms and propositions.\n- **Part C**: Compare this enthymeme to the example given in the text (the syllogism about climbing the Alps) and explain how the structure and reasoning are analogous.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of enthymemes as abbreviated syllogisms and correctly expand them into their complete forms.'

- prompt: |-
    In this logically complete syllogism, the minor premise is only grammatically abridged, and the rules of grammar suffice for the expansion which must be made before its validity can be determined. Only one expansion can or need be made, for, if the sentence is analyzed or diagrammed, it is perfectly clear that "Climbing the Alps" is the subject of the minor premise (as well as of the major) and that a "fascinating undertaking" is its predicate. The formula of the syllogism is Ma P, MaS, Si P; it is in Figure III, Mood AAI, and it is valid.

    In an enthymeme the omitted proposition is logically abridged because there is no rule of grammar or of logic to determine the position of its terms in the expansion which must be made before the validity of the enthymeme can be determined. An example is: An oak is a plant because it is a tree.

    RULES FOR DETERMINING THE VALIDITY OF AN ENTHYMEME

    Find the conclusion using the following clues: (1) because, for, or since introduces a premise (a cause, of which the conclusion is the effect) and therefore the other proposition is the conclusion; (2) therefore, consequently, or accordingly introduces the conclusion; (3) and or but connects two premises and indicates that the proposition omitted is the conclusion.

    Write S above the subject of the conclusion and P above its predicate. One of these terms will appear with M in the other proposition given (if the enthymeme is of the usual type with the conclusion and one premise stated). Mark both terms in the premise given. Substitute for pronouns the nouns for which they stand. Since there is no rule of logic or of grammar to determine the position of the terms in the missing proposition, that proposition may be stated in either of two ways. Hence there are two expansions possible, in two different figures.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Structure of an Enthymeme**\n\nConsider the statement: ''An oak is a plant because it is a tree.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the conclusion and the two premises in the enthymeme.\n- **Part B**: Using the rules provided, diagram the enthymeme by marking the subject and predicate of the conclusion and identifying the missing proposition.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the enthymeme is valid, referencing the rules for determining the validity of an enthymeme.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the structure of an enthymeme and the application of the given rules to determine its validity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Expansion of an Omitted Proposition**\n\nGiven the incomplete syllogism: ''Climbing the Alps is a fascinating undertaking.''\n- **Part A**: Expand the syllogism by identifying the missing proposition and stating it in two different ways (as per the rules).\n- **Part B**: Diagram the syllogism in both possible figures, ensuring that the subject and predicate of the conclusion are correctly marked.\n- **Part C**: Justify the validity of the syllogism based on its structure and the rules of syllogistic logic.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show a clear understanding of syllogistic logic and the ability to expand and diagram an enthymeme according to the provided rules.'

- prompt: |-
    The principles for determining the validity of an enthymeme are:
    (1) If an enthymeme is valid in one expansion, it is a valid enthymeme regardless of whether it is valid in the other expansion. (2) If an enthymeme is found to be invalid in the first expansion, it is necessary to expand it in the alternate figure in order to be certain whether it is a valid enthymeme or not; but if it is found valid in the first expansion, it need not be expanded both ways.

    Since this enthymeme thus expanded into a full syllogism is valid, it need not be expanded in the alternate figure. But if it is, it is found to be invalid in Figure II. It must be clearly understood, however, that an enthymeme is a good, sound argument if it is formally valid in one of its possible expansions.
    It cannot be pronounced an invalid argument unless it has an error in both expansions.

    Although expansion b is formally valid, the major premise is false. It is true that shoes that are too
    short hurt the feet, but it is not true that all snoes that hurt the feet are too short, for they may
    hurt the feet because they are too narrow, or for other reasons. An A proposition is not validly
    convertible to A unless it is a definition, and this A proposition is not a definition. This enthymeme is
    an erroneous argument because there is an error in both expansions.3

    The Simple Sylllogism 141

    Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.

    The conclusion is stated in an abnormal word order, with the predicate (a participle or adjective) first,

    Although this syllogism is valid, both premises are false. Nothing can be literally and absolutely too good; if, however, too good be taken to mean very good, the minor premise can be accepted as true. But only a confirmed cynic could assert the major premise as true. Nonetheless, this enthymeme is repeated glibly by many who would deny the implicit major premise if they adverted to it explicitly,

    You are a thief, and a thief ought to be behind bars.
    in this enthymeme, the omitted proposition is the conclusion.

    A reward is an incentive to effort, for people desire to win it.

    This enthymeme illustrates the fact that the grammatical expression frequently obscures logical relations. Restatement is necessary to clarify them. Be particularly careful where there is a direct object.
    This usually requires conversion to the passive voice. By this means, the direct object can be extricated from other terms with which it is mixed and can be placed as an unconfused term on one side of the copula, Unless one can discern logical relations as they are actually expressed in daily life, the study of logic is not really practical. Seldom do people adhere to strict logical forms of expression.

    A whale is not a fish, for it has not scales and gills, and it nourishes its young with milk.

    This is a double enthymeme; the same conclusion is reached from two different sets of premises.
    Expansion:

    A fish has scales and gills. PaM Mood EAE
    ". A whale is not a fish. SeP Valid
    Note that if this syllogism is constructed in Figure IV by stating the major premise M a P. an illicit process of the major term would not be present, for having both scales and gills is a property of fish; therefore both terms are distributed, the one through the form, the other through the matter.

    The following is a quintuple enthymeme because one and the same conclusion is drawn from five
    different sets of premises. While the paragraph clearly illustrates this logical structure, it also illus-
    trates the rhetorical principle of variety: in diction, in sentence structure and sentence length, in
    rhythm, in introducing a Biblical allusion and some emphatic repetition, in first naming together
    those who hold the third and fourth reasons, then giving the reasons they hoid, and finally in sub-
    stituting the contrary, the abstract, and the negative in stating them.

    There is a chorus of voices... raised in favor of the doctrine... that everybody must be educated.
    The politicians tell us, "You must educate the masses because they are going to be masters." The
    clergy join in the cry for education, for they affirm that the people are drifting away from church
    and chapel into the broadest infidelity. The manufacturers and the capitalists swell the chorus
    lustily. They declare that ignorance makes bad workmen; that England will soon be unable to turn
    out cotton goods, or steam engines, cheaper than other people; and then, Ichabod! Ichabod! the
    glory will be departed from us. And a few voices are lifted up in favor of the doctrine that the
    masses should be educated because they are men and women with unlimited capabilities of being,
    doing, and suffering, and that it is as true now, as ever it was, that the people perish for lack of
    knowledge.

    —Thomas H. Huxley, "A Liberal Education"4

    Importance of the Enthymeme
    The enthymeme has been given careful consideration because of its
    great practical importance.

    In the enthymeme one proposition, most often the major premise,
    is merely implied, not explicit; and therefore it is more likely to be care-
    lessly assumed as true, without examination, and thereby to become a
    source of error and fallacious reasoning.

    The enthymeme is the form of reasoning which we constantly em-
    ploy in our thinking, conversation, and writing, and that which we
    should notice in our reading and listening. Logic is really practical
    when it is thus habitually used as a tool in daily life.

    The enthymeme is used extensively in exposition and in debate.
    Whenever the three, four, or any number of reasons for an event in his-
    tory are given, they constitute a multiple enthymeme—triple, quadru-
    ple, etc. The formal brief for a debate is a series of interlinked
    enthymemes: each main point states a conclusion, and the subheads,
    introduced by for, are the reasons which support it. When the main
    points have been established and are summarized, the reasoning
    moves forward to the final conclusion, as in the epicheirema, discussed
    below.

    SORITES

    A sorites is a chain of enthymemes or abridged syllogisms, in which the
    conclusion of one syllogism becomes a premise of the next; one premise of every syllogism but the first and the conclusion of all but the last
    are unexpressed, that is, merely implicit.

    There are two types of sorites: (1) that in which the conclusion of
    one syllogism becomes the major premise of the next; (2) that in which
    it becomes the minor premise of the next.

    Although it is possible to construct valid sorites in each of the four
    figures and to combine syllogisms of different figures in one sorites, we
    shall consider only the two traditional types in Figure I, the Aristotelian
    sorites and the Goclenian sorites, both of formally unlimited length.
    They are the only forms likely to be actually used in our reasoning.

    The formal unity of each of these sorites is emphasized by regarding
    it as a syllogism in Figure I with many middle terms.

    EXAMPLE: Aristotelian sorites

    Socrates is a man. S a M1
    A man is an animal. M1 a M2
    An animal is an organism. M2 a M3
    An organism is a body. M3 a M4
    A body is a substance. M4 a P

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Reasoning in a Sorites Chain**\n\nConstruct a valid sorites argument of at least four syllogisms, following the Aristotelian form, to prove that ''All birds can fly.''\n- **Step 1**: Begin with a specific premise about a known category (e.g., ''Penguins are birds'').\n- **Step 2**: Chain each subsequent syllogism by using the conclusion of the previous as the major premise.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that each syllogism is valid and that the final conclusion is ''All birds can fly.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically consistent, and you must explicitly identify at least three syllogisms with their major and minor premises.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Enthymeme Structure in Debate Reasoning**\n\nExplain how the structure of an enthymeme is used in the following argument from a debate:\n\n''For, first, the reason why we should support this policy is that it will reduce crime. For, it has been shown that reducing crime reduces the number of victims, and reducing the number of victims reduces the number of crimes.''\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the major and minor premises of the enthymeme.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the enthymeme''s structure supports the reasoning in the debate.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must demonstrate an understanding of how enthymemes function in logical reasoning and how they are structured for persuasive debate.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Sorites Validity**\n\nEvaluate the validity of the following sorites argument: ''All dogs are mammals. All mammals are animals. All animals are living things. All living things are matter. Therefore, all dogs are matter.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the structure of the sorites as either Aristotelian or Goclenian.\n- **Step 2**: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid, and explain your reasoning.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a modification to the sorites that would make it invalid, while keeping the same structure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must demonstrate a clear understanding of sorites structure and the conditions for validity, and you must provide a concrete example of an invalid modification.'

    Food that is not stored in the body is not fattening.
    ". Beefsteak is not fattening.

    In dealing with negatives, it is very important to remember that the
    negative may be placed either in the copula or in the term; but it is
    never permissible to place the negative in the copula in one premise
    and in the middle term in the other, for this would create four terms:
    M, M', S, and P. To make clear that a term is negative, it is often nec-
    essary to insert a word after the copula. If the enthymeme which is the
    minor premise in this epicheirema stood alone, the implied major
    premise "Protein is not stored in the body" would normally be treated
    as an E proposition. But since the middle term in the major premise of
    the epicheirema is negative, it is not only permissible but necessary to
    treat this as an A proposition, as in the following expansion.

    The double epicheirema is the five-part form of argument which
    Cicero® particularly admired and used in his orations. The five parts are
    (1) the major premise; (2) the proof of the major; (3) the minor prem-
    ise; (4) the proof of the minor; (5) the conclusion. In its rhetorical dress,
    this form of argument was elaborately illustrated and thereby consider-
    ably amplified.

    A multiple enthymeme differs from an epicheirema in having only
    one conclusion but stating many reasons that support it. A single
    epicheirema has two conclusions, and a double epicheirema has three,
    for the conclusions of its two enthymemes become premises which lead
    to a third conclusion.

    From a Sorites to an Epicheirema
    The transformation of a sorites into an epicheirema allows for a com-
    parison of structure. A sorites not exceeding five propositions may be
    transformed into a double epicheirema.

    EXAMPLE: A sorites transformed Into a doubie epicheirema

    Socrates is an animal because he is a man.

    of the resemblances rather than upon the number of resemblances. The
    validity of the argument requires that the point of resemblance M be
    probably a property resulting from the nature P and be not the differ-
    entia of S!. As Aristotle has remarked, the argument from example is an
    inference, not from the logical whole to its parts (deduction), but from

    MEDIATED OPPOSITION

    Definition

    Mediated opposition is the opposition between two propositions which
    together contain three terms, one term being common to both.

    EXAMPLE: Mediated opposition

    The witness is lying.
    The witness is telling the truth.

    Mediated opposition probably occurs more frequently in disputes
    than immediate opposition does. Immediate opposition would oppose
    the first proposition, in the example given above, with its contradictory:
    The witness is not lying.

    Mediated opposition combines the rules of opposition with the rules
    of syllogism. Since two propositions mediately opposed have three
    terms, they can be formed into a syllogism, which, combined with im-
    mediate opposition, clearly expresses the relations of all the proposi-
    tions involved.

    Let X symbolize the minor premise, Y the major premise, and Z the
    conclusion of a syllogism. Let X' symbolize the contradictory of X, and
    Z', that of Z.

    ILLUSTRATION: Mediated opposition

    Y

    The witness is lying. xX' The witness is not lying.
    Whoever lies does not tell the truth.
    The witness is not telling the truth. Z' The witness is telling the truth.

    Rules Determining the Validity of Mediated Opposition

    1 The syllogism involved in relating the propositions mediately op-
    posed must be formally valid.

    2 The third proposition (Y), which serves to establish mediated op-
    position between two others, must be materially true.

    The following fallacies result from the violation of these rules: illicit,
    illusory, or merely seeming mediated opposition.

    Relations of Mediated Opposition
    These relations can be understood by applying the rules of mediated
    opposition to the illustration above.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Mediated Opposition in Logical Arguments**\n\nConsider the following statements from the text:\n\n1. "The argument from example is an inference, not from the logical whole to its parts (deduction), but from part to part when both fall under a common genus (M) but one of the two (S!) is better known to us than the other (S82)."\n2. "Mediated opposition combines the rules of opposition with the rules of syllogism. Since two propositions mediately opposed have three terms, they can be formed into a syllogism, which, combined with immediate opposition, clearly expresses the relations of all the propositions involved."\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify the key differences between the argument from example and a syllogism as described in the text.\n- Explain how mediated opposition serves as a bridge between the argument from example and the syllogism.\n- Provide an original example of mediated opposition, clearly demonstrating the three terms and the syllogism that connects them.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference both the argument from example and the syllogism, and your example must be logically sound and based on the text''s definitions.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Syllogistic Validity in Mediated Opposition**\n\nUsing the rules of mediated opposition provided in the text, evaluate the following syllogism:\n\n1. All dogs are mammals. (Major premise)\n2. All mammals are animals. (Minor premise)\n3. All dogs are animals. (Conclusion)\n\n**Task**:\n- Determine if the syllogism is formally valid according to the first rule (the syllogism must be formally valid).\n- Check if the major premise (All mammals are animals) is materially true.\n- Identify any potential fallacy that might arise if the premises were not true or if the syllogism were not formally valid.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly apply the two rules from the text and clearly explain the validity or invalidity of the syllogism based on those rules.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Mediated Opposition and Fallacies**\n\nThe text discusses three fallacies that can result from violating the rules of mediated opposition: illicit, illusory, and merely seeming mediated opposition. Consider the following argument:\n\n1. All students are people.\n2. All people are mortal.\n3. Therefore, all students are mortal.\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify which of the three fallacies this argument might fall into, based on the text''s description.\n- Explain how the argument''s structure could be considered illicit or illusory according to the text''s definitions.\n- Construct a counterexample that demonstrates the difference between a valid syllogism and an illusory one, using terms from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define each of the three fallacies and show how the given argument fits into one of them, using logical reasoning based on the text''s definitions.

    Provided that Y is materially true, X and Z' are validly opposed as genuine mediated contraries, and both cannot be true. Recall that contraries are propositions which differ in quality (affirmative / negative) and are either total in quantity or necessary in modality. With contraries, both cannot be true, but both may be false.

    Provided that Y is materially true, Z and X' are validly opposed as mediated subcontraries, and both cannot be false. Recall that subcontraries are propositions which differ in quality and are either partial in quantity or contingent in modality. With subcontraries, both cannot be false, and both may be true.

    Mediated opposition is frequently a source of fallacy because the disputants usually do not know the formal rules for determining its validity, nor do they consciously advert to and examine the third proposition (Y) to which each of their contentions is related and by virtue of which they are mediately opposed (just as in any enthymeme the omitted premise which is not consciously adverted to is often the source of fallacy). The terms of Y must be repugnant. Recall that "repugnant" means that the terms are incompatible. Each term symbolizes a reality that excludes the other term.

    The following illustration shows how fundamental to genuine mediated opposition is the rule that Y must be materially true.

    If John were accused of a crime committed in New York last Mon-
    day, would this argument establish an alibi, provided that Z' could be
    proved? We have here a valid syllogism; but in order that X and Z' be
    validly opposed as mediated contraries, it is necessary also that Y be ma-
    terially true. Y would have been materially true a hundred years ago but
    not now; hence now X and Z' are not validly opposed as genuine me-
    diated contraries but merely seem to be such, and both may be true.

    The source of many fallacies in the daily use of mediated opposition is
    the false, hidden assumption that the terms not common to the proposi-
    tions mediately opposed are mutually exclusive terms. For example, one
    person says, "Mary has a degree in law." The other replies, "That isn't
    true; she has a degree in philosophy." Neither disputant adverts to the
    full, explicit argument, which is explained in the following illustration.

    ILLUSTRATION: Y must be materially true

    X Mary has a degree in law. X' Mary does not have a degree in law.
    Y Whoever has a degree in law cannot have a degree in philosophy.
    Z Mary does not have a degree in philosophy. Z' Mary has a degree in philosophy.

    We see at once that although the syllogism is valid, Y is not materially
    true. Therefore X and Z' may both be true, and X' and Z may both be
    false. As a matter of fact, this Mary has a degree in law and also a degree
    in philosophy. Each disputant happened to know only about the one de-
    gree, not the other. In this, as in many arguments in daily life, there is not
    genuine opposition, for both disputants are right. A realization of this and
    a knowledge of the rules of mediated opposition would forestall much
    needless and futile contention. This misunderstanding applies to many
    arguments about the spelling or the pronunciation of words, for the dic-
    tionary shows many instances in which two or more ways are valid.

    UTILITY OR WORTH OF THE SYLLOGISM

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Mediated Opposition in Legal Context**\n\nJohn is accused of a crime committed in New York last Monday. The argument claims that if Z'' (John does not have an alibi) can be proved, then the accusation is valid. Using the syllogism described in the text, determine whether this argument establishes an alibi.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the propositions X, Y, Z, and Z'' in this context.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the text''s definition of mediated opposition. Explain why Y must be materially true for X and Z'' to be validly opposed.\n- **Step 3**: Based on the text''s example of Mary and her degrees, argue whether X and Z'' can both be true.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s explanation of mediated opposition and the necessity of Y being materially true for the syllogism to hold.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Fallacy in Everyday Disputes**\n\nTwo people argue over the spelling of the word ''accommodate.'' One claims it is spelled with two ''c''s, the other with one. Using the text''s example of Mary and her degrees, explain why this dispute is a case of mediated opposition.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the propositions X, Y, Z, and Z'' in this context.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the text''s definition of mediated opposition. Explain why the dispute is based on a false assumption of mutual exclusivity.\n- **Step 3**: Suggest a resolution that aligns with the text''s argument that both disputants could be correct.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s explanation of mediated opposition and the example of Mary having two degrees.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Syllogism Validity and Material Truth**\n\nIn the syllogism presented in the text, the validity of the argument depends on the material truth of Y. Consider the syllogism: X (John has an alibi), X'' (John does not have an alibi), Y (If someone has an alibi, they cannot be at the crime scene), Z (John is at the crime scene), Z'' (John does not have an alibi).\n- **Step 1**: Explain why Y must be materially true for the syllogism to be valid.\n- **Step 2**: Use the text''s example of Mary and her degrees to argue whether Y can be materially true in this context.\n- **Step 3**: Determine whether the syllogism is valid or not, and explain why.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s explanation of material truth and the example of Mary having two degrees.'

    The various forms and combinations of the syllogism discussed in this
    chapter are useful only if the syllogism itself is a means whereby the
    mind advances in knowledge. John Stuart Mill and other logicians of
    the Empiricist School have attacked the syllogism, contending that the
    conclusion is contained in the major premise, and has to be known be-
    fore the major premise can be stated; that it therefore begs the question
    in thus assuming the very proposition to be proved; and that it is there-
    fore not an advance in knowledge.'

    A refutation of the Empiricists' argument is that while it may be true
    of a syllogism whose major premise is a mere enumerative empirical
    proposition that the conclusion has to be known before the major prem-
    ise can be stated, but it is never true of a syllogism whose major premise
    is a general proposition, for the truth of a general proposition is known,
    not from counting instances and adding them together, but from an
    analysis of the terms in relation to each other; its truth is not dependent
    on investigation of the individual facts, for it is understood in intension,
    not in extension. In other words, the terms are understood by their
    meaning rather than by their application.

    EXAMPLE: Syllogism in which major premise is an enumerative empirical proposition

    Every new car built for the American market has airbags.
    The Smiths' new car was built for the American market.
    .. The Smiths' new car has airbags.

    EXAMPLE: Syllogism with a general proposition as the major premise

    A blind man cannot umpire a football game.
    Tom Jones is a blind man.
    .. Tom Jones cannot umpire a football game.

    The second syllogism is not begging the question, because the con-
    clusion, that is, the proposition to be proved, is not implicit in the major
    premise, nor in the minor premise, but in the conjunction of the two
    premises.

    The syllogism is an advance in knowledge because its conclusion is
    a truth distinct from that of each of the premises and apparent only
    through their conjunction.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Syllogism and Empiricism**\n\nEvaluate the Empiricist critique of syllogisms by analyzing the two provided examples from the text.\n- **Example 1** (Enumerative Empirical Syllogism):\n  Major Premise: Every new car built for the American market has airbags.\n  Minor Premise: The Smiths'' new car was built for the American market.\n  Conclusion: The Smiths'' new car has airbags.\n- **Example 2** (General Proposition Syllogism):\n  Major Premise: A blind man cannot umpire a football game.\n  Minor Premise: Tom Jones is a blind man.\n  Conclusion: Tom Jones cannot umpire a football game.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the Empiricists argue that the first example ''begs the question,'' while the second does not. Use the text''s distinction between enumerative empirical propositions and general propositions.\n- **Part B**: Justify how the second example demonstrates that a syllogism can ''advance in knowledge'' by referencing the text''s claim that the conclusion is ''distinct from that of each of the premises and apparent only through their conjunction.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the two syllogistic types as per the text, and explicitly connect each example to the Empiricist critique and the defense of syllogism as a means of knowledge advancement.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Syllogistic Structure**\n\nConstruct a syllogism that demonstrates the ''advance in knowledge'' as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a major premise that is a general proposition (not an enumerative empirical one).\n- **Step 2**: Choose a minor premise that is a specific instance.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure the conclusion is distinct from the premises and not implicit in either.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Provide your constructed syllogism with clear major, minor, and conclusion statements.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the syllogism to show how it ''avoids begging the question'' and ''advances in knowledge'' according to the text''s reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Contrast your syllogism with the first example in the text, explaining why one ''advances in knowledge'' and the other does not.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogism must be logically valid, and your analysis must explicitly reference the text''s definitions of ''general propositions'' and ''enumerative empirical propositions.'''
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Syllogistic Validity**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''all syllogisms are invalid because they beg the question.'' Use the text''s explanation of how general propositions differ from enumerative empirical propositions.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the Empiricists argue that some syllogisms ''beg the question,'' while the text refutes this claim for syllogisms with general propositions.\n- **Part B**: Construct a syllogism that demonstrates the text''s assertion that ''the conclusion is a truth distinct from that of each of the premises.''\n- **Part C**: Use your syllogism from Part B to argue against the claim that all syllogisms are invalid.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s distinction between general and empirical propositions, and your syllogism must clearly demonstrate the ''advance in knowledge'' as described in the text.'

    It is a common experience that a person may have knowledge of only
    one of the premises, and that as soon as he discovers the second, he rec-
    ognizes the truth of the conclusion which instantly emerges in a spon-
    taneous act of syllogistic reasoning. For example, one may have known
    that "A bird is not a mammal." But one may not have known that "A
    bat is a mammal." The conclusion that "A bat is not a bird" was, then,
    not only a distinctly new piece of knowledge, but the contradictory of
    what had been believed, namely, that "A bat is a bird."

    It may be further contended against Mill that even the conclusion
    from two empirical premises sometimes represents an advance in
    knowledge, arising from the conjunction of the premises. This is the
    very means used to create suspense and interest in many stories and
    parts of stories. For example, in Hawthorne's The House of the Seven
    Gables,' the reader knows that the Maule family has been hostile to the
    Pyncheon family, for Matthew Maule had cursed Colonel Pyncheon
    and his descendants after Colonel Pyncheon had persecuted him. The
    reader also knows that Holgrave is interested in Phoebe Pyncheon. But
    it comes as a surprise, as an advance in knowledge, to discover at the
    end of the story that Holgrave is a Maule. The situation may be stated
    thus:

    The Maules have no love for the Pyncheons.
    Holgrave is a Maule.
    . Holgrave will not love a Pyncheon.

    Since, however, living human beings, although rational, are not
    ruled altogether by cold logic, especially that of a dead ancestor's curse,
    but by emotion and independent judgment as well, the lovers disregard
    the major premise and end the family feud.

    Another example is in Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities.? Dr. Manette
    knows that Charles Darnay, a young man whom he likes and admires,
    wishes to marry Lucie Manette, his daughter. He also knows that the St.
    Evremonde family has grievously injured him. But when he learns
    Charles Darnay's true family name, these separate, previously known
    propositions suddenly conjoin in the following disturbing sorites made
    up of two syllogisms:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Reasoning and Syllogistic Deduction**\n\nGiven the premises: \n1. The Maules have no love for the Pyncheons. \n2. Holgrave is a Maule. \n\nConstruct a syllogism to conclude that ''Holgrave will not love a Pyncheon.'' \n- **Step 1**: Identify the major premise, minor premise, and conclusion. \n- **Step 2**: Use the syllogistic structure (Barbara, Celarent, etc.) to validate the conclusion. \n- **Step 3**: Explain how this reasoning aligns with the text''s discussion of syllogistic reasoning as a tool for knowledge and contradiction.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogism must be logically valid, and you must explicitly reference the text''s example to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Empirical Premises and Knowledge Advancement**\n\nConsider the scenario from *A Tale of Two Cities*: \n1. Dr. Manette knows that Charles Darnay wishes to marry Lucie. \n2. Dr. Manette knows that the St. Evremonde family has grievously injured him. \n3. Dr. Manette learns that Charles Darnay is a member of the St. Evremonde family. \n\nUsing the premises, construct two syllogisms that lead to the conclusion: ''Dr. Manette will not approve of Charles Darnay marrying Lucie.'' \n- **Step 1**: Form the first syllogism using premises 1 and 2. \n- **Step 2**: Form the second syllogism using premises 2 and 3. \n- **Step 3**: Explain how the conjunction of these two syllogisms creates a ''sorites'' (a complex chain of reasoning) that advances knowledge, as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogisms must be logically valid, and you must explicitly link them to the text''s discussion of knowledge advancement through empirical premises.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Human Reasoning and Logic**\n\nThe text contrasts syllogistic reasoning with human emotion and independent judgment. Using the example from *The House of the Seven Gables*, where the lovers disregard the logical conclusion of the syllogism, answer the following: \n- **Part A**: Explain why the syllogism ''Holgrave will not love a Pyncheon'' is logically valid, but the conclusion is disregarded by the characters. \n- **Part B**: Construct a real-life scenario where logical reasoning and human emotion conflict, similar to the text''s example. \n- **Part C**: Reflect on the text''s argument that ''living human beings are not ruled altogether by cold logic'' and discuss the implications for decision-making in everyday life.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of logic vs. emotion, and you must provide a clear example for Part B that demonstrates the interplay between the two.'

    The St. Evremondes have grievously injured me.
    . My daughter loves one of a family which has grievously injured me.

    Dr. Manette finally consents to let Charles Darnay become his son-
    in-law, but so great is the emotional shock of the new knowledge aris-
    ing from the conjunction of the premises that Dr. Manette temporarily
    loses the use of his reason.

    Examples could be multiplied indefinitely both from literature and
    from life—cases of mistaken identity, of proving an alibi in court, and

    the like.

    THE SYLLOGISM AS A FORMULA OR RULE OF INFERENCE

    A valid syllogism, like every other relation of propositional forms, is a
    formula or rule of inference requiring that a given assertion must be
    made if certain other assertions are made. Provided that the syllogism
    is valid, it operates as a rule of inference in the following manner:

    Rule 1. If both premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

    Rule 2. If the conclusion is false, at least one of the premises must
    be false. The premises together constitute a conjunction of proposi-
    tions. Hence when one is false, the conjunction is false.

    Rule 3. If one or both of the premises are false, the value of the con-
    clusion is unknown.

    EXAMPLES: Sylogisms with false premises

    4 2
    0 All Squares are circles. OQ All squares are circles.
    1 No circle is a triangle. 4 No circle is a rectangle.

    1 No square is a triangle. QO No square is a rectangle.

    Since in both these examples, one of the premises is false, and since
    in the one the conclusion is true whereas in the other the conclusion
    is false, it is evident that if the premises are false, the value of the con-
    clusion is unknown through the form although it may be learned from
    the matter.

    The Simple Syllogism 155

    Rule 4. If the conclusion is true, the value of the premises is un-
    known.

    Rule 5. If one or both of the premises are probable, the conclusion
    can be only probable; it cannot be categorically true or false.

- prompt: |-
    Rule 6. If the conclusion is probable, the value of the premises is un-
    known; for in the first example illustrating Rule 3 the conclusion is true
    and one of the premises is false, whereas in every sound syllogism the
    conclusion is true and the premises are true. Hence when the conclu-
    sion is true the value of the premises cannot be known through the form
    but must be learned from the matter.

    These first two rules are the most important. Rules 3 to 6 are implied
    in Rules 1 and 2.

    SPECIAL RULES OF THE FOUR FIGURES OF THE SYLLOGISM

    As has been stated earlier in this chapter, a knowledge of the general
    rules of the syllogism, particularly those of distribution, suffices to de-
    termine the validity of any syllogism.

    It is, however, a good logical exercise to apply the general rules to
    each figure abstractly in order to determine the special rules for each.
    It is easiest to understand the rules for Figure II, and we shall therefore
    begin with that.

    Special Rules of Figure II
    S___M _ Since the middle term, which must be distributed
    P__M at least once, is predicate in both premises, and
    S__P _ since only a negative proposition formally distributes its
    predicate, the first rule is apparent at once:

    Rule I. One premise must be negative in order to distribute M (in
    accordance with general Rule 3).

    A second special rule follows from this. Since the conclusion will be
    negative (Rule 6), the major term P will be distributed there and must
    accordingly be distributed also in its own premise (Rule 4); but there it
    stands as subject, and since only a total or a necessary proposition dis-
    tributes its subject, the second special rule is:

    Rule 2. The major premise must be total or necessary in order to
    avoid an illicit process of the major term.

    Applying these special rules to the nine combinations of premises
    permitted by the general rules one finds that the valid moods in Figure
    II, with minor premise first, are AEE, EAE, IEO, OAO.

    Special Rules of Figure I

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Syllogistic Logic**\n\nUsing the special rules of Figure II from the text, determine the validity of the following syllogism:\n\nPremise 1: All S are M.\nPremise 2: All P are M.\nConclusion: All S are P.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the mood and figure of the syllogism (e.g., ''AEE-2'').\n- **Part B**: Apply the special rules of Figure II to determine if the syllogism is valid.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the conclusion is invalid, citing Rule 6 and the illicit process of the major term.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate understanding of the special rules and the logical fallacy in the syllogism.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Syllogistic Figures**\n\nUsing the special rules of Figure I from the text, evaluate the validity of the syllogism:\n\nPremise 1: All M are P.\nPremise 2: All S are M.\nConclusion: All S are P.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the mood and figure of the syllogism (e.g., ''AAA-1'').\n- **Part B**: Apply the special rules of Figure I to determine validity.\n- **Part C**: Justify why this syllogism is valid, referencing Rule 4 and the proper distribution of terms.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly apply the rules of Figure I and explain the logical structure of the syllogism.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Syllogistic Logic**\n\nConsider the syllogism:\n\nPremise 1: No M are P.\nPremise 2: All S are M.\nConclusion: No S are P.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the mood and figure of the syllogism (e.g., ''EAE-1'').\n- **Part B**: Use the special rules of Figure I to determine its validity.\n- **Part C**: Explain why this syllogism is valid, citing Rule 2 and the correct distribution of terms.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of the special rules and the logical structure of the syllogism.'

- prompt: |-
    S_...M In considering the position of the terms, we do not
    M P see at once, as we did in Figure II, what special rule is
    S P necessary, because the reasoning is indirect, by disproof

    of the contradictory of the special rule.

    Rule 1. The minor premise must be affirmative.

    The necessity of this rule becomes clear only in considering what
    would follow if the minor premise were negative: the conclusion would
    then be negative (Rule 6), and consequently the major term P would
    be distributed there and would have to be distributed in its own prem-
    ise (Rule 4), where it occupies the position of predicate; the major
    premise would then have to be negative, since only a negative proposi-
    tion distributes the predicate. But we have assumed that the minor is
    negative, and from two negative premises no conclusion can be drawn.
    Therefore, in order to avoid, on the one hand, an illicit process of the
    major term or, on the other hand, the formal fallacy of two negative
    premises, it is obvious that the minor premise must be affirmative. The
    second special rule follows from this:

    Rule 2. The major premise must be total or necessary in order to
    avoid an undistributed middle term.

    Since in Figure I the minor premise must be affirmative, the middle
    term M, as its predicate, cannot be distributed there by the form (al-
    though, if it is a definition, it will be distributed by the matter); in this
    figure, therefore, M can be distributed formally (Rule 3) only as subject
    of the major premise, which, consequently, must be total or necessary
    because only those distribute the subject.

    Applying these special rules, we find that the valid moods of this fig-
    ure are AAA, AEE, IAI, IEO.

    Special Rules of Figure III

    M S Since in this figure, as in Figure [, the major term is
    M____P predicate in the major premise, the same special rule
    S P follows, for the same reasons, which need not be re-

    peated here.
    The Simple Syllogism 157

    Rule 1. The minor premise must be affirmative.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Application of Syllogistic Logic in Figure II**\n\nIn the text, it is stated that in Figure II, the position of terms makes it unclear what special rule is necessary because the reasoning is indirect through disproof. Given the special rules provided for Figure II, determine the valid moods for this figure.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the minor premise must be affirmative (Rule 1) based on the text''s reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Justify why the major premise must be total or necessary (Rule 2) to avoid an undistributed middle term.\n- **Part C**: List the valid moods for Figure II, referencing the text''s conclusion that they are AAA, AEE, IAI, and IEO.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s logical reasoning and the stated rules without any external knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Syllogistic Figures and Their Validity**\n\nThe text distinguishes between Figure I and Figure III, noting that in Figure III, the same special rules apply as in Figure II. However, the text also provides different valid moods for Figure II.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the special rules for Figure II with those for Figure I, as described in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the valid moods for Figure II are different from those of Figure I, based on the text''s explanation of distribution and term positions.\n- **Part C**: Construct a syllogism in Figure II using the valid mood IAI, and verify its validity using the text''s rules.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of distribution, term positions, and the special rules for both figures.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Syllogistic Structures**\n\nThe text discusses the necessity of the minor premise being affirmative in Figure II and the role of the middle term in syllogistic reasoning.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why an affirmative minor premise is required in Figure II to avoid logical fallacies, as stated in the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to the claim: "A syllogism with two negative premises is valid." Use the text''s rules to justify why this claim is incorrect.\n- **Part C**: Analyze the role of the middle term in syllogistic reasoning, explaining how its distribution affects the validity of the argument, based on the text''s discussion of Rule 2.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of the text''s logical framework and apply it to create a valid syllogistic argument and counterexample.'

- prompt: "Rule 2. This follows from the first rule. Since the minor premise  \nmust be affirmative, the minor term S, its predicate, is formally undis-  \ntributed there and must likewise be undistributed in the conclusion  \n(Rule 4), where it stands as subject. But only partial or contingent  \npropositions have the subject undistributed; therefore the conclusion  \nmust be partial or contingent.\n\nApplying these special rules, one finds that the valid moods of Fig-  \nure III are AAI, AI], IAI, AEO, AOO, IEO.\n\nSpecial Rules of Figure V  \nAlthough Aristotle knew Figure IV, both he and logicians of the Re-  \nnaissance discussed only the first three figures.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Syllogistic Logic Rules**\n\nGiven the rules of syllogistic logic provided in the text, determine the validity of the following syllogism:\n\nPremise 1: All M are P.\nPremise 2: Some S are M.\nConclusion: Some S are P.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Step 1**: Identify the figure of the syllogism (I, II, III, or IV) based on the position of the middle term.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the special rules of the identified figure to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your reasoning by referencing the specific rules (e.g., ''Rule 1 states that if the major premise is affirmative...'').\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the syllogistic structure, the identification of the figure, and the application of the relevant rules to determine validity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Syllogistic Moods**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of valid moods in Figures III and IV, evaluate the following syllogistic moods and determine whether they are valid according to the special rules provided:\n\nMood: IAI in Figure III\nMood: AAI in Figure IV\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each mood, identify the type of propositions (A, E, I, O) and the position of the middle term.\n- **Part B**: Apply the special rules of the respective figure to determine the validity of each mood.\n- **Part C**: Explain the difference in validity between the two moods based on the unique characteristics of Figures III and IV as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the special rules of each figure and demonstrate a clear understanding of how they affect the validity of the syllogistic moods.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Syllogistic Figures**\n\nThe text describes Figure I as the ''perfect figure'' because it can yield total or necessary general affirmative propositions. Consider the following syllogism:\n\nPremise 1: All S are M.\nPremise 2: All M are P.\nConclusion: All S are P.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the figure of this syllogism and confirm that it aligns with the text''s description of Figure I as the ''perfect figure''.\n- **Part B**: Explain why this syllogism is considered valid under the rules of syllogistic logic, referencing the special rules provided in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to challenge the claim that Figure I is the ''perfect figure'' by creating a syllogism that contradicts this assertion. Your counterexample must adhere to the rules of syllogistic logic and clearly demonstrate the limitations of Figure I.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of Figure I''s perfection and demonstrate an understanding of its logical structure and potential limitations.'

- prompt: |-
    Figure I is also called the perfect figure because in it alone is the
    middle term really in the natural, middle position; in it alone is the nat-
    ural synthesis of the terms given in the premises themselves. It repre-
    sents the spontaneous, natural movement of thought in the process of
    reasoning. In Figure | the dictum, the fundamental principle of syllo-
    gistic reasoning, has immediate and obvious application, for as the
    major term is affirmed (or denied) of the middle term, the logical
    whole, so is it affirmed (or denied) of the minor term, the logical part.

    Note that in this book the minor premise has regularly been placed
    first because (1) it is thereby more clearly evident that the middle term
    is in the middle (S__._M, M___P, therefore S P); (2) it corre-
    spends more closely to our experience, for we usually become inter-
    ested first in a particular object, then place it mentally in a class,
    perhaps after careful examination (This is a toadstool, not a mush-
    room), join to it what we know of that class (Toadstools are poisonous),
    and draw a conclusion therefrom (This is poisonous, and I must not eat
    it) the second conclusion making this, by the implied premise (What-
    ever is poisonous | must not eat) two syllogisms; (3) this is the natural
    movement of thought, as is evident from the fact that we find the Aris-
    totelian sorites, which places the minor premise first, much more com-
    fortable than the Goclenian sorites, which places the major premise
    first. It is, of course, true that certain arguments seem more satisfactory
    with the major premise first, others with the minor premise first. So far
    as validity or formal correctness goes, it makes no difference which is
    placed first.

    Figure II, except when one premise is a definition, can yield only
    negative conclusions. It is therefore particularly adapted to disproof.

    Figure III is the weakest figure because, except when one premise
    is a definition, it can yield only a conclusion that is partial or singular
    or contingent. It is adapted to proving exceptions.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Syllogistic Reasoning in Figure I**\n\nUsing the description of Figure I provided in the text, explain how the natural position of the middle term in the syllogism reflects the ''spontaneous, natural movement of thought'' in reasoning.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the structure of the syllogism described as ''S _ _ M, M _ _ P, therefore S P''.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why the middle term being in the ''natural, middle position'' allows for the logical conclusion ''S P'' to follow directly from the premises.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this structure mirrors the process of reasoning described in the text (e.g., ''we usually become interested first in a particular object...'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must explicitly reference the text''s assertion that Figure I represents the ''natural synthesis of the terms given in the premises'' and that it corresponds to the ''natural movement of thought'' in reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Syllogistic Figures II and III**\n\nCompare and contrast the purposes and limitations of Figure II and Figure III as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain why Figure II is particularly adapted to disproof, citing the text''s statement that it can yield only negative conclusions except when one premise is a definition.\n- **Part B**: Describe why Figure III is adapted to proving exceptions, using the text''s claim that it can yield only partial, singular, or contingent conclusions except when one premise is a definition.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical syllogism for each figure (Figure II and III) that demonstrates their respective capabilities and limitations.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s descriptions of Figures II and III, including their specific constraints and applications in reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Syllogistic Reasoning to Real-World Scenarios**\n\nConsider the following real-world scenario: A student is told that ''All toadstools are poisonous'' (premise 1) and ''This is a toadstool'' (premise 2).\n- **Part A**: Construct a syllogism in the form of Figure I that leads to the conclusion ''This is poisonous.''\n- **Part B**: Explain how this syllogism aligns with the text''s description of the ''natural movement of thought'' (e.g., ''we usually become interested first in a particular object...'').\n- **Part C**: Modify the syllogism to fit Figure II or III, and explain how the conclusion changes in terms of its validity and logical strength.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of syllogistic figures and the natural progression of thought in reasoning, as described in the provided passage.'

- prompt: |-
    Figure IV, whose premises are the converse of Figure I, is so unnatural in the movement of its thought that it gives the mind the least satisfaction and the least sense of conviction, whereas the first figure gives the mind the most in both of these respects.

    REDUCTION OF SYLLOGISMS

    This is an ingenious exercise of little practical importance. Reduction is the process by which a syllogism in one of the imperfect figures (II, III, or IV) is expressed as a syllogism of the first figure, which is called the perfect figure.

    The purpose of reduction is to demonstrate the validity of an imperfect figure as a formal process of reasoning by showing that an argument carried on according to the rules of an imperfect figure is valid in the perfect figure.

    The assumptions of reduction are two: that the premises of the imperfect figure are true as given and that the first or perfect figure is formally valid.

    The mnemonic lines that follow are a clever medieval device enumerating the nineteen!° valid moods of the four figures and indicating the methods for reducing the moods of the imperfect figures to the corresponding moods of the perfect figure.

- prompt: |-
    This conclusion in Barbara, since it is the contradictory of the O
    premise of Bocardo, which was given as true, must be false. But Barbara
    is accepted as a valid process of reasoning. The error therefore must be
    in the matter, since it is not in the form; for if the conclusion of a valid
    syllogism is false, at least one of the premises must be false. But the
    minor premise of Barbara, borrowed from Bocardo, is given as true;
    therefore the major premise of Barbara must be false. Since this major
    premise is the contradictory of the conclusion of Bocardo, that conclu-
    sion must be true.

    uses of logic:

    A hypothetical proposition is one that asserts the dependence of one proposition on another. An example is: If a man drinks poison, he will die. It is usually an if proposition; unless meaning if not, provided that, and sometimes when may also express this relation. The proposition which depends on the other is called the consequent; the proposition on which it depends is called the antecedent. The dependence itself is the nexus, which is the connection, the link between the propositions.

    The hypothetical proposition expresses a relation of propositions, whereas the simple proposition expresses a relation of terms. The hypothetical proposition expresses a conditional relation of dependence, and hence of limitation, whereas the simple categorical proposition expresses without limitation a relation between a subject and a predicate.

    Because a hypothetical proposition expresses a dependence primarily in the logical order, the antecedent is more correctly called the reason, rather than the cause, of the consequent. A reason is the relation in the logical order, whereas a cause is, strictly speaking, a relation in the metaphysical order. Thus, the existence of the world is a reason for believing in the existence of God, but it is not a cause of His existence; on the contrary, it is an effect of His existence.

    Types of Hypothetical Propositions
    There are two types of hypothetical propositions: the type having three terms and the type having four terms.

    1 In the type having three terms, one term being common to both antecedent and consequent, the formula is If S is M, it is P. If you study, you will learn.

    2 In the type having four terms, no term being common to both antecedent and consequent, the formula is If B is C, D is E. If he comes, I will go.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing Hypothetical Propositions\n\nConsider the hypothetical proposition: If a student studies regularly, he will pass the exam.\n- **Part A**: Identify the antecedent and consequent in this proposition.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the term ''reason'' is preferred over ''cause'' in describing the relationship between the antecedent and consequent, based on the text''s distinction between logical and metaphysical orders.\n- **Part C**: Construct a similar hypothetical proposition using different terms, ensuring that the antecedent and consequent follow the logical order described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s explanation of hypothetical propositions and their distinction from simple categorical propositions.'

    The hypothetical proposition can be reduced to a categorical proposition and vice versa, but usually this involves a change of import or a distortion of meaning. Distortion occurs especially in reducing the second type. Were there no difference whatever except in form, there would be no real justification for regarding the categorical and the hypothetical propositions as logically distinct types instead of verbally distinct. The genuine hypothetical is one in which the dependence between antecedent and consequent cannot be adequately expressed in categorical form or in which such dependence persists even in the categorical form.

    Formula for Reduction of Hypothetical Propositions
    1. The first type: if S is M, it is P becomes SM is P.
    2. The second type: If B is C, D is E becomes BC is DE.

    . Achild's going wrong is a cause of the mother's grieving.

    166 = The Trivium

    It will be noted that all these examples, except the last, represent the
    first type: SM is P. The first two suffer little distortion; the last two suf-
    fer much, and in them especially the dependence between antecedent
    and consequent persists and is felt even in the categorical form, for
    causality is the relation expressed in both forms.

    Just as clearly, the categorical nature of the third persists and is felt
    when it is expressed in hypothetical form because its antecedent is not
    the reason of the consequent, nor does the one depend on the other. This
    is an empirical proposition, to which the categorical form is natural.

- prompt: |-
    The compound nature of all these propositions (especially categorical example 2, "A virtuous man will be rewarded.") becomes obvious if we recall that grammatical modification is implicit logical predication; therefore, each of these examples is a conjunction of propositions, not one simple proposition. It is not bare conjunction, however, but one expressing a relation of dependence. Therefore, although the hypothetical proposition is compound and can be reduced to its component simple propositions or to one simple proposition with compound terms, it represents a species of judgment, a particular kind of relationship between propositions and not merely between terms, and so it merits treatment as a distinct logical form.

    Special Characteristics of Hypothetical Propositions

    TRUTH OR FALSITY

    The hypothetical proposition does not assert either one of its component simple propositions as true or false; it asserts only that one depends on the other, that there is a nexus between them. Hence a hypothetical proposition is true when the nexus holds in the real order and false when it does not.

    EXAMPLES: Hypothetical propositions and dependence on truth of nexus

    If a man drinks poison, he will die. (True)

    If a man drinks water, he will die. (False)

    QUALITY
    The hypothetical proposition is always affirmative in the sense that it always affirms the nexus, that is, the connection of its component simple propositions; these, however, taken separately, may be both affirmative, or both negative, or one may be affirmative and the other negative.

    EXAMPLES: Hypothetical propositions always affirmative

    If you stop eating, you will die.
    If you do not eat, you will die.
    If you do not eat, you will not live.
    If you stop eating, you will not live.

    The proposition which denies a hypothetical proposition denies the nexus, yet such a proposition is not really a hypothetical proposition, for it does not assert the dependence of one proposition on another but denies such dependence.

    EXAMPLE: Hypothetical proposition and Its contradictory

    If a man drinks water, he will die.

    A man drinks water, he will not die.

    Taken in relation to the first proposition, which is false, the second,

    sition is not true, for by drinking water a man cannot keep from dying.

    DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS

    A disjunctive proposition is one which asserts that of two or more sup-
    positions, one is true. It is an either . . . or proposition.

    Types of Disjunctive Propositions
    There are three types represented by the following formulas. The first
    is the most important type.

    1. S is P or Q or R.

    167

    168 = The Trivium

    EXAMPLES: First type of disjunctive proposition

    A triangle is either equilateral or isosceles or scalene.

    A rectangle is either a square or an oblong.

    This type of disjunctive proposition is usually a summary of the re-
    sults of a logical division of a genus into its constituent species and con-
    forms to the same rules; for the alternatives are (1) collectively
    exhaustive, (2) mutually exclusive, (3) species resulting from division
    according to a single basis.

    2. S or T or U is P.

    EXAMPLE: Second type of disjunctive proposition

    Either John or Helen or Henry will win the scholarship.

    3. B is C or D.

    EXAMPLES: Third type of disjunctive proposition

    Either the man committed suicide or someone murdered him.
    Either the captain failed to give the order or the soldier failed to obey it.

    Reduction of Disjunctive Propositions
    A disjunctive proposition having only two alternatives can be expressed
    in a hypothetical proposition which denies one alternative and affirms
    the other.

    EXAMPLES: Reducing disjunctive proposition to hypothetical propositions

    if this man did not commit suicide, someone murdered him.
    if a rectangle is a square, it is not an oblong. (if S is M, it is not P)

    EXAMPLES: Reducing converted disjunctive to a simple proposition

    A rectangle that is a square is not an oblong. {(SMeP)
    A nonsquare rectangle is an oblong. (SM'aP)

    If the disjunctive proposition has more than two alternatives, it may,
    it is true, be expressed in a hypothetical proposition, but in that case the
    consequent will be disjunctive. For example: If a triangle is not equi-
    lateral, it is either isosceles or scalene.

    Special Characteristics of Disjunctive Propositions
    TRUTH OR FALSITY
    A disjunctive proposition is strictly true if it enumerates all the possi-
    bilities, that is, if the alternatives are mutually exclusive and collectively
    exhaustive. Otherwise, strictly speaking, it is false.

    The strict purpose, then, of the disjunctive proposition of every type
    is so to limit the choice of alternatives that if one is true, any other must
    be false.! Only under this condition does it serve as a true instrument
    of reasoning toward truth. It is this limitation of choice that makes the
    disjunctive proposition distinct from the hypothetical and the categori-
    cal. It is itself a conjunction of simple propositions joined by or, but it
    is not a bare conjunction, for the series of alternatives is fixed; to add to
    or subtract from the alternatives would falsify the series.

    In ordinary discourse the disjunctive proposition is often used
    loosely without the strict disjunctive purpose, yet this purpose is often
    present in the context even when it is absent from the proposition it-
    self. An example is: The package is in either the living room or the din-
    ing room.

    This proposition does not seem to exhaust the possibilities, but it
    does so implicitly if the context in the mind of the speaker is this: Since
    I had the package when | entered the house, and now, having left the
    house, I do not have it, and since I was in only the two rooms men-
    tioned, the package must be in either the one room or the other.

    To deny a disjunctive proposition, one may either:

    1. Deny the possibilities as well as the choice.
    Original: A student is either a laborer or a gentleman.
    Denial: A student is neither.

    2. Deny that the alternatives are mutually exclusive.
    Denial: A student is both a laborer and a gentleman.

    3. Deny that the alternatives are collectively exhaustive.
    Denial: A student is not either a laborer or a gentleman.

    The last is the most effective method of denying this example, for a
    student may be a woman; the original proposition is false, however, on
    all three counts.

    QUALITY
    The disjunctive proposition is always affirmative, in the sense that it af-
    firms a series of possibilities. The proposition which denies a disjunc-
    tive proposition is not really a disjunctive proposition, as may be seen
    in the first and third examples above, for it does not assert that of two or
    more suppositions one is true; rather it is the negation of such an as-
    sertion. In relation to a given disjunctive proposition, however, such de-
    nials provide the change of quality needful to the opposition and
    eduction of the disjunctive proposition.

    The hypothetical and the disjunctive proposition are effective in
    drama or story. Shakespeare often used the hypothetical proposition to
    state an important problem.

    or subdivision in closely knit reasoning. The final sentence gathers to-
    gether the parts disclosed by division.

    ILLUSTRATION: Continued disjunction

    Every action of every person either is or is not due to that person himself. Of those not due to
    himself some are due to chance, the others to necessity; of these latter, again, some are due to
    compulsion, the others to nature. Consequently all actions that are not due to a man himself are due
    either to chance or to nature or to compulsion. .. . Those things happen through compulsion which
    take place contrary to the desire or reason of the doer, yet through his own agency... . All actions
    that are due to a man himself and caused by himself are due either to habit or to rational or irrational
    craving. Rational craving is a craving for good, that is, a wish—nobody wishes for anything unless he
    thinks it is good. Irrational craving is twofold, namely, anger and appetite. Thus every action must be
    due to one or other of seven causes: chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reasoning, anger, or
    appetite.

    RELATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL AND DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS

    Hypothetical and disjunctive propositions have all the relations that
    simple propositions have, and the rules governing these relations are
    practically the same.

    ANALOGY: Grammatical structure and relations of propositions

    One who understands the grammatical structure of the simple sentence has only to apply the same
    principles to the more complicated but not altogether new patterns of the compound-complex
    sentence.

    The Mixed Hypothetical
    The mixed hypothetical syllogism is extensively used. The major
    premise is a hypothetical proposition, and the minor premise is a simple proposition.

    Rules for the Mixed Hypothetical Syllogism

    The minor premise must either

    1. posit the antecedent or

    2. sublate the consequent of the major premise.

    Fallacies:

    1. to sublate the antecedent:
    2. to posit the consequent.

    8-2 Rules for the Mixed Hypothetical Syllogism

    To posit the antecedent is to restate it as a fact, retaining the same
    quality: if it is negative in the major premise, it should be negative in
    the minor; if it is affirmative in the major, it should be affirmative in
    the minor.

    To sublate the consequent is to restate as a fact its contradictory. This
    requires a change of quality: if it is affirmative in the major premise, it
    should be negative in the minor; if it is negative in the major, it should
    be affirmative in the minor.

    Note that the rule has reference only to what the minor premise does
    to the major. Whenever the minor premise posits the antecedent, the
    conclusion posits the consequent. And whenever the minor premise
    sublates the consequent, the conclusion sublates the antecedent. This
    is correct and does not conflict with the rule.

    There are two moods of the mixed hypothetical syllogism: the constructive, which posits, and the destructive, which sublates. Only two forms are valid.

    The valid constructive mood posits the antecedent.

    EXAMPLE: Positing the antecedent

    If a man is not honest, he is not a fit public officer.
    This man is not honest.
    Therefore, this man is not a fit public officer.

    The valid destructive mood sublates the consequent.

    EXAMPLE: Sublating the consequent

    If all students were equally competent, each would acquire the same amount of knowledge
    from a given course.

    But each does not acquire the same amount of knowledge from a given course.

    All students are not equally competent.

    Note that when the consequent is sublated, the conclusion should be the contradictory, not the contrary, of the antecedent. Contradictory and contrary terms are explained in Chapter Four. There is no
    middle ground between contradictory terms; they divide everything into one sphere or another (tree or non-tree). Contrary terms can have a middle ground. They express degrees of difference; for ex-
    ample, good and evil are contrary terms. Most people or behaviors are not either good or evil but
    shadings of both.

    Equivalent Fallacies of Mixed Hypothetical and Simple Syllogisms

    1. The fallacy of sublating the antecedent in a mixed hypothetical
    syllogism is equivalent to the fallacy of an illicit process of the major
    term in a simple syllogism.

    EXAMPLE: Sublating the antecedent

    If a man drinks poison, he will die. Fallacy: Sublating the antecedent
    This man has not drunk poison.
    Therefore, he will not die.

    Equivalent simple syllogism:

    Whoever drinks poison will die. MaP Fallacy: Illicit process of the major term
    This man has not drunk poison. SeM
    Therefore, he will not die. SeP

    2. The fallacy of positing the consequent in a mixed hypothetical
    syllogism is equivalent to the fallacy of an undistributed middle term in
    a simple syllogism.

    EXAMPLE: Positing the consequent

    If a man drinks poison, he will die. Fallacy: Positing the consequent
    This man died.
    Therefore, he must have drunk poison.

- prompt: |-
    Note that if the hypothetical proposition is a sine qua non, no fallacy can result in a mixed hypothetical syllogism for in that circumstance the minor premise may posit or sublate either the antecedent or the consequent. Similarly, if one of the premises of a simple syllogism is a definition, neither an illicit process nor an undistributed middle will occur, even if the special rules of the figures are disregarded.

    Formal Basis for the Rules Governing the Syllogism as

    a Formula of inference

    By applying the rule of the mixed hypothetical syllogism, we can
    show formally the ground for the rules governing the syllogism as a for-
    mula of inference. We may state each of the rules in a formally correct
    mixed hypothetical syllogism, thus:

    1 If the premises of a valid syllogism are true, the conclusion must
    be true.
    In this valid syllogism the premises are true.
    . The conclusion is true.

    This mixed hypothetical syllogism is correct, for the minor premise
    posits the antecedent. It would be incorrect to sublate the antecedent.
    Therefore, if the premises are not true, the value of the conclusion is
    formally unknown.

    2 If the premises of a valid syllogism are true, the conclusion must
    be true.
    The conclusion of this syllogism is not true.
    . The premises are not true.

    This mixed hypothetical syllogism is valid, for the minor premise
    sublates the consequent. It would be incorrect to posit the consequent.
    Therefore, if the conclusion is true, the value of the premises is formally
    unknown.

    The point may be demonstrated further by constructing two more
    correct mixed hypothetical syllogisms, the minor premise of the one
    positing the antecedent, that of the other sublating the consequent of
    the following major premise, which states the second important rule: If
    the conclusion of a correct syllogism is false, at least one of the prem-
    ises must be false. In the same way one could prove the rules of oppo-
    sition which work in only one direction; for example: If A is true, E is
    false.

    This is a syllogism in which the major premise is a disjunctive proposition and the minor premise is a simple categorical proposition positing or sublating one of the alternatives.

    Relations of Hypothetical and Disjunctive Propositions 179

    Moods of the Disjunctive Syllogism
    There are two moods of the disjunctive syllogism: ponendo tollens
    and tollendo ponens.®

    1 Ponendo tollens, in which the minor premise posits one alterna-
    tive, and the conclusion sublates the other.

    EXAMPLE: Ponendo tollens disjunctive syllogism

    S is either P or Q. This woman's long-unheard-from husband is either living or dead.
    (Stated before making investigation.}

    Sis P. He is living. (Stated after long investigation.)

    «5 is not Q. He is not dead.

    2 Tollendo ponens, in which the minor premise sublates one alter-
    native, and the conclusion posits the other.

    EXAMPLE: Tollendo ponens disjunctive syllogism

    S is either P or Q. The soul is either spiritual or material.
    Sis not Q. The soul is not material.
    ~SiISP. The soul is spiritual.

    Note that this mood is valid only when the disjunctive proposition is of the strict type, its alterna-
    tives being collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive.

    Fallacies of the Disjunctive Syllogism

    There is only one purely formal fallacy, which will seldom occur. It
    is present when both the minor premise and the conclusion both posit
    and sublate each alternative.

    EXAMPLE: Fallacy of disjunctive syllogism

    John is either a rabbit or not a rabbit. (Only two alternatives.)
    John is not a rabbit. (You say, removing one alternative.)
    .. John is a rabbit. {The only alternative left.)

    This appears at first sight to exemplify the second formula above. But

    180 = The Trivium

    notice that the minor premise sublates the first alternative and posits the
    second and does both these things simultaneously. The conclusion si-
    multaneously posits the first alternative and sublates the second.

- prompt: |-
    The root of the error lies in the ambiguity of not in the major premise; as worded, it may be understood with is or with rabbit, either with the copula or with the term. The ambiguity can be removed by a clearer statement in which the negative is clearly attached to rabbit and the alternatives are dichotomous.

    EXAMPLE: Syllogism with ambiguity resolved

    John is either a rabbit or a nonrabbit.
    John is not a rabbit.
    Therefore, John is a nonrabbit.

    ANALOGY: Billiards and the disjunctive syllogism

    In billiards or in croquet, it is permissible to move two balls with one stroke. But to move both alternatives by one statement is not permissible in the disjunctive syllogism. Each stroke, each proposition, must affect only one alternative at one time.

    The material fallacy of imperfect disjunction, which also has a formal aspect, occurs when the alternatives are either not mutually exclusive or not collectively exhaustive.

    EXAMPLE: Alternatives not collectively exhaustive

    Roses are either red or white.
    The roses he sent are not red.
    Therefore, the roses he sent are white.

    THE DILEMMA

    The dilemma is a syllogism which has for its minor premise a disjunctive proposition, for its major premise a compound hypothetical proposition, and for its conclusion either a simple or a disjunctive proposition.

    The dilemma, correctly constructed, is a valid and useful form of reasoning, as all but the first of the four following examples and also some of the examples in the exercises at the end of this chapter illustrate. In actual use, a part of the argument is usually only implicit.

    Relations of Hypothetical and Disjunctive Propositions 181

    If the disjunctive offers three alternatives, the argument is more correctly called a trilemma; if many, a polylemma.

    The dilemma is constructive if the minor premise posits the two antecedents of the major and destructive if it sublates the two consequents.

    The dilemma has four moods: simple constructive, complex constructive, simple destructive, and complex destructive.

    EXAMPLES: Four moods of the dilemma

    . The accused is wealthy.

    Empson, a tax-gatherer of Henry V!I of England, used this argument to prove that everyone whom
    he haled? into court could and should pay higher taxes to the king.®

    Either the Christians have committed crimes or they have not.

    If they have, your refusal to permit a public inquiry is irrational; if they have not, your punishing them
    is unjust.

    . You are either irrational or unjust.

    Tertullian, the Christian apologist, used this argument in an appeal to the Roman Emperor Marcus
    Aurelius, who was regarded as both a philosopher and an upright man, to stop the persecution of
    the Christians.

    Simpie destructive

    lf a student has earned graduation with the honor summa cum laude, he must have shown both
    talent and diligence.

    But (his grades indicate that) either this student has not shown talent or he has not shown diligence.
    . This student has not earned graduation with the honor summa cum laude.

    In the simple destructive dilemma, the two consequents of the major premise are conjoined by both
    and and instead of being disjoined by either and or. They are therefore not alternatives; if they were,
    to sublate one or the other of them in the minor premise would not necessarily involve sublating
    the antecedent in the conclusion, as is required in a destructive dilemma.

    Complex destructive

    If this man had been properly instructed, he would know that he is acting wrongly; and if he were
    conscientious, he would care.
    But either he does not know that he is acting wrongly or he apparently does not care.
    .. Either he has not been properly instructed or he is not conscientious.

    THE TRILEMMA
    The trilemma, which is a dilemma in which the disjunctive proposition
    offers three alternatives, follows the rules for the dilemma.

    Note that such an argument might have been used by priest hunters in sixteenth-century England.

    FALLACIES OF THE DILEMMA
    There are three fallacies of the dilemma: (1) false major premise; (2)
    imperfect disjunction in the minor premise; (3) the dilemmatic fallacy,
    occasioned by a shifting point of view.

    There are three methods of attack in exposing these three sources of
    error.

    1 Taking the dilemma by the horns: This method of attack is used
    when the major premise is false, that is, when the nexus affirmed be-
    tween antecedent and consequent in the major premise does not hold
    in fact.

    EXAMPLE: Taking the dilemma by the horns

    If this man were intelligent, he would see the worthlessness of his arguments; if he were honest, he
    would admit that he is wrong.

    But either he does not see the worthlessness of his arguments or, seeing it, he will not admit that
    he is wrong.

    Either he is not intelligent or he is not honest.

    In attacking the dilemma, the controversialist would deny the nexus of the first part of the major prem-
    ise by asserting that he is intelligent and thereby recognizes his arguments not as invalid but as valid.
    Relations of Hypothetical and Disjunctive Propositions 183

    2 Escaping between the horns: This method of attack is used when
    the minor premise presents an imperfect disjunction in that the alter-
    natives stated are not collectively exhaustive. The discovery of an un-
    mentioned alternative offers an escape from the conclusion, between
    the horns.

    EXAMPLE: Escaping between the horns

    If I tell my friend that her new dress is unbecoming, she will be hurt; if I tell her that it is becoming,
    I shall tell a lie.

    But I must either tell her that it is becoming or that it is unbecoming.

    Therefore, I must either hurt my friend or tell a lie.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Identifying and Correcting a Dilemma Fallacy**\n\nThe text presents an example of a dilemma fallacy. Analyze the following dilemma:\n\n"If this man were intelligent, he would see the worthlessness of his arguments; if he were honest, he would admit that he is wrong.\nEither he does not see the worthlessness of his arguments or, seeing it, he will not admit that he is wrong.\nEither he is not intelligent or he is not honest.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify which fallacy of the dilemma is being committed in this argument. Justify your answer by referencing the text''s description of the three fallacies.\n- **Part B**: Propose a counterexample that demonstrates how the fallacy can be avoided. Explain how your counterexample shows that the original argument''s conclusion is not necessarily valid.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s method of ''taking the dilemma by the horns'' could be applied to this argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s definition of the fallacy and demonstrate an understanding of the method to correct it.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing a Dilemma with an Unmentioned Alternative**\n\nThe text provides an example of a dilemma where the minor premise presents an imperfect disjunction. Analyze the following dilemma:\n\n"If I tell my friend that her new dress is unbecoming, she will be hurt; if I tell her that it is becoming, I shall tell a lie.\nI must either tell her that it is becoming or that it is unbecoming.\nTherefore, I must either hurt my friend or tell a lie.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify which fallacy of the dilemma is being committed in this argument. Justify your answer by referencing the text''s description of the fallacies.\n- **Part B**: Propose a counterexample that demonstrates how the fallacy can be avoided.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluating the Logic of a Dilemma**\n\nConsider the following scenario: A person claims that if they are honest, they will not lie; if they are dishonest, they will lie. They also claim that either they are honest or dishonest. Therefore, they must either not lie or lie.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify which fallacy of the dilemma is being committed in this argument. Justify your answer by referencing the text''s description of the fallacies.\n- **Part B**: Propose a counterexample that demonstrates how the fallacy can be avoided. Explain how your counterexample shows that the original argument''s conclusion is not necessarily valid.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s method of ''taking the dilemma by the horns'' could be applied to this argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s definition of the fallacy and demonstrate an understanding of the method to expose the fallacy.'

- prompt: |-
    Here escape between the horns, the alternatives presented in the minor premise, is easy. I can refrain from making any comment on the dress; or, better, I can remark on some point that I can really commend, such as the color, the material, etc., avoiding any statement that will be either untruthful or offensive.

    3 Rebutting the dilemma: This method of attack is used when both the dilemma open to rebuttal and the rebutting dilemma contain the dilemmatic fallacy, which is both a formal and a material fallacy; sometimes a condition has two consequents, and each dilemma states only one (half-truth, optimistic or pessimistic), as in the Empson example above; sometimes each adopts a shifting point of view, as in the Protagoras example below.

    The method of rebuttal is to accept the alternatives presented by the minor premise of the original dilemma but to transpose the consequents of the major premise and change them to their contraries. Hence a conclusion exactly opposite to the conclusion of the original dilemma is derived.

    Formal rebuttal is a rhetorical device, a mere manipulation of the material in order to show up the weakness of an opponent's position. The very fact that a rebuttal to a given dilemma can be constructed shows that the dilemmatic fallacy of a shifting point of view is present in both dilemmas and that neither one is valid.

    A famous ancient example is the argument between Protagoras and Euathlus, his law pupil. According to the contract between them, Euathlus was to pay half his tuition fee when he completed his studies and the other half when he had won his first case in court. Seeing that his pupil deliberately delayed beginning the practice of law, Protagoras sued him for the balance of the fee. Euathlus had to plead his own case.

    ILLUSTRATION: Rebutting the dilemma

    Protagoras' argument

    if Euathlus loses this case, he must pay me by the judgment of the court; if he wins it, he must pay me in accordance with the terms of the contract.

    But he must either win or lose it.

    Therefore, he must pay me in any case.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Dilemma of Protagoras and Euathlus**\n\nExplain the logical structure of Protagoras'' dilemma in the context of the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two conditional statements in Protagoras'' argument.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the conclusion he draws from these statements using the principle of the excluded middle.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text refers to this as a "dilemmatic fallacy" and how it relates to the concept of a shifting point of view.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly articulate the logical flaw in Protagoras'' reasoning and reference the text''s description of the dilemma''s fallacy.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating the Rebuttal Strategy**\n\nAnalyze Euathlus'' rebuttal to Protagoras'' dilemma as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Explain how Euathlus transposes the consequents of the major premise and changes them to their contraries.\n- **Step 2**: Demonstrate that this transposition leads to a conclusion directly opposite to Protagoras'' original conclusion.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how the text uses this rebuttal to illustrate the concept of a shifting point of view in both dilemmas and the invalidity of the original argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must highlight the logical manipulation in Euathlus'' rebuttal and connect it to the text''s explanation of the dilemmatic fallacy.'

    If I win the case, I need not pay, by the judgment of the court; if I lose it, I need not pay, by the terms

    Therefore I need not pay in any case.

    A dilemma is open to rebuttal only when there is room for a real shift
    in the point of view, not merely a shift in the position of the terms. For
    example, a child might be faced with the following dilemma.

    ILLUSTRATION: Dilemma not open to rebuttal

    I must take either castor oil or bitter cascara.
    If I take castor oil, I shall suffer an ugly taste; and if I take bitter cascara, I shall suffer an ugly taste.
    Therefore I shall suffer an ugly taste in either case.

    This dilemma is not open to rebuttal. There is no room for a real
    shift from pessimism to optimism.

    The following is not a rebuttal but only a meaningless shifting of the
    terms.

    ILLUSTRATION: False rebuttal

    If I take the bitter cascara, I shall escape the ugly taste of castor oil; and if I take the castor oil, I shall
    escape the ugly taste of bitter cascara.

    But I must take either bitter cascara or castor oil.

    Therefore I shall escape an ugly taste in either case.

    Relations of Hypothetical and Disjunctive Propositions 185

    If this dilemma really constituted a rebuttal to the first one, any
    dilemma could be rebutted. But such is not the case. Even though a
    dilemma open to rebuttal and its rebuttal are both fallacious, neither of
    them is so patently empty an argument as this second dilemma about
    the medicine.

Therefore, it is blowing from the west.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the logical structure of this argument and determine whether it is valid. Justify your answer using principles of propositional logic.\n- **Part B**: Compare this argument to the following statement: ''The prisoner is either guilty or not guilty. He is guilty (jury''s verdict). Therefore, he is not guilty.'' Determine the validity of this second argument and explain why it is or is not valid.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the difference between logical validity and the truth of the premises. Provide an example from the text that illustrates this distinction.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of logical structure, validity, and the relationship between premises and conclusions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Ethical Reasoning in Historical Context**\n\nExamine the exchange between Samuel Johnson and the fellow who claimed there is no distinction between virtue and vice. Johnson''s response is: ''If the fellow does not think as he speaks, he is lying; and I cannot see what honor he can propose to himself from having the character of a liar. But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice, why, sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Interpret Johnson''s argument. What is his main point, and how does he use logical reasoning to support it?\n- **Part B**: Compare Johnson''s reasoning to the argument made by the Athenian mother: ''If you act justly, your fellow politicians will hate you; and if you act unjustly, the gods will hate you. But you must act either justly or unjustly. Therefore, you will be hated in either case.'' Determine whether the mother''s argument is logically valid and explain why.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the role of ethical reasoning in the context of the text. How do the examples illustrate the relationship between logic and moral philosophy?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate ethical reasoning with logical structure, demonstrating a clear understanding of both the text and the underlying philosophical concepts.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Logical and Literary Analysis**\n\nThe text includes several excerpts from classical literature, including the passage from Euripides'' ''Iphigenia at Aulis'' where Agamemnon announces his decision to sacrifice his daughter.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Analyze the logical structure of Agamemnon''s argument. Does it follow logically that the winds will swell the sails and Troy will be humbled in the dust? Justify your answer using principles of logical reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Compare this argument to the speech in ''Henry V'' where the king says, ''If we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss; and if to live, the fewer men, the greater share of honor.'' Determine whether this argument is logically valid and explain why.\n- **Part C**: Synthesize the themes of fate, honor, and logical reasoning as presented in the text. How do the literary examples illustrate the intersection of logic and human decision-making?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of both the logical structures and the literary themes presented in the text.'

    Three men had five hats, three white and two black. In a dark room each put on one of the hats and stepped into a lighted room, A first, B next, C last. C, who could see A's and B's hats, said, "I do not know what color my hat is." B, who could see A's hat and who had heard C speak, said, "I do not know what color my hat is." A, who merely heard C and B speak, said, "I do know what color my hat is." What color is A's hat? Express syllogistically the reasoning by which he knew.

    You are given twelve balls that look exactly alike, but one is either lighter or heavier than the others. In three weighings with balance scales that show only comparative weight, find the odd ball. Express syllogistically the reasoning involved in satisfying all the possibilities.

    Either the understanding of ourselves is a constant and lively and ever-renewed obligation of reasonable men or it is not. If it is our obligation, the humanist is something far different from a transmitter of the past, and the subject of his studies is something far subtler and more profound than societies; it is nothing less than a human being.

    Q FALLACIES

    The proper attitude in argument is expressed by Socrates:

    What sort of man am I? I am one of those who would be glad to be refuted when saying a thing that is untrue, glad also to refute another if he said something inexact, not less glad to be refuted than to do it, since I deem it the greater blessing, in proportion as it is a greater good, to be released from that which is the greatest evil than to release another from it.

    —Plato, Gorgias!

    In so far as an argument is fallacious, it is not logical. But as logic is concerned with truth, it is incidentally concerned with the negation of truth, namely errors—falsity and fallacies.

  finalExamQuestion1: |-
    **Logical Deduction in a Hat Puzzle**\n\nThree men (A, B, C) are in a dark room and each puts on one of five hats: three white and two black. They step into a lighted room, with A seeing nothing, B seeing only A's hat, and C seeing both A's and B's hats. The conversation unfolds as follows:\n\n1. C says, "I do not know what color my hat is."
    2. B, hearing C's statement, says, "I do not know what color my hat is."
    3. A, hearing both statements, says, "I do know what color my hat is."
    \n\n**Question**: What color is A's hat?\n\n**Syllogistic Reasoning Requirement**: Express the reasoning that allows A to deduce the color of his hat using logical steps.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include the syllogistic structure of the reasoning and demonstrate a clear understanding of the logic behind each statement made by C and B.
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Solving the Twelve Ball Problem**\n\nYou are given twelve balls, one of which is either lighter or heavier than the others. Using a balance scale and three weighings, determine which ball is the odd one out.\n\n**Question**: What is the logical sequence of weighings that guarantees identification of the odd ball, considering all possible scenarios (lighter or heavier)?\n\n**Sylllogistic Reasoning Requirement**: Express the reasoning involved in the strategy using logical steps that account for all possible outcomes of each weighing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include a step-by-step breakdown of the weighings, the logic behind each decision, and a syllogistic structure that ensures the identification of the odd ball regardless of whether it is lighter or heavier.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analyzing Logical Fallacies in a Textual Argument**\n\nThe text presents a philosophical argument by G. K. Chalmers, discussing the nature of human understanding and the role of the humanist. It includes a quote from Plato''s *Gorgias* about the proper attitude in argument.\n\n**Question**: Identify and explain the logical fallacy present in the argument that "either the understanding of ourselves is a constant obligation or it is not." Then, evaluate how this fallacy relates to the broader discussion of logic and truth in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must analyze the specific fallacy, explain its implications for the argument, and connect it to the text''s emphasis on the negation of truth and the importance of logical reasoning.'

- prompt: |-
    A fallacy is a violation of logical principle disguised under an appearance of validity; it is an error in process. Falsity is an error in fact.
    Fallacy arises from an erroneous relation of propositions; falsity, from
    an erroneous relation of terms. A premise may be false; reasoning may
    be fallacious.

    To discover a fallacy is to discover the reason why the mind was de-
    ceived into regarding error as truth. To classify fallacies is to attempt to
    find common ground for such deception. But a given argument may be
    fallacious for more reasons than one, and hence it may exemplify more
    than one fallacy. Consequently, a classification of fallacies is neither ex-
    haustive nor mutually exclusive.

    A fallacy is either formal or material or both simultaneously.

    Formal fallacies arise from the violation of rules governing the for-
    mal relations of propositions and have been treated where these for-
    mal relations have been treated. The fallacies of opposition are
    violations of the rules of opposition; the commonest one is to assume
    of contraries that when one is false the other is true instead of un-
    known. The fallacies of eduction are two: illicit obversion and illicit
    conversion. The fallacies of the syllogistic relation are: undistributed
    middle term; illicit process of the major term or of the minor term;

    187

    188 The Trivium

    four terms; four propositions; two negative premises; two partial prem-
    ises; merely seeming mediated opposition; sublating the antecedent or
    positing the consequent in the minor premise of a mixed hypotheti-
    cal syllogism; simultaneously positing and sublating both alternatives
    of a disjunction; imperfect disjunction; the dilemmatic fallacy.

    Material fallacies have their root in the matter—in the terms, in the
    ideas, and in the symbols by which the ideas are communicated. They
    vitiate an argument that may be formally correct.

    Aristotle grouped them in two classes: six fallacies in dictione, occa-
    sioned by a hidden assumption not conveyed in the language, and
    seven fallacies extra dictionem, characterized by a hidden false assump-
    tion not warranted by the language in which the ideas are expressed.

- prompt: |-
    Fallacies were devices used in oral controversy in Athens by the Soph-
    ists, who sought not truth but victory over their opponents by these merely
    apparent refutations. These fallacies continue to be used, however, to de-
    ceive others and sometimes even to deceive the one using them.

    FALLACIES ['V DICTIONE

    Fallacies in dictione arise from ambiguity of language, whether of words
    or of construction. They have their root in the grammar (the language)
    that seeks to symbolize the logic (the thought), and they may all be re-
    garded as special instances of the fallacy of four terms. This fallacy is si-
    multaneously a formal and a material fallacy because it both violates a
    rule of the form and lies in the matter. Six types of fallacies in dictione
    may be distinguished: equivocation, amphiboly, composition, division,
    accent, and verbal form.

    Equivocation
    Equivocation is a fallacy occasioned by the ambiguity of a word which
    symbolizes two or more different terms.

    EXAMPLE: Equivocation

    Feathers are light.
    Light is the opposite of darkness.
    .. Feathers are the opposite of darkness.

    Light in the minor premise means "not heavy'; in the major premise it means "not dark."

    Fallacies 189

    Amphiboly

    Amphiboly is a fallacy produced by ambiguity of syntax or grammatical
    structure, such as a misplaced or a dangling modifier, ambiguous ref-
    erence of pronouns, or ambiguity of word order. Such ambiguity is es-
    pecially likely to occur in an uninflected language like English. It is
    always an error in grammar, but, strictly speaking, it occasions the fal-
    lacy of four terms in logic only when the ambiguous sentence becomes
    a premise in a syllogism.

    EXAMPLES: Amphiboly

    The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose.
    —2 Henry VI 1.4.30

    Translated into an inflected language, like Latin, this passage would lose its ambiguity. The argument
    would become syllogistic if the duke should interpret it by adding the minor premise, "! am this
    duke," and conclude, "Therefore | shall depose Henry." Or, if he should give the alternate meaning to
    the major premise and conclude, "Therefore Henry shall depose me."

    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and the content extracted verbatim:

    He told his brother that he had won the prize. (Who won it?)
    Feed a cold and starve a fever.

    Here "feed" is subjunctive. The sentence is a warning; it means: if you feed a cold, you will have a fever to starve. As commonly interpreted, however, "feed" is taken to be imperative, and a meaning just the opposite of the one intended is derived.2

    Clown. I was a gentleman born before my father, for the king's son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two kings called my father brother.

    —The Winter's Tale 5.2.139-143

    The clown has been using the words "gentleman born" to mean "born a gentleman." Literally, the clown is using the word "gentleman" to refer to the social status of the gentleman class, but the reference to his father leaves open the possibility that "gentleman" is a synonym for "man," thus creating a paradox. This quote illustrates both amphiboly and equivocation.

    Composition
    The fallacy of composition occurs when the properties of the parts are
    illicitly predicated of the whole.

    EXAMPLE: Composition

    Sodium and chlorine are toxic elements.
    Toxic elements are harmful.
    Therefore, sodium chloride is harmful.

    Here are present simultaneously four fallacies, one material and three formal:

    1. Composition. Sodium and chlorine are referred to as discrete entities in the premises and as combined in the conclusion.

    2. The formal fallacy of four terms, for composition is a fallacy in dictione.

    3. The formal fallacy of four propositions, for the major premise is a conjunction of two propositions:
    Sodium is a toxic element. Chlorine is a toxic element.

    4. The formal fallacy of an illicit process of the major term.

    Division
    Division, just the reverse of composition, occurs when the properties of
    the whole are illicitly predicated of the parts.

    EXAMPLE: Division

    Nine and seven is sixteen.
    Sixteen is an even number.
    Therefore, nine and seven are even numbers.

    In addition to the material fallacy of division, there are present here also the formal fallacies of four terms and four propositions.

    It is this fallacy of division that produces such erroneous conclusions
    as: A single straw broke the camel's back. A single justice of the
    Supreme Court determined the constitutionality of a law in 4 five-to-
    four decision.

    Accent
    The accent fallacy occurs when a meaning different from that intended
    is conveyed through a special emphasis on certain letters, syllables,
    words, or ideas. Emphasis of words can be produced orally by stress or
    indicated in written language by italics or another visible device. Such
    misleading emphasis may occur in syllables of the same word or in dif-
    ferent words of the same sentence.

    Fallacies 191

    EXAMPLES: Accent

    A master said to his servant: "Co heat this capon's leg," who immediately did eat it. Then his master,
    being angry, Said, "| baid you heat it, with an h." "No, sir," said the servant, "I did heat it with bread."

    This misunderstanding of a word, peculiar to a certain class of Englishmen, is given as an example of
    this fallacy by Thomas Blunderville in The Art of Logic (1599).

    The servants incensed the king.

    Here the alternative pronunciations, in'-censed and in-censed', convey strongly contrasted mean-
    ings and imply different conclusions if a premise is added.

    He is my friend.

    Here not only does the meaning change as the emphasis is made to fall successively on each of the
    words, but an ironical emphasis will convey a meaning which actually contradicts the statement spo-
    ken in an ordinary manner.

    Note that this form of the fallacy of accent must not be confused with amphiboly. In this sentence
    there is no doubt about syntax, whereas there always is in amphiboly.

    Quotations taken out of context are sometimes gross examples of the
    fallacy of accent. For example, the Bible says: There is no God. No one
    can be trusted.

    It is a fact that these propositions are in the Bible, but in their con-
    text the meaning is altogether different: "The fool hath said in his heart:
    There is no God" (Ps. 4:1—2). "I said in my excess: No one can be
    trusted" (Ps.116:11).

- prompt: |-
    To introduce italics into quoted material without stating that one has done so may be an instance of the fallacy of accent. Headlines, arrangement of copy, and the use of different-sized fonts to misrepresent are also examples of the fallacy of accent.

    In extended discourse, by overemphasizing certain aspects of a subject and either slighting or completely neglecting other related aspects, one may, without actual misstatement, convey a very false idea of the subject in its entirety. This is called special pleading or propaganda and is a very frequent source of misrepresentation.

    EXAMPLE: Special pleading or propaganda

    Propaganda is the coloring of the news through overemphasis of some facts and underemphasis or omission of others, for instance at the time of a political campaign.

    In a certain history textbook, after eulogizing the achievements of Roger Bacon, the author re-
    marked that Bacon had been left to die in poverty. He created a very false impression by ignoring
    the fact that in becoming a Franciscan friar, Roger Bacon freely chose both to live and to die in
    poverty.

    Verbal Form
    Verbal form is a fallacy that results from erroneously supposing that similarity in the form of language signifies a corresponding similarity in meaning.

    This fallacy occurs, for instance, when the identity of the prefix or suffix of words leads one to conclude erroneously that they are therefore analogous in meaning. For instance, inspiration and inexplicable are both negative terms, and if in means "not" in the one, it must mean "not" in the other.

    EXAMPLES: Verbal form

    The words flammable and inflammable both mean "easily ignited," and yet the suffix in with flam-
    Mable misleads people into thinking that inflammable means nonflammabie because frequently
    in means *not.'

    John Stuart Mill commits this fallacy when he argues:

    The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible is that people actually see it... . The
    only proof that a sound is audible is that people hear it... . In like manner, the sole evidence it is
    possible to give that anything is desirable is that people do actually desire it.

    Since the whole force of the argument lies in the assumption of a strict analogy between visible, audible, and desirable, the argument fails when it is understood that, according to the dictionary, visible and audible mean "capable of being seen" or "heard," or "actually seen" or "heard," whereas desirable means "worthy of desire" or "that which ought to be desired."

    A fallacy in verbal form may also arise from the similarity of phrases, particularly verb phrases.

    EXAMPLE: Fallacy in verb phrase

    He who sleeps least is most sleepy.
    He who is most sleepy sleeps most.
    .. He who sleeps least sleeps most.

    Here the verb phrases sleeps and sleeps most appear to be contraries; but if the tenses are more carefully discriminated, we have the following valid syllogism (true of normal, healthy persons):
    He who has slept least is most sleepy.
    He who is most sleepy will sleep most.
    - He who has slept least will sleep most.

    A fallacy in verbal form also includes an illicit transition from one category in the ten categories of being to another, as in the following, from substance to relation.

    EXAMPLE: Fallacy in verbal form

    A boy who has six marbles and loses one no longer has what he once had.
    He who no longer has the six marbles he once had has not necessarily lost six marbles.
    ;. He who no longer has what he once had has not necessarily lost it.

    Objects collectively considered are related as members of a given group. If one is lost, all that remain have lost the relation, a member of six, even though as independent substances, they have not been lost.

    FALLACIES EXTRA DICTIONEM

    Common to the seven fallacies extra dictionem is a hidden false assumption not warranted by the language in which the ideas are expressed. The fallacies extra dictionem are fallacy of accident, confusion of absolute and qualified statements, fallacy of consequent, arguing beside the point, false cause, begging the question, and complex question.

- prompt: "Fallacy of Accident  \nThis fallacy arises from the false assumption that whatever is predicable of a subject (usually the middle term) is predicable of its accident (the minor term), and in the same sense; or that whatever is predicable of a term understood in one aspect (for example, specifically or concretely) is predicable of the same term understood in another aspect (for example, generically or abstractly) or vice versa.  \n\nEvery predicate, except one in a definition or an identical proposition, is accidental to its subject in the sense that it is by accident that the given subject and the predicate are related in the given proposition. A lion is an animal. A square is an equilateral. It is an accident that an animal should be a lion rather than a mouse or a horse or that an equilateral figure should be a square rather than a triangle or an octagon. This situation exists whenever the extension of a predicate affirmed is greater than the extension of the subject, in other words, when the proposition is convertible only per accidens, that is, by limitation, hence the name.  \n\nAny one of the three terms of a syllogism may be the source of the fallacy of accident, but most often it is the middle term.  \n\n**EXAMPLE: Fallacy of accident**  \n\nTo communicate knowledge is commendable.  \nTo gossip is to communicate knowledge.  \nTherefore, to gossip is commendable.  \n\nHere knowledge is understood in the generic sense in the major premise and in a specific and even trivial sense hardly worthy of the general name in the minor premise. Therefore, while it is commendable to communicate knowledge understood in its essential, abstract, and general meaning, it is not commendable to communicate trivial or even mischievous information.  \n\nAristotle remarks that the fallacy of accident results when we fail to distinguish the sameness and otherness of terms, or when we substitute an accident for an essential attribute.  \n\nAccording to Renaissance logicians, the fallacy of accident occurs when anything belonging to the substance of something is attributed also to some accident of that substance.

    Fish is not the same that flesh is.
    Flesh is food.
    .. Fish is not food.

    In the first proposition one understands the substance of flesh, and in the second proposition the
    speaker means the accident that is in both flesh and fish. Therefore, the argument is not lawful be-
    cause the speaker referred both the substance and the accident to one and the same subject.

    This man is a witty fellow.
    This man is lame.
    .. This man has a lame wit.

    This is evidently false because the accidents of the body are referred to the substance of the mind.

    Fallacies 195

    The fallacy of accident may seem much like that of equivocation;
    but whereas the fallacy of equivocation involves a shifting of terms, the
    fallacy of accident involves a shifting of usage of the same term. To shift
    from one first imposition to another first imposition on the same word
    is to shift from one term to another, and this is the fallacy of equivoca-
    tion. But to shift from a generic to a specific usage of the same term or
    from first imposition of a term to second or zero imposition, or from first
    to second intention is a shift in usage, and this is the fallacy of accident.

    EXAMPLE: Word In two impositions

    Feathers are light.
    Light4 is an adjective.
    .. Feathers are adjectives.

    Here we have the fallacy of accident because the same term is understood as an adjective and as a
    noun. Light has the same meaning, although not the same usage, in both propositions. It is only
    light in the first proposition that is an adjective.

    Every term can be used in either of the two intentions, and every
    word can be used in each of the three impositions. The intentions and
    impositions are reviewed in the box below.

    Second imposition: grammar

    First imposition and first intention: reference to reality

    Here we have simultaneously two fallacies, accident and equivocation, for in the major premise, light is classified grammatically as "the opposite of darkness"; this is not the same term symbolized by light, meaning "not heavy" in the minor premise.

    196 9 The Trivium

    Every term can be used in either of the two intentions, and every word can be used in each of the three impositions. Particularly enlightening species of the fallacy of accident are those that involve a shift from one plane or plateau of discourse to another by a change of intention or of imposition. The ordinary plane of discourse is that of first imposition and first intention. There are three others: that of second intention, of second imposition, and of zero imposition. A valid argument can be maintained if each term is used consistently in any one of these planes of discourse, but if the same term is shifted from one plane to another, the argument is invalid.

    SHIFT OF IMPOSITION

    The shift of imposition fallacy involves the false assumption that what is true of a word understood in one imposition is true of the same word understood in other impositions. Consider the following syllogism: A banana is yellow. Yellow is an adjective. Therefore, banana is an adjective. Here yellow is understood in first imposition in the minor premise and in second imposition in the major.

    The parts of speech and other grammatical concepts are terms of second imposition in the sense that when used as predicates, that is, as modes of conceiving their subjects, they cause their subjects to be understood in second imposition, that is, as grammatical entities. But the terms of grammar may themselves be understood in all of the impositions, as the following examples illustrate.

    Fallacious syllogisms occur when the part of speech itself is shifted from one imposition to another in the premises.

    EXAMPLES: Grammar terms used in two impositions

    Carry is a verb.
    Verb is a noun.
    Therefore, carry is a noun.

    Verb shifts from first to second imposition in the premises.

    Hippopotamus is a noun.
    Noun is a monosyllable.
    Therefore, hippopotamus is a monosyllable.

    Noun shifts from first to zero imposition in the premises.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Fallacy of Shift of Imposition**\n\nExplain why the syllogism: ''A banana is yellow. Yellow is an adjective. Therefore, banana is an adjective.'' is a fallacious argument based on the shift of imposition fallacy.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the different impositions used for the term ''yellow'' in the premises.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why the conclusion is invalid by showing that the term ''yellow'' is not consistently used in the same imposition in both premises.\n- **Step 3**: Relate this to the text''s explanation that the shift of imposition makes an argument invalid if the same term is used in different impositions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the shift of imposition fallacy as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Reasoning with Grammatical Concepts**\n\nEvaluate the following syllogism for validity based on the text''s explanation of the shift of imposition fallacy: ''Carry is a verb. Verb is a noun. Therefore, carry is a noun.''\n- **Step 1**: Determine the impositions used for the term ''verb'' in the premises.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why this syllogism is invalid, citing the text''s example where ''verb'' shifts from first to second imposition.\n- **Step 3**: Contrast this with a valid syllogism where all terms are consistently used in the same imposition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze the structure of the argument and apply the text''s definition of the shift of imposition fallacy.'

    Valid syllogisms occur when the term of grammar is understood in first, zero, or second imposition throughout, and the argument is not erroneously shifted from one plane of discourse to another.

    EXAMPLES: Valid syllogisms with terms in second and zero imposition

    Sing is a verb.
    A verb has tense.
    -, Sing has tense.

    Here verb is understood in the first imposition in both premises, and sing is understood in second imposition in the minor premise and in the conclusion.

    Adjective is often mispronounced.
    A word often mispronounced is often misspelled.
    . Adjective is often misspelled.

    Here adjective is understood in zero imposition both in the minor premise and in the conclusion.

    The terms of phonetics and of spelling, or orthography, are terms of zero imposition in the sense that when used as predicates, that is, as modes of conceiving their subjects, they cause their subjects to be understood in zero imposition, that is, as mere sounds or notations. But that the terms of phonetics and of orthography may themselves be understood in all of the impositions is illustrated by the following examples.

    EXAMPLES: Terms of phonetics and orthography used in all impositions

    The following is a fallacious syllogism in which the terms of phonetics or orthography are themselves shifted in imposition in the premises.

    Cat is a notation.
    Notation has three syllables.
    ". Cat has three syllables.

    Here Notation is understood in first imposition in the minor premise and in zero imposition in the major.

    The following are valid syllogisms in which the term of phonetics or orthography is understood in first or in second imposition throughout and in which, consequently, the argument is not shifted from one plane of discourse to another.

    Indivisibility is a polysyllable.
    A polysyllable may be divided between lines.
    .. Indivisibility may be divided between lines.

    Invisibility is a notation.
    A notation is visible.
    .. Invisibility is visible.

    In these syllogisms, polysyllable and notation are understood in first imposition in both premises.
    indivisibility and invisibility are understood in zero imposition in the minor premise and in the conclusion.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Imposition in Syllogisms**\n\nExplain the difference between the first, zero, and second impositions as they relate to the terms in syllogisms, using the examples provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define each imposition type based on the text''s explanation.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the definitions to the example where ''Sing'' is a verb (first imposition) and ''Sing has tense'' (second imposition).\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the term ''adjective'' is considered in zero imposition in both the minor premise and the conclusion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly distinguish the three impositions and directly reference the text''s examples to demonstrate your understanding.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Valid and Fallacious Syllogisms**\n\nEvaluate the validity of the syllogism: ''Cat is a notation. Notation has three syllables. Therefore, Cat has three syllables.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the imposition of the term ''notation'' in both the major and minor premises.\n- **Step 2**: Determine whether the argument shifts from one plane of discourse to another, as described in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this syllogism to the valid examples provided in the text (e.g., ''Invisibility is a notation. A notation is visible. Therefore, Invisibility is visible.'')\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must explicitly reference the text''s criteria for valid syllogisms and clearly identify whether the given syllogism is valid or fallacious, explaining the reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Phonetics and Orthography Terms**\n\nThe text describes that terms of phonetics and orthography are understood in zero imposition when used as predicates, but can be understood in any imposition when necessary. Construct a syllogism that illustrates this concept, using the following structure:\n\nPremise 1: [Term] is a [phonetics/orthography] term.\nPremise 2: [Phonetics/orthography] terms have [property].\nConclusion: [Term] has [property].\n\n- **Step 1**: Choose a term that can be understood in zero imposition as a phonetics term and in first imposition as an orthography term.\n- **Step 2**: Ensure that the syllogism does not shift from one plane of discourse to another, as per the text''s criteria.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the term is used in both impositions and why this is valid according to the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogism must demonstrate an understanding of the flexibility of phonetics and orthography terms across different impositions, with clear reasoning based on the text.'

- prompt: |-

    A noun may be the object of a preposition.
    .. Notation may be object of a preposition.

    Here notation is understood in second intention in both the minor premise and in the conclusion.

    SHIFT OF INTENTION

    Shift of intention involves the false assumption that what is true of a
    term understood in first intention is true of the same term understood
    in second intention, and vice versa.

    EXAMPLES: Shift of intention

    A lion is an animal.
    Animal is a genus.
    .. A lion is a genus.

    A square is equilateral.
    Equilateral is a differentia.
    .. A square is a differentia.

    In these syllogisms, animal and equilateral are understood in first intention in the minor premise
    and in second intention in the major.

    The predicables are terms of second intention in the sense that when
    used as predicates, that is, as modes of conceiving their subjects, they
    cause their subjects to be understood in second intention, that is, as
    concepts, as mental entities. The predicables themselves may be un-
    derstood in both the intentions.

    In these fallacious syllogisms the predicable itself is shifted from first
    to second intention in the premises.

    EXAMPLES: Shift of intention

    Animal is a genus.
    Genus is a predicable.
    .. Animal is a predicable.

    Mirthful is a property.
    Property is a predicable.
    .. Mirthful is a predicable.

    in these syllogisms, genus and property are understood in first intention in the minor premise and
    in second intention in the major.

    In valid syllogisms the predicable is understood in the same inten-
    tion in both premises, and the argument is not shifted from one plane
    of discourse to another.

    EXAMPLES: Valid syllogisms with terms in second intention

    Animal is a genus.
    A genus is divisible into species.
    .. Animal is divisible into species.

    Mirthful is a property.
    A property is a term convertible with its subject.
    .. Mirthful is a term convertible with its subject.

    In these syllogisms, genus and property are understood in first intention (that is, predicatively) in
    both premises; animal and mirthful are understood in second intention (that is, reflexively) in both
    the minor premise and in the conclusion.

    Fallacy of Consequent
    This fallacy arises from the false assumption that an A proposition is convertible simply, when it is not. The material fallacy of consequent is present whenever one of the following formal fallacies is present: an illicit process of the major or the minor term, an undistributed middle term, sublating the antecedent, positing the consequent. As we have noted, when a premise is an A proposition that is a definition, its predicate is distributed through the matter, and therefore a fallacy of nondistribution is avoided; likewise, when a premise is a sine qua non hypothetical proposition, no fallacy can result. Since, however, a premise is seldom a definition or a sine qua non hypothetical proposition, the material fallacy of consequent is one of the most frequent causes of error in reasoning. It is most likely to occur in an enthymeme in which the major premise is only implicit.

    Since we can reduce a hypothetical proposition to a simple categorical proposition, we can apply to a simple proposition the terminology of the hypothetical and call the subject of a simple proposition the antece­dent and its predicate the consequent. Therefore, in both the simple and the mixed hypothetical syllogism, we distinguish two types of the material fallacy of consequent, both resulting from the nonconvertibility of a premise: one falsely assumes that because a consequent follows upon its antecedent, the antecedent must likewise follow upon its consequent (positing the consequent); the other falsely assumes that from the contrary of the antecedent the contrary of the consequent must follow (sublating the antecedent).

    In argument, the fallacy of consequent leads a disputant to think he has refuted his opponent when he has shown the unsoundness of the reasons advanced in favor of the point urged. This amounts to the fallacy of sublating the antecedent, for, as we noted, although the conclusion does follow from true premises, one cannot disprove a conclusion by showing that its premises are false; it may be supported by other, true premises.6 Nor does a disputant necessarily gain assent to his premises by

    getting his opponent to concede the truth of his conclusion, for to suppose that the truth of the premises follows from the truth of the conclusion is the fallacy of positing the consequent in the minor premise.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Hypothetical Propositions and Fallacies**\n\nGiven the definition of a hypothetical proposition and the fallacy of consequent as described in the text, identify and explain the logical error in the following argument: \n\n"If a person is a student, then they are educated.\nJohn is educated.\nTherefore, John is a student."\n\n- **Step 1**: Classify the argument as a form of syllogism (simple or mixed hypothetical).\n- **Step 2**: Determine which type of fallacy of consequent is being committed (positing the consequent or sublating the antecedent).\n- **Step 3**: Justify your answer by referencing the definitions provided in the text (e.g., "The fallacy of positing the consequent occurs when...").\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly identify the fallacy and explain why the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Logical Reasoning to Fallacy Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the following two arguments and determine whether they commit the fallacy of consequent. If they do, specify which type (positing the consequent or sublating the antecedent) and explain the logical flaw. If they do not, explain why they are logically sound.\n\n**Argument 1**:\n\nIf a plant is a cactus, then it has spines.\n\nThis plant has spines.\n\nTherefore, this plant is a cactus.\n\n**Argument 2**:\n\nIf a person is a doctor, then they are a professional.\n\nThis person is not a doctor.\n\nTherefore, this person is not a professional.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each argument, classify the type of syllogism used.\n- **Part B**: For each argument, determine if the fallacy of consequent is committed. If so, specify the type and explain the flaw.\n- **Part C**: Compare the two arguments and explain how they differ in terms of logical structure and the fallacy (if any).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must directly reference the definitions and examples provided in the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Reasoning with Logical Fallacies**\n\nConstruct an original argument that commits the fallacy of consequent and explain why it is a fallacy using the definitions from the text. Your argument must include:\n- A clear hypothetical proposition (if-then statement)\n- A premise that is a consequent (or the contrary of an antecedent)\n- A conclusion that does not logically follow from the premises\n- An explicit explanation of the fallacy using the terminology from the text (e.g., "This argument commits the fallacy of positing the consequent because...")\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Write the argument.\n- **Part B**: Identify which type of fallacy is committed (positing the consequent or sublating the antecedent).\n- **Part C**: Explain why the conclusion is logically invalid using the definitions and reasoning provided in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must demonstrate a clear understanding of the fallacy and its implications in logical reasoning.'

- prompt: "or ignoratio elenchi  \nThis fallacy arises from falsely assuming that the point at issue has been  \ndisproved when one merely resembling it has been disproved; the point  \nreally at issue is consequently ignored.  \n\nIgnoratio elenchi means ignorance of the nature of refutation. To re-  \nfute an opponent, one must prove the contradictory of his statement;  \nand this is done only when the same predicate —not merely the name  \nbut the reality—is denied of the same subject in the same respect, re-  \nlation, manner, and time in which it was asserted. To establish some  \nother conclusion is to dodge the issue and to argue beside the point.'  \n\nOne might think he has refuted the proposition: \"The President of  \nthe United States governs the whole country\" when, by citing the re-  \nsults of an election, he has established the proposition: The President  \nof the United States was not elected by the majority of Americans. He  \nhas not, however, denied the same predicate as was affirmed in the  \nproposition he attempted to refute. Authority to govern comes from the  \nvote of the electoral college, not a majority vote in the election.  \n\nOne also ignores the issue and argues beside the point, when ac-  \ncused of dishonesty, one replies that many others are doing the same  \nthing, falsely assuming that when the number of dishonest people is  \nvery large, ipso facto, each ceases to be dishonest.  \n\nAn argument that deals with the point at issue is argumentum ad rem  \n(literally an \"argument to the thing\"). Arguments that evade the issue  \nare given special names to signify on which irrelevant grounds they are  \nbased: argumentum ad hominem, argumentum ad populum, argumen-  \ntum ad misericordiam, argumentum ad baculum, argumentum ad igno-  \nrantiam, and argumentum ad verecundiam.  \n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  \n\nThe argumentum ad hominem (literally, an \"argument to the man\") fal-  \nlacy confuses the point at issue with the people concerned. Attacks on  \nthe character and conduct of people and personal abuse or praise are  \nsubstituted for reasoning on the point at issue.8 Argumentum ad  \nhominem seeks to persuade by unsound ethos. In rhetoric ethos means  \nestablishing the speaker or writer as one worthy of making an argument.\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Identifying and Correcting a Logical Fallacy**\n\nConsider the following argument: ''The President of the United States governs the whole country.'' A counterargument claims that the President was not elected by the majority of Americans.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the logical fallacy committed in the counterargument. Use the text''s definition of ''ignoratio elenchi'' to justify your answer.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the counterargument fails to address the original claim. Use the text''s explanation of the relationship between the predicate and the subject in refutation.\n- **Part C**: Propose a valid counterargument that directly addresses the original claim. Your response must reference the text''s distinction between the electoral college and majority vote.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly define ''ignoratio elenchi'' and demonstrate understanding of how the fallacy relates to the predicate and subject in logical refutation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing an Argumentum Ad Hominem Example**\n\nConsider the following exchange: A student is accused of cheating. The teacher responds: ''You''re a lazy person, so you must be cheating.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the logical fallacy committed in the teacher''s response. Use the text''s definition of ''argumentum ad hominem'' to justify your answer.\n- **Part B**: Explain why this fallacy is ineffective in proving the original claim (cheating). Use the text''s explanation of ''ethos'' and how it relates to logical argumentation.\n- **Part C**: Suggest a valid alternative response that addresses the issue of cheating directly. Your response must reference the text''s emphasis on reasoning based on the point at issue rather than personal characteristics.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly define ''argumentum ad hominem'' and demonstrate understanding of how it differs from a sound argument based on ethos.'

     EXAMPLE: Argumentum ad hominem

    To argue that, because a certain lawyer has defrauded his relatives by getting a larger share of the
    inheritance than was really intended by the testator, that lawyer's arguments alleging that a certain
    bank official is an embezzler are worthless.

    it is, however, legitimate to argue that, because a witness is known to have lied in court, his present
    testimony ought not to be readily accepted.

    ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM

    The argumentum ad populum fallacy arises from substituting an appeal
    to the passions and prejudices of the people for logical reasoning on the
    point issue, for example, the appeal to race hatred by persecutors of

    the Jews.

    ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM

    The argumentum ad misericordiam (literally, an "argument to pity") fallacy replaces reason with a plea for sympathy. It is used by many criminal lawyers to divert the jurors' minds from the real question—guilty or not guilty—by moving them to pity and to a favorable verdict because
    the defendant is, for instance, a beautiful woman or a single parent. A
    scofflaw might argue that he should not receive a parking ticket because
    he was donating blood while the car was parked illegally. A classic ex-
    ample of argumentum ad misericordiam is that the defendant who mur-
    dered his mother and father should receive sympathy because he is an
    orphan.

    ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM

    Argumentum ad baculum is the appeal to the "big stick." The issue is
    ignored in an attempt to inspire fear of the consequences of adopting a
    proposed opinion or program, or of allowing a movement branded as
    dangerous to gain strength. The threat of social ostracism or loss of a po-
    sition might be used to deter a person from exposing fraud in the work
    place. A bully might persuade by threatening violence.

    ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIAM

    Argumentum ad ignorantiam is the use of an argument that sounds convincing to others because they are ignorant of the weakness of the argument and of the facts that stand against it.?

    A theory, such as evolution, is declared worthless because it has not been proved.
    No one has ever proved that aliens exist; therefore aliens do not exist.

    No one has ever proved that aliens do not exist; therefore aliens exist.

    Argumentum ad populum, ad misericordiam, ad baculum and ad ig-
    norantiam also demonstrate an unsound use of pathos. Pathos is a term
    used in rhetoric to mean that a speaker or a writer tries to establish
    empathy with the audience. Pathos is fully explained in Chapter
    Eleven.

    ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM

    Argumentum ad verecundiam is an appeal to the prestige or respect in
    which a proponent of an argument is held as a guarantee of the truth
    of the argument. This is unwarranted when reasoning about an issue is
    required and only the authority of its upholders or opponents is given
    consideration. It is perfectly legitimate to supplement reasoning with
    authority (argumentum ad auctoritatem), but it is fallacious to substitute
    authority for reasoning in matters capable of being understood by rea-
    son. This fallacy is particularly pernicious when the authority cited is
    not an authority on the matter under discussion. For example, celebrity
    endorsement of consumer products or political causes constitutes ar-
    gumentum ad verecundiam.

    False Cause
    The fallacy of false cause is present also when something accidental to
    a thing is held to determine its nature, character, or value, for that
    which is not a cause is then held to be a cause.

    EXAMPLE: False cause

    Football games are evil because some people gamble away too much money on the results.

    A thing is not evil merely because some people abuse it. In such instances, the cause of the evil is
    Ml in the thing itself, but in those who make it an occasion for gratifying their own evil propensi-
    ties.

    Note that Post hoc ergo propter hoc is an inductive fallacy that is
    sometimes loosely identified with the deductive fallacy of false cause.

- prompt: |-
    False cause makes a false assumption about a reason, which is a cause of knowing; post hoc ergo propter hoc makes a false assumption about a cause of being. The inductive fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc results from the false assumption that whatever happens before a given event is the cause of that event. The error is increased by imperfect observation; often events that occur without the alleged antecedent cause pass unnoticed. A black cat crosses a person's path. The next day the stock market falls in value. The person concludes that the black cat caused the bad luck but has failed to notice how often a black cat has crossed his path and no bad luck has followed. But even if bad luck always followed, the black cat would not therefore be a cause of the misfortune, for it could not be.

    Begging the Question
    Begging the question is the fallacy of assuming in the premises the very proposition to be proved, namely, the conclusion—or a proposition wide enough to include the one to be proved. The conclusion assumed in the premises is usually hidden under synonyms, so that the identities of the propositions are less obvious.

    EXAMPLES: Begging the question

    The tautological (repetition of the same sense in different words) argument:
    William Shakespeare is famous because his plays are known all over the world.

    The shuttle argument:

    "That boy is insane." "Why do you think so?" "Because he murdered his mother." "Why did he mur-
    der her?" "Because he is insane."

    It may be a fact that the boy is insane and that may be the reason why he murdered his mother, but
    to reason without begging the question, other evidence of his insanity must be offered.

    Arguing in a circle:

    This differs from the shuttle argument only by the addition of one or more propositions, which
    causes the argument to go around in a circle instead of merely shuttling back and forth: "This movie
    is the best of the decade." "How can you prove that?" "The New York Times says so." "So what if the
    New York Times says so?" "The New York Times is the most respected paper in the entertainment
    industry." "How do you know that?" "Because they always pick the best movies of the decade."

    The question-begging epithet is probably the most common instance of this fallacy. It is a phrase or a single word that assumes the point to be proved.

    206 = The Trivium

    Complex Question
    The complex question fallacy is somewhat similar to that of begging the question. Begging the question assumes in the premises the proposition to be proved, and the complex question assumes in the question a part of what belongs wholly to the answer.

    The fallacy of complex question occurs when, in answer to a compound question, one demands a simple answer, whereas the correct answer would divide the question and answer it part by part. Cross-examiners often employ this device to trap a witness into contradicting himself, thereby weakening the value of his testimony in favor of the opposite side. Examples of this fallacy include: Why did you steal my watch? When did you stop flirting? Where did you hide the body of the woman you murdered? How much time have you wasted studying impractical subjects like philosophy and music?

    EXERCISES

    Analyze the following arguments, expanding, if necessary, those that are abridged. Name the type. If the argument is fallacious, it is necessary to explain clearly wherein the fallacy lies and to name it. If there are two or more fallacies present, name each one.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Deduction in Argumentation**\n\nEvaluate the validity of the following syllogism: ''This statue is a work of art. This statue is mine. Therefore, it is my work of art.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the structure of the syllogism using traditional logic terms (e.g., major premise, minor premise, conclusion).\n- **Step 2**: Determine if the argument is valid or invalid based on formal logic principles.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your conclusion by referencing the logical rules of syllogistic reasoning provided in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly state whether the argument is valid or invalid and reference at least two logical principles from the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Fallacious Reasoning**\n\nExamine the following argument: ''Man is an animal. Animal is a genus. A genus is divisible into species. Therefore, man is divisible into species.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the logical fallacy in this argument using the definitions of logical terms from the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a corrected version of the argument that maintains the original reasoning but avoids the fallacy.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of categorical logic and the distinction between valid and invalid inferences as presented in the text.'

    Logic is the normative science which directs the operations of the in-
    tellect so as to attain truth. Just as metaphysics, or ontology, deals with
    all things as they are in their most abstract, their most general, and,
    therefore, their one common aspect—being—so logic deals with all
    that is thought in its most general aspect —truth.

    The requirements of truth are:

    1 What is thought must represent what is. (This is the norm of con-
    ception and of induction.)

    2 Thoughts must be consistent among themselves. (This is the
    norm of deduction.)

    The first requirement is concerned with the material of reasoning;
    the second, with the reasoning itself. Both are necessary.

    Deductive or formal logic is the only logic in the sense that it alone
    discovers the rules by which we think and reason correctly. But the ma-
    terial of thinking, the terms and propositions, must come ultimately
    from our experience by means of conception and induction. These
    processes therefore are preliminary to reasoning.

    ANALOGY: Connection between deduction and induction

    Raw cotton is necessary to the manufacture of muslin, organdy, and lace. But it is the machines that
    produce the difference between these kinds of cotton goods. It is with the machine and its opera-
    tion that manufacturing is specifically concerned. The production and acquisition of raw material are
    not, strictly speaking, problems of manufacturing; they are preliminary, and prerequisite, to it.

    ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE

    Knowledge —that is, whatever information the mind possesses—is de-
    rived from either the operation of one's own powers or from faith.

    209
    210 = The Trivium

    Human Powers
    One acquires knowledge through one's own powers. The sense powers
    acquire an immediate perception of external objects, and the intellec-
    tual powers act on data provided by the senses.

    SENSE POWERS

    The sense powers comprise the external senses—sight, hearing, touch,
    taste, smell—as well as the internal senses. The internal senses include
    the imagination, which produces and retains phantasms; memory,
    which recalls and recognizes them as previously experienced; the com-
    mon or central sense, which discriminates, coordinates, and synthesizes
    the sensations; and instinct, by which a sentient being estimates an ob-
    ject as conducive or not conducive to its physical well being.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Norms**\n\nUsing the definitions of truth from the text, evaluate the following argument: ''All humans are mortal. Socrates is human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify which of the two requirements of truth (conception/induction or deduction) apply to this argument.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the argument satisfies the requirement of truth.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the argument is valid based on the text''s explanation of deductive reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the two requirements of truth and demonstrate understanding of how deduction ensures logical validity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Knowledge Acquisition**\n\nThe text distinguishes between knowledge acquired through one''s own powers and knowledge derived from faith. Consider the following scenario: A student is trying to solve a complex logic problem.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the student might acquire knowledge through their own powers, referencing the role of sense powers and intellectual processes.\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with knowledge derived from faith, providing an example of how faith could contribute to understanding the problem.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the relationship between knowledge acquisition and the three components of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, logic).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanation of knowledge sources and the trivium''s components, demonstrating a clear understanding of their interrelations.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Analogies**\n\nThe text uses an analogy between deduction and induction, comparing them to cotton and machines. Analyze this analogy to explain the relationship between these two forms of reasoning.\n- **Part A**: Explain the analogy''s relevance to the distinction between deduction and induction.\n- **Part B**: Apply this analogy to a real-world scenario where both deduction and induction are used.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the text''s claim that ''deductive or formal logic is the only logic'' in the context of this analogy.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the analogy and its implications for logical reasoning, as well as the text''s position on the nature of logic.'

- prompt: |-
    The senses can operate intuitively or indirectly. Intuitive refers to the
    direct or immediate perception of the proper sensibles—color, sound,
    etc. Indirect refers to the indirect perception of the common sensibles,
    which may be perceived by more than one sense. For example, motion,
    rest, figure, and size may be perceived through both sight and touch;
    number, distance, direction, duration, and rhythm, through sight,
    touch, and hearing.

    Note that the constructive or fictive imagination can operate by
    combining phantasms, for example: mermaid, satyr, centaur, griffin.

    INTELLECTUAL POWERS

    Intellectual powers comprise the intellect, which seeks truth; the ra-
    tional memory; and the will, which seeks good. The intellect can op-
    erate intuitively (abstraction: conception, induction).

    EXAMPLES: Intellectual intuition

    Metaphysical: Every effect must have an adequate cause.

    Logical: Contradictory propositions cannot both be true.
    Mathematical: Things equal! to the same thing are equal to each other.
    Moral: Good ought to be done and evil avoided.

    Psychological: My consciousness testifies that my will is free.

    The intellect can also act inferentially, which includes both imme-
    diate and mediate or syllogistic inference.

    Faith

    INDU

    A Brief Summary of Induction

    Faith includes all that one knows from the testimony of another. This
    other may be human—parents, teachers, companions, books, maga-
    zines, newspapers, radio, etc.—or divine—God communicating a reve-
    lation directly or by miracles authenticating the message of His agent
    (angel, prophet, apostle, etc.).

    The topics of invention (see Chapter Six) draw material for reason-
    ing either from the exercise of one's own powers (the first sixteen top-
    ics) or from faith (the testimony of others).

- prompt: |-
    Psychology, the philosophy of mind, explains the process by which concepts and judgments are obtained from the real world. Induction, like conception, is abstractive, intuitive; but whereas conception is the abstraction of the essence, and its product is a concept expressed in a term, induction is the drawing forth and perception of a relation, and its product is a judgment expressed in a proposition. Neither process is one of merely counting or adding instances; neither is a generalization from particulars, or an inference of any sort; both are intuitions of truth drawn from reality.

    The basis of conception and of intuitive induction is the same: only individuals exist, but they exist as we see them in nature, according to type. The essence is that which makes an individual a member of his species, or type; consequently, the concept, which is the intellectual apprehension of the essence present in the individual, is equally applicable to every member of the species. Similarly, a necessary general proposition which expresses the intellectual apprehension of a fundamental relation, such as cause and effect, present in the individual as a member of his species must be present in every other member of the same species.

    ACTION: A FORM OF INTUITION

    Induction is not a form of inference; it is a form of intuition. Every general proposition serving as a premise in a syllogistic inference is either the conclusion of a syllogism or of a series of syllogisms made up solely of general propositions or an induction or intuition drawn from nature. For there is no correct formula of inference by which a general proposition can be derived as a conclusion from empirical premises, which alone express our knowledge of particular facts. (Rule 10 of the general rules of the syllogism states: "If one or both premises are empirical, the conclusion must be empirical.")

    211
    212 = ‘The Trivium

    Therefore, every general proposition is derived either directly or ultimately from induction. Induction is a mental act but not an inference. It is preliminary and prerequisite to inference; it is an intuition of truth, either general or empirical.

    Types of induction
    There are three distinct kinds of induction, none of which is inferential.

    ENUMERATIVE INDUCTION

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Intuition and Inference in Psychology**\n\nCompare and contrast the processes of conception and induction as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key characteristics of each process (e.g., abstraction, intuition, general propositions).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how both processes are rooted in the ''intuition of truth drawn from reality'' as per the text.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why induction is not considered a form of inference but rather a form of intuition.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definitions of conception and induction and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct roles in acquiring knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Inductive Reasoning in Logic**\n\nGiven the text''s assertion that ''every general proposition is derived either directly or ultimately from induction,'' explain how this principle applies to the following scenario:\n- **Scenario**: A student observes that the sun has risen every morning for the past 100 days.\n- **Step 1**: Use the concept of enumerative induction to justify the student''s conclusion that ''the sun will rise tomorrow.''\n- **Step 2**: Discuss the limitations of this inductive reasoning based on the text''s distinction between general propositions and empirical premises.\n- **Step 3**: Propose an alternative explanation for the sun''s daily rising that does not rely on induction, citing the text''s discussion of necessary general propositions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s concepts of induction, inference, and general propositions, and demonstrate an understanding of their relationship to empirical observation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Inductive and Deductive Reasoning**\n\nThe text describes three types of induction, with enumerative induction being the most common. However, it also states that ''induction is not a form of inference; it is a form of intuition.'' Consider the following argument:\n- **Argument**: ''All swans are white. Therefore, the next swan I see will be white.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify whether this argument is inductive or deductive based on the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why this argument is not a valid syllogism, citing the text''s discussion of syllogistic inference and the role of induction.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a revised version of the argument that aligns with the text''s view of induction as an intuition of truth drawn from reality.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s distinction between inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and the nature of general propositions.'

- prompt: |-
    Enumerative induction? is the assertion of a numerically definite plural empirical proposition as a result of observing facts and counting instances, for example: fifty-three people were killed in automobile accidents in that city last year. This is the least important kind of induction, hardly worthy to be called such. Its chief value lies in contributing ascertained facts to be used in deduction or in other kinds of induction.

    A statistical deduction is a conclusion in a syllogism whose minor premise is an enumerative induction and whose major premise is a statistical or mathematical law, usually expressed in a formula. The conclusion is the statement of a numerically definite probability. For example, an insurance company bases its rates on the scientifically calculated probable number of deaths in a particular group— designated by age, occupation, locality—in a year. Vital statistics provide the minor premise for this statistical deduction, and a mathematical formula for the calculation of probability is the major. The conclusion is a statement of numerically definite probability, sufficiently accurate to be the basis of a sound business enterprise.

    INTUITIVE INDUCTION
    Intuitive induction is the psychological act of asserting a self-evident proposition as true. This is by far the most important kind.

    If the self-evident proposition is empirical, it is a datum of sense-knowledge and is relative to the sentient individual making the intuitive induction. An example is: The grass is green. A blind person could not make this induction.

    If the self-evident proposition is general, it is a principle of intellectual knowledge and is relative to human reason and to the knowledge of the terms possessed by the individual making the intuitive induction. For example: The whole is greater than any of its parts.

    A Brief Summary of Induction 213

    DIALECTICAL OR PROBLEMATIC INDUCTION

    Dialectical or problematic induction is the psychological act of asserting a proposition, whether general or empirical, as a possibility, without any calculation of its probability. It is an intuition of the compatibility of the terms.

    EXAMPLES: Dialectical induction

    A regular polygon may have a million sides.
    This child may become the President of the United States.

- prompt: "Nature and Purpose of Induction  \nInduction is the legitimate derivation of general propositions from in-  \ndividual instances. What is invariably observed in them must be essen-  \ntial to their nature. Induction is a method for the discovery of truth, not  \na process of proof or reasoning about truth.  \n\nThe physical order is, however, too complex to permit the mental  \nact of intuitive induction without much preliminary work. Scientific  \nmethodology, the methods of science, are concerned with this prelim-  \ninary work. They are systematic procedures for the investigation of nat-  \nural phenomena. Their aim is to separate what is essential or typical  \nfrom what is accidental or fortuitous and to present to the mind precise,  \nrelevant, simple data. The mind then abstracts the inductive judgment  \nby an intuitive act as simple and spontaneous as that by which it ab-  \nstracts the concept directly from sense data.  \n\nScientific methodology is not a mental act at all but a safeguard to  \nprecision in the investigation of nature. It is preliminary to induction  \nfrom complex phenomena, just as induction itself is preliminary to de-  \nduction. Induction and deduction are distinct, but in practice they go  \nhand in hand.  \n\nEach of the special sciences aims to abstract from the complex nat-  \nural phenomenon laws governing that aspect of nature with which it is  \nconcerned. For example, mathematics is concerned only with quantity;  \nphysics, with motion; anatomy, with the structure of living organisms;  \neconomics, with human activities in making a living.  \n\nANALOGY: Special sciences  \n\nPetroleum is a complex natural substance from which are abstracted by fractional distillation diverse  \nsubstances, Among them are gasoline, benzine, naptha, kerosene, vaseline, paraffin, artificial asphalt,  \nand mothhbalis. The distinctive characteristic of each of these products is due to (1) the abstraction  \nof part from the whole (compare the special sciences, each of which deals only with a selected phase  \nof nature) by means of fractional distillation (compare induction) and in some instances by means of  \n(2) a process of manufacture (compare deduction) which transforms the natural product by means  \nof machinery (compare the mind). Thus the final products owe their being to nature's gifts modifieq  \nby human ingenuity.\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Induction and Deduction**\n\nExplain how the text defines induction and deduction, and how they relate to the special sciences (e.g., mathematics, physics, anatomy, economics) described in the passage.\n- **Step 1**: Define induction and deduction based on the text''s explanation of their purposes and methods.\n- **Step 2**: Relate each concept to the example of the special sciences, using the text''s description of how they abstract from complex phenomena.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the claim that ''induction and deduction are distinct, but in practice they go hand in hand'' using the examples provided.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions of induction and deduction from the text and apply them to the examples of the special sciences, demonstrating an understanding of their interdependence.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Scientific Methodology**\n\nUsing the text''s description of scientific methodology, explain how it functions as a ''safeguard to precision'' in the investigation of natural phenomena.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the purpose of scientific methodology as outlined in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the systematic procedures of scientific methodology help distinguish essential from accidental aspects of natural phenomena.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from the text (e.g., the process of fractional distillation of petroleum) to illustrate how methodology ensures precision in data collection and analysis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly link the text''s explanation of scientific methodology to the example given, showing how it supports the idea of precision in natural investigation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Analogy and Special Sciences**\n\nThe text uses the analogy of petroleum distillation to explain the relationship between induction, deduction, and special sciences.\n- **Part A**: Identify the analogy used in the text and explain how it relates to the concepts of induction and deduction.\n- **Part B**: Using the analogy, explain how the process of fractional distillation mirrors the role of special sciences in abstracting from complex natural phenomena.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that ''induction is only applicable to natural phenomena.'' Your example must reference the text''s explanation of how deduction is used in the distillation process and how this relates to the role of the mind in abstracting concepts.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the analogy and the text''s explanation of induction and deduction, demonstrating an understanding of their roles in both natural and conceptual contexts.'

- prompt: |-
    The aim of every science is the knowledge of facts through their
    causes. This is true of both deductive and inductive sciences. In de-
    duction we know the fact, the conclusion, through its causes, the prem-
    ises. In induction we apprehend the cause common to a number of
    observed facts; that cause is a principle, a middle term, by which their
    relation can be understood.

    We shall consider first the nature of causality, then the uniformity of
    causation, and lastly the ways in which the scientific method aids in dis-
    covering causes.

    Causality
    Since induction is concerned mainly with the investigation of causes,
    it is important to understand the distinction between a cause, a condi-
    tion, and a special type of condition called a determining agent, as well
    as the four metaphysical causes.

    CAUSE

    A cause is that which has a positive influence in making a thing be what
    it is. To the sum of its causes, it owes every one of its characteristics. A
    cause is nota mere antecedent in a time sequence. For instance, day and
    night follow each other, but they do not cause each other. The assump-
    tion that the antecedent in a time sequence is a cause is the inductive fal-
    lacy post hoc ergo propter hoc, which is explained in Chapter Nine.

    CONDITION

    A condition is that which in any way enables a cause to act in produc-
    ing the effect, but to which the effect owes none of its characteristics.
    For instance, light is a condition requisite to the carving of a statue;
    food, to the health and competence of the sculptor; scaffolding, to the
    decoration of the ceiling of a church.

    A Brief Summary of Induction 215

    DETERMINING AGENT

    The determining agent is a condition which sets in motion the

    causative factors. It differs from other conditions in being the origin or

    occasion of the effect. Examples include the mosquito which transmits

    the yellow fever germ and the flea which transmits the bubonic plague.
    Science often seeks the determining agent rather than one of the

    four metaphysical causes.°

    The metaphysical causes, according to Aristotle, explain every material effect. They are the efficient, the final, the material, and the formal cause. The efficient cause and the final cause are extrinsic to the effect, the causes of a thing becoming what it is. The following explanation of the four metaphysical causes uses the example of a statue.

    1. The efficient cause is the agent and the instruments, for example: the sculptor, and the hammer and chisel.

    2. The final cause is the end or purpose that moved the agent, for example: desire to honor a national hero, the particular design the artist conceived, love of art, fame, money, etc. The final cause is first in intention, last in execution.

    3. The material cause is that out of which it is made, for example: marble, bronze, wood.

    4. The formal cause is the kind of thing into which it is made, for example: Lincoln, Napoleon, Bucephalus, Joan of Arc.

    The material cause and the formal cause are intrinsic to the effect, the causes of a thing being what it is. To know an object through its formal cause is to know its essence. Thus the formal cause of man is his soul animating his body, his rational animality. The material cause is that particular matter which constitutes his physical being; it continually varies through metabolism but is supported and unified by the formal cause, the soul in the body. Thus, despite metabolism, the man remains the same man throughout his life, through the persistence of the formal cause.

    Uniformity of Causation
    Uniformity of causation is a postulate of all natural sciences, a physically, not a metaphysically, necessary assumption of the scientist who studies the material universe. It is not capable of proof but only of illustration. The postulate may be stated thus: The same natural cause, under similar conditions, produces the same effect.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.

    This generalization needs to be limited in two important ways. It is
    not applicable to a being with free will in those activities subject to con-
    trol by free will. Thus a human being is free to lift the right arm or not
    to lift it, to choose to think upon one subject rather than upon another.
    But a person has no such free control over the circulation of the blood,
    digestion, falling from a height when support is removed, etc. Also, the
    uniformity of causation requires the normal concurrence of the First
    Cause. Thus miracles represent a deviation from the uniformity of na-
    ture, attributable to the free will of the First Cause.

    Note that the postulate of the uniformity of causation should not be
    confused with the philosophical principle of causality, namely: What-
    ever comes into being must have an adequate cause. The latter is a
    philosophical axiom, knowable by intuitive induction. Philosophical
    axioms are metaphysically necessary truths. The postulates of science
    are not and, accordingly, have not so high a degree of certainty.

    Scientific Induction
    Scientific induction as a method of discovering truth embraces five
    steps: observation, analogy, hypothesis, analysis and sifting of data, and
    verification of the hypothesis.

    OBSERVATION
    Observation involves asking questions of nature in order to get facts, the
    data of induction. Because of the complexity of nature, observation
    must be selective, analytic. Care should be taken to obtain facts free
    from inference. Ordinary observation is supplemented by (1) scientific
    instruments, for example: the telescope, microscope, microphone,
    camera, barometer, thermometer, delicate balances and (2) statistics, or
    enumeration, for example: a statistical study of the recurrence of de-
    pressions, of the causes of death, of the number of marriages and di-
    voices, of the diffusion of hereditary traits among offspring.

    Simple observation, aided by the use of scientific instruments and of
    statistics, is almost the only means available to such natural sciences as
    systematic zoology and astronomy and to some of the social sciences.

    Experiment is observation under conditions subject to control. Its advantage lies in the opportunity it offers to simplify, to analyze, to repeat at will, to ask questions of nature, one at a time, by varying conditions one at a time. A science which can employ experiment advances much more rapidly than one which cannot. The rapid progress of physics, chemistry, bacteriology, and nutrition is due in large measure to experiment.

    ANALOGY

    Analogy or likeness observed in different classes of phenomena suggests to the alert scientific mind the probability of a causal relation. Analogy is a fertile source of hypotheses. The periodic table of the chemical elements had its inception in analogy; and it presents analogies which have occasioned other scientific discoveries.

    HYPOTHESIS

    Hypothesis is a scientific guess at general laws to explain phenomena which appear to be causally related. Hypotheses guide observation and experiment. Subsequent investigation either verifies or disproves them.

    ANALYSIS AND SIFTING OF DATA (SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGY)

    Roger Bacon (1214?-1294) stressed the importance of experimental science and its place in Christian studies. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) developed a theory of induction. John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) formulated five canons or general methods of science and popularized them.

    The Method of Agreement

    If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree is the cause or the effect of the given phenomenon.

    Note that in Mill's formulas the capital letters stand for antecedents, the small letters for consequents. Each group stands for an instance. The formula is ABC —abc; ADE—ade. Hence A is causally related to a.

    EXAMPLE: Method of agreement

    William Stanley Jevons describes how the cause of the iridescence of mother-of-pearl was discovered:

    A person might suppose that the peculiar colours of mother-of-pearl were due to the chemical
    Qualities of the substance. Much trouble might have been spent in following out that notion by
    comparing the chemical qualities of various iridescent substances. But Sir David Brewster accidentally
    took an impression from a piece of mother-of-pearl in a cement of resin and beeswax, and finding
    218 = The Trivium

    the colours repeated upon the surface of the wax, he proceeded to take other impressions in
    balsam, fusible metal, lead, gum arabic, isinglass, etc., and always found the iridescent colours the
    same. He thus proved that the chemical nature of the substance is a matter of indifference, and that
    the form of the surface is the real condition of such colours.6

    The Method of Difference

    If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs
    and an instance in which it does not occur have every circumstance in
    common save one, that one occurring only in the former, the circum-
    stance in which alone the two instances differ is the effect or the cause
    or an indispensable part of the cause of the phenomenon. The formula
    is ABC —abc; BC—bce. Hence A is causally related to a.

    EXAMPLES Method of difference

    Sore eyes and retarded growth are observed in rats with no vitamin A in their diet.

    A bell struck in a vacuum makes no sound: if air is admitted, it does; hence the vibration of air is seen
    to be causally related to the production of sound.

    The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference

    If two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only
    one circumstance in common, while two or more instances in which
    it does not occur have nothing in common except the absence of that
    circumstance, the circumstance in which alone the two sets of in-
    stances differ is the effect or the cause or an indispensable part of the
    cause of the phenomenon. The formula is ABC—abc, ADE—ade,
    BDM—bdm, CEO—ceo. Hence A is causally related to a.

The total heat produced is measured as 150 units. It is known that the reaction of substance A alone produces 80 units of heat, and the reaction of substance B alone produces 60 units of heat. Using the method of residues, determine the cause of the remaining heat produced when both substances A and B are combined.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must explicitly apply the method of residues as described in the text, subtract the known effects of A and B from the total heat, and justify the conclusion about the remaining heat''s cause.\n\n**Answer**: The remaining heat must be caused by the interaction between substances A and B, as the total heat (150 units) minus the heat from A (80 units) and B (60 units) equals 10 units.

You must explicitly reference the formula and the reasoning provided in the text.\n\n**Answer**: The consistent variation in temperature and volume (as described by the formula AIBC —a!bc) indicates that temperature is a cause of the change in volume. Since the volume varies in the same manner as the temperature, they are causally related, aligning with the principle that a phenomenon varying in tandem with another is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon.'

Using the text''s description of verification, explain how the student should proceed to test the hypothesis and what conclusions can be drawn.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the steps of verification as described in the text, including the use of inductive reasoning and the rejection of rival hypotheses. You must explicitly reference the method of verification outlined in the text.\n\n**Answer**: The student should test the hypothesis by examining whether the data consistently supports the relationship between study time and test scores. If the scores increase proportionally with study time, the hypothesis is verified. If other factors (such as prior knowledge) are found to influence the scores, those factors must be rejected as causal. The student should also compare the results to previous experiences to ensure the hypothesis is universally true, as described in the text.'

    is not essential so that it may intuit what is essential, so elimination
    withdraws its attention from what is not causally related so that it may
    intuit what is causally related.

    Elimination

    Elimination is accomplished by means of deductive reasoning from
    a disjunctive proposition. The minor premises of the eliminative syllogisms are empirical propositions stating the result of observation of the facts under investigation. The major premises are the canons of the general scientific methods.
    The cause of X is either A or B or C or D.

    But A is present when X is absent.
    The cause of X cannot be present when X is absent.
    Therefore A is not the cause of X.

    2 B is absent when X is present.
    The cause of X cannot be absent when X is present.
    Therefore B is not the cause of X.

    3 C does not vary concomitantly with X.
    The cause of X does vary concomitantly with X.
    Therefore C is not the cause of X.

    The cause of X is neither A nor B nor C. Therefore, the cause of X
    is probably D.

    Note that the alternatives of the disjunctive syllogism should not be
    a mere enumerative catalogue of possibilities. The alternatives should
    be selected by scientific insight into the probable antecedents, not by a
    random gathering of irrelevant facts." Note also that mere elimination
    provides no certitude.8 The conclusion of the disjunctive syllogism
    merely represents the degree of simplification that scientific method
    can achieve. After the rival alternatives have been disproved, the data,
    the facts of nature, thus divested of some of their complexity, stand
    naked, as it were, before the mind's eye.

    intuitive Induction

    If the mind sees positive reasons for asserting that the cause of X is
    D, there is certitude. If not, the analysis of the data was probably in-
    complete, and the alternatives were not exhaustive; an unknown an-
    tecedent, not listed, may be the cause of X.

    A Brief Summary of induction 221

    Application and Demonstration by Deduction

    The certitude resulting from the intuitive induction of a general law
    must be demonstrated by syllogistic inference using either a regressive
    or demonstrative syllogism.

    A regressive syllogism is the link between induction and deduction.
    It is a theoretical verification of the hypothesis by deduction. Seeking
    the cause of natural phenomena, a law that governs them, is seeking a
    middle term, which is the formal cause of the relation of the terms in
    the conclusion of a syllogism. In contrast to the definite process by
    which the premises lead to the conclusion, seeking the middle term is
    an indefinite, inverse process, for S and P may be related by many M's.
    The conclusion may be supported by many reasons.

    ANALOGY: Seeking the middle term

    In mathematics, we proceed definitely from multiplier and multiplicand to the product, but the in-
    verse process is indefinite as is shown in the following example.

    Given: 6 x 6. What is the product? Definite answer: 36.
    Given: 36. What are the factors? 3 x 12:4 « 9: ~-2 x -18: -3 x -12: -4 x —9.

    Induction is a similar indefinite, inverse process until it is verified by
    deduction and application.

    In our observation of nature, we intuit the empirical proposition S
    is P. But S is P because it is M. The whole problem of the discovery of
    laws of nature is the problem of discovering M. The effect P proves the
    presence of the cause M. Here M must not be only the antecedent of
    P but the only antecedent, a property or a definition. Hence M is P must
    be convertible simply to P is M. In other words, science seeks the veri-
    fication of a hypothesis which can be expressed in a hypothetical propo-
    sition that is reciprocal: If S is M, it is P; and if S is P, it is M. When this
    reciprocal relationship is found, it may be stated in a regressive syllo-
    gism in the first figure: S is P. P is M. Therefore S is M. The theoreti-
    cal verification of the hypothesis, stated fully, then is: If S is M, it is P.
    But S is M. Therefore S is P.

    A demonstrative syllogism is a practical verification of the hypoth-
    esis by deduction.

    As a final step in its verification, the hypothesis must be applied over and over again to the facts of nature and thereby have its truth demonstrated. The hypothesis becomes the major premise in a syllogism whose minor premise is an empirical proposition derived by intuition from the observation of nature. The conclusion which follows from a correct syllogistic formula employing these premises is, then, an empirical proposition which is an inference from the hypothesis being tested. If this process is repeated again and again, with different, typical, and widely selected data as the minor premises of the testing syllogisms, and if, in every case, the empirical conclusion inferred conforms to the observed facts of nature, then the hypothesis is verified, and it is demonstrated to be a law of nature. Herein, then, by combining deduction with induction, one verifies before the tribunal of human reason the general law with which induction furnished us. Deduction leads to consistency in the conceptual order, and induction leads to the assurance that this conceptual order truly represents the real order.

    PHILOSOPHY IN THE FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE

    What is the place of philosophy in the field of knowledge? Our rationality urges us to analyze, relate, organize, synthesize, and so to simplify our knowledge. Philosophy represents the greatest unity and simplicity to which unaided human reason can attain.

    Progress Toward Unity

    4 Experience (fact: for example, A stone falls. A chair falls.)

    3 Science (law: for example, the law of gravity)

    2 Philosophy (principles: for example, Every effect must have an adequate cause.)

    1 Beatific vision (Unity of Perfect Truth; the alt in the One. Theology and faith prepare us for the beatific vision after death.)

    10-1 Synthesis of Knowledge

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Philosophical and Scientific Reasoning**\n\nUsing the text''s distinction between experience, science, philosophy, and beatific vision, construct a syllogism that demonstrates how the law of gravity (from science) leads to the principle that ''Every effect must have an adequate cause'' (from philosophy).\n\n**Requirements**:\n- The major premise must be the philosophical principle.\n- The minor premise must be the empirical observation of the law of gravity.\n- The conclusion must be a logical inference based on the syllogistic structure described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your syllogism must accurately reflect the text''s synthesis of deduction and induction, and your conclusion must demonstrate how philosophy unifies scientific laws into a broader conceptual framework.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Knowledge Hierarchies**\n\nBased on the text''s classification of knowledge into experience, science, philosophy, and beatific vision, explain how the statement ''Every effect must have an adequate cause'' (a philosophical principle) is a necessary condition for the law of gravity (a scientific law) to be valid.\n\n**Task**:\n- Reference the text''s explanation of how philosophy provides the conceptual order that science must conform to.\n- Use logical reasoning to show that without the philosophical principle, the law of gravity cannot be universally applied.\n- Compare this to the text''s description of how induction and deduction work together to verify natural laws.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly integrate the hierarchical nature of knowledge and demonstrate an understanding of how philosophy serves as the foundation for scientific inquiry.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Philosophical Concepts**\n\nThe text describes philosophy as the greatest unity and simplicity attained by unaided human reason. Using the example of a falling object, construct a hypothetical scenario where the principles of philosophy and science are applied in a new context (e.g., space exploration, artificial intelligence, or environmental science).\n\n**Requirements**:\n- The scenario must involve both empirical observation (science) and a philosophical principle.\n- The philosophical principle must be one from the text (e.g., ''Every effect must have an adequate cause'').\n- The scenario must demonstrate how the syllogistic process described in the text verifies a natural law through repeated testing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must clearly show the integration of deduction and induction, and it must illustrate how philosophy unifies different fields of knowledge into a cohesive system.'

    These four steps in the synthesis of knowledge are the special
    provinces of history, science, philosophy, and theology. History's pri-
    mary function is to chronicle the facts of experience. Science's primary
    function is to organize facts under their proximate causes or laws. Phi-
    losophy's primary function is to discover ultimate causes. It accepts the
    findings of the special sciences as its data and treats of the ultimate

    principles and characteristics which constitute the order of the uni-
    verse as a whole.

    Speculative philosophy is concerned with knowledge of the real
    order for the sake of knowledge. According to the three classes of ob-
    jects to be understood, the mind employs three kinds of abstraction
    and distinguishes three great fields of knowledge: (1) Physics in the
    wide sense, meaning all the special sciences that deal with the mate-
    rial world; they abstract from individual conditions and are concerned
    with general laws and the universal type; (2) Mathematics abstracts for
    consideration only quantity; (3) Metaphysics abstracts only being as
    being.

    Practical or normative philosophy regulates actions according to
    some standard. Logic deals with thought; it directs the intellect to truth.
    Ethics deals with action; it directs the will to good. Aesthetics deals with
    expression; it directs the intellect, the senses, and the emotions to
    beauty and its contemplation.

    Abstraction is the basis of science and of philosophy. Each special
    science adopts as its sphere of investigation one general characteristic
    and ignores all others. It is only by this means that human beings can
    make progress in knowledge. A complex being, for example, a man or
    a woman, is made the object of distinct special sciences such as biol-
    ogy, psychology, anthropology, ethics, economics, politics, each of
    which studies only a chosen aspect. Even chemistry, physics, mathe-
    matics contribute to our knowledge of humankind. No one science
    gives us the whole truth. All together give us one truth, a composite pic-
    ture, limited, of course, by the inadequacies of the human mind.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Philosophical Knowledge Domains**\n\nExplain how the text differentiates between the three major domains of knowledge: (1) Physics in the wide sense, (2) Mathematics, and (3) Metaphysics.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary focus of each domain based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast the levels of abstraction involved in each domain.\n- **Step 3**: Use the text''s distinction between ''special sciences'' and ''speculative philosophy'' to justify why Physics in the wide sense is considered a separate category from Mathematics and Metaphysics.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define each domain and demonstrate an understanding of the hierarchical structure of knowledge as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Abstraction in Scientific Progress**\n\nThe text argues that abstraction is essential for scientific progress, as each special science focuses on a single characteristic while ignoring others.\n- **Part A**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how abstraction allows for the study of a complex being (e.g., a human) through multiple special sciences.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the text uses the example of a human being to argue that no single science can provide the ''whole truth,'' but that the combination of all sciences provides a ''composite picture.''\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument using the text''s reasoning to support the claim that abstraction is necessary for human progress in understanding the world.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of abstraction and its role in the division of knowledge among special sciences.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning in Philosophical Functions**\n\nThe text describes the primary functions of history, science, philosophy, and theology.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the functions of history and science according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how philosophy, as a field, serves as a bridge between the special sciences and the ultimate causes of the universe.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that demonstrates how the functions of these four fields (history, science, philosophy, theology) collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the world.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s classification of the functions of each of the four fields and their interrelationships.'

- prompt: |-
    It is very important to realize the selectivity of the special sciences—
    to understand that each represents but one aspect of reality. To know
    one aspect as a part of a greater complex whole is to know a part of the
    truth. But to think that one such aspect is the whole is to distort truth
    into gross error. This is the danger of specialization. Philosophy, which
    harmonizes the findings of the special sciences, comes closest to giving
    us the whole truth, insofar as we can know it by reason alone.

    Theology's primary function is to supplement human knowledge
    with knowledge which unaided human reason cannot attain. This is
    Revelation, which comprises both speculative and practical knowledge,
    chiefly of God, who is the First Cause of all that science and philoso-
    phy study, and the Last End of man, who studies them.

    DEFENSE OF PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY

    The logic of perennial philosophy presented in this book is scorned in
    many colleges and universities today as outmoded, inadequate, and
    unfit for a scientific age. Logical positivism admits as knowable only
    sense experience of matter and the relations of coexistence and
    succession in natural phenomena; it denies spirit, intellect, and the capacity
    to know essence. Modern semantics regards as arbitrary and shifting
    not only words but ideas; it denies that words are signs of ideas that truly
    represent things. The new symbolic or mathematical logic, which
    aims to free logic from the restrictions of words and things, becomes a
    mere manipulation of symbols capable of being tested for their internal
    consistency but having no correspondence to ideas or things (and there-
    fore no stability or truth).

    Perennial philosophy holds that symbols such as those of the syllogism, opposition, obversion, conversion represent a higher degree of abstraction and more clear relationships than words do, and therefore a more advanced knowledge; they are sound precisely because they represent words that do correspond to the ideas and things. These symbols point the way to a more complete symbolic logic which preserves the basic truths of perennial philosophy, in particular its healthy respect for intellectual knowledge derived from sense knowledge by abstraction.

    THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOGIC, RHETORIC, AND POETIC

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Perennial Philosophy and Scientific Method**\n\nThe text contrasts the positivist view of knowledge with the perennial philosophy''s view of symbolic logic. Using the definitions and arguments from the text, explain how the symbolic logic of the syllogism and opposition can be seen as a more advanced form of knowledge than the scientific method.\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Reference at least two distinct arguments from the text about the role of symbols in knowledge.\n- Justify how symbols like syllogisms preserve ''basic truths'' according to the text.\n- Contrast the positivist view of knowledge with the perennial philosophy''s view in your explanation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both the philosophical and scientific perspectives as presented in the text, demonstrating an understanding of the ''higher degree of abstraction'' claimed by the perennial philosophy.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning in the Trivium Framework**\n\nUsing the definitions of the trivium (logic, rhetoric, and poetic) provided in the text, construct a logical argument that illustrates the interdependence of these three disciplines.\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Define each component of the trivium using the text''s explanation of their roles.\n- Demonstrate how each discipline supports the others through a real-world example.\n- Explain why the trivium is described as ''the liberal arts of logic, grammar, and rhetoric'' in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must clearly show the hierarchical and complementary relationship between logic, rhetoric, and poetic as outlined in the text, using a coherent example that reflects the ''complex whole'' of knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Philosophical Synthesis of Specialization and Philosophy**\n\nThe text warns against the dangers of specialization, arguing that philosophy harmonizes the findings of the special sciences. Using the text''s arguments, explain how the trivium (logic, rhetoric, poetic) serves as a bridge between specialized knowledge and the holistic understanding of truth.\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Reference the text''s claim that ''each represents but one aspect of reality.''\n- Explain how the trivium provides a ''framework for the whole truth'' as described in the text.\n- Use the text''s argument about theology supplementing human knowledge with Revelation to illustrate the role of philosophy in understanding the ''whole truth.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s critique of specialization and its defense of the trivium as a comprehensive framework for knowledge, integrating both philosophical and theological perspectives.'

    The art of rhetoric originated in Sicily, when a democracy was established in Syracuse in 466 B.C., and Corax and his pupil Tisias assisted those who had been dispossessed of property to convince the judges that they had a just claim to its restoration. Corax put together some theoretical precepts based principally on the topic of general probability, called eikos (see Aristotle, Rhetoric, 2.24.9), and Tisias developed it further, as Plato shows in Phaedrus. Gorgias, the Sicilian, came to Athens in 427 B.C., introduced the art of rhetoric into many parts of Greece, and had many disciples, among whom the most admirable and famous was Isocrates, the orator and teacher. Gorgias, Protagoras, Prodicus, and Hippias emphasized the graces of style, figures of speech, distinction of synonyms, correctness and elegance in the choice of words, and rules of rhythm. Gorgias aimed to teach how to convince, independent of any knowledge of the subject. He admittedly taught persuasion, not virtue. Plato and Aristotle condemned the sophists: Gorgias, Protagoras, and others for their superficiality and disregard of truth in teaching how to make the worse appear the better cause.

    Aristotle himself constructed a well-balanced system of the arts of discovering and communicating truth, and his treatises on these subjects profoundly influenced his own and succeeding ages. He systematized rhetoric and made it an instrument of truth. He explicitly claimed to be the founder of the art of logic. His Poetics is the beginning of real literary criticism.

    Logic and rhetoric are concerned with the discovery and communication of truth directly from the mind of the author to the mind of the listener or reader. Poetic is a very different mode of communication, an indirect one that imitates life in characters and situations; readers or listeners share imaginatively the characters' experiences as if they were their own; yet poetic rises out of knowledge as well as feeling, and logic and rhetoric are employed in the communication of the whole, which goes beyond them. Poetic is argument through vivid representation.

- prompt: "Logic  \nAristotle divided logic, according to its subject matter, into scientific demonstration, dialectic, and sophistic, treated in the works named below.  \n\n1 *Posterior Analytics*. Scientific demonstration has as its subject matter premises that are true, essential, and certain. In this field there are not two sides to a question but only one. The reasoning is merely expository, as in geometry, moving step by step to the conclusive demonstration of what was to be proved. *Prior Analytics* treats certainty through form. The work is concerned with inference, and it presents the syllogism.  \n\n2 *Topics*. Dialectic has as its subject matter opinion, not certain knowledge; therefore, the premises are merely probable.  \n\nIn this field there are two sides to a question, and there is reasonable support for opposing views, both only probable, neither certain, although each person engaging in the discussion may be personally, even ardently, convinced of the truth of his views. Yet he cannot justly regard them as having the quality of geometric proof because each must recognize that the matter under discussion is not intrinsically clear and that his opponent's view is not so manifestly false as the proposition that two and two makes five. The argument is conducted in a spirit of inquiry and love of truth. If, in the course of the discussion, one disputant sees that the opponent's view is true and that which he has advanced is false, he may be justly said to have won the argument because he has gained truth, which, he now sees, his opponent had at the start. Plato's Dialogues are the perfect examples of dialectic.\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Classification of Logical Methods**\n\nAccording to the text, Aristotle categorized logic into three main types: scientific demonstration, dialectic, and sophistic.\n\n**Question**: Identify the primary subject matter of each of these three types of logic, and explain how they differ in terms of certainty and the nature of reasoning.\n\n- **Scientific Demonstration**: Focus on premises that are true, essential, and certain. The reasoning is expository, moving step by step to a conclusion.\n- **Dialectic**: Deals with opinion, not certain knowledge. The premises are probable, and there are two sides to a question with opposing views.\n- **Sophistic**: Not discussed in the text, but based on the structure of the other two, infer its likely subject matter and reasoning style.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish the three types based on their subject matter, certainty, and reasoning style, using direct inferences from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Dialectic and the Spirit of Inquiry**\n\nThe text describes dialectic as a method of discussion where opposing views are both probable, and neither is certain. It also mentions that the spirit of dialectic is one of inquiry and love of truth.\n\n**Question**: In a hypothetical debate on the effectiveness of a new educational policy, how would dialectic reasoning apply?\n\n- **Part A**: Describe the nature of the premises in this debate. Would they be certain or probable?\n- **Part B**: Explain how the discussion would proceed, referencing the text''s mention of ''reasonable support for opposing views.''\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the possibility that one participant might later concede that the other''s view is correct. How does this align with the text''s description of dialectic?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s description of dialectic, including the treatment of probable premises and the spirit of inquiry, to demonstrate an understanding of its application in real-world debates.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Sophistic and Logical Distinction**\n\nThe text briefly mentions ''sophistic'' as the third type of logic, but it is not elaborated on. Based on the structure of the other two types, infer the likely characteristics of sophistic reasoning.\n\n**Question**: What is the most plausible subject matter and reasoning style of sophistic logic according to the text?\n\n- **Part A**: Based on the contrast between scientific demonstration and dialectic, infer what sophistic might focus on.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the reasoning in sophistic might differ from the other two types, using logical inference from the text''s structure.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a situation where sophistic reasoning might be applied, and explain why it would be considered a different type of logic.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate logical inference based on the text''s structure and the characteristics of the other two types of logic.'

    3 Sophistical Refutations (treatise on material fallacies). Sophistic
    has as its subject matter premises that seem to be generally accepted
    and appropriate but which really are not appropriate. In this field, usu-
    ally that of opinion, the sophist seeks not truth but only an appearance
    of truth, achieved by the use of fallacious arguments designed to put
    down the opponent in contentious dispute. Anyone who wins by such
    methods has not won truth. On the contrary, he has made error appear
    to have triumphed over truth, and nobody has won truth by means of
    the argument. It is a sad commentary that many people today attach to
    the word argument only the sophists' conception, entertain the sophis-
    tic notion of "winning" an argument, and ignore the fine and con-

    forms of argument worthy of the name, namely scientific demonstra-
    tion and dialectic.

    Rhetoric

    Rhetoric, according to Aristotle, is the counterpart of dialectic, and the
    rhetorical enthymeme is the counterpart of the dialectical syllogism.
    Both these arts, rhetoric and dialectic, deal with opinion, with proba-
    bility, not certainty, and therefore these two arts, and they alone, are ca-
    pable of generating arguments on two or more sides of a question.
    Dialectic deals with philosophical and general questions, proceeds by
    question and answer, employs technical language, and is addressed to
    philosophers. Rhetoric deals with particular questions, such as political
    action, proceeds by uninterrupted discourse, usually employs nontech-
    nical language, and is addressed to a popular audience.

    Rhetoric is defined by Aristotle as the art of finding in any given sub-
    ject matter the available means of persuasion. The modes of persuasion
    are three, and since, as Aristotle remarks, one must know not only what
    to say but how to say it effectively in words and in a well disposed order,
    his basic treatment may be outlined as follows.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Sophistic Fallacies in Argumentation**\n\nExplain how the text distinguishes between the sophist''s goal of achieving an appearance of truth and the goal of scientific demonstration or dialectic in pursuing actual truth.\n- **Step 1**: Define the sophist''s approach based on the text''s description of their reliance on fallacious arguments.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with the method of scientific demonstration, which the text says is the only form of argument worthy of the name.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the sophist''s methods, while effective in debate, do not lead to the discovery of truth.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s claim that ''no one has won truth by means of the argument'' and integrate the idea that sophistry is about ''winning'' rather than ''truth.'''
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Comparing Rhetoric and Dialectic**\n\nThe text describes rhetoric as the art of finding means of persuasion, while dialectic is described as the art of discovering truth. Compare and contrast these two forms of argumentation based on the following criteria:\n- **Purpose**: What is the primary goal of each art?\n- **Audience**: Who is the intended audience for each?\n- **Method**: How do they differ in their approach to argumentation?\n- **Certainty vs. Probability**: How does each handle the concept of certainty or probability in their arguments?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly quote or paraphrase the text''s descriptions of rhetoric and dialectic, and clearly demonstrate an understanding of their distinct roles in the pursuit of truth and persuasion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluating the Sophistic Fallacy in a Real-World Scenario**\n\nImagine a political debate where two candidates use different argumentation styles. One candidate employs sophistical fallacies to win the argument, while the other uses scientific demonstration or dialectic to seek truth.\n- **Part A**: Describe how the sophistical candidate might use fallacious arguments to appear persuasive, referencing the text''s description of the sophist''s goal of ''making error appear to have triumphed over truth.''\n- **Part B**: Explain how the truth-seeking candidate would structure their argument using scientific demonstration or dialectic, citing the text''s distinction between these methods.\n- **Part C**: Based on the text''s critique of sophistry, evaluate which candidate is more aligned with the ''only forms of argument worthy of the name'' and justify your answer.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s analysis of sophistry and the distinction between rhetoric and dialectic, and clearly demonstrate an understanding of the difference between winning an argument and discovering truth.'

    Persuasion is achieved by means of logos, pathos, and ethos. Logos re-
    quires one to convince the minds of the listeners or readers by proving the
    truth of what one is saying. Pathos requires one to put the listeners or
    readers into a frame of mind favorable to one's purpose, principally by
    working on the emotions. Ethos requires one to inspire in the audience,
    by courtesy and other qualities, confidence in one's character, compe-
    tence, good sense, good moral character, and good will.

    Style is characterized by good diction, good grammatical structure,
    pleasing rhythm, clear and appropriate language, effective metaphor,
    etc.

    Arrangement is the order of parts: introduction, statement and proof,
    conclusion.

    The five traditional components of rhetoric were invention (finding
    arguments for persuasion), arrangement of the parts of a composition,
    style, memory of a speech, and the proper use of voice and gesture in
    delivering it.

    Poetic
    Poetic, as Aristotle understands it, is imitation, an imitation of life, in
    which the author does not speak to the reader directly but only through
    his characters. The author lets them speak and act, and the readers or
    listeners identify imaginatively with the characters. The use of verse is
    not essential.

    Because poetic communication is mediate, through the interposition
    of the characters and the situation in the story, it is more subject to mis-
    interpretation than direct or expository communication. If, for example,
    one does not recognize irony, burlesque, or satire, one will understand
    just the opposite of what is intended by the author. It is necessary to learn
    how to interpret poetic communication. Often it is the easiest, most nat-
    ural, and most effective means of communication, as in the parable of
    the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32); but sometimes it is difficult to under-
    stand, as in the parable of the unjust steward (Luke 16:1-8).

He distinguishes six formative elements or qualitative parts of drama: (1) plot, (2) characters, (3) the thought of the characters, (4) diction or style, (5) music, (6) spectacle (production in the theatre, scene, costumes).

    The specific function of tragedy is to produce in the audience a purification of the emotions through pity and fear, evoked principally by the tragic suffering of the hero. To produce this effect, the tragic hero must be a man, not perfect, but on the whole good, for whom one feels liking and sympathy, whose misfortune is brought upon him not by vice or depravity but by an error of judgment or a flaw in his character.

    It will be noticed that character (ethos), thought (logos), arousal of the emotions (pathos), and style (through grammar) are basic in both theoric and poetic.

    Poetic is the imitation of an action by which agents to whom we ascribe moral qualities achieve happiness or misery. Their thought and character are shown as causes of their actions which result in success or in failure. Moreover, at any time, anywhere, a person of this kind will probably, or even necessarily, say or do this, under circumstances like this. Yet the character in the drama, even while typical of many others, is realized in this story vividly and imaginatively as an individual one has known, whose joys and sorrows one has shared. Therefore, poetic stands in a unique position between history and philosophy. It is more philosophical and of greater import than history because it is universal, not singular, and represents what might be, not merely what has been. By it one

    gathers the meaning of an insight as an artist perceived it. It is more moving than philosophy because the universal is realized intensely in the individual portrayed, and the appeal is to the whole person: to the imagination, the feelings, and the intellect, not to the intellect alone.

    THE SHORT STORY

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Tragic Structure and Poetic Elements**\n\nIn the text, Aristotle distinguishes six elements of drama: plot, characters, thought, diction, music, and spectacle. In the context of tragic drama, how do these elements contribute to the production of pity and fear in the audience?\n- **Step 1**: Identify which elements are directly responsible for evoking the emotions (pity and fear).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the tragic hero''s character and thought (ethos and logos) influence the audience''s emotional response.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the role of spectacle (production) in enhancing the dramatic effect, referencing Aristotle''s view of tragedy as a form of imitation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of tragedy and the six elements, demonstrating understanding of their interplay in achieving the tragic effect.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Tragic Hero and Character Development**\n\nAccording to the text, a tragic hero is ''a man, not perfect, but on the whole good, for whom one feels liking and sympathy, whose misfortune is brought upon him not by vice or depravity but by an error of judgment or a flaw in his character.''\n- **Part A**: Explain how the tragic hero''s ''flaw in his character'' (hamartia) leads to his downfall. Use specific examples from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part B**: Compare the tragic hero''s character to the characters in the epic. How do their similarities and differences reflect Aristotle''s distinction between tragedy and epic?\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that the tragic hero''s ''liking and sympathy'' is a necessary condition for the tragic effect. Use the text''s discussion of the audience''s emotional response to justify your claim.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of the tragic hero''s role and its significance in Aristotle''s theory of tragedy.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Poetic and Historical Context**\n\nThe text states that poetic is ''more philosophical and of greater import than history because it is universal, not singular, and represents what might be, not merely what has been.''\n- **Part A**: Explain how the poetic form achieves this universality. Use examples from the text to illustrate your point.\n- **Part B**: Compare the poetic''s role in exploring ''what might be'' with the role of history in documenting ''what has been.'' How does this distinction reflect Aristotle''s view of poetry as a form of imitation?\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that ''poetry is merely a form of history.'' Your example must reference the text''s discussion of poetic''s unique characteristics and demonstrate how it differs from historical accounts.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of poetic and history, demonstrating an understanding of their distinct purposes and functions.'

    Poetic, as Aristotle conceived it, is plotted narrative dramatically imitating action in human life, whether in epic or drama. Consequently, poetic is realized also in the novel and the short story.

    Because the short story is the shortest form of plotted narrative, this discussion focuses on the short story, although the principles are applicable to the novel, the drama, and the epic as well.

    The Plot
    The plot, not the characters, is the first and the essential element in poetic. The characters reveal themselves in the action.

    A plot is a combination of incidents so closely connected by cause and effect that not one of them may be transposed or withdrawn without disjoining and dislocating the whole. This causal connection constitutes unity of action, the one unity essential to every poetic work.

    A plot, says Aristotle, must have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning is not necessarily that which is after, or caused by, something else, but is that which causes what follows it; the middle is that which is caused by what precedes it and is the cause of what follows it; the end is that which is caused by what precedes it but does not cause something to follow after it. In other words, a plot has a rising and a falling action in a sequence of cause and effect.

    The topics of cause and effect! are the tools for analyzing poetic, just as division is the tool for analyzing rhetorical in the sense of expository or direct communication of ideas.

    The plot is the story. Every plot is a narration of events, but not every narration of events is a plot. A plot is a narration of selected events causally connected, rising out of a conflict and the resulting obstacles to be overcome, all of which creates suspense which is not satisfied until the end. Thus plotted narrative has logical and artistic unity which unplotted narrative lacks. In unplotted narrative the end is simply a cessation of the story, which otherwise could be continued indefinitely beyond that point; in plotted narrative there is actual dissatisfaction unless the end is
    known, and there is a sense of finality when it is known—no desire to
    have the story go on and on.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Plot Structure**\n\nUsing the definitions of a plot provided by Aristotle and Sister Miriam Joseph, analyze the structure of a short story by identifying and explaining the beginning, middle, and end.\n- **Step 1**: Define each component of the plot (beginning, middle, end) based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Apply these definitions to a fictional short story of your choice.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your analysis using the text''s emphasis on cause and effect as the foundation of a plot.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the hierarchical structure of a plot and its role in creating suspense and finality in narrative.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Narrative Unity**\n\nCompare and contrast the concept of narrative unity in the short story with the concept of narrative unity in the novel, using the text''s definitions of plot and cause-effect relationships.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the short story achieves narrative unity through a sequence of causally connected incidents.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the novel might differ in its approach to narrative unity, considering the text''s mention of the short story as the ''shortest form of plotted narrative''.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on ''actual dissatisfaction'' in plotted narrative influences the reader''s expectations in different narrative forms.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s analysis of plot and its role in creating artistic and logical unity across various narrative forms.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Narrative Construction**\n\nDesign a short story that adheres to the principles of a plot as described in the text. Your story must include:\n- A beginning that initiates the conflict and sets up the cause for the middle.\n- A middle that develops the conflict and the resulting obstacles.\n- An end that resolves the conflict and provides a sense of finality.\n- At least two instances of cause and effect that demonstrate the text''s emphasis on causal connection.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the plot structure and the role of cause and effect in creating a coherent and unified narrative.'

- prompt: |-
    The plot of a short story involves a single situation: one central char-
    acter is facing a problem, and the plot is its solution. The problem or
    conflict is the driving desire or purpose of the main character, who, en-
    countering obstacles, either overcomes them (happy ending) or is over-
    come by them (tragic ending); both are solutions.

    Therefore, the simplest analysis of any plotted narrative is in terms
    of character, problem, and solution. This analysis may be made of the
    main plot and of subplots, if there are any, as there are in some dramas
    and novels.

    PARTS OF THE ACTION

    The parts of the action are (1) the situation or exposition; (2) the com-
    plication or rising action; (3) the resolution or falling action. The basic
    analysis of plotted narrative discovers the beginning of the action, the
    turning point (the logical climax), and the denouement or final out-
    come (the emotional climax).

    ANALYSIS OF ACTION

    In Shakespeare's Hamlet, the action begins when the ghost tells Hamlet that he is Hamlet's father,
    murdered by the king, and asks Hamlet to avenge this wrong. The turning point occurs when Ham-
    let, thinking it is the king whose reactions to the play within the play have revealed his guilt, kills Po-
    lonius instead. The denouement is the scene in which Hamlet kills the king with the poisoned weapon
    which the king had prepared for him, and from which he, too, dies.

    These three points in the action, it will be noticed, are what Aris-
    totele called the beginning, the middle, and the end of a plot.

    The parts of a plot may be diagrammed b
    thus, with the three important points of the aw
    action marked a, b, c. a ¢
    PROBLEMS OF ACTION

    Plausibility is absolutely essential to a story. It is the achievement of il-
    lusion and inward consistency. No matter how imaginative or even fan-
    tastic a story may be, it must create illusion; it must seem real. A writer
    may secure plausibility by the following means.

    2 Skillful, adequate forecast, which includes motives and details of setting, appearance, incident, etc.—all the elements that make later events plausible

    3 Vivid, concrete, realistic detail
    4 Effective creation of setting

    5 Tone

    The beginning of the story can occur at any point of the action. A writer must decide where to begin the story —at the beginning, the middle, or near the end of the series of events that constitute the story. It is often better to plunge in medias res (literally, "into the midst of things"), into the midst of the events, as Homer does in the Iliad and the Odyssey, and to tell what happened earlier (retrospective action) at points where the incidents will have greatest significance. For example, in the Odyssey the story of Odysseus' pursuit of the boar which tore his leg is told in Book XIX, when the scar causes his old nurse to recognize him, although the incident occurred earlier perhaps than any other related in the story.

    Retrospective action may be introduced by letters, by dialogue, by reminiscent reverie. In A Tale of Two Cities, the letter which Dr. Manette wrote during his imprisonment in the Bastille, before the story opened, is introduced with intense dramatic effect at Charles Darnay's second French trial near the end of the novel. The conversation between Sidney Carton and the Sheep of the Prisons (Solomon Press) near the end of the novel clarifies the facts about the mysterious funeral of Roger Cly and Jerry Cruncher's muddy boots (bits of forecast) introduced near the beginning.

    Retrospective action is very important in building a story; it is a means to secure artistic unity, dramatic effect, compactness. Prospective action is that which moves forward chronologically: the order of narration corresponds to the order of events. Retrospective action is that which moves backward chronologically: the order of narration differs from the order of the events narrated. The action is retrospective whenever an incident which occurred before another is told after it. This device is also called a flashback. A story cannot begin with retrospective action, although it may begin with reminiscence; these two are not identical.

    Dramatic and nondramatic scenes constitute the narrative. Dra-
    matic scenes create an experience for the reader to share imaginatively,
    through dialogue, reverie, detail of action, and vivid picturing details.
    A scene is obligatory if psychological necessity requires a dramatic pres-
    entation to satisfy the reader's interest and to make the story or the char-
    acter convincing and plausible. Dialogue should forward plot, reveal
    character, and be natural. Dialogue cannot be created by merely put-
    ting words into quotation marks and adding he said, she said, etc. It
    must have the quality of speech and must fit the character and situation.
    Nondramatic narration merely gives the reader information through
    the author's explanation and summary of events. In most good stories
    there is little of this.

    Angle of narration includes point of view, focus, the use of frames,
    and the degree of dramatization.

    1 Point of View. A story is usually told in third- or first-person point
    of view. In first-person point of view, the narrator may be the main char-
    acter or a less important character. In third-person point of view, the
    story may use omniscient narration and present the thoughts of many
    or all of the characters, or it may use limited omniscient narration and
    only present the thoughts of one character. Second-person point of view
    uses a narrator who speaks directly to the reader. It is rare.

    2 Focus. From whose perspective is the story to be told? Whose
    story is it to be? Sometimes the choice of an unusual angle of narration
    gives a fresh and interesting turn to an otherwise ordinary story, for ex-
    ample, a family tragedy from the plumber's point of view or a fight be-
    tween lovers from a cabdriver's point of view, in either first or third
    person. An interesting effect is sometimes produced, usually in a work
    longer than a short story, by telling the same story or part of a story more
    than once, each time from the point of view of a different character, for
    example: Robert Browning's The Ring and the Book and William
    Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury.

    3 Frame. A story can be told within a larger story, for example:
    Dostoyevski's "The Thief" and Kipling's "The Man Who Would Be
    King."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Narrative Perspective**\n\nIn the context of the text, explain how the choice of first-person point of view in a story can create a more immersive experience for the reader compared to third-person omniscient narration. Use specific examples from the text to illustrate your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s discussion on first-person narration and provide a clear comparison between first-person and third-person perspectives, highlighting the role of dialogue and psychological insight in achieving narrative immersion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Narrative Focus**\n\nThe text suggests that an unusual narrative focus can offer a fresh perspective on a common story. Choose a scenario (e.g., a family tragedy, a romantic conflict) and describe how telling it from the perspective of an unlikely character (e.g., a plumber, a cabdriver) could alter the reader''s understanding of the events.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the scenario and the character''s perspective.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the narrative focus would affect the portrayal of events, characters, and themes.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this approach for the reader''s engagement with the story.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s ideas about narrative focus and demonstrate an understanding of how perspective influences storytelling.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluation of Narrative Structure**\n\nThe text mentions the use of frames in storytelling, where a story is told within a larger narrative. Choose a literary work (e.g., Dostoyevski''s ''The Thief'' or Kipling''s ''The Man Who Would Be King'') and analyze how the framing device contributes to the overall message or character development.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the framing device and its purpose in the chosen work.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the framing device enhances the reader''s understanding of the story''s themes or characters.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the use of framing in the two examples provided in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of framing in narrative structure and its impact on the reader''s interpretation of the story.'

    Characters
    A character is an imagined figure who takes a role in a story. Characters can be round, which means they are multidimensional, or flat, which means they can be distinguished by one outstanding trait. A flat character may be a stock character that is a recognizable stereotype.

    236 = The Trivium

    The wicked stepmother, the sad clown, the handsome and shallow playboy are all stock characters.

    Characters can be considered according to the degree to which they are developed in a story. Some characters are not well developed; they are needed only to fulfill a function in the plot, for example: Orestes in Iphigenia at Aulis, Iris and Chryseis in the Iliad, the minor wooers in the Odyssey. Some characters are recognizable types, for example: Euryclea, the faithful servant in the Odyssey; Uriah Heep, the scheming sycophant in David Copperfield; Jane Bennet, the ingenue in Pride and Prejudice. Other characters are fully developed and individualized, even if they evolve from types: for example, Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, Hamlet.

    Motivation refers to the reason the characters act as they do—hence the basic link between characters and plot. Adequate motivation is the principal means to create plausibility and suspense.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Character Development and Motivation**\n\nIn the text, the author distinguishes between flat characters, round characters, and stock characters. Using the examples provided (e.g., the wicked stepmother, the sad clown, and the handsome playboy), explain how these character types contribute to the overall structure and themes of the story.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate at least two examples from the text and analyze how their development or lack thereof affects the plot and character relationships.\n\n**Answer**: Flat characters like the wicked stepmother serve as stereotypes that highlight moral contrasts, while stock characters such as the sad clown reinforce traditional tropes. Their limited development underscores the story''s reliance on familiar archetypes, which can create suspense or reinforce thematic elements like the struggle between individuality and societal expectations.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Character Types**\n\nBased on the definitions provided, determine which of the following characters would be classified as flat, round, or stock: \n1. Orestes in Iphigenia at Aulis\n2. Euryclea in the Odyssey\n3. Shylock in The Merchant of Venice\n4. Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must be based solely on the text''s definitions and examples. For each character, provide a brief explanation of why they fit into the specified category.\n\n**Answer**: \n1. Orestes is a flat character, as he is a minor figure needed to fulfill a plot function.\n2. Euryclea is a stock character, as she is a recognizable type (a faithful servant).\n3. Shylock is a round character, as he is fully developed and individualized.\n4. Elizabeth Bennet is a round character, as she evolves and is individualized in the story.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Motivation and Character Function**\n\nImagine a new character in a story who is not well developed and serves only to fulfill a function in the plot. Based on the text''s description of such characters, describe the role this character would play and explain how their lack of development affects the narrative.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a specific example of how this character would function in the plot and analyze the impact of their limited development on the story''s themes or structure.\n\n**Answer**: A character like Iris in the Iliad, who is a minor figure but essential to the plot, might serve as a symbol of the consequences of war. Their lack of development allows the story to focus on larger themes, such as the futility of conflict, without getting bogged down in individual character arcs.'

    Character can be revealed either directly or indirectly. In direct
    characterization, the author or an observer in the story describes the
    character. In indirect characterization, the character is revealed by
    what he or she thinks, says, or does. The author presents details and
    creates an experience for the reader who imaginatively meets the char-
    acter. A detail suggests much more than it actually states, for from it
    the reader spontaneously builds up a vivid image of the whole. The use
    of detail is the principal means to make the reader see everything with
    the vividness of an eyewitness, to make the story tell itself without the
    intrusion of the author, to make it a poetic communication that creates
    illusion.

    Thought
    The thought and moral qualities of the characters, says Aristotle, are the
    natural causes of the action or plot. Thought and action reveal charac-
    ter. Thought expressed in language is that part of poetic which is com-
    mon to both logic and rhetoric, for the characters employ these arts to
    prove or disprove, to arouse emotion, or to maximize and minimize
    events and issues.

    GENERAL STATEMENTS

    Particularly important thoughts are the general statements or senten-
    tious utterances (general propositions, apothegms, proverbs) which ex-
    press a universal view or judgment or philosophy of life. Hamlet owes
    much of its philosophical quality to the large number of such utter-
    ances in it.

    EXAMPLES: General statements

    _,, to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    —Hamlet 3.1.99-100

    _,. the good, when praised,
    Feel something of disgust, if to excess
    Commended.

    —Euripides, Iphigenia at Aulis

    Even his character grew firmer, like that of a man who has made up his mind and set himself a goal.
    —Nikolai Gogol, "The Cloak'

    Could we know all the vicissitudes of our fortunes, life would be too full of nope and fear, exultation
    or disappointment, to afford us a single hour of true serenity.
    —Nathaniel Hawthorne, "David Swan"

- prompt: |-
    Theme is the underlying thought of the whole story and can be stated in one sentence. It is usually a conviction about life, which might have been the subject of an essay or a sermon but which has been expressed instead in a poetic communication: a story, drama, or novel.

    EXAMPLES: Statements of theme

    A man should not be allowed to perish altogether.
    —Dostoyevski, "The Thief'

    Sacrifice for the public good exalts the sorrow it entails.
    —Euripides, Iphigenia at Aulis

    Self-knowledge is the first step to maturity.
    —Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice

    DICTION OR STYLE

    Aristotle uses the term diction to mean communication by means of language. Modern literary criticism uses the term diction in a narrower sense to mean the words which the author uses and considers diction one element of style. Style refers to how the writer manages the elements of the story. In a broad sense, it includes every choice the writer makes, but since most of those choices are discussed under other headings, usually the focus is on the following elements of style: tone, diction, and syntax.

    Tone is the author's attitude toward the subject of his literary work and the various devices by which he or she creates that attitude. Tone may be serious, earnest, realistic, romantic, flippant, cynical, satiric, etc.

    Diction is the language a writer uses. Diction may be pedantic or colloquial, abstract or concrete, unadorned or poetic. Most stories use a range of diction, and these purposeful choices help to communicate character, action, and tone.

    Syntax is sentence structure. Both the length and construction of sentences are components of syntax. Grammatically, sentences can be simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex. Sentence fragments, elements punctuated as sentences that are not grammatically sentences, can also be found in stories. Rhetorical elements of sentence structure, such as the use of parallel structure or periodic sentences, are part of syntax.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Theme in Literary Analysis**\n\nIdentify the central theme of the text by stating it in one sentence, as demonstrated in the examples provided. Then, explain how the author''s use of diction, tone, and syntax supports this theme.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Formulate a single-sentence theme statement that captures the essence of the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the author''s diction (language choices), tone (attitude toward the subject), and syntax (sentence structure) to show how they reinforce the theme.\n- **Part C**: Compare the theme to the example themes from the text (e.g., ''A man should not be allowed to perish altogether'') and explain why your theme is analogous or different.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your theme statement must be concise and reflect the text''s underlying conviction about life. Your analysis must integrate diction, tone, and syntax, and your comparison must highlight thematic similarities or differences to the provided examples.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Style Elements in Interpretation**\n\nUsing the definitions of diction, tone, and syntax from the text, analyze a specific passage from the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify the diction used in the passage (e.g., formal, colloquial, poetic).\n- **Part B**: Determine the tone conveyed (e.g., serious, satirical, earnest).\n- **Part C**: Examine the syntax (e.g., simple, complex, parallel structure) and explain how it contributes to the overall effect.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part D**: Relate the stylistic choices to the theme of the text.\n- **Part E**: Reflect on how the author''s style (diction, tone, syntax) creates a specific mood or message that aligns with the theme.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly connect each stylistic element to the theme, demonstrating an understanding of how style and theme are interrelated.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Reasoning with Literary Elements**\n\nImagine that the text is a short story or drama, and create a scene that reflects its theme.\n- **Part A**: Write a brief scene (2-3 paragraphs) that illustrates the theme of the text.\n- **Part B**: Use appropriate diction, tone, and syntax to mirror the author''s style.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the scene''s elements (dialogue, action, sentence structure) support the theme.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part D**: Compare your scene to the example themes (e.g., ''Self-knowledge is the first step to maturity'') and explain how your scene exemplifies a similar or different conviction about life.\n- **Part E**: Justify why your creative interpretation is faithful to the text''s theme and style.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scene must be coherent and stylistically consistent with the text. Your explanation must clearly link the scene''s elements to the theme and demonstrate creative reasoning based on the text''s literary elements.'

    Of the two remaining elements of drama discussed by Aristotle, music
    is not essential today, as the songs of the chorus were in Greek drama;
    music is dominant, however, in opera. Spectacle is essential to the pro-
    duction of drama; it includes costumes and scenery.

    In written narrative details of setting play a strong role. Setting in-
    cludes the time and the place of the story. All details of time and place
    fall under this general heading, so the author's description of nature, the
    furniture in a room, the temperature, etc. are elements of setting. Set-
    ting may create atmosphere; Poe, for instance, uses setting to add to the
    terror of a story.

    Regional writers set stories in one geographic area. William
    Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County is a fictional name for a part of Mis-
    sissippi; Thomas Hardy recreates parts of Dorset, England, in his nov-
    els although he calls Dorset by its Anglo-Saxon name, Wessex, and he
    fictionalizes place names in the region. Local color is an aspect of re-
    gional writing that involves faithful representation of an area's locale,
    dress, customs, and speech. Bret Harte and Mark Twain use local color
    in their stories.

    Composition and Reading 239

    Most stories show that setting has a strong impact on character devel-
    opment and action. Naturalism, however, emphasizes the importance
    of setting even more because in a naturalistic story the environment di-
    rectly affects character and plot. Most often, the protagonist is shown as
    a victim of his or her environment. The French novelist, Emile Zola, is
    considered the founder of naturalism. American writers Stephen Crane,
    Upton Sinclair, and Theodore Dreiser used elements of naturalism.

    The distinctive value of the world's great stories is that they lead the
    reader to share imaginatively the rich and varied experience of individ-
    ual characters confronted with problems and conditions of life common
    to people in all ages. They present potentialities and norms of living
    made significant by the best writers. They may show men and women
    suffering as a result of their own desire to have an excess of what is good
    for them or of what is not good, even sinful. They show how false con-
    ceptions of happiness lead to misery. A story that portrays evil is morally
    sound if it shows evil as evil yet does not portray the evil so as to make it
    a source of temptation to a normal reader.? Good stories appeal to the
    human in us. We may love, detest, admire, pity, scorn, or ridicule.

    The reader should ask: What vision of life, what insight, is gained
    from this story? What problems has the author stated and solved? What
    has been left unsolved? Does the story present the problem of conflict-
    ing duties, the claims of public good against those of private good,
    human rights against property rights, adjustment to environment,
    clashes of culture, etc.? Has the story brought to life fictional or histor-
    ical personages worth knowing? Are they individualized? alive? Are they
    normal and fine people or are they perverted? Are they heightened
    above life to an ideal conception? Are their actions and dialogue ap-
    propriate? Who are the most interesting people? Why? Of which peo-
    ple and incidents in the story does the author seem to approve? to
    disapprove? What seems to be the philosophy of life? What is the dom-
    inant idea, the single impression, left by the story? Does it present other
    times, other places, other civilizations and cultures? Is the style distin-
    guished? What are the literary relationships and influences that affect
    the story? What was the author trying to do in this work? Did she or he
    succeed in doing it? Was it worth doing?

    Dostoyevski's "The Thief," for example, answers the question "Who
    is my neighbor?" Am I my brother's keeper? Yes. Is it right to let a man
    perish altogether? No, not even if he seems worthless, an incorrigible

    drunkard, lazy, ungrateful, a thief, a liar. Not even if I am poor and have
    very little to share with anyone, and he has no particular claim on me
    such as kinship or friendship. He is a human being, and I must not let

    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE

    According to the ancient conception, expressed by Cicero and Quintilian, figurative language includes any deviation, either in thought or expression, from the ordinary and simple modes of speaking. This would include the language of ordinary people moved by excitement to adopt short cuts and turns of expression which give their speech liveliness and vividness not ordinarily found in it.

    Cicero and Quintilian distinguished about ninety figures of speech, and Renaissance rhetoricians about two hundred in all, which were divided into tropes and schemes. Schemes were fashionings of language or thought deviating from the ordinary, which were divided into grammatical and rhetorical schemes. Grammatical schemes included devices which today are treated as means to improve style through grammar: variety of structure, parallel and antithetical structure, balance, rhythm, emphasis, elliptical structure, and the use of one part of speech for another, for example, nouns used as verbs. Rhetorical schemes of repetition were frequently used to emphasize parallel structure, balance, and rhythm. They included repetition of letters in alliteration and repetition of words. Rhetorical schemes of thought corresponded to the threefold means of persuasion: logos, pathos, and ethos. One hundred and twenty-two of the two hundred figures corresponded to the topics of logic and the forms of reasoning. We have already seen that litotes is the rhetorical counterpart of logical obversion. Other rhetorical schemes correspond to the enthymeme, the disjunctive and hypothetical syllogisms, and the dilemma.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Figurative Language Concepts\n\nExplain how the concept of figurative language, as described in the text, connects to the threefold means of persuasion (logos, pathos, ethos) mentioned in the passage.\n- **Step 1**: Identify which rhetorical schemes correspond to each of the three means of persuasion.\n- **Step 2**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how a specific rhetorical scheme enhances one of these persuasive methods.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the distinction between grammatical and rhetorical schemes is significant in the context of persuasive communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly integrate the text''s discussion of rhetorical schemes and their relationship to the threefold means of persuasion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Figurative Language in Everyday Speech\n\nThe text discusses how figurative language can arise from the ''language of ordinary people moved by excitement to adopt short cuts and turns of expression.'' Consider the following sentence: ''He''s a drunkard, a liar, a thief, a lazy man.''\n- **Part A**: Analyze this sentence as an example of figurative language, identifying at least two rhetorical schemes used.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of these rhetorical schemes contributes to the emotional impact of the sentence, in line with the text''s discussion of pathos.\n- **Part C**: Compare this to the ''ordinary and simple modes of speaking'' mentioned in the text.

    The modern concept of figures of speech is almost limited to those
    which ancient and Renaissance rhetoricians called tropes. A trope is the
    turning of a word from its ordinary and proper meaning to another not
    proper meaning, in order to increase its force and vividness. It is an
    imaginative, in contrast to a matter-of-fact, use of words. For example,
    "The knife is rusty" is a matter-of-fact use of rusty. "Their minds are
    Composition and Reading

    rusty" is a figurative use of rusty, turning it to a meaning not proper to
    it, but nonetheless forceful.

    The value of tropes lies in their power to convey ideas vividly in a
    condensed and picturesque style. They are means to achieve a clear,
    forceful, lively style. 'The most important trope is the metaphor.

    Renaissance rhetoricians distinguished from four to ten tropes;
    Quintilian, fourteen. We shall distinguish eight tropes (simile,
    metaphor, onomatopoeia, personification, antonomasia, metonymy,
    synecdoche, and irony) and shall notice from which topic of invention
    each is derived.®

    Tropes Based on Similarity

    Simile, metaphor, onomatopoeia, personification, and antonomasia are
    tropes based on a similarity between the elements which are compared.

    SIMILE

    A simile expresses through the words, like, as, or resembles an imagina-
    tive comparison between objects of different classes. A simile is not,
    strictly speaking, a trope, since the similarity is expressed and no word
    is turned to a meaning not proper to it. Its resemblance to metaphor is
    so basic, however, that this technical distinction will be ignored here.

    EXAMPLES: Simile

    My fate cries out,

    And makes each petty artery in this body

    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    —Hamlet 1.4.82-84

    Oh, my love is like a red, red rose
    That's newly sprung in June:
    My love is like the melody
    That's sweetly played in tune.
    —Robert Burns, "My love is like a red, red rose"

    Now, therefore, while the youthful hue

    METAPHOR
    A metaphor boldly states, without using a word of comparison, the identification of similar objects of different classes.

    EXAMPLES: Metaphor

    The Lord is my shepherd:
    there is nothing I lack.
    In green pastures, you let me graze;
    to safe water you lead me;
    you restore my strength.

    Is fallen into the sere, the yellow leaf.
    —Macbeth 5.3.22-23

    ONOMATOPOEIA
    Onomatopoeia is the use of words or rhythms whose sound imitates the
    sense.

    EXAMPLES: Onomatopoeia

    The moan of doves in immemorial elms
    And murmuring of innumerable bees.
    —Alfred Lord Tennyson, "The Princess"

    But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,

    The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar:

    When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw

    The line too labors, and the words move slow.

    PERSONIFICATION

    Personification is the attribution of life, sensation, and human qualities
    to objects of a lower order or to abstract ideas. Personification is based

It merits the name poetry if it has the requisite  \nqualities of thought, style, and rhythm, which will be discussed  \npresently. Outstanding examples are Lucretius' \"De Rerum Natura\"!2  \nand Pope's \"Essay on Criticism.\" Lyric poetry includes the song, hymn,  \nsonnet, ode, rondeau, and many other special verse forms. It expresses  \nthe poet's feelings, impressions, and reflections rather than an objective  \nincident, although an incident may occasion the reflections.

    Although the conceptions of poetry vary considerably, it is generally
    agreed that poetry is a communication of experience, of emotion as well
    as thought, which embraces the universal under the particular.

    Poetry may be defined as the expression in apt, rhythmical language
    of the thought, imagination, and emotion of the poet, reflecting some
    aspect of beauty and truth, and capable of arousing a response in the
    imagination and feelings of the reader or listener.

    The language of poetry is distinguished by an enhanced rhythm, al-
    though, according to Aristotle as well as Wordsworth, meter is not es-
    sential. It is further distinguished by exceptional energy, vividness,
    imagery, penetration, and compression, whereby much meaning is
    packed into few words. While achieving these qualities, great poets
    have as their primary mark, so far as form is concerned, the capacity to
    Composition and Reading 247

    arrange words in eloquent, inevitable, and unimprovable order and
    beauty; so far as matter is concerned, they must have a deep perception
    of truth and beauty in nature, man, and God.

    Poetry communicates experience that cannot be expressed in any
    other way. The poet sees and feels with a depth and intensity beyond that
    of the ordinary person; the poet communicates not thought only but this
    experience. To read poetry is to share the experience of the poet.

    The form of poetry is of its essence to such a degree that the form is
    felt to be inevitable; that is, it is felt to be the only form in which that
    matter could be satisfactorily communicated. Hence matter and form
    are united in poetry more intimately than in merely logical communi-
    cation. It is true that what one person considers to be poetry another
    may not. Poetry depends greatly on the psychological dimension of lan-
    guage, which is less objective than the logical dimension; the subjec-
    tive varies from person to person. There is, however, much poetry
    capable of evoking poetic response in so many readers through the years
    that it is universally judged to be truly poetry.

    The subjective character of a poetic impression is the theme of the
    following poem:

    The Solitary Reaper

    Behold her, single in the field,
    Yon solitary, Highland lass!
    Reaping and singing by herself;
    Stop here, or gently pass!

    Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
    And sings a melancholy strain;

    O listen! For the vale profound

    Is overflowing with the sound.

    No nightingale did ever chaunt
    More welcome notes to weary bands
    Of travelers in some shady haunt
    Among Arabian sands.

    A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
    In springtime from the cuckoo-bird,
    Breaking the silence of the seas

    Among the farthest Hebrides.

    Will no one tell me what she sings? —
    Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
    For old, unhappy, far-off things,
    And battles long ago.

    Or is it some more humble lay,
    Familiar matter of today?

    Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain
    That has been, and may be again?

    What'er the theme, the maiden sang
    As if her song could have no ending;
    I saw her singing at her work,

    And o'er the sickle bending —

    I listened, motionless and still;

    And, as I mounted up the hill,

    The music in my heart I bore

    Unlike the popular idea that the opposite of poetry is prose, the true
    opposite of poetry is matter-of-fact, as Wordsworth insists in his "Preface
    to the Lyrical Ballads." The opposite of prose is verse; both have
    rhythm, but verse has meter, and prose has not.

    Consequently, poetry should not be identified with verse: poetic pas-
    sages occur in novels and other prose writings; some verse is distinctly,
    often dully, matter-of-fact and anything but poetic. The following bits
    of verse are decidedly not poetry:

    Thirty days hath September,
    April, June, and November.

    Early to bed and early to rise
    Makes men healthy, wealthy, and wise.
    ELEMENTS OF FORM
    RHYTHM
    The emphasized rhythm essential to poetry may be achieved by various

    means.

    Parallelism
    Parallelism is the chief rhythmical device of Hebrew poetry. Paral-
    lelism has been called thought-rhyme because the commonest form is
    a repetition of thought in different words. If a psalm is read with the
    repeated parts omitted, one perceives at once that it is prosaic.

    There are three main types of parallelism. The following examples are from the Psalms.

    Repetitive parallelism (thought repeated):
    For my life is wasted with grief; and my years in sighs. (31:11)

    Antithetical parallelism (thought contrasted):
    For divine anger lasts but a moment;
    Divine favor lasts a lifetime. (30:6)

    Additive or synthetic parallelism (thought repeated and amplified):
    Such are the people who love the Lord
    that seek the face of the God of Jacob. (24:6)

    Caesura
    Caesura is a pause in a line of poetry usually in or near the middle. The
    Anglo-Saxon poets developed the alliterative line, which used the
    caesura with alliteration to create a strong and distinctive rhythm. Usu-
    ally, two words in the first half of the line connected alliteratively with
    one or two words in the second half of the line.

    We twain had talked, in time of youth
    and made our boast, we were merely boys,
    striplings still, —to stake our lives
    far at sea: and so we performed it.
    — Beowulf (Gummere's translation)

    Cadence
    Cadence relies on the natural rise and fall of the speaking voice. Free
    verse or vers libre uses the inherent cadence of language rather than a
    set metrical pattern. Brought to modern attention by the French sym-
    bolist poets of the late nineteenth century, free verse can be found in
    much modern poetry as well as in the Bible, particularly in the Psalms
    and the Song of Solomon.

    Had I the choice

    Had I the choice to tally greatest bards,
    To limn their portraits, stately, beautiful, and emulate at will,
    Homer with all his wars and warriors— Hector, Achilles, Ajax,
    250 = The Trivium

    Or Shakespeare's woe-entangled Hamlet, Lear, Othello—
    Tennyson's fair ladies,
    Meter or wit the best, or choice conceit to wield in perfect rhyme,
    delight of singers;
    These, these, O sea, all these I'd gladly barter,
    Would you the undulation of one wave, its trick to me transfer,
    Or breathe one breath of yours upon my verse,
    And leave its odor there.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Metrical Variations in Verse**\n\nConsider the following two lines from a poem and analyze the metrical variations: \n\nLine 1: "I wandered lonely as a cloud"\nLine 2: "That floats on high o''er vales and hills,\"\n\n- **Part A**: Determine the metrical structure of each line, including any possible metrical foot variations.\n- **Part B**: Identify any metrical variations (e.g., catalexis, feminine ending, anacrusis, truncation) that may occur in the transition between these lines.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the presence of these variations affects the rhythm and pacing of the poem.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of the specific metrical terms and their effects on the poem''s structure and flow.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Metrical Concepts**\n\nGiven the definitions of meter, feet, and scansion provided in the text, construct a logical argument to explain why the following statement is true: \n\n"A spondee is not a common metrical foot in English poetry, despite consisting of two stressed syllables, because it is often used to emphasize a word or phrase in a line."\n\n- **Part A**: Define a spondee based on the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain the function of a spondee in poetry, using the text''s explanation of its role as a substitute for a dactyl.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a line from a poem that contains a spondee and explain how its placement affects the metrical pattern.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically structured and explicitly reference the definitions and properties of metrical feet as presented in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    Note that the catalexis and feminine ending often belong to the pattern. Anacrusis and truncation never do. They are only means of adapting irregular lines to the prevailing pattern; for example, there are six anacrustic lines out of twenty-four lines in Blake's "The Tiger." The anacrustic lines are marked with asterisks.

    RHYTHM OR VERSE PHRASING

    Rhythm, or verse phrasing, is not identical with meter. Poems of the
    same meter may be dissimilar in rhythm, for the thought pattern may
    not coincide with the metrical pattern, although it fits into it. Compare
    the rhythm in the following excerpts from Pope's "An Essay On Criti-
    cism" and Browning's "My Last Duchess," both written in the same
    meter, iambic pentameter rhymed in couplets.

    A little learning is a dang'rous Thing;

    Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring:

    There shallow Draughts intoxicate the brain,

    And drinking largely sobers us again.
    —Alexander Pope, "An Essay on Criticism"

    That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,
    Looking as if she were alive. I call
    That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf's hands
    Worked busily a day, and there she stands.

    — Robert Browning, "My Last Duchess"

    Pope's use of end-stopped rhyme emphasizes the meter while
    Browning's use of run-on lines makes it more subtle. Each poet is mak-
    ing a choice that suits the purpose of the work.

    Poor verse, unpoetic, deserving to be called doggerel, results when
    the rhythm coincides too exactly with the meter. In good verse, the
    thythm seldom corresponds exactly with the meter, although it harmo-
    nizes with it and may be metrically perfect. The variety within order
    which thus characterizes good verse is achieved not by violating the
    metrical pattern but by using more subtle, artistic devices: by shifting
    the caesura, by using run-on lines as well as end-stopped lines, phrases
    of light and of heavy syllables, words of varying number of syllables —
    in a word, by setting the thought pattern in harmony with, but not in
    identity with, the metrical pattern. Good verse can be regular in meter
    but must have a varied rhythm. Both Pope and Browning write verse in
    which the rhythm is artistically varied.

    RHYME

    Rhyme is identity of sounds at the end of two or more words, with a dif-
    ference at the beginning. The rhyming must begin on stressed syllables.

    Kinds of Rhyme
    1 Masculine: words having one final stressed syllable rhyming, for
    example: reign, gain; hate, debate.

    2 Feminine: words having two or more syllables rhyming (the first of
    which must be stressed), for example: unruly, truly; towering, flowering.

    Note that feminine rhyme is not identical with feminine line-end-
    ing, which is the addition of one or two unstressed syllables at the end
    of a line of verse.

    EXAMPLES: Masculine and feminine rhyme

    With rue my heart is laden

    For golden friends | had,

    For many a rose-lipt maiden

    And many a lightfoot lad.

    —A. E. Housman, "With rue my heart is laden"

    This illustrates masculine rhyme in the second and fourth lines, and feminine rhyme in the first and
    third lines.

    Our lives would grow together
    In sad or singing weather.
    —Algernon Swinburne, "A Match"

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Meter and Rhythm in Poetry**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of meter and rhythm in Robert Browning''s ''My Last Duchess'' and Alexander Pope''s ''The Rape of the Lock.'' Specifically, address how each poet''s choice of line structure (run-on lines vs. end-stopped lines) affects the rhythm and how this relates to the concept of ''good verse'' discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s definition of ''good verse'' and explicitly link the line structure choices to the balance between metrical regularity and rhythmic variation.\n\n**Answer**:\n\nIn ''My Last Duchess,'' Browning employs run-on lines that create a continuous, flowing rhythm, which contrasts with the end-stopped lines of Pope''s ''The Rape of the Lock.'' This difference reflects the text''s emphasis on ''good verse'' as requiring varied rhythm within a regular meter. Browning''s approach aligns with the idea that good verse should not have rhythm that coincides too exactly with the meter, instead using subtle devices like run-on lines to introduce variation. Pope''s end-stopped lines, while maintaining a strict meter, may result in ''poor verse'' if the rhythm becomes too rigid. Thus, Browning''s use of run-on lines demonstrates a more artistic balance between meter and rhythm, as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhyme Types in Poetry**\n\nIdentify and explain the rhyme scheme in the provided examples from the text. Specifically, analyze the rhyme scheme in the two examples given (Housman''s and Swinburne''s) and determine whether they exemplify masculine, feminine, or a combination of both.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s definitions of masculine and feminine rhyme and provide clear examples from the given poems.\n\n**Answer**:\n\nIn Housman''s poem, the rhyme scheme is a combination of masculine and feminine rhyme. The first and third lines (''laden'' and ''had'') rhyme as masculine rhymes, while the second and fourth lines (''reign'' and ''gain'') also form a masculine rhyme. The first and third lines (''With rue my heart is laden'' and ''For many a rose-lipt maiden'') exhibit feminine rhyme because ''laden'' and ''maiden'' have two or more syllables, with the first being stressed. In Swinburne''s poem, the rhyme scheme is masculine, with ''weather'' and ''match'' rhyming as masculine rhymes. This aligns with the text''s distinction between masculine and feminine rhyme, where feminine rhyme requires two or more syllables with the first stressed.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Verse Quality**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of ''good verse,'' evaluate the claim that ''all poetry must have a strict meter to be considered good verse.'' Provide a counterargument using examples from the text and explain how the concept of ''good verse'' supports your position.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definition of ''good verse'' and demonstrate an understanding of how artistic devices beyond strict meter contribute to poetic quality.\n\n**Answer**:\n\nThe claim that ''all poetry must have a strict meter to be considered good verse'' is invalid according to the text. ''Good verse'' is characterized by a regular meter but with a varied rhythm, achieved through artistic devices like run-on lines and caesural shifts. For example, Browning''s ''My Last Duchess'' uses run-on lines to create a continuous rhythm that varies the metrical pattern without violating it, demonstrating that strict meter alone is not sufficient. The text emphasizes that ''good verse'' requires a balance between metrical regularity and rhythmic variation, which can be achieved through subtle devices rather than rigid meter. Thus, the quality of verse depends on the interplay between meter and rhythm, not solely on the strictness of the meter.'

    Variations of Rhyme
    Imperfect rhyme or slant rhyme refers to words that are not identical
    in rhyming sounds, for example: heaven and even, geese and bees. (But
    geese and fleece are perfect rhymes; so are bees and ease.)

    254 = The Trivium

    Eye rhyme is a name given to the imperfect rhyme of words that look
    alike but do not sound exactly alike, for example: seven and even, love
    and prove.

    Position of the Rhyming Words
    End rhyme is the rhyming of a word at the end of one line with a
    word at the end of another line. This is the most usual form.

    Internal rhyme is the rhyming of a word in the middle of a line with
    another in the same line, usually at the end of it.

    EXAMPLES: End rhyme and internal rhyme

    Who will go drive with Fergus now,

    And pierce the deep wood's woven shade,

    And dance upon the level shore?

    Young man, lift up your russet brow,

    And lift your tender eyelids, maid,

    And brood on hope and fear no more

    —William Butler Yeats, "Who Goes with Fergus?"

    Yeats' poem illustrates end rhyme in lines one and four, two and five, and three and six.

    The splendor falls on castle walls
    And snowy summits old in story;
    The long light shakes across the lakes,
    And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
    Blow, bugle: answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.
    —Alfred Lord Tennyson, "The splendor falls on castle walls"

    Tennyson's poem illustrates end rhyme (lines two and four, five and six) and internal rhyme ("falls'
    and "walls" in line one, and "shakes" and "lakes" in line three).

    OTHER POETIC ELEMENTS

    Assonance
    Assonance is identity of vowel sound in the middle of two or more words
    in the same line, with a difference at the beginning and end. An ex-
    ample is Tennyson's line: "A hand that can be clasped no more."

- prompt: "Forms of Metrical Discourse  \nBLANK VERSE  \nBlank verse is unrhymed iambic pentameter. Iambic pentameter is the  \nmost important meter in English. Iambic meter is best adapted to the  \nEnglish language; and pentameter, neither too long nor too short, is  \nleast monotonous. Moving the caesura creates a pleasing variety of ef-  \nfect since the caesura does not divide the line into halves.

    ITALIAN SONNET

    The Italian or Petrarchan sonnet is written in iambic pentameter. All
    sonnets are fourteen lines. In an Italian sonnet, the poem divides into
    an octave and sestet, rhyming abbaabba cdecde. The sestet may vary
    from this somewhat, for example, cdeded, or cdedee. The form is
    named for Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374), who wrote a series of son-
    nets to a woman named Laura. John Milton used the more classical
    form of the sonnet in contrast to earlier English Renaissance writers,
    who used an adaptation.

    On His Blindness

    When I consider how my light is spent

    Ere half my days in this dark world and wide
    And that one talent which is death to hide,
    Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
    To serve therewith my Maker, and present

    My true account, lest he returning chide;

    Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?

    I fondly ask; but Patience to prevent

    That murmur, soon replies, God does not need
    Either man's work or his own gifts; who best
    Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
    Is kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed

    And post o'er land and ocean without rest;

    They also serve who only stand and wait.

    The English or Shakespearean sonnet is written in iambic pentameter. It is composed of three heroic quatrains followed by a rhymed couplet. The pattern is abab cded efef gg. Shakespeare did not create this adaptation of the sonnet, but he was the most famous writer who used the form.

    Sonnet 18

    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    And often is his gold complexion dimmed
    And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
    By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade
    Nor lose possession of the fair thou ow'st,
    Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
    When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st.
    As long as men can breathe and eyes can see,
    So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
    — William Shakespeare

    SPENSERIAN STANZA

    The Spenserian stanza has nine lines rhyming ababbcbcc; the first eight lines are of iambic pentameter, but the last is an alexandrine, which is iambic hexameter. The form is named for Edmund Spenser (1552? 1599), who devised it for his epic, The Faerie Queene. In the nineteenth century Lord Byron used the form in his long narrative poem,

    Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.

    from Childe Harold's Pilgrimage Canto IV, Stanza 1

    I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs,

    A palace and a prison on each hand:

    I saw from out the wave her structures rise
    As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand:
    A thousand years their cloudy wings expand
    Around me, and a dying Glory smiles

    O'er the far times, when many a subject land
    Looked to the winged Lion's marble piles,
    Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles!
    — George Gordon, Lord Byron

- prompt: |-
    The rondeau is a lyric poem of fifteen lines divided into three stanzas
    of no determined length. It rhymes aabba aabba aabba (R means re-
    frain). The refrain usually picks up a word, a phrase, or a clause from
    the opening line of the poem.

    In Flanders Fields

    In Flanders fields the poppies blow
    Between the crosses row on row,
    That mark our place; and in the sky
    The larks, still bravely singing, fly
    Scarce heard amid the guns below.

    We are the Dead. Short days ago

    We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
    Loved and were loved, and now we lie
    In Flanders fields.

    Take up our quarrel with the foe:
    To you from failing hands we throw
    The torch; be yours to hold it high.
    If ye break faith with us who die
    We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
    In Flanders fields.
    —John McCrae

    TRIOLET

    The triolet rhymes ABaAabAB. (The capital letters stand for lines re-
    frain.) Usually the lines are short, but they may vary in length and
    rhythm.

    Serenade Triolet

    Why is the moon
    Awake when thou sleepest?
    To the nightingale's tune

    LIMERICK
    The limerick is the only indigenous English verse form. It is five lines

    long, and the dominant foot is the anapest.

- prompt: "Definition and a Brief History  \nThe essay is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of  \nwriting. An essay can be broadly defined as a short prose work on a sin-  \ngle topic. Michel Eyquem de Montaigne first used the word as a literary  \nterm with the publication of his *Essais* in 1650. The French word *essais*  \nmeans \"attempts\" and suggests that the works offered by Montaigne  \nwere more informal and personal than an academic, philosophical work  \non the same subject. Francis Bacon, the first English writer to use the  \nterm, published a collection of aphorisms on a specific topic but later  \nexpanded the concept into longer works that were more developed in  \nlength and more personal in tone.  \n\nThe invention of the periodical in the seventeenth century gave the  \nessay a broad audience. Joseph Addison and Richard Steele wrote lively  \nessays on the manners and quirks of their day and published them in  \nthe *Tatler* and the *Spectator*. The names of the periodicals suggest the  \nmode of the writing. Addison and Steele observed and commented in  \na colloquial manner that invited the reader in as a fellow observer. The  \nAmerican writer Washington Irving wrote a similar type of essay. Dur-  \ning the Romantic movement in the early nineteenth century, the essay  \ndeveloped a familiar and informal tone. Writers often used autobio-  \ngraphical material and made it interesting through the use of whimsy,  \nwit, and sentiment. Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt, James Leigh Hunt,  \nand Thomas DeQuincey are the most famous writers of the personal  \nessay of this era.  \n\nThe American Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David  \nThoreau, did not adopt the whimsical tone of the English essayists.  \nThoreau's nature writing uses autobiography, but the writing is less self-  \nconsciously literary. Both Emerson and Thoreau wrote formal essays  \nelucidating their beliefs.  \n\nIn the Victorian Age, the formal essay was more popular. Long book  \nreviews and essays on historical, scientific, religious, and educational  \ntopics were written by Victorian writers including Thomas Carlyle, John  \nRuskin, Walter Pater, Thomas Huxley, Matthew Arnold, and John  \nHenry Newman.\n\nThe text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Essay Definition and Historical Development**\n\nUsing the text provided, explain how the definition of an essay as a ''short prose work on a single topic'' has evolved through different historical periods.\n- **Step 1**: Reference Montaigne''s original use of the term and its connection to personal, informal writing.\n- **Step 2**: Describe how Bacon''s essays expanded the form and purpose of the genre.\n- **Step 3**: Analyze the role of periodicals in broadening the essay''s audience during the 17th century.\n- **Step 4**: Compare the American Romantic essays (e.g., Irving) with the English Romantic essays (e.g., Lamb, Hazlitt) in terms of tone and content.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the historical progression described in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how the definition and purpose of essays have changed over time.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Essay Characteristics**\n\nBased on the text, categorize the following works as essays or not essays, and justify your decision using the defining characteristics provided:\n1. *Essais* by Michel de Montaigne\n2. A collection of aphorisms on a specific topic by Francis Bacon\n3. A long book review published in a 19th-century journal\n4. A detailed historical analysis of the Industrial Revolution by a Victorian writer\n5. A short personal reflection on a recent trip written in a diary\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each item, state whether it is an essay and provide a justification based on the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the diary entry is not classified as an essay, even though it is a personal reflection.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s emphasis on ''single topic'' and ''prose work'' influences the classification of these works.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the essay''s defining characteristics as presented in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Essay History and Purpose**\n\nImagine you are a writer in the 18th century, and you are considering writing an essay on the topic of ''The Impact of the Industrial Revolution on Society.'' Using the text provided, answer the following questions:\n- **Part A**: What historical context would you draw upon to frame your essay, based on the development of the essay form during the 17th and 18th centuries?\n- **Part B**: How would you approach the tone and style of your essay, considering the influence of the American and English Romantics?\n- **Part C**: What form would your essay take, and how would you use the structure of the essay to convey your argument?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the historical context and stylistic elements discussed in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how the essay form has evolved to serve different purposes.'

- prompt: |-
    The difficulty of labeling or defining the essay becomes more apparent when one thinks of Pope's "Essay on Criticism" and "Essay on Man," both of which are poetry. Also, the linear history from Montaigne to the Victorian writers ignores works like Aristotle's Poetics, which fit the concept of the essay.

    The Familiar Essay
    The familiar essay aims to please rather than to inform the reader. It stands between story and exposition, and, like the lyric, it is a subjective communication of thought and feeling colored by the personality and mood of the author. A commonplace, even trivial, subject is made charming, amusing, or piquant when discussed in a chatty, casual, informal manner by a person who is delightfully whimsical, fanciful,
    belligerent, or even pompous. The style of the familiar essay is an essential element and should have a quality similar to that of a story, full of feeling, imagination, and vivid detail.

    The Formal Essay

    The style of the formal essay varies depending on the theme, purpose, and audience. It would include philosophical, scientific, religious, and historical writing.

    The literary critical essay may, like Aristotle's Poetics or Dryden's "Essay of Dramatic Poesy," expound critical principles with a few illustrations for clarity; or it may apply critical principles in evaluating a particular work, as in a book review or a critical study such as a dissertation or a research paper.

    A BRIEF GUIDE TO COMPOSITION

    Expository writing has as its primary aim to inform, to communicate ideas from writer to reader directly through words, not indirectly through character and situation.¹⁴ Clear expository composition is needed in all walks of life. It is the indispensable tool both of teaching and of being taught. Textbooks, class explanations, lectures, recitations, examinations are expository. So also are such practical matters as describing a process, writing directions, summaries, reports, business letters, social letters. Other, more literary forms of expression include the essay which defines a term or elaborates a general proposition, literary criticism, dramatic and art criticism, the formal and the familiar essay.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Essay Types and Purpose**\n\nCompare and contrast the purposes and styles of the ''familiar essay'' and the ''formal essay'' as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary purpose of each essay type.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the stylistic differences, including the tone, formality, and use of subject matter.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of each essay type based on the text''s descriptions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of both essay types and their distinct characteristics.'

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Essay Classification**\n\nThe text mentions that the essay can be formal or familiar, and that it differs from other literary forms like the lyric.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the essay''s subjective nature in the familiar essay contrasts with the objective nature of expository writing.\n- **Part B**: Use the text to argue why Aristotle''s ''Poetics'' might not fit into the traditional essay classification, despite being a critical work.\n- **Part C**: Create a hypothetical scenario where a writer might choose to write a formal essay versus a familiar essay, and explain the reasoning behind each choice.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s definitions and examples to support your reasoning.'

- prompt: |-
    Before you begin to write, carefully think through your purpose and
    the means to gain and hold the interest of the particular readers you
    address. Find a common ground with them. Begin perhaps with a
    question or an unexpected statement. Do not write what is obvious,
    trite, or insipid to them—what anyone can see on the run. Penetrate
    into your subject. Divide!> and conquer. For example, the ordinary ob-
    server sees a drop of blood as a mere blob of red, and he has little to
    say about it. The expert looking through a microscope sees it divided
    into plasma and red and white corpuscles that indicate health or dis-
    ease; she has much to say about it that is enlightening and valuable,
    pointing to remedies.

    To discover the parts of the whole, their relation to each other and
    to the whole, is a prime means to advance in knowledge and a measure
    of intellectual power. Discover differences, contrasts. Distinguish
    meanings. Penetrate likenesses; use comparison, analogy, metaphor, ex-
    amples. Use other topics of invention, especially definition, cause and
    effect. The four causes equivalent in rhetoric to who, what, how, why
    help to open up a subject.

    Divide, first to penetrate into your subject matter, then to analyze it
    into its parts, and finally to organize it into a whole having unity, co-
    herence, and emphasis. These three principles should govern the con-
    struction of the sentence, the paragraph, and the whole work.

    Outline your comparison, determine which topics are coordinate,
    which subordinate. Every division results in at least two parts. The subor-
    dinate topics should add up to the main topic which they divide, and the
    main topics to the whole composition. What sequence of topics will most
    effectively promote coherence and emphasis? The position of greatest
    emphasis is at the end; the next greatest, at the beginning; the least, in the
    middle. You can also emphasize an idea by repeating it in different
    words, or in the same words skillfully placed, and by giving it a greater
    proportion of space. Announce your plan early in your paper and keep
    your reader reminded of it by clear transitions from one topic to the next.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Structure of Knowledge**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of dividing a subject into parts to understand its whole. Consider the three principles of division mentioned: dividing into parts, analyzing into components, and organizing into a coherent whole. How does this process reflect the broader goal of advancing knowledge?\n- **Step 1**: Explain the role of division in uncovering the relationships between parts.\n- **Step 2**: Justify how analysis leads to a deeper understanding of the subject''s components.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the significance of organizing into a coherent whole in the context of intellectual progress.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the three principles and demonstrate how they collectively contribute to the advancement of knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**The Art of Logical Argumentation**\n\nThe text emphasizes the use of definitions, cause and effect, and the four causes (who, what, how, why) in constructing arguments. Construct a logical argument using these elements to explain the role of rhetoric in education.\n- **Step 1**: Define the purpose of rhetoric in education using the ''what'' cause.\n- **Step 2**: Explain the ''why'' cause by linking rhetoric to the development of critical thinking.\n- **Step 3**: Use the ''how'' cause to describe the method of teaching rhetoric through structured analysis and discussion.\n- **Step 4**: Conclude with the ''who'' cause, identifying the role of the educator in fostering rhetorical skills.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must clearly incorporate all four causes and demonstrate a logical progression from definition to application.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing the Principles of Coherence**\n\nThe text highlights the importance of sequence and emphasis in maintaining coherence in writing. Design a structure for a persuasive essay on climate change that follows the principles of emphasis and sequence described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the main topic and the sequence of subtopics that will be discussed.\n- **Step 2**: Assign emphasis to the most critical points, placing them at the beginning and end of the essay.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how repetition and transitions will enhance the essay''s coherence and effectiveness.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your structure must reflect the principles of emphasis and sequence, and your explanation must demonstrate an understanding of how these elements contribute to persuasive writing.'

- prompt: |-
    Clarity is the first requisite of style in expository writing. (Grammatical correctness is a prerequisite.) Help your reader to understand the abstract by providing concrete examples from which the reader can make the abstraction and so comprehend it thoroughly. The intellect is normally reached through the imagination, and therefore, even in workaday prose, figurative language is an effective means to promote both clarity and interest. The writer must achieve clarity and hold interest by avoiding monotony.

    Variety is a cardinal principle of effective style. There should be variety in diction through the use of synonyms, in sentence length, in grammatical structure, and in rhythm. Variety in grammatical structure and rhythm are secured through omitting or adding conjunctions, through differences in word order, in sentence beginnings, in the use of simple, compound, and complex sentences, of prepositional and participial phrases, of clauses, of loose and periodic structure, of parallel structure. These structures may be clarified and emphasized by the effective repetition of words.

    In the following passage from Washington Irving, the repeated "he" must emphasize parallel structure, while each verb following it is varied, as is also the length of the clauses. Conjunctions are omitted in one clause and an extra one is added in another. This paragraph is developed by division.

    The stranger who would form a correct opinion of the English character .. . must go forth into the country; he must sojourn in villages and hamlets; he must visit castles, villas, farmhouses, cottages; he must wander through parks and gardens; along hedges and green lanes; he must loiter about country churches; attend wakes and fairs and other rural festivals; and cope with the people in all their conditions and all their habits and humors.

    In a periodic sentence the meaning is held in suspense until the end, as in this sentence from Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus:

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing the Use of Parallel Structure in a Periodic Sentence\n\nExamine the following sentence from Thomas Carlyle''s Sartor Resartus: \n\"The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.\"\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify the verb form used for the subject ''The text'' and describe how this choice contributes to the sentence''s periodic structure.\n- Compare this to the example from Washington Irving, where the repeated ''he'' emphasizes parallel structure.\n- Explain how the periodic structure in Carlyle''s sentence creates suspense and how this effect is similar to the parallel structure in Irving''s paragraph.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of periodic sentences, parallel structure, and the rhetorical effects of these elements. Use specific examples from the text to support your analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Synthesizing Style Principles in Expository Writing\n\nThe passage from Washington Irving demonstrates the use of parallel structure through the repeated ''he'' and varied verb forms. The text also emphasizes the importance of variety in diction, sentence length, and grammatical structure.\n\n**Task**:\n- Create a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) that illustrates the principles of clarity, variety, and effective style as outlined in the text.\n- Your paragraph must include at least two different verb tenses, three different sentence structures (simple, compound, complex), and two synonyms for ''begin''.\n- Explain how your paragraph reflects the principles of effective expository writing as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be grammatically correct and demonstrate a clear understanding of the style principles. Your explanation must connect the elements of your paragraph to the concepts of clarity, variety, and effective style.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Evaluating Rhetorical Devices in Periodic Sentences\n\nConsider the periodic sentence from Thomas Carlyle: \n\"The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.\"\n\n**Task**:\n- Analyze the rhetorical effect of the periodic structure in this sentence.\n- Compare this to the parallel structure in Washington Irving''s paragraph, and explain how both devices serve different purposes in expository writing.\n- Construct a periodic sentence of your own that conveys a clear message, and explain how its structure contributes to the intended effect.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of periodic sentences and parallel structure. Your self-created sentence must be grammatically correct and clearly convey a message, with an explanation of its rhetorical effect.'

    Considering our present advanced state of culture, and how the Torch of Science has now been brandished and borne about, with more or less effect, for five-thousand years and upwards; how in these times especially, not only the Torch still burns, and perhaps more fiercely than ever, but innumerable Rush-lights, and Sulphur-matches, kindled thereat, are also glancing in every direction, so that not the smallest cranny or doghole in Nature or Art can remain unilluminated—it might strike the reflective mind with some surprise that hitherto little or nothing of a fundamental character, whether in the way of Philosophy or History, has been written on the subject of Clothes.

    In the following passage from Stewart Edward White's "On Making Camp," the rhythm reflects the boy's unorganized and scattered efforts.

    Dick was anxiously mixing batter for the cakes, attempting to stir a pot of rice often enough to prevent it from burning, and trying to rustle sufficient dry wood to keep the fire going. . . . At each instant he had to desert his flour sack to rescue the coffee pot, or to shift the kettle, or to dab hastily at the rice, or to stamp out the small brush, or to pile on more dry twigs.

    Condense your sentences. Pack much meaning into few words. Use words that are fresh, accurate, vivid, specific —like torrent, strode, sauntered. Vivid diction and imagery, effective combinations of words, especially of nouns and verbs, arresting phrases, metaphors, and allusions contribute to compression of style. Verbs, above all, are the key to a vigorous style.

    To give your writing life and movement, use vivid verbs in the active voice. Put the verb idea into the verb rather than into an abstract noun with an empty verb like occur. Cut out deadwood — needless words that dilute your thought and make your style insipid, dull, wordy. Prefer the specific expression to the general, the positive to the negative, the definite to the indefinite.

    Aristotle gives this definition: "Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion" (1.2). However, even in the Rhetoric, Aristotle must defend its use. He argues that the use of a good thing for a bad end does not negate the goodness of the thing itself. "And it might be objected that one who uses such power of speech unjustly might do great harm, that is a charge which may be made in common against all good things except virtue, and above all against the things that are most useful, as strength, health, wealth, generalship" (1.1).

    14. The Trivium offers a precision in thinking that is frequently reflected in the use of categories. In this regard Sister Miriam Joseph follows Aristotle, whose writings inform The Trivium. Categories is among Aristotle's works that present his theory of logic.

    THE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF LANGUAGE

    1. Sister Miriam Joseph's contention that human beings are the only animals to have developed language is compatible with contemporary scientific thought. In "The Gift of Gab," Discover 19 (1998): 56-64, Matt Cartmill notes, "The birds and beasts can use their signals to attract, threaten, or alert each other, but they can't ask questions, strike bargains, tell stories or lay out a plan of action." Cartmill's article explores the physiological adaptations that made language possible for Homo sapiens. The search implies that the ability to create language made higher-order thinking possible.

    2. When an angel chooses to use language, he might sound like Gabriel in Milton's Paradise Lost. Here, Gabriel is addressing Satan, who has escaped from hell to find Adam and Eve. Gabriel taunts Satan by suggesting that he deserted his followers because he is too weak to endure the consequences of defying God.

    But wherefore thou alone? Wherefore with thee

    Came not all hell! broke loose? Is pain to them

    Less pain, less to be fled? Or thou than they

    Less hardy to endure? Courageous chief,

    The first in flight from pain, hadst thou alleged

    To thy deserted host this cause of flight

    Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.

    3. Both "temporary" and "permanent" are relative terms in regard to symbols. Usually a larger group of people accept the convention of a permanent symbol. Moreover, permanent symbols, such as chemical formulas or numbers, are incorporated into standardized bodies of knowledge.

    4. The answer is DCCCCKXXXX, which could be shortened to CMXL. The Roman numerals translate to Arabic numerals as follows: 235 x 4 = 940.

    6. Although Latin was used in the liturgies of the Catholic Church for centuries,
    after Vatican II (1962), congregations began using the local language. However, the Vat-
    ican still writes in Latin on matters of doctrine. Scientific nomenclature also uses Latin.

    7. The metaphysical concepts of matter and form are central to the view of the triv-
    ium presented in this book. The concepts become easier to understand as they are
    woven throughout the text.

    8. The International Phonetic Alphabet can be found in most dictionaries.

    9. The word class means any type of grouping that recognizes those characteristics
    which the individuals in the group have in common. As used in The Trivium, class refers
    to both species and genus.

    10. Designations of species and genus are relative in language, unlike in science.
    For example, tulip, grass, elm could be designated as a species in that they are all grow-
    ing things. Tulip could be grouped with daffodil and hyacinth and considered as the
    species spring bulbs. Spring bulbs could then be labeled in the genus perennial. An-
    nual flowers, perennial flowers, and vegetables could be labeled as the species nonev-
    ergreens and then be included in the genus plants, along with evergreens and other
    nonevergreens. In binomial nomenclature, the system of biological classification in-
    vented by Carolus Linnaeus, each species belongs to a genus and then a family, an
    order, a class, a phylum, and a kingdom. The species is known by the two names (bi-
    nomial) that designate species and genus, and they do not change unless the scientific
    thinking on the species changes. A dog is always Canis familiaris.

    11. One might argue that some animals are capable of some degree of abstraction.
    For example, if a dog has been hit with one sort of a broom, it will know enough to
    cower from another kind of broom. At some level the dog has abstracted the concept
    of "broomness." TM

    20. The word intension means the sum of attributes contained in a word. Intention means the way in which a word is used. In the sentence "Roses lined the walkway of the cottage garden," roses is used in first intention because it symbolizes the reality of the flower. Its intension (or meaning) is a flower with prickly stems, pinnately compound leaves, and variously colored petals.

    21. The plays and sonnets of William Shakespeare are quoted from The Riverside Shakespeare (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1974).

    22. In the stanza from Gray's "Elegy," awaits is the third person, singular form of the verb await, so it must have a singular subject. Hour is the subject of awaits. In normal English word order, the sentence would read, "The inevitable hour awaits the boast of heraldry, the pomp of power, and all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave."

    GENERAL GRAMMAR

    1. Chapter Three presents grammatical concepts that can be applied to all languages—those that exist now, those no longer used, those not yet invented. General grammar describes the relationship between language and reality. General grammar poses the question: How does the intellect use language to translate reality?

    2. Syntactical refers to the arrangement of words into sentences.

    3. Ten categories of being which are introduced in Chapter Two are substance and the nine accidents: quantity, quality, relation, action, passion, when, where, posture, and habiliment.

    4. The word accident comes from the Latin accidere, to happen. Normally, accidents refer to those events that cannot be predicted. In the ten categories of being, however, accidents are those elements that cannot exist alone. Accidents exist in substance. Some accidents are essential to the substance, in the sense of making it what it is, and some accidents are nonessential. Consider the sentence "A person thinks." Person is a substance and as such is a reality designated by a noun. Thinks is an action (one of the nine accidents within the categories of being) and as such is a reality designated by a verb. The ability to think is an essential quality of human nature, but it is not a quality that exists outside the person.

    5. Words such as anger, love, and happiness express emotion, but the intellect ab-
    stracts those emotional qualities from experience. The process of abstracting ideas from
    reality differs from the emotion expressed by an interjection, which expresses an emo-
    tion that has not been processed by the mind.

    6. Recall that accident refers to those elements that can only exist within substance.
    By conceiving of the accident as an abstract quality, the thinking being makes the qual-
    ity into a substantive or noun. The word love expresses a reality which can only exist
    within a being who experiences emotion. The mind's ability to abstract, to conceive of
    qualities apart from the reality within which they exist, creates the necessity for abstract
    nouns.

    7. The categories referred to are quantity, quality, relation, action, passion, posture,
    and habiliment.

    8. The Story of English written by Robert McCrum, William Cran, and Robert
    MacNeil (New York: Viking Press, 1986) provides an interesting note on the introduc-
    tion of abstract substantives into English. "The importance of this cultural revolution
    {the introduction of Christianity into England by the Benedictine monk Saint Augus-
    tine in 597] in the story of the English language is not merely that it strengthened and
    enriched Old English with new words, more than 400 of which survive to this day, but
    also that it gave English the capacity to express abstract thought. Before the coming of
    Saint Augustine, it was easy to express the common experience of life—sun and moon,
    hand and heart, sea and land, heat and cold— in Old English, but much harder to ex-
    press more subtle ideas" (55 and 56).

    9. Substantives, as defined in general grammar, include phrases as well as single
    words.

    10. Consider the sentence, "Sophia is the girl whom I know from school." In the
    clause -- whom I know from school—whom is in the accusative case because it receives
    the action of know. Whom refers to girl, which is in the nominative case, but the case
    of whom is determined by its use in the clause.

    11. The distinction between term and word is explained in Chapter Four. Briefly, a
    term is a word used to communicate a concept.

Justify your answer based on the text''s distinction between term and word.\n- **Part C**: Relate the concept of abstract substantives (as introduced in the Story of English) to the grammatical role of "know" in the sentence. How does the abstract nature of "know" contribute to the sentence''s meaning?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of grammatical cases, the distinction between terms and words, and the role of abstract substantives in language.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Categories and Abstract Nouns**\n\nThe text categorizes concepts into quantity, quality, relation, action, passion, posture, and habiliment. Consider the word "happiness" as an abstract noun.\n- **Part A**: Assign "happiness" to one of the seven categories and justify your choice using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Using the text''s discussion on abstract substantives, explain why the word "happiness" is not a concrete noun but an abstract substantive.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that connects the development of abstract substantives to the ability of humans to express complex emotions and ideas, as noted in the Story of English.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the seven categories and the text''s discussion on abstract substantives to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of their role in language and thought.'

    12. In English grammar, words in the dative case are called indirect objects. In the
    sentence, "Shakespeare gave the world A Midsummer's Night Dream," world is an in-
    direct object (dative case) and A Midsummer's Night Dream is the direct object (accu-
    sative). The dative case follows verbs like give, tell, deliver, etc., which predicate a re-
    ceiver and something to be received. "The quarterback threw Dan the football." The
    quarterback did not throw Dan; he threw the football, so the football receives the ac-
    tion.

    13. Puero is the dative singular of puer and means "to the boy." Noctis is the geni-
    tive singular of nox and means "of night."

    14. A gerund is the ing form of a verb used as a noun. Swimming requires strength.
    Climbing dangerous mountain peaks involves skills, training, and courage. Swimming,
    training, and climbing are gerunds.

    15. A participle is a word formed from a verb that acts as an adjective. A present
    participle ends in ing and a past participle ends in d, ed, n, en, t. If a word ends in ing,
    it needs an auxiliary verb to function as the verb in a sentence: He was riding the waves.
    Was is the auxiliary verb. If an ing word modifies a noun, it is a participle. If an ing word
    acts as a noun, it is a gerund. The riding cowboy entertained the crowd (participle).
    Riding a wave in Hawaii was her dream (gerund). A gerund or a participle still retains
    some qualities of a verb and so can take an object or be modified by an adverb.

    16. This sentence illustrates the importance of correct punctuation. If the sentence
    were punctuated the following way, "Jane, my uncle's law partner, considers that man
    to be a scoundrel," then Jane would be the subject and partner an appositive.

    17. The concept of the copula will be explained fully in this chapter.

    18. The infinitive form is the word to plus the singular, first person, present tense

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Dative Case and Verb Usage**\n\nIn the sentence, "Shakespeare gave the world A Midsummer''s Night Dream," identify and explain the roles of the dative and accusative cases. Then, create a new sentence that uses the dative case with a verb like ''deliver'' and a direct object.\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the original sentence to determine the dative and accusative elements.\n- **Step 2**: Construct a new sentence using the dative case with the verb ''deliver'' and a direct object.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your new sentence by explaining how the dative case functions in relation to the verb.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly identify the grammatical roles and demonstrate an understanding of the dative case''s function in verb constructions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Participle and Gerund Usage**\n\nCompare and contrast the use of a participle and a gerund in the sentences: ''Riding a wave in Hawaii was her dream'' and ''The riding cowboy entertained the crowd.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify which part of speech each word (riding and dream) is in the first sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Identify which part of speech each word (riding and cowboy) is in the second sentence.\n- **Step 3**: Explain the difference in function between the two sentences, referencing the text''s explanation of participles and gerunds.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the grammatical functions of participles and gerunds and apply this understanding to the given examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Punctuation**\n\nConsider the sentence: "Jane, my uncle''s law partner, considers that man to be a scoundrel."\n- **Part A**: Explain the grammatical role of the appositive phrase "my uncle''s law partner."\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence with correct punctuation, ensuring that the appositive is properly set off.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the original punctuation is incorrect and how the appositive functions in the sentence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of appositive structure and correct punctuation conventions as outlined in the text.'

    of the verb, for example, to sing, to joust, to read. The infinitive can be used as a noun,
    an adjective, or an adverb. In the sentence, "Jane, my uncle's law partner considers that
    man to be a scoundrel," to be is used as an adjective modifying man. What kind of man?
    A (to be a scoundrel) man.

    19. Indirect discourse refers to the statements of a speaker which are summarized
    rather than reported verbatim and enclosed in quotation marks.

    20. The predicate is that which is asserted (predicated) of the subject.

    21. The Decalogue refers to the Ten Commandments.

    22. The nicety of addressing inferiors in the imperative and superiors in the opta-
    tive is less followed today.

    23. Optative refers to wishing, and hortatory, to persuading.

    24. The verb turns, when it means to change, is another example of an intransitive
    verb which requires a complement. "He turned angry when he heard the news."

    25. An intransitive verb never requires a direct object because a direct object re-
    ceives the action of the verb, and an intransitive verb does not pass the action along to
    a complement. An intransitive verb, like to become or to turn, takes a subjective com-
    plement.

    26. Under the category of attributives, verbals are considered along with verbs. The
    other primary attributive is the adjective.

    27. Because of its length and because it contains a dependent clause, the follow-
    ing phrase could be mistaken for a sentence, but it is, of course, a fragment. "Swim-
    ming so far that she reached the outer limits of the bay and could look back and see the
    coastline." It could not even be labeled as a gerund phrase or a participial phrase un-
    less it were part of a sentence.

    28. In English an infinitive can also perform the function of an adjective (The play
    to see is Hamlet) or of an adverb (Robert joined the health club to lose weight).

    32. In grammar the word restrictive means to limit, define (therefore restrict)
    meaning. Some grammar books discuss restrictive elements as essential and nonrestrictive as
    nonessential. In other words, if the modifying clause limits the meaning so that with-
    out the clause the sentence does not communicate the correct information, the clause
    is essential.

    33. The statement that substances do not coalesce in nature seems to be contra-
    dicted by the chemical elements, which combine to create different substances. Per-
    haps the distinction that Sister Miriam Joseph intends is based on exactly that point:
    when substances coalesce in nature, they change and become a new substance.

    34. A construct is a composite concept. Frequently, a word symbolizes a concept
    which combines both natural species with qualifications that are only accidental. Bend-
    ing is not germane to the species tree.

    35. A verbal auxiliary combines with another verb. The words have and has act as
    verbal auxiliaries in creating the perfect tenses.

    36. When a sentence is converted from active voice to passive voice, the direct ob-
    ject should become the subject. In a sentence with a retained object, the object is "re-
    tained" in the position of direct object even though logically it should be the subject.
    Such an anomaly occurs when the active voice sentence has an indirect object which
    then becomes the subject of the passive voice sentence.

    37. Germanic is the branch of the Indo-European family of languages that contains
    German and English.

    38. Them refers to ends.

    39. Separating the sentence into phrases helps in understanding the meaning. That
    "that is" is that "that is not" is not.

    40. Looking at the grammatical function of the that's helps in understanding the
    meaning. He said that (introduces noun clause) that (a pronominal) that (should be
    italicized because in this case that is used in second imposition) that (introduces ad-
    jective clause) that (a pronominal) sentence contains is a definitive.

    41. The sentence could be read, The boy, said his father, was to blame. Also the
    sentence could be read, The boy said [that] his father was to blame.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Grammatical Concepts**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''The book that he wrote is on the table.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the grammatical function of the relative pronoun ''that'' and explain how its use illustrates the distinction between restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses (as discussed in the text).\n- **Part B**: Analyze the sentence structure using the concept of a ''construct'' (from the text). Explain how the phrase ''that he wrote'' functions as a construct and why it is not ''germane to the species tree'' (as mentioned in the text).\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the active and passive voice transformations of the sentence ''The boy wrote the letter.'' According to the text, explain why the passive voice might retain the object in its original position despite the logical expectation of changing the subject.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions of restrictive clauses, constructs, and passive voice transformations from the text, and demonstrate a clear understanding of their interrelationships.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Grammatical Functions**\n\nExamine the sentence: ''He said that (introduces noun clause) that (a pronominal) that (should be italicized because in this case that is used in second imposition) that (introduces adjective clause) that (a pronominal) sentence contains is a definitive.''\n- **Part A**: Identify and classify each instance of ''that'' in the sentence according to its grammatical function (noun clause, pronominal, adjective clause, etc.) as described in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of ''that'' in the sentence demonstrates the concept of ''construct'' (from the text). Specifically, how does the repetition of ''that'' reflect the composite nature of a construct?\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of the text''s statement that ''a construct is a composite concept'' in the context of the sentence. How does this relate to the idea that ''bending is not germane to the species tree''?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the grammatical functions of ''that'' and the concept of constructs as defined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analysis of Grammatical Transformations**\n\nConsider the two versions of the sentence: ''The boy, said his father, was to blame.'' and ''The boy said [that] his father was to blame.''\n- **Part A**: According to the text, explain the grammatical difference between these two sentences and how they illustrate the concept of ''active voice'' versus ''passive voice.''\n- **Part B**: Analyze the sentence ''The boy, said his father, was to blame.'' using the concept of ''them'' (as defined in the text). Explain how the word ''them'' refers to ''ends'' and how this relates to the structure of the sentence.\n- **Part C**: Construct a grammatically correct sentence that demonstrates the use of a ''verbal auxiliary'' (as defined in the text). Explain how the auxiliary verb functions in creating the perfect tenses and how this relates to the concept of a ''construct.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of active/passive voice, ''them,'' and verbal auxiliaries as defined in the text, and demonstrate an ability to apply these concepts in original sentence construction.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Terminological Misuse in Literature**\n\nIn the text, Mrs. Malaprop''s misuse of words is contrasted with Feste''s witting use of hyperbole. Using examples from the text, explain how these two characters demonstrate different types of linguistic errors.\n- **Part A**: Analyze Mrs. Malaprop''s error in the quote ''as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile.'' Identify the incorrect word and explain why it is a misuse of language.\n- **Part B**: Contrast Feste''s use of ''Out hyperbolical fiend'' with Mrs. Malaprop''s errors. Explain how Feste''s hyperbole is a deliberate, linguistic choice rather than a misuse.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how Shakespeare''s characters, like Abraham Slender, may misuse words unintentionally. Provide a specific example from the text and explain the context of the error.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of the difference between intentional and unintentional linguistic errors.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Terminological Equivalence in Grammar**\n\nThe text explores the relationship between terms and their grammatical equivalents. Using the concept of ''terms and their grammatical equivalents'' from the text, explain how the sentence ''The cat sat on the mat'' can be rephrased to demonstrate different grammatical structures while maintaining the same meaning.\n- **Part A**: Identify the grammatical structure of the original sentence.\n- **Part B**: Create two paraphrases that maintain the meaning but use different grammatical structures (e.g., passive voice, different word order).\n- **Part C**: Explain how these paraphrases demonstrate the concept of ''terms and their grammatical equivalents'' as discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show a clear understanding of grammatical structure and equivalence as defined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Linguistic Misuse in Drama**\n\nThe text provides examples of linguistic misuse in Shakespeare''s plays. Using the examples from the text, construct a logical argument about the purpose of such linguistic errors in drama.\n- **Part A**: Identify two examples of linguistic misuse from the text (e.g., Mrs. Malaprop, Feste, Abraham Slender).\n- **Part B**: Explain how these errors serve a dramatic purpose, such as character development or thematic emphasis.\n- **Part C**: Draw a conclusion about the role of linguistic misuse in the overall effectiveness of dramatic works.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically structured and based on the examples and concepts provided in the text.'

    2. In The Odyssey, Odysseus often speaks with "winged words" as in the following
    excerpts. When Odysseus is leaving the Phoenicians, he places a libation cup in Queen
    Arete's hand and "uttering his voice spake to her winged words. ‘Fare thee well, O
    queen, all the days of thy life, till old age come and death, that visit all mankind" (Book
    XIIf). When Odysseus returns to Ithaca, he plans the demise of the suitors. "Now the
    goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, devising with Athene's aid the slaying of
    the wooers, and straightway he spake winged words to Telemachus. "Telemachus, we
    must needs lay by the weapons of war, within, every one" (Book XX). The Odyssey of
    Homer, trans. Richard Lattimore (New York: Harper and Row, 1967). The concept of
    "winged words" would seem to be the poetic equivalent of "coming to terms." The one
    addressed correctly understands the reality symbolized by the speaker's language.

    3. In considering whether a term is general or empirical, ask whether the term
    refers to the entire category of beings (general) or to an individual or individuals within
    that category (empirical). TM

    4. The reference is to Aristotle's categories of being.

    5. The earlier example of the teacher and the pupil used in the section, Absolute
    and Relative Terms, illustrates that terms that are categorically different can coexist in

    the same substance. The term teacher includes the categories of substance, quality, re-
    lation, and action. In fact, most terms include several categories.

    6. This important concept is revisited and becomes clearer in the chapter on syl-
    logisms.

    7. The intension of a term is the set of necessary and sufficient conditions for ap-
    plying the term. TM

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of ''Winged Words'' in The Odyssey**\n\nIn the text, ''winged words'' are described as a poetic device that conveys messages that ''the one addressed correctly understands the reality symbolized by the speaker''s language.'' Using the examples from Book XIIf and Book XX of The Odyssey, explain how Odysseus''s ''winged words'' function as a form of communication that bridges the material and the spiritual.\n\n- **Part A**: Analyze how the libation cup and the act of speaking ''winged words'' in Book XIIf reflect the concept of ''coming to terms'' as described in the text.\n- **Part B**: Contrast the purpose of ''winged words'' in Book XX with those in Book XIIf, considering the different contexts of Odysseus''s communication.\n- **Part C**: Based on the text''s explanation of ''winged words'' as a poetic equivalent of ''coming to terms,'' interpret how this device contributes to the themes of identity and transformation in The Odyssey.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s definition of ''winged words'' with the literary analysis of the Odyssey, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of both the poetic device and its symbolic significance.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Terms and Categories**\n\nThe text discusses the distinction between general and empirical terms, noting that a general term refers to the entire category of beings, while an empirical term refers to individual or specific beings within a category. Using the examples from the section on ''Absolute and Relative Terms,'' explain the following: \n\n- **Part A**: Why is the term ''teacher'' considered a general term, and how does it include multiple categories of being (substance, quality, relation, and action) as described in the text?\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of an empirical term from the text and explain how it differs from a general term in terms of scope and application.\n- **Part C**: Using the concept of intension (the set of necessary and sufficient conditions for applying a term), analyze the term ''human'' and determine whether it is a general or empirical term. Justify your answer with logical reasoning based on the text''s definition of intension.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinction between general and empirical terms, as well as the concept of intension, based solely on the information provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Aristotle''s Categories in the Trivium**\n\nThe text references Aristotle''s categories of being, noting that terms can include multiple categories such as substance, quality, relation, and action. Using the examples from the text and the concept of the trivium (logic, grammar, rhetoric), answer the following: \n\n- **Part A**: How does the term ''teacher'' exemplify the inclusion of multiple categories of being, as discussed in the text?\n- **Part B**: Explain how the trivium''s structure (grammar, logic, rhetoric) reflects the categories of being, using specific examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Based on the text''s discussion of the intension of a term, argue whether the term ''Odysseus'' is a general or empirical term. Support your argument with reasoning that connects the term''s scope to Aristotle''s categories of being.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanation of Aristotle''s categories and the trivium with the analysis of terms and their classification, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between language, logic, and the structure of the trivium.'

    8. This concept would not apply to mathematical objects. For example, the term
    prime number is more narrowly specified than the term integer, but both refer to an in-
    finite number of objects. Also, animals with kidneys and hearts is more intensionally
    specified than animals with hearts, but the two terms are at least empirically coexten-
    sive. TM

    9. Porphyry (232?-305?) was a Neo-Platonic philosopher who tried to bring to-
    gether the philosophies of Aristotle and of Plato. He wrote an influential book on Aris-
    totle's Categories.

    10. Res means the thing itself, and aliquid means the other. The concept is the
    "whatness" of a reality as opposed to "other" reality.

    11. Other philosophers would agree with Sister Miriam Joseph that transcendental
    concepts elude logical definition, but the attempt to define them has preoccupied
    philosophers for centuries. The different "theories of truth" are based on different def-
    initions of these concepts. TM

    12. Efficient cause is the agent and the instruments. Material cause refers to what
    was used to make something. Formal cause is what kind of thing is being made. Final
    cause is the purpose that motivated the agent. The four metaphysical causes as defined
    by Aristotle are treated more fully in Chapter Ten.

    13. One might question whether rhetorical definition is definition in a real sense.
    Explication, exegesis, and textual clarification are better terms than rhetorical defini-
    tion for the process described. TM

    14. The examples of virtual or functional division demonstrate that some realities
    can be thought of as having parts but cannot be actually divided. Also, the unifying prin-
    ciple of the reality exists within each part but not to the same degree.

    15. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica I, question 76, article 8.

    16. Chemists have identified all the naturally occurring elements, but the possi-
    bility of synthesizing new elements is open-ended.

    17. Positive division is based on empirical investigation and, therefore, is always
    open to revision. Declaring positive division inferior from a logical point of view reflects
    a bias against empirical reasoning that goes all the way back to Plato. TM

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Definitions and Empirical Division**\n\nCompare and contrast the concepts of "positive division" and "virtual or functional division" as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define each term using the text''s explanation.\n- **Step 2**: Provide an example for each division type, ensuring that your examples align with the text''s descriptions.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the text''s distinction between these two types of division reflects the broader philosophical debate about the nature of reality and definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both division types and their philosophical implications.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Aristotelian Causality**\n\nExplain how the four metaphysical causes (efficient, material, formal, and final) as defined in the text relate to the process of creating a work of art.\n- **Step 1**: Identify which cause corresponds to each aspect of the artistic process.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a specific example of how each cause is manifested in the creation of a painting.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the philosophical significance of these causes in understanding the nature of art and human creativity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must integrate all four causes and demonstrate an understanding of their roles in the creative process.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Definition Types**\n\nEvaluate the claim that "rhetorical definition" is not a true definition, as suggested in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define "rhetorical definition" based on the text''s description.\n- **Step 2**: Compare it to "explication," "exegesis," and "textual clarification" as described in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Provide a real-world example where rhetorical definition might be used, and explain why it is or is not a valid definition according to the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must reflect the text''s perspective on the nature of definitions and their purpose in philosophical inquiry.'

    18. The six methods of classifying terms are by the kind of reality signified, by contradictory terms, by concrete and abstract terms, by absolute and relative terms, by collective and distributive terms, by the ten logical categories of terms.

    PROPOSITIONS AND THEIR GRAMMATICAL EXPRESSION

    1. The concepts in this paragraph—a proposition expressing a relation of terms and a proposition consisting of subject, copula, and predicate —refer to the most common type of simple propositions. Compound propositions are introduced later in the book.
    TM

    Notes to pages 90-127

    2. Mode refers to the way that terms in a proposition are related. Categorical propositions merely state that this is the way reality is. A modal proposition which is necessary states that this is the way reality must be. A modal proposition which is contingent states that this is the way that reality could be.

    3. Obeying a red light implies that one keeps the promises one makes. In applying for a driver's license, one promises to obey the rules that regulate motorists. TM

    4. Post-classical logic challenges the Aristotelian contention that "a simple proposition is one that asserts the relation of two terms and only two." It is possible to have a simple proposition with more than two terms. Baltimore is between Philadelphia and Washington is a simple proposition, but it has three terms. TM (A solution to the problem TM poses might lie in re-formulating the proposition thus: "Baltimore is a city located between Philadelphia and Washington." Manipulating the terms this way might not always work, however.)

    5. Conversion is the reversal of the subject and the predicate.

    6. Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) was a Swiss mathematician.

    7. The reference is to the Aristotelian ten categories of being: substance and the nine accidents. In the categories of being, accident includes concepts which would be categorized differently in the predicables. Among the predicables, accident would not include characteristics germane to a species, but within the ten categories of being, accidents do include characteristics germane to a species.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Classification of Terms in Propositions**\n\nBased on the text''s six methods of classifying terms, classify the proposition ''A dog is a mammal'' and explain your reasoning.\n- **Method 1**: Classify by the kind of reality signified (e.g., animal, class, or category).\n- **Method 2**: Classify by contradictory terms (e.g., ''dog'' and ''not a dog'').\n- **Method 3**: Classify by concrete and abstract terms (e.g., ''dog'' is concrete, ''mammal'' is abstract).\n- **Method 4**: Classify by absolute and relative terms (e.g., ''dog'' is absolute, ''mammal'' is relative).\n- **Method 5**: Classify by collective and distributive terms (e.g., ''dog'' is distributive, ''mammal'' is collective).\n- **Method 6**: Classify by the ten logical categories of terms (e.g., ''dog'' is a substance, ''mammal'' is an accident).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must address all six methods and explicitly connect each classification to the definitions provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Modal Propositions and Real-World Applications**\n\nThe text distinguishes between categorical, necessary, and contingent propositions. Apply this distinction to the following real-world scenarios:\n- **Scenario A**: ''The sun will rise tomorrow.''\n- **Scenario B**: ''The moon is made of green cheese.''\n- **Scenario C**: ''If it rains, the ground will be wet.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each scenario, determine the type of proposition (categorical, necessary, or contingent) and explain your reasoning based on the text''s definition of modality.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the truth value of each proposition in the context of real-world knowledge.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the distinction between necessary and contingent propositions relates to the philosophical concept of ''necessity in nature'' as discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of modal propositions with real-world examples and demonstrate an understanding of the logical implications of modality.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Categories and Propositional Structure**\n\nThe text introduces the Aristotelian ten categories of being, including substance and accidents. Analyze the proposition ''The library is a building'' using these categories:\n- **Part A**: Identify which category (substance, accident, or other) ''library'' and ''building'' belong to.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the proposition aligns with the distinction between predicables and categories of being as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that ''all propositions must be about substances.'' Your example must reference at least two categories from the text and clarify how they relate to the structure of the proposition.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the Aristotelian categories and their application to propositional analysis.'

    3. The place of subalterns relates to the issue that a proposition must refer to some-
    thing "in fact or fiction." In modern logic, this is called the problem of existential im-
    port. If I say that "All students who plagiarize are guilty of an offense against their peers,"
    I do not imply that any students are, in fact, plagiarizing. If I assert the subaltern of this,
    namely the statement "Some students who plagiarize are guilty of an offense against
    their peers," I do imply that at least one such student really exists. That is, I statements
    carry a kind of existence commitment that A statements lack. So in cases such as these
    many would claim that the truth of the I proposition doesn't follow from the truth of
    the A proposition. TM

    4. Note that in the example, nonstarchy-food, there is a hyphen between starchy
    and food, unlike the first example. The hyphen makes the expression one part of speech
    and a true contradictory term. Nonstarchy-food is equivalent in meaning to anything
    that is not starchy food.

    >. In this example, the word low is used in two different meanings or intensions re-
    sulting in the material fallacy of equivocation, which is fully explained in Chapter
    Nine.

    THE SIMPLE SYLLOGISM

    1. Modern logic recognizes that there is valid deductive reasoning that cannot be
    captured by syllogisms. TM

    2. Sister Miriam Joseph explains later in the chapter why she chooses this order:
    the minor premise, the major premise, the conclusion. Many logic texts use the order:
    the major premise, the minor premise, the conclusion. Either is correct.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Existential Commitment in Logic**\n\nConsider the two statements:\n- A: "All students who plagiarize are guilty of an offense against their peers."\n- I: "Some students who plagiarize are guilty of an offense against their peers."\n\nUsing the concept of existential import and the definitions provided in the text, explain why the truth of the I statement carries a stronger commitment to the existence of at least one plagiarizing student than the A statement does.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s explanation of the problem of existential import and clearly distinguish between the logical implications of A and I statements. You must also explain why the I statement cannot be considered a logical consequence of the A statement, based on the text''s discussion of subalternation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Equivocation in Terminology**\n\nExamine the term "low" as used in the example provided in the text. The word "low" has two different meanings, leading to the fallacy of equivocation.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the two distinct meanings of "low" in the context of the example.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of "low" in two different senses creates a logical inconsistency or fallacy, as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct an original example of equivocation using a different term, ensuring that the term has at least two distinct meanings that are not clearly defined in the context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the fallacy of equivocation and its implications for logical reasoning. The example you create must be logically sound and clearly illustrate the concept.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning in Syllogistic Logic**\n\nThe text discusses the structure of a simple syllogism, noting that modern logic recognizes the limitations of syllogisms in capturing all valid deductive reasoning.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference between the order of premises in a syllogism as described by Sister Miriam Joseph (minor premise, major premise, conclusion) and the order used in many logic texts (major premise, minor premise, conclusion).\n- **Part B**: Create a syllogism that follows Joseph''s order and another that follows the traditional order. Ensure that both syllogisms are logically valid and have the same conclusion.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of the text''s assertion that some valid deductive reasoning cannot be captured by syllogisms. How might this affect the use of syllogisms in formal logic?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of syllogistic structure and the limitations of traditional logic, demonstrating a clear understanding of the text''s arguments and their broader implications.'

- prompt: |-
    3. Sister Miriam Joseph is making the distinction here between the formal aspects of a syllogism or enthymeme and the material aspects. If a syllogism or enthymeme follows the rules of logic, a valid syllogism or enthymeme results. Validity is a relationship between premises and conclusions such that if the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false. Analyzing a syllogism formally does not involve analyzing the truth or falsity of the premises. It is possible to have a valid syllogism with false premises and a true conclusion, or with false premises and a false conclusion, but never with true premises and a false conclusion.

    11. In Dorothy L. Sayers's mystery novel, Strong Poison, Lord Peter Wimsey quotes this mnemonic to Harriet Vane. He sees it as a proof of his diligence as a lover since he learned it to honor a woman named Barbara, who had spurned him.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Syllogism Validity and Logical Structure**\n\nAnalyze the following syllogism and determine its validity according to the rules of logic presented in the text:\n\nAll humans are mortal.\nSocrates is a human.\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal.\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the structure of the syllogism (major premise, minor premise, conclusion).\n- **Step 2**: Apply the definition of validity from the text: ''Validity is a relationship between premises and conclusions such that if the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false.''\n- **Step 3**: Justify whether this syllogism is valid, using the text''s explanation that formal analysis does not consider the truth of premises but the logical connection between them.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s definition of validity and demonstrate understanding of the distinction between validity and truth of premises.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Logical Mnemonics and Historical Context**\n\nIn the text, it is mentioned that Dorothy L. Sayers''s character Lord Peter Wimsey uses a mnemonic to remember valid syllogism moods.\n\n- **Part A**: Explain the significance of mnemonics in logical education, referencing the text''s discussion of memorization as a tool for mastering logical structures.\n- **Part B**: Consider the historical context of Thomas Huxley''s essay on a liberal education. How might the use of mnemonics align with Huxley''s views on education and intellectual rigor?\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the contrast between the ''ice cream is nourishing food'' example from Chapter One and the syllogism in this chapter. How does this contrast illustrate the difference between logical structure and real-world applicability?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate historical references, logical concepts, and the text''s discussion of mnemonics as educational tools.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Logical Arguments and Real-World Examples**\n\nEvaluate the following argument and determine if it is valid based on the text''s definition of validity:\n\nIf it rains, the ground gets wet.\nIt is raining.\nTherefore, the ground is wet.\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the logical form of this argument.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the text''s definition of validity: ''Validity is a relationship between premises and conclusions such that if the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false.''\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the difference between this argument and the syllogism in Question 1. How does the structure of this argument relate to the concept of logical form as discussed in the text?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s explanation of logical form and validity, and demonstrate an understanding of how real-world conditions might affect the conclusion even if the argument is valid.'

    RELATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL
    AND DISJUNCTIVE PROPOSITIONS

    1. In modern logic, this type of disjunctive proposition is called the exclusive dis-
    junctive. Modern logic allows for the inclusive disjunctive, also, in which the disjunc-
    tion is true if at least one disjunct is true. For example, "You can buy either sheets or
    towels in that store" would still be true if you could buy both. The exclusive disjunc-
    tive, on the other hand, requires that the choices be mutually exclusive.

    3. In modern logic a sine qua non hypothetical proposition can also be represented
    as an "if and only if" proposition, which is called a biconditional. Thus, "if and only if
    a substance turns blue litmus paper red is it an acid." TM

    5. The first rule is called modus ponens, meaning "way of affirmation." The second
    rule is called modus tollens, "way of negation." TM

    6. Ponendo tollens. Ponendo, from ponere, to posit, and tollens, from tollere, to re-
    move. The meaning is "to posit the negative." Tollendo ponens means "to negate the
    positive."

    7. To hale means "to force to go." The expression "hauled into court" is also cor-
    rect since to haul means "to drag forcibly."

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Structure of Hypothetical and Disjunctive Propositions**\n\nGiven the definitions of exclusive and inclusive disjunctive propositions from the text, construct a real-world scenario that illustrates both types.\n- **Exclusive Disjunctive**: Create a situation where the disjunction is only true if exactly one of the two options is chosen.\n- **Inclusive Disjunctive**: Create a situation where the disjunction is true if either or both options are chosen.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Define the scenario for the exclusive disjunctive and explain why it fits the definition.\n- **Part B**: Define the scenario for the inclusive disjunctive and explain why it fits the definition.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the two scenarios using the terminology from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenarios must be logically consistent and explicitly reference the definitions provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Biconditional Propositions and Logical Equivalence**\n\nUsing the text''s explanation of biconditional propositions, translate the statement ''If a substance turns blue litmus paper red, then it is an acid'' into a biconditional statement.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two conditions involved in the original statement.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the biconditional structure (if and only if) to both directions of implication.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the logical equivalence between the original statement and the biconditional.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Write the biconditional statement.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the biconditional is appropriate for this context.\n- **Part C**: Contrast this with a hypothetical proposition that is not a biconditional, using the definitions from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the difference between hypothetical and biconditional propositions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Syllogisms and Rules**\n\nThe text describes modus ponens, modus tollens, and their related forms (ponendo tollens, tollendo ponens). Construct a syllogism that demonstrates the use of modus ponens and another that demonstrates modus tollens.\n- **Syllogism 1 (Modus Ponens)**:\n  - **Premise 1**: If it is a dog, then it is a mammal.\n  - **Premise 2**: This animal is a dog.\n  - **Conclusion**: Therefore, this animal is a mammal.\n\n- **Syllogism 2 (Modus Tollens)**:\n  - **Premise 1**: If it is a bird, then it can fly.\n  - **Premise 2**: This animal cannot fly.\n  - **Conclusion**: Therefore, this animal is not a bird.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain the logical structure of each syllogism using the terminology from the text.\n- **Part B**: Compare modus ponens and modus tollens using the definitions provided.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of the logical rules (ponendo tollens, tollendo ponens) in real-world reasoning scenarios.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions of the logical rules and demonstrate an understanding of their application in deductive reasoning.'

    8. Empson was an employee of Bishop Morton, who was a mentor of Thomas More. This type of dilemma in which the accused is guilty no matter how the dilemma is resolved is also called Morton's Fork. Bishop Morton probably wrote the biography of Richard III, often credited to Thomas More, which vilifies Richard and is the source for Shakespeare's portrait.

    A BRIEF SUMMARY OF INDUCTION

    1. Psychology and the philosophy of mind both deal with how we obtain concepts
    and judgments from the real world, but they do so in different ways. Sister Miriam
    Joseph's approach leans toward the philosophical. TM

    2. Sister Miriam Joseph's statement that "there is no correct formula of inference
    by which a general proposition can be derived as a conclusion from empirical prem-
    ises" means that there is no deductive way to draw a general conclusion from empiri-
    cal data. Her solution, by calling induction an intuition, comes down to the notion that
    induction is a form of direct, noninferential knowledge. TM

    3. Most logicians say that induction is a form of inference, different from deduc-
    tion, but there is ongoing, scholarly deliberation on the nature of induction. The fol-
    lowing proposition illustrates the problem: All unsupported objects fall toward the cen-
    ter of the earth. How do we know that proposition is true? Strictly speaking, the most
    we can say is that all unsupported objects observed so far fall toward the center of the
    earth. The second statement says less than the first. There is no valid deductive infer-
    ence from "All unsupported objects observed so far fall" to "All unsupported objects
    fall." That is the problem of induction. TM

    4. Modern logicians would question whether "enumerative" induction qualifies as
    induction. TM

    ered is efficient cause. TM

    7. In Chapter Seven the explanation of analogical inference relates to the method
    of elimination in scientific reasoning. There must be selection achieved through other
    scientific methods for the process to be effective.

    8. One reason that mere elimination provides no certitude is that there is generally
    no certitude that all the relevant disjuncts have been discovered. TM

    9. Sister Miriam Joseph's complaint against logical positivism has some justice in
    it. Logical positivism is now generally regarded as defunct. TM

    10. Modern logic still deals with propositions that are true or false. Furthermore,
    syllogisms, conversion, obversion, and the like have not vanished from modern logic.
    Rather, they are subsumed under more general forms and principles as special cases.

    COMPOSITION AND READING

    1. Sister Miriam Joseph is referring to Aristotle's and Cicero's topics of invention
    which include cause and effect. We analyze the plot, the organizational structure of a
    story, by investigating the workings of cause and effect in the story. The topics of in-
    vention are in Chapter Six.

    Notes to pages 230-245

    2. Sister Miriam Joseph's view of literature as a moral guide follows from the clas-
    sical sources she is following as well as her own worldview. Plato attacked poetry on four
    points: poets use inspiration, not reason; poetry teaches the wrong things; poetry be-
    cause it is imitation is two steps removed from reality; poetry encourages the emotions
    of the audience. Aristotle addresses the moral benefits of poetry in response to Plato's
    view.

    3. Quintilian (first century A.D.) is the author of Institutio Oratoria, which outlines
    the education of an orator.

    4. Obversion, the logical equivalent to litotes, is explained in Chapter Six. In ob-
    version the predicate changes in quality from negative to affirmative or affirmative to
    negative. The predicate changes to the contradictory of the original. For example, the
    A proposition "Jane is known for her brilliance" could be obverted to "Jane is not un-
    known for her brilliance."

    5. An enthymeme is a syllogism logically abridged by the omission of one proposi-
    tion. It contains three terms and can be logically expanded into a full syllogism. For ex-
    ample, "You are talking during the film, and you should be removed from the theater."
    The missing proposition is "People who talk during films should be removed from the
    theater." It is the major premise of the syllogism.

    The text is from The Trivium The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric by Sister Miriam Joseph, Marguerite McGlinn.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Positivism and Classical Logic**\n\nCompare and contrast Sister Miriam Joseph''s critique of logical positivism with the persistence of classical logical forms in modern logic.\n- **Step 1**: Explain why Joseph finds logical positivism ''defunct'' despite its historical significance.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how syllogisms, conversion, and obversion are preserved in modern logic, citing specific examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the claim that classical logical forms are ''subsumed under more general forms'' without losing their essential function.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both historical and contemporary logical frameworks, referencing the text''s discussion of Aristotelian logic and modern developments.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Literary and Logical Functions**\n\nExplain how Sister Miriam Joseph integrates literary analysis with logical principles, using examples from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the classical sources (Aristotle, Plato, Cicero) that inform her view of literature as a moral guide.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the role of cause and effect in analyzing plot structure, referencing Chapter Six.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate how Joseph''s perspective on poetry aligns with or challenges Plato''s criticism of poetry.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must connect literary theory with logical analysis, demonstrating an understanding of both the classical and modern contexts provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Syllogistic Reasoning**\n\nConstruct a syllogism based on the example of an enthymeme provided in the text, and then logically expand it into a full syllogism.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the missing proposition in the enthymeme example: ''You are talking during the film, and you should be removed from the theater.''\n- **Step 2**: Create a new enthymeme that applies to a different scenario (e.g., classroom behavior, public speaking).\n- **Step 3**: Use obversion or conversion to logically transform one of the propositions in your syllogism.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate mastery of syllogistic structure, enthymeme identification, and logical transformation techniques as described in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    6. A disjunctive syllogism asserts that of two propositions, one must be true. For ex-
    ample, "Either Mary is lying or she committed the murder." A hypothetical syllogism
    asserts the dependence of one proposition on another. For example, "If the environ-
    ment is protected, water quality will be good."

    7. A dilemma is a syllogism which has for its minor premise a disjunctive proposition, for its major premise a compound, hypothetical proposition, and for its conclusion either a simple or a disjunctive proposition. For example, "Either death is a state
    of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or it is a migration of the soul from this world
    to another. If you suppose that there is no consciousness, death will be an unspeakable
    gain, for eternity is then only a single night and it like to the sleep of him who is undis-
    turbed even by dreams, and not only a private man but even a great king will judge that
    better than other days and nights. If death is the journey to another place where all the
    dead are, where the pilgrim is delivered from the professors of justice in this world to
    find true judges there, where a man may converse with Orpheus, Hesiod, Homer, Ajax,

    9. Epithet is a descriptive word or phrase used to characterize a person, place, or
    thing. In a literary work, the phrase becomes so associated with what is described that
    it is often used as a substitute. Epics provide many examples of this practice.

    Sister Miriam Joseph, C.S.C., seemed destined to be involved in the arts of discourse from her earliest days. She was born Agnes Lenore Rauh in Glandorf, Ohio, on December 17, 1898. Her father, Henry Francis Rauh, known as the "Professor," was a church organist, founder of a building and loan company, superintendent of schools, journalist, and publisher and owner of a newspaper. Perhaps influenced by her father's vocation, but definitely inspired by a lecture delivered by A. P. Sandles, editor of the Putnam County Sentinel, during her senior year in high school, Agnes decided to study journalism at Saint Mary's College. When she arrived at Saint Mary's in the fall of 1916, Agnes found that she could not take a journalism class that semester; in fact, there were no journalism courses scheduled for that term. Disappointed but not deterred, Agnes lobbied the administration, and two weeks into the semester her determination paid off. She gladly transferred from astronomy into a newly created journalism course. Agnes passionately believed that journalism and American society would benefit from the presence of more women. In her essay "Women and Journalism" (1919), she wrote, "(The profession of journalism] long ago recognized that women have minds, perhaps in several aspects different from men's minds but of equal merit and that their ideas and works are not to be despised. Moreover, women have special aptitudes peculiar to themselves, whereby they fill a definite need in certain spheres of thought and endeavor." Sounding the alarm for women to become involved in journalism she warmed, "One cannot estimate the danger, the harm, that comes from insidious propaganda, which, under the cloak of high-sounding new movements, threatens to undermine the most fundamental principles of social and family life." Women must take up the pen, for, "If this propaganda succeeds in winning the support of the women of our country, it has secured the stronghold because an entire people derives its ideals from the mothers." The battle must be waged and the "most effectual means to combat this danger is to turn the enemies' own weapons against them."

    nalism, along with the study of modern problems in economics, politics,
    ethics, and sociology, from a Catholic and Christian point of view," ar-
    guing that such writers were best suited to stem the tide of societal ill.

    The desire for advocacy journalism was not the only passion that
    burned in Agnes' soul. Sensing the call of God, she entered the novi-
    tiate of the Sisters of the Holy Cross at Saint Mary's in September 1919.
    The following August she was received as a novice, and within a year
    was teaching in a middle school. Sister Miriam Joseph was taking steps
    to fulfill the call she herself had issued in 1919. She would be directly
    involved in the process of training writers who would articulate "the
    right principles." Teaching during the school year (St. Joseph's School,
    Pocatello, Idaho, 1921-1923; St. Joseph's Academy, South Bend, 1923-
    1927) and being a student herself in the summer, Sister completed her
    course work at Saint Mary's and graduated with a Ph.B. in Journalism
    in 1923; in 1927, she was awarded an M.A. in English from the Uni-
    versity of Notre Dame. Miriam Joseph solidified her commitment to
    the Sisters of the Holy Cross and to their ministry by making her first
    profession of vows in 1922 and her final profession in 1925.

    Continuing in a now-familiar pattern, Sister spent the next few years teaching during the school year (Saint-Mary-of-the-Wasatch Academy and College, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1927-1930; Saint Angela's Academy, Morris, Illinois, 1930-1931) and continuing her own studies in the summers at Notre Dame. Sister Miriam Joseph returned to her alma mater in 1931 and assumed the position of Assistant Professor in the English Department. She had traveled full circle: the call she had issued in 1919 for well-trained Catholic writers would now be her charge. In 1931, Miriam Joseph was assigned five sections of freshman English: "College Rhetoric." During the next four years, she continued teaching Rhetoric and courses in "General Literature," "Grammar and Composition," and "Composition and Rhetoric."

    In the spring of 1935, Sister Miriam Joseph's life and teaching career took a momentous turn. On Friday, March 8, Dr. Mortimer Adler, from the University of Chicago, delivered a lecture at Saint Mary's entitled "The Metaphysical Basis of the Liberal Arts." According to the campus newspaper, The Static, Adler contended that college students of the day "know little or nothing about . . . the liberal arts." Adler "centered his discussion on the three arts of language, pointing out that whereas among the Greeks and the Medievalists their integral unity and harmony was always recognized and preserved, since the fifteenth century specialization

    It has contrived to separate them to the consequent deterioration and even the ruination of their educative function — to develop the power of the individual to read, write, and speak — in other words, to acquire mastery over the tools of learning." Following the lecture, Father William Cunningham, C.S.C., Professor of Education at Notre Dame, asked Adler if it would be feasible to revive the united Trivium again in the freshman English class. Years later, Sister Miriam Joseph wrote that when the question was asked "[m]any in the audience turned and looked at me." Whether Sister Madeleva, President of Saint Mary's, turned to see Sister Miriam Joseph's reaction to the query, we do not know. What we do know is that Sisters Madeleva, Miriam Joseph, and Maria Theresa (then teaching at Bishop Noll High School, Hammond, Indiana) spent Saturdays in April and May of that year studying with Adler in Chicago. Traveling to Columbia University in New York, Miriam Joseph and Maria Theresa continued their studies with Adler through the summer.

    In the fall of 1935, Sister Miriam Joseph returned to Saint Mary's to teach for the first time a course that was to become a college institution, "The Trivium." Required of all freshmen, the course met five days a week for two semesters. As Sister Miriam Joseph saw it, the course was designed to train students how to think correctly, read with intelligence, and speak and write clearly and effectively. Since no existing textbook was adequate for the course Sister wrote her own. The Trivium in College Composition and Reading was first published in 1937.

    For the next twenty-five years, all freshmen at Saint Mary's were
    taught the trivium with Sister Miriam Joseph bearing much of the
    teaching load herself. She was absent from campus from 1941 to 1945,
    pursuing her doctorate in English and Comparative Literature at Co-
    lumbia University. She was awarded a Ph.D. in 1945, and her disserta-
    tion, "Shakespeare's Use of the Arts of Language," was published in
    1947 by Columbia University Press. Sister's teaching and research all
    pointed in the same direction. In the first chapter of her dissertation she
    wrote, "The extraordinary power, vitality, and richness of Shakespeare's
    language are due in part to his genius, in part to the fact the unsettled
    linguistic forms of his age promoted to an unusual degree the spirit of
    free creativeness, and in part to the theory of composition then prevail-
    ing." She continued, "It is this last which accounts for those character-
    istics of Shakespeare's language which differentiate it most from the
    language of today . . . The difference in habits of thought and in meth-
    ods of developing thought results in a corresponding difference in ex-
    pression principally because the Renaissance theory of composition,
    Sister Miriam Joseph

    derived from the ancient tradition, was permeated with formal logic and
    theoric, while ours is not." Shakespeare had the benefit of being
    trained in the trivial arts — modern students did not. Sister Miriam
    Joseph was attempting to correct that error.

    Sister Miriam Joseph Rauh died on November 11, 1982. In a letter to the Saint Mary's faculty after her death, Vice President and Dean of Faculty William Hickey wrote that Sister was "perhaps the most distinguished scholar to be identified with the College in this century." But perhaps the greatest tribute came from Mary Frances Schaff Meekison (SMC 740), who wrote in the Saint Mary's Courier, "In class her brilliance and zeal in teaching were quite apparent." Sister "Mickey Jo" was a "taskmistress and a perfectionist," inspiring "even the most reluctant student to stretch her intellect and to strive toward perfection." Meekison concluded her letter to the Courier by writing, "Though I was only an average student, Sister believed that I could stretch not only my intellect, but also my writing ability. Because of her faith, I have been lucky enough to find my by-line in print many times over. I am certain there are hundreds of alumnae out there who could make even stronger testimonials than mine." So, Agnes Lenore Rauh, Sister Miriam Joseph, C.S.C., aspiring journalist turned teacher and Shakespeare scholar, accomplished her goal. She influenced a generation of women to think carefully, to read thoughtfully, and to write and speak "the right principles" eloquently.

Therefore, John is a doctor."\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the logical structure of the argument (e.g., conditional, syllogism).\n- **Step 2**: Reference the definitions of formal fallacies provided in the text to determine if this argument falls under any category (e.g., converse error, affirming the consequent).\n- **Step 3**: Justify your conclusion by explaining why the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, using the concepts of logical validity and formal fallacy from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly name the fallacy and reference the text''s definitions to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Logical Classification and Fallacy Analysis**\n\nConsider the following two statements and determine whether they commit a fallacy of accident or a fallacy of consequent.\n\nStatement 1: "All students must pass the final exam to graduate. Therefore, if a student fails the final exam, they cannot graduate."\nStatement 2: "If a person is honest, then they are trustworthy. Therefore, if a person is not trustworthy, they must not be honest."\n\n- **Part A**: For each statement, identify the type of fallacy (fallacy of accident or fallacy of consequent) and explain why it fits that category based on the definitions in the text.\n- **Part B**: Contrast the two fallacies by discussing how they differ in terms of logical structure and the nature of the error they commit.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the fallacy of accident might occur, and explain how it differs from the fallacy of consequent.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the two fallacies and demonstrate your understanding of their definitions and applications.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Symbolic and Figurative Language**\n\nExplain how the concepts of formal relations and figurative language interact in the context of argumentation.\n\n- **Part A**: Define formal relations and figurative language as presented in the text.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a statement that uses figurative language and analyze how it might affect the formal relations of the argument.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of using figurative language in logical reasoning. Does it introduce ambiguity or enhance clarity? Support your answer with reasoning from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of formal relations and figurative language, demonstrating an understanding of their roles in logical argumentation.'
