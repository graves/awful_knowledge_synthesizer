When the file does not\n       exist, the fsmpm will not start any FSM daemons.\n\nSYNTAX\n       The format for the fsmlist is simple.  On each line is the name of one\n       local volume to start, and an optional priority number from zero (0) to\n       nine (9).  The name must not include cluster-naming information.\n\n       The optional priority number is used when there is a redundant metadata\n       controller (MDC).  A priority of zero makes the specified FSM top\n       priority and any number greater than zero means lower priority.\tSee\n       cvfs_failover(8) for details about setting up a failover-capable file\n       system service.\n\n       The format of an fsmlist line has the following format:"

    Manpage text:

    File_System_Name [priority]

           File_System_Name is the public name of the volume used in the mount(8)
           command, and as the prefix for the configuration file (see
           snfs_config(5)).

           The priority field is used to designate a priority when there are
           redundant fsm daemons for a volume.  Only one may be active at a time
           and the fsmpm daemon executes failover votes to determine the daemon to
           activate.  The priority value helps the fsmpm determine, all other
           things being equal, which service to activate.

           The previous version of fsmlist(4) was documented as requiring a dot
           (.) character as an argument before the priority argument, for
           compatibility with even older versions of fsmlist(4).  In reality, it
           was optional.  The first argument will be ignored if it is just the dot
           (.) character.

           Lines that contain white space only or that contain the comment token
           as the first non-white space character are ignored.
