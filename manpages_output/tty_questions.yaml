- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tty`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTTY(1)\t\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t\tTTY(1)\n\nNAME\n     tty – return user's terminal name\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     tty [-s]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The tty utility writes the name of the terminal attached to standard\n     input to standard output.\tThe name that is written is the string\n     returned by ttyname(3).  If the standard input is not a terminal, the\n     message “not a tty” is written.  The options are as follows:\n\n     -s      Do not write the terminal name; only the exit status is affected\n\t     when this option is specified.  The -s option is deprecated in\n\t     favor of the “test -t 0” command.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The tty utility exits 0 if the standard input is a terminal, 1 if the\n     standard input is not a terminal, and >1 if an error occurs.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     test(1), ttyname(3)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The tty utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”) compatible.\n\nHISTORY\n     A tty command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\t June 6, 1993\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
