The package can handle both IPv4 (1)\n       and IPv6 (2) address types.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::ip::version address\n\t      Returns the protocol version of the address (4 or 6) or 0 if the\n\t      address is neither IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n       ::ip::is class address\n\t      Returns true if the address is a member of the given protocol\n\t      class. The class parameter may be either ipv4 or ipv6 This is\n\t      effectively a boolean equivalent of the version command. The\n\t      class argument may be shortened to 4 or 6.\n\n       ::ip::equal address address\n\t      Compare two address specifications for equivalence. The\n\t      arguments are normalized and the address prefix determined (if a\n\t      mask is supplied). The normalized addresses are then compared\n\t      bit-by-bit and the procedure returns true if they match.\n\n       ::ip::normalize address\n\t      Convert an IPv4 or IPv6 address into a fully expanded version.\n\t      There are various shorthand ways to write internet addresses,\n\t      missing out redundant parts or digts.. This procedure is the\n\t      opposite of contract.\n\n       ::ip::contract address\n\t      Convert a normalized internet address into a more compact form\n\t      suitable for displaying to users.\n\n       ::ip::prefix address\n\t      Returns the address prefix generated by masking the address part\n\t      with the mask if provided. If there is no mask then it is\n\t      equivalent to calling normalize\n\n       ::ip::type address\n\n       ::ip::mask address\n\t      If the address supplied includes a mask then this is returned\n\t      otherwise returns an empty string.\n\n       ::ip::prefixToNative prefix\n\t      This command converts the string prefix from dotted form\n\t      (<ipaddr>/<mask> format) to native (hex) form. Returns a list\n\t      containing two elements, ipaddress and mask, in this order, in\n\t      hexadecimal notation.\n\n\n\t\t % ip::prefixToNative 1.1.1.0/24\n\t\t 0x01010100 0xffffff00\n\n\n       ::ip::nativeToPrefix nativeList|native ?-ipv4?\n\t      This command converts from native (hex) form to dotted form.  It\n\t      is the complement of ::ip::prefixToNative.\n\n\n\t      list nativeList (in)\n\t\t     List of several ip addresses in native form. The native\n\t\t     form is a list as returned by ::ip::prefixToNative.\n\n\t      list native (in)\n\t\t     A list as returned by ::ip::prefixToNative.\n\n       The command returns a list of addresses in dotted form if it was called\n       with a list of addresses. Otherwise a single address in dotted form is\n       returned.\n\n\n\t  % ip::nativeToPrefix {0x01010100 0xffffff00} -ipv4\n\t  1.1.1.0/24\n\n\n       ::ip::intToString number ?-ipv4?\n\t      This command converts from an ip address specified as integer\n\t      number to dotted form.\n\n\n\t\t     ip::intToString 4294967295\n\t\t     255.255.255.255\n\n\n       ::ip::toInteger ipaddr\n\t      This command converts a dotted form ip into an integer number.\n\n\n\t\t % ::ip::toInteger 1.1.1.0\n\t\t 16843008\n\n\n       ::ip::toHex ipaddr\n\t      This command converts dotted form ip into a hexadecimal number.\n\n\n\t\t % ::ip::toHex 1.1.1.0\n\t\t 0x01010100\n\n\n       ::ip::maskToInt ipmask\n\t      This command convert an ipmask in either dotted (255.255.255.0)\n\t      form or mask length form (24) into an integer number.\n\n\n\t\t ::ip::maskToInt 24\n\t\t 4294967040\n\n\n       ::ip::broadcastAddress prefix ?-ipv4?\n\t      This commands returns a broadcast address in dotted form for the\n\t      given route prefix, either in the form \"addr/mask\", or in native\n\t      form. The result is in dotted form.\n\n\n\t\t ::ip::broadcastAddress 1.1.1.0/24\n\t\t 1.1.1.255\n\n\t\t ::ip::broadcastAddress {0x01010100 0xffffff00}\n\t\t 0x010101ff\n\n\n\n\n\n       ::ip::maskToLength dottedMask|integerMask|hexMask ?-ipv4?\n\n\n\t      This command converts the dotted or integer form of an ipmask to\n\t      the mask length form."
