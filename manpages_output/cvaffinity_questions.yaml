An affinity is\n       created in a storage pool through the volume configuration, see\n       snfs_config(5).\tIt is a name, up to eight (8) characters, describing a\n       special media type. Use cvadmin(8) to see what affinity sets are\n       assigned to the configured storage pools.\n\n       If the affinity does not exist on any of the storage pools, a set will\n       fail.  When allocating space for a file with an affinity, if the\n       affinity does not exist for any of the storage pools, or if the storage\n       pools with the affinity cannot be used to satisfy an allocation\n       request, then the allocation will occur on the non-exclusive storage\n       pools.  If there is no non-exclusive storage pools, an ENOSPC is\n       returned.  See also AffinityPreference in snfs_config(5)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `cvaffinity`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf a file does not have an affinity, it cannot have space allocated to\n       it on storage pools that have any affinities and are configured to be\n       exclusive.\n\n       A common way to use the affinity capability, is to create a directory\n       with cvmkdir(1) and have all files and directories below that directory\n       inherit the affinity.  Also, files can be created and have space pre-\n       allocated with an affinity using cvmkfile(1).\n\n       For automatic affinity mapping for certain files, see autoAffinity and\n       autoAffinities in snfs_config(5) and snfs.cfgx(5).\n\nOPTIONS\n       -s key Set the given key to be the Affinity Key of the given file or\n\t      directory.  This key must be configured as an Affinity in the\n\t      storage pool section of the file system configuration. Use\n\t      cvadmin(8) to see the affinities in this file system.  For files\n\t      with an Affinity, new blocks allocated to that file are placed\n\t      on a storage pool with the specified Affinity.  For directories\n\t      with an Affinity new files created in that directory inherit the\n\t      Affinity from the directory."
