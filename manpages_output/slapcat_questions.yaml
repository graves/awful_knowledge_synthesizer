It opens the\n       given database determined by the database number or suffix and writes\n       the corresponding LDIF to standard output or the specified file.\n       Databases configured as subordinate of this one are also output, unless\n       -g is specified.\n\n       The entry records are presented in database order, not superior first\n       order.  The entry records will include all (user and operational)\n       attributes stored in the database.  The entry records will not include\n       dynamically generated attributes (such as subschemaSubentry).\n\n       The output of slapcat is intended to be used as input to slapadd(8).\n       The output of slapcat cannot generally be used as input to ldapadd(1)\n       or other LDAP clients without first editing the output.\tThis editing\n       would normally include reordering the records into superior first order\n       and removing no-user-modification operational attributes."

If a valid config directory exists then the default config\n\t      file is ignored."
