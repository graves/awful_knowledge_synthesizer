File information includes: the file's\n     UNIX permissions, its owner and group, its size, its time of last\n     modification, and so on.  Also included are a checksum of each file and\n     information about hard links.\n\n     The bill of materials for installed packages are found within the package\n     receipts located in /Library/Receipts.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     ditto(1), lsbom(8), mkbom(8)\n\nBUGS\n     Mac OS X's bill of materials format is not compatible with formats from\n     older operating systems.\n\nHISTORY\n     The bill of materials file appeared in NeXTSTEP to support installation.\n     The file format was updated and extended for Mac OS X 10.0.
