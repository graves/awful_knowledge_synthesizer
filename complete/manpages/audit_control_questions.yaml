Each\n     line of this file is of the form:\n\n\t   parameter:value\n\n     The parameters are:\n\n     dir     The directory where audit log files are stored.  There may be\n\t     more than one of these entries.  Changes to this entry can only\n\t     be enacted by restarting the audit system.  See audit(8) for a\n\t     description of how to restart the audit system."
