In this case, the widget will display no background or\n       border, and no colors will be consumed from its colormap for its\n       background and border.  [-class class] Specifies a class for the\n       window.\tThis class will be used when querying the option database for\n       the window's other options, and it will also be used later for other\n       purposes such as bindings.  The class option may not be changed with\n       the configure widget command.  [-colormap colormap] Specifies a\n       colormap to use for the window.\tThe value may be either new, in which\n       case a new colormap is created for the window and its children, or the\n       name of another window (which must be on the same screen and have the\n       same visual as pathName), in which case the new window will use the\n       colormap from the specified window.  If the colormap option is not\n       specified, the new window uses the default colormap of its screen.\n       This option may not be changed with the configure widget command.\n       [-container container] The value must be a boolean.  If true, it means\n       that this window will be used as a container in which some other\n       application will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can be\n       embedded using the -use option).  The window will support the\n       appropriate window manager protocols for things like geometry requests.\n       The window should not have any children of its own in this application.\n       This option may not be changed with the configure widget command.\n       [-height height] Specifies the desired height for the window in any of\n       the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less than or\n       equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.\n       [-menu menu] Specifies a menu widget to be used as a menubar. On the\n       Macintosh, the menubar will be displayed across the top of the main\n       monitor. On Microsoft Windows and all UNIX platforms, the menu will\n       appear across the toplevel window as part of the window dressing\n       maintained by the window manager.  [-screen ] Specifies the screen on\n       which to place the new window.  Any valid screen name may be used, even\n       one associated with a different display.  Defaults to the same screen\n       as its parent.  This option is special in that it may not be specified\n       via the option database, and it may not be modified with the configure\n       widget command.\t[-use use] This option is used for embedding. If the\n       value is not an empty string, it must be the window identifier of a\n       container window, specified as a hexadecimal string like the ones\n       returned by the winfo id command. The toplevel widget will be created\n       as a child of the given container instead of the root window for the\n       screen.\tIf the container window is in a Tk application, it must be a\n       frame or toplevel widget for which the -container option was specified.\n       This option may not be changed with the configure widget command.\n       [-visual visual] Specifies visual information for the new window in any\n       of the forms accepted by Tk_GetVisual.  If this option is not\n       specified, the new window will use the default visual for its screen.\n       The visual option may not be modified with the configure widget\n       command.  [-width width] Specifies the desired width for the window in\n       any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less\n       than or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Additional options, described above, may be\n       specified on the command line or in the option database to configure\n       aspects of the toplevel such as its background color and relief.  The\n       toplevel command returns the path name of the new window.\n\n       A toplevel is similar to a frame except that it is created as a top-\n       level window:  its X parent is the root window of a screen rather than\n       the logical parent from its path name.  The primary purpose of a\n       toplevel is to serve as a container for dialog boxes and other\n       collections of widgets.\tThe only visible features of a toplevel are\n       its background color and an optional 3-D border to make the toplevel\n       appear raised or sunken.\n\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The toplevel command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same\n       as the path name of the toplevel's window.  This command may be used to\n       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general\n       form:\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same as the toplevel\n       widget's path name.  Option and the args determine the exact behavior\n       of the command.\tThe following commands are possible for toplevel\n       widgets:\n\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      toplevel command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      toplevel command."
