LDAP tools, such as ldapadd(1)\n       and ldapsearch(1), read and write LDIF entry records.  ldapmodify(1)\n       reads LDIF change records.\n\n       This manual page provides a basic description of LDIF.  A formal\n       specification of LDIF is published in RFC 2849.\n\nENTRY RECORDS\n       LDIF entry records are used to represent directory entries.  The basic\n       form of an entry record is:\n\n\t    dn: <distinguished name>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>\n\t    <attrdesc>:: <base64-encoded-value>\n\t    <attrdesc>:< <URL>\n\t    ...\n\n       The value may be specified as UTF-8 text or as base64 encoded data, or\n       a URI may be provided to the location of the attribute value.\n\n       A line may be continued by starting the next line with a single space\n       or tab, e.g.,\n\n\t    dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=exam\n\t     ple,dc=com\n\n       Lines beginning with a sharp sign ('#') are ignored.\n\n       Multiple attribute values are specified on separate lines, e.g.,\n\n\t    cn: Barbara J Jensen\n\t    cn: Babs Jensen\n\n       If an value contains a non-printing character, or begins with a space\n       or a colon ':', the <attrtype> is followed by a double colon and the\n       value is encoded in base 64 notation. e.g., the value \" begins with a\n       space\" would be encoded like this:\n\n\t    cn:: IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=\n\n       If the attribute value is located in a file, the <attrtype> is followed\n       by a ':<' and a file: URI.  e.g., the value contained in the file\n       /tmp/value would be listed like this:\n\n\t    cn:< file:///tmp/value\n       Other URI schemes (ftp,http) may be supported as well.\n\n       Multiple entries within the same LDIF file are separated by blank\n       lines.\n\nENTRY RECORD EXAMPLE\n       Here is an example of an LDIF file containing three entries.\n\n\t    dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com\n\t    cn: Barbara J Jensen\n\t    cn: Babs Jensen\n\t    objectclass: person\n\t    description:< file:///tmp/babs\n\t    sn: Jensen\n\n\t    dn: cn=Bjorn J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com\n\t    cn: Bjorn J Jensen\n\t    cn: Bjorn Jensen\n\t    objectclass: person\n\t    sn: Jensen\n\n\t    dn: cn=Jennifer J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com\n\t    cn: Jennifer J Jensen\n\t    cn: Jennifer Jensen\n\t    objectclass: person\n\t    sn: Jensen\n\t    jpegPhoto:: /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAAAAAQABAAD/2wBDABALD\n\t     A4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQ\n\t     ERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVG\n\t    ...\n\n       Note that the description in Barbara Jensen's entry is read from\n       file:///tmp/babs and the jpegPhoto in Jennifer Jensen's entry is\n       encoded using base 64.\n\nCHANGE RECORDS\n       LDIF change records are used to represent directory change requests.\n       Each change record starts with line indicating the distinguished name\n       of the entry being changed:\n\n\t    dn: <distinguishedname>\n\n\t    changetype: <[modify|add|delete|modrdn]>\n\n       Finally, the change information itself is given, the format of which\n       depends on what kind of change was specified above.  For a changetype\n       of modify, the format is one or more of the following:\n\n\t    add: <attributetype>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <value1>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <value2>\n\t    ...\n\t    -\n\n       Or, for a replace modification:\n\n\t    replace: <attributetype>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <value1>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <value2>\n\t    ...\n\t    -\n\n       If no attributetype lines are given to replace, the entire attribute is\n       to be deleted (if present).\n\n       Or, for a delete modification:\n\n\t    delete: <attributetype>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <value1>\n\t    <attrdesc>: <value2>\n\t    ...\n\t    -\n\n       If no attributetype lines are given to delete, the entire attribute is\n       to be deleted.\n\n       For a changetype of add, the format is:\n\n\t    <attrdesc1>: <value1>\n\t    <attrdesc1>: <value2>\n\t    ...\n\t    <attrdescN>: <value1>\n\t    <attrdescN>: <value2>\n\n       For a changetype of modrdn or moddn, the format is:\n\n\t    newrdn: <newrdn>\n\t    deleteoldrdn: 0 | 1\n\t    newsuperior: <DN>\n\n       where a value of 1 for deleteoldrdn means to delete the values forming\n       the old rdn from the entry, and a value of 0 means to leave the values\n       as non-distinguished attributes in the entry.  The newsuperior line is\n       optional and, if present, specifies the new superior to move the entry\n       to.\n\n       For a changetype of delete, no additional information is needed in the\n       record.\n\n       Note that attribute values may be presented using base64 or in files as\n       described for entry records.  Lines in change records may be continued\n       in the manner described for entry records as well.\n\nCHANGE RECORD EXAMPLE\n       The following sample LDIF file contains a change record of each type of\n       change.\n\n\t    dn: cn=Babs Jensen,dc=example,dc=com\n\t    changetype: add\n\t    objectclass: person\n\t    objectclass: extensibleObject\n\t    cn: babs\n\t    cn: babs jensen\n\t    sn: jensen\n\n\t    dn: cn=Babs Jensen,dc=example,dc=com\n\t    changetype: modify\n\t    add: givenName\n\t    givenName: Barbara\n\t    givenName: babs\n\t    -\n\t    replace: description\n\t    description: the fabulous babs\n\t    -\n\t    delete: sn\n\t    sn: jensen\n\t    -\n\n\t    dn: cn=Babs Jensen,dc=example,dc=com\n\t    changetype: modrdn\n\t    newrdn: cn=Barbara J Jensen\n\t    deleteoldrdn: 0\n\t    newsuperior: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com\n\n\t    dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com\n\t    changetype: delete"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ldif`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nINCLUDE STATEMENT\n       The LDIF parser has been extended to support an include statement for\n       referencing other LDIF files.  The include statement must be separated\n       from other records by a blank line.  The referenced file is specified\n       using a file: URI and all of its contents are incorporated as if they\n       were part of the original LDIF file. As above, other URI schemes may be\n       supported. For example:\n\n\t    dn: dc=example,dc=com\n\t    objectclass: domain\n\t    dc: example\n\n\t    include: file:///tmp/example.com.ldif\n\n\t    dn: dc=example,dc=org\n\t    objectclass: domain\n\t    dc: example\n       This feature is not part of the LDIF specification in RFC 2849 but is\n       expected to appear in a future revision of this spec. It is supported\n       by the ldapadd(1), ldapmodify(1), and slapadd(8) commands.\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n       ldap(3), ldapsearch(1), ldapadd(1), ldapmodify(1), slapadd(8),\n       slapcat(8), slapd-ldif(5), slapd.replog(5).\n\n       \"LDAP Data Interchange Format,\" Good, G., RFC 2849.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n       OpenLDAP Software is developed and maintained by The OpenLDAP Project\n       <http://www.openldap.org/>.
