Where possible, it is preferable for jobs to launch on\n     demand based on criteria specified in their respective configuration\n     files.\n\n     launchd also manages XPC services that are bundled within applications\n     and frameworks on the system.\n\n     During boot launchd is invoked by the kernel to run as the first process\n     on the system and to further bootstrap the rest of the system.\n\n     You cannot invoke launchd directly.\n\nNOTES\n     On Darwin operating systems, the canonical way to launch a daemon is\n     through launchd as opposed to traditional POSIX and POSIX-like mechanisms\n     or mechanisms provided in earlier versions of OS X. These alternate\n     methods should be considered deprecated and not suitable for new\n     projects."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `launchd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIn the launchd lexicon, a daemon is, by definition, a system-wide service\n     of which there is one instance for all clients. An agent is a service\n     that runs on a per-user basis.  Daemons should not attempt to display UI\n     or interact directly with a user's login session. Any and all work that\n     involves interacting with a user should be done through agents.\n\n     XPC services which are marked with a ServiceType of System are\n     functionally equivalent to daemons and run in the same environment,\n     sharing the same Mach bootstrap namespace. XPC services which are marked\n     with a ServiceType of User are equivalent to agents with the\n     LimitLoadToSessionType key specifying the Background session and run in\n     the same environment, sharing the same Mach bootstrap namespace. See\n     launchd.plist(5) for more information about user sessions.\n\n     On Darwin platforms, a user environment includes a specific Mach\n     bootstrap subset, audit session and other characteristics not recognized\n     by POSIX.\tTherefore, making the appropriate setuid(2) and setgid(2)\n     system calls is not sufficient to completely assume the identity for a\n     given user. Running a service as a launchd agent or a per-user XPC\n     service is the only way to run a process with a complete identity of that\n     user."
