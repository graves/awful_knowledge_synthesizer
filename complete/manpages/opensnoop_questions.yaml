Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       opensnoop [-a|-A|-ceFghstvxZ] [-f pathname] [-n name] [-p PID]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       opensnoop tracks file opens. As a process issues a file open, details\n       such as UID, PID and pathname are printed out.\n\n       The returned file descriptor is printed, a value of -1 indicates an\n       error. This can be useful for troubleshooting to determine if\n       applications are attempting to open files that do not exist.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a     print all data\n\n       -A     dump all data, space delimited\n\n       -c     print current working directory of process\n\n       -e     print errno value\n\n       -F     print the flags passed to open\n\n       -g     print full command arguments\n\n       -s     print start time, us\n\n       -t     print user stack trace\n\n       -v     print start time, string\n\n       -x     only print failed opens\n\n       -Z     print zonename\n\n       -f pathname\n\t      file pathname to snoop\n\n       -n name\n\t      process name to snoop\n\n       -p PID process ID to snoop\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Default output, print file opens by process as they occur,\n\t      # opensnoop\n\n       Print human readable timestamps,\n\t      # opensnoop -v\n\n       See error codes,\n\t      # opensnoop -e\n\n       Snoop this file only,\n\t      # opensnoop -f /etc/passwd\n\nFIELDS\n       ZONE   Zone name\n\n       UID    User ID\n\n       PID    Process ID\n\n       PPID   Parent Process ID\n\n       FD     File Descriptor (-1 is error)\n\n       FLAGS  Flags passed to open\n\n       ERR    errno value (see /usr/include/sys/errno.h)\n\n       CWD    current working directory of process\n\n       PATH   pathname for file open\n\n       COMM   command name for the process\n\n       ARGS   argument listing for the process\n\n       TIME   timestamp for the open event, us\n\n       STRTIME\n\t      timestamp for the open event, string\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       opensnoop will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit.\n\nBUGS\n       occasionally the pathname for the file open cannot be read and the\n       following error will be seen,\n\n       dtrace: error on enabled probe ID 6 (...): invalid address\n\n       this is normal behaviour.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dtrace(1M), truss(1)"
