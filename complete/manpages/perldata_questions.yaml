A scalar is a single\n       string (of any size, limited only by the available memory), number, or\n       a reference to something (which will be discussed in perlref).  Normal\n       arrays are ordered lists of scalars indexed by number, starting with 0.\n       Hashes are unordered collections of scalar values indexed by their\n       associated string key.\n\n       Values are usually referred to by name, or through a named reference.\n       The first character of the name tells you to what sort of data\n       structure it refers.  The rest of the name tells you the particular\n       value to which it refers.  Usually this name is a single identifier,\n       that is, a string beginning with a letter or underscore, and containing\n       letters, underscores, and digits.  In some cases, it may be a chain of\n       identifiers, separated by \"::\" (or by the slightly archaic \"'\"); all\n       but the last are interpreted as names of packages, to locate the\n       namespace in which to look up the final identifier (see \"Packages\" in\n       perlmod for details).  For a more in-depth discussion on identifiers,\n       see \"Identifier parsing\".  It's possible to substitute for a simple\n       identifier, an expression that produces a reference to the value at\n       runtime.   This is described in more detail below and in perlref.\n\n       Perl also has its own built-in variables whose names don't follow these\n       rules.  They have strange names so they don't accidentally collide with\n       one of your normal variables.  Strings that match parenthesized parts\n       of a regular expression are saved under names containing only digits\n       after the \"$\" (see perlop and perlre).  In addition, several special\n       variables that provide windows into the inner working of Perl have\n       names containing punctuation characters.  These are documented in\n       perlvar.\n\n       Scalar values are always named with '$', even when referring to a\n       scalar that is part of an array or a hash.  The '$' symbol works\n       semantically like the English word \"the\" in that it indicates a single\n       value is expected.\n\n\t   $days\t       # the simple scalar value \"days\"\n\t   $days[28]\t       # the 29th element of array @days\n\t   $days{'Feb'}        # the 'Feb' value from hash %days\n\t   $#days\t       # the last index of array @days\n\n       Entire arrays (and slices of arrays and hashes) are denoted by '@',\n       which works much as the word \"these\" or \"those\" does in English, in\n       that it indicates multiple values are expected.\n\n\t   @days\t       # ($days[0], $days[1],... $days[n])\n\t   @days[3,4,5]        # same as ($days[3],$days[4],$days[5])\n\t   @days{'a','c'}      # same as ($days{'a'},$days{'c'})\n\n       Entire hashes are denoted by '%':\n\n\t   %days\t       # (key1, val1, key2, val2 ...)\n\n       In addition, subroutines are named with an initial '&', though this is\n       optional when unambiguous, just as the word \"do\" is often redundant in\n       English.  Symbol table entries can be named with an initial '*', but\n       you don't really care about that yet (if ever :-).\n\n       Every variable type has its own namespace, as do several non-variable\n       identifiers.  This means that you can, without fear of conflict, use\n       the same name for a scalar variable, an array, or a hash--or, for that\n       matter, for a filehandle, a directory handle, a subroutine name, a\n       format name, or a label.  This means that $foo and @foo are two\n       different variables.  It also means that $foo[1] is a part of @foo, not\n       a part of $foo.\tThis may seem a bit weird, but that's okay, because it\n       is weird.\n\n       Because variable references always start with '$', '@', or '%', the\n       \"reserved\" words aren't in fact reserved with respect to variable\n       names.  They are reserved with respect to labels and filehandles,\n       however, which don't have an initial special character.\tYou can't have\n       a filehandle named \"log\", for instance.\tHint: you could say\n       \"open(LOG,'logfile')\" rather than \"open(log,'logfile')\".  Using\n       uppercase filehandles also improves readability and protects you from\n       conflict with future reserved words.  Case is significant--\"FOO\",\n       \"Foo\", and \"foo\" are all different names.  Names that start with a\n       letter or underscore may also contain digits and underscores.\n\n       It is possible to replace such an alphanumeric name with an expression\n       that returns a reference to the appropriate type.  For a description of\n       this, see perlref.\n\n       Names that start with a digit may contain only more digits.  Names that\n       do not start with a letter, underscore, digit or a caret are limited to\n       one character, e.g.,  $% or $$.\t(Most of these one character names\n       have a predefined significance to Perl.\tFor instance, $$ is the\n       current process id.  And all such names are reserved for Perl's\n       possible use.)\n\n   Identifier parsing\n       Up until Perl 5.18, the actual rules of what a valid identifier was\n       were a bit fuzzy.  However, in general, anything defined here should\n       work on previous versions of Perl, while the opposite -- edge cases\n       that work in previous versions, but aren't defined here -- probably\n       won't work on newer versions.  As an important side note, please note\n       that the following only applies to bareword identifiers as found in\n       Perl source code, not identifiers introduced through symbolic\n       references, which have much fewer restrictions.\tIf working under the\n       effect of the \"use utf8;\" pragma, the following rules apply:\n\n\t   / (?[ ( \\p{Word} & \\p{XID_Start} ) + [_] ])\n\t     (?[ ( \\p{Word} & \\p{XID_Continue} ) ]) *\t /x\n\n       That is, a \"start\" character followed by any number of \"continue\"\n       characters.  Perl requires every character in an identifier to also\n       match \"\\w\" (this prevents some problematic cases); and Perl\n       additionally accepts identifier names beginning with an underscore.\n\n       If not under \"use utf8\", the source is treated as ASCII + 128 extra\n       generic characters, and identifiers should match\n\n\t   / (?aa) (?!\\d) \\w+ /x\n\n       That is, any word character in the ASCII range, as long as the first\n       character is not a digit.\n\n       There are two package separators in Perl: A double colon (\"::\") and a\n       single quote (\"'\").  Normal identifiers can start or end with a double\n       colon, and can contain several parts delimited by double colons.\n       Single quotes have similar rules, but with the exception that they are\n       not legal at the end of an identifier: That is, \"$'foo\" and \"$foo'bar\"\n       are legal, but \"$foo'bar'\" is not.\n\n       Additionally, if the identifier is preceded by a sigil -- that is, if\n       the identifier is part of a variable name -- it may optionally be\n       enclosed in braces.\n\n       While you can mix double colons with singles quotes, the quotes must\n       come after the colons: \"$::::'foo\" and \"$foo::'bar\" are legal, but\n       \"$::'::foo\" and \"$foo'::bar\" are not.\n\n       Put together, a grammar to match a basic identifier becomes\n\n\t/\n\t (?(DEFINE)\n\t     (?<variable>\n\t\t (?&sigil)\n\t\t (?:\n\t\t\t (?&normal_identifier)\n\t\t     |\t \\{ \\s* (?&normal_identifier) \\s* \\}\n\t\t )\n\t     )\n\t     (?<normal_identifier>\n\t\t (?: :: )* '?\n\t\t  (?&basic_identifier)\n\t\t  (?: (?= (?: :: )+ '? | (?: :: )* ' ) (?&normal_identifier) )?\n\t\t (?: :: )*\n\t     )\n\t     (?<basic_identifier>\n\t       # is use utf8 on?\n\t\t (?(?{ (caller(0))[8] & $utf8::hint_bits })\n\t\t     (?&Perl_XIDS) (?&Perl_XIDC)*\n\t\t   | (?aa) (?!\\d) \\w+\n\t\t )\n\t     )\n\t     (?<sigil> [&*\\$\\@\\%])\n\t     (?<Perl_XIDS> (?[ ( \\p{Word} & \\p{XID_Start} ) + [_] ]) )\n\t     (?<Perl_XIDC> (?[ \\p{Word} & \\p{XID_Continue} ]) )\n\t )\n\t/x\n\n       Meanwhile, special identifiers don't follow the above rules; For the\n       most part, all of the identifiers in this category have a special\n       meaning given by Perl.  Because they have special parsing rules, these\n       generally can't be fully-qualified.  They come in six forms (but don't\n       use forms 5 and 6):\n\n       1.  A sigil, followed solely by digits matching \"\\p{POSIX_Digit}\", like\n\t   $0, $1, or $10000.\n\n       2.  A sigil followed by a single character matching the\n\t   \"\\p{POSIX_Punct}\" property, like $! or \"%+\", except the character\n\t   \"{\" doesn't work.\n\n       3.  A sigil, followed by a caret and any one of the characters\n\t   \"[][A-Z^_?\\]\", like $^V or $^].\n\n       4.  Similar to the above, a sigil, followed by bareword text in braces,\n\t   where the first character is a caret.  The next character is any\n\t   one of the characters \"[][A-Z^_?\\]\", followed by ASCII word\n\t   characters.\tAn example is \"${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\".\n\n       5.  A sigil, followed by any single character in the range\n\t   \"[\\xA1-\\xAC\\xAE-\\xFF]\" when not under \"use utf8\".  (Under\n\t   \"use utf8\", the normal identifier rules given earlier in this\n\t   section apply.)  Use of non-graphic characters (the C1 controls,\n\t   the NO-BREAK SPACE, and the SOFT HYPHEN) has been disallowed since\n\t   v5.26.0.  The use of the other characters is unwise, as these are\n\t   all reserved to have special meaning to Perl, and none of them\n\t   currently do have special meaning, though this could change without\n\t   notice.\n\n\t   Note that an implication of this form is that there are identifiers\n\t   only legal under \"use utf8\", and vice-versa, for example the\n\t   identifier \"$etat\" is legal under \"use utf8\", but is otherwise\n\t   considered to be the single character variable \"$e\" followed by the\n\t   bareword \"tat\", the combination of which is a syntax error.\n\n       6.  This is a combination of the previous two forms.  It is valid only\n\t   when not under \"use utf8\" (normal identifier rules apply when under\n\t   \"use utf8\").  The form is a sigil, followed by text in braces,\n\t   where the first character is any one of the characters in the range\n\t   \"[\\x80-\\xFF]\" followed by ASCII word characters up to the trailing\n\t   brace.\n\n\t   The same caveats as the previous form apply:  The non-graphic\n\t   characters are no longer allowed with \"use utf8\", it is unwise to\n\t   use this form at all, and utf8ness makes a big difference.\n\n       Prior to Perl v5.24, non-graphical ASCII control characters were also\n       allowed in some situations; this had been deprecated since v5.20.\n\n   Context\n       The interpretation of operations and values in Perl sometimes depends\n       on the requirements of the context around the operation or value.\n       There are two major contexts: list and scalar.  Certain operations\n       return list values in contexts wanting a list, and scalar values\n       otherwise.  If this is true of an operation it will be mentioned in the\n       documentation for that operation.  In other words, Perl overloads\n       certain operations based on whether the expected return value is\n       singular or plural.  Some words in English work this way, like \"fish\"\n       and \"sheep\".\n\n       In a reciprocal fashion, an operation provides either a scalar or a\n       list context to each of its arguments.  For example, if you say\n\n\t   int( <STDIN> )\n\n       the integer operation provides scalar context for the <> operator,\n       which responds by reading one line from STDIN and passing it back to\n       the integer operation, which will then find the integer value of that\n       line and return that.  If, on the other hand, you say\n\n\t   sort( <STDIN> )\n\n       then the sort operation provides list context for <>, which will\n       proceed to read every line available up to the end of file, and pass\n       that list of lines back to the sort routine, which will then sort those\n       lines and return them as a list to whatever the context of the sort\n       was.\n\n       Assignment is a little bit special in that it uses its left argument to\n       determine the context for the right argument.  Assignment to a scalar\n       evaluates the right-hand side in scalar context, while assignment to an\n       array or hash evaluates the righthand side in list context.  Assignment\n       to a list (or slice, which is just a list anyway) also evaluates the\n       right-hand side in list context.\n\n       When you use the \"use warnings\" pragma or Perl's -w command-line\n       option, you may see warnings about useless uses of constants or\n       functions in \"void context\".  Void context just means the value has\n       been discarded, such as a statement containing only \"\"fred\";\" or\n       \"getpwuid(0);\".\tIt still counts as scalar context for functions that\n       care whether or not they're being called in list context.\n\n       User-defined subroutines may choose to care whether they are being\n       called in a void, scalar, or list context.  Most subroutines do not\n       need to bother, though.\tThat's because both scalars and lists are\n       automatically interpolated into lists.  See \"wantarray\" in perlfunc for\n       how you would dynamically discern your function's calling context.\n\n   Scalar values\n       All data in Perl is a scalar, an array of scalars, or a hash of\n       scalars.  A scalar may contain one single value in any of three\n       different flavors: a number, a string, or a reference.  In general,\n       conversion from one form to another is transparent.  Although a scalar\n       may not directly hold multiple values, it may contain a reference to an\n       array or hash which in turn contains multiple values.\n\n       Scalars aren't necessarily one thing or another.  There's no place to\n       declare a scalar variable to be of type \"string\", type \"number\", type\n       \"reference\", or anything else.  Because of the automatic conversion of\n       scalars, operations that return scalars don't need to care (and in\n       fact, cannot care) whether their caller is looking for a string, a\n       number, or a reference.\tPerl is a contextually polymorphic language\n       whose scalars can be strings, numbers, or references (which includes\n       objects).  Although strings and numbers are considered pretty much the\n       same thing for nearly all purposes, references are strongly-typed,\n       uncastable pointers with builtin reference-counting and destructor\n       invocation."

    Manpage text:

    A scalar value is interpreted as FALSE in the Boolean sense if it is
           undefined, the null string or the number 0 (or its string equivalent,
           "0"), and TRUE if it is anything else.  The Boolean context is just a
           special kind of scalar context where no conversion to a string or a
           number is ever performed.  Negation of a true value by "!" or "not"
           returns a special false value.  When evaluated as a string it is
           treated as "", but as a number, it is treated as 0.  Most Perl
           operators that return true or false behave this way.

           There are actually two varieties of null strings (sometimes referred to
           as "empty" strings), a defined one and an undefined one.  The defined
           version is just a string of length zero, such as "".  The undefined
           version is the value that indicates that there is no real value for
           something, such as when there was an error, or at end of file, or when
           you refer to an uninitialized variable or element of an array or hash.
           Although in early versions of Perl, an undefined scalar could become
           defined when first used in a place expecting a defined value, this no
           longer happens except for rare cases of autovivification as explained
           in perlref.  You can use the defined() operator to determine whether a
           scalar value is defined (this has no meaning on arrays or hashes), and
           the undef() operator to produce an undefined value.

    Special floating point: infinity (Inf) and not-a-number (NaN)

           Floating point values include the special values "Inf" and "NaN", for
           infinity and not-a-number.  The infinity can be also negative.

           The infinity is the result of certain math operations that overflow the
           floating point range, like 9**9**9.  The not-a-number is the result
           when the result is undefined or unrepresentable.  Though note that you
           cannot get "NaN" from some common "undefined" or "out-of-range"
           operations like dividing by zero, or square root of a negative number,
           since Perl generates fatal errors for those.

           The infinity and not-a-number have their own special arithmetic rules.
           The general rule is that they are "contagious": "Inf" plus one is
           "Inf", and "NaN" plus one is "NaN".  Where things get interesting is
           when you combine infinities and not-a-numbers: "Inf" minus "Inf" and
           "Inf" divided by "Inf" are "NaN" (while "Inf" plus "Inf" is "Inf" and
           "Inf" times "Inf" is "Inf").  "NaN" is also curious in that it does not
           equal any number, including itself: "NaN" != "NaN".

    Manpage text:

    Perl doesn't understand "Inf" and "NaN" as numeric literals, but you
           can have them as strings, and Perl will convert them as needed: "Inf" +
           1.  (You can, however, import them from the POSIX extension; "use POSIX
           qw(Inf NaN);" and then use them as literals.)

           Note that on input (string to number) Perl accepts "Inf" and "NaN" in
           many forms.   Case is ignored, and the Win32-specific forms like
           "1.#INF" are understood, but on output the values are normalized to
           "Inf" and "NaN".

           Version Strings

           A literal of the form "v1.20.300.4000" is parsed as a string composed
           of characters with the specified ordinals.  This form, known as
           v-strings, provides an alternative, more readable way to construct
           strings, rather than use the somewhat less readable interpolation form
           "\x{1}\x{14}\x{12c}\x{fa0}".  This is useful for representing Unicode
           strings, and for comparing version "numbers" using the string
           comparison operators, "cmp", "gt", "lt" etc.  If there are two or more
           dots in the literal, the leading "v" may be omitted.
