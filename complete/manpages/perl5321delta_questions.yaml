The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.32.1:\n\n       Adam Hartley, Andy Dougherty, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker, Dan Book,\n       David Mitchell, Graham Knop, Graham Ollis, Hauke D, H.Merijn Brand,\n       Hugo van der Sanden, John Lightsey, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson,\n       Leon Timmermans, Max Maischein, Nicolas R., Ricardo Signes, Richard\n       Leach, Sawyer X, Sevan Janiyan, Steve Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.\n\n       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically\n       generated from version control history.\tIn particular, it does not\n       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who\n       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.\n\n       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN\n       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug\n       database at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be\n       information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.\tBe sure to trim your bug down\n       to a tiny but sufficient test case.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see \"SECURITY\n       VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\" in perlsec for details of how to\n       report the issue.\n\nGive Thanks\n       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in\n       Perl 5, you can do so by running the \"perlthanks\" program:\n\n\t   perlthanks\n\n       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of\n       thanks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5321DELTA(1)"
