The backtrace_unpack() function returns the number\n     of addresses written to the destination buffer.\n\nFORMATS\n     BTP_NONE\n\t     Just copy the addresses unpacked to the destination buffer.\n\n     BTP_KERN_OFFSET_32\n\t     Subtract the kernel base address from each address so they fit in\n\t     4 bytes."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the backtrace_pack and backtrace_unpack functions?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the backtrace_pack function to convert a backtrace into a compact byte array with kernel offset 32-bit addressing?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the backtrace_unpack function to convert a compact byte array back into a list of kernel addresses?
