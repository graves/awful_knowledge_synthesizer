These services are implemented with\n       distinct service names: proxymap and proxywrite, respectively. The\n       purpose of these services is:\n\n       •      To overcome chroot restrictions. For example, a chrooted SMTP\n\t      server needs access to the system passwd file in order to reject\n\t      mail for non-existent local addresses, but it is not practical\n\t      to maintain a copy of the passwd file in the chroot jail.  The\n\t      solution:\n\n\t      local_recipient_maps =\n\t\t  proxy:unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps\n\n       •      To consolidate the number of open lookup tables by sharing one\n\t      open table among multiple processes. For example, making mysql\n\t      connections from every Postfix daemon process results in \"too\n\t      many connections\" errors. The solution:\n\n\t      virtual_alias_maps =\n\t\t  proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/virtual_alias.cf\n\n\t      The total number of connections is limited by the number of\n\t      proxymap server processes.\n\n       •      To provide single-updater functionality for lookup tables that\n\t      do not reliably support multiple writers (i.e. all file-based\n\t      tables).\n\n       The proxymap(8) server implements the following requests:\n\n       open maptype:mapname flags\n\t      Open the table with type maptype and name mapname, as controlled\n\t      by flags. The reply includes the maptype dependent flags (to\n\t      distinguish a fixed string table from a regular expression\n\t      table).\n\n       lookup maptype:mapname flags key\n\t      Look up the data stored under the requested key.\tThe reply is\n\t      the request completion status code and the lookup result value.\n\t      The maptype:mapname and flags are the same as with the open\n\t      request.\n\n       update maptype:mapname flags key value\n\t      Update the data stored under the requested key.  The reply is\n\t      the request completion status code.  The maptype:mapname and\n\t      flags are the same as with the open request.\n\n\t      To implement single-updater maps, specify a process limit of 1\n\t      in the master.cf file entry for the proxywrite service.\n\n\t      This request is supported in Postfix 2.5 and later.\n\n       delete maptype:mapname flags key\n\t      Delete the data stored under the requested key.  The reply is\n\t      the request completion status code.  The maptype:mapname and\n\t      flags are the same as with the open request.\n\n\t      This request is supported in Postfix 2.5 and later.\n\n       sequence maptype:mapname flags function\n\t      Iterate over the specified database. The function is one of\n\t      DICT_SEQ_FUN_FIRST or DICT_SEQ_FUN_NEXT.\tThe reply is the\n\t      request completion status code and a lookup key and result\n\t      value, if found.\n\n\t      This request is supported in Postfix 2.9 and later.\n\n       The request completion status is one of OK, RETRY, NOKEY (lookup failed\n       because the key was not found), BAD (malformed request) or DENY (the\n       table is not approved for proxy read or update access).\n\n       There is no close command, nor are tables implicitly closed when a\n       client disconnects. The purpose is to share tables among multiple\n       client processes.\n\nSERVER PROCESS MANAGEMENT\n       proxymap(8) servers run under control by the Postfix master(8) server.\n       Each server can handle multiple simultaneous connections.  When all\n       servers are busy while a client connects, the master(8) creates a new\n       proxymap(8) server process, provided that the process limit is not\n       exceeded.  Each server terminates after serving at least $max_use\n       clients or after $max_idle seconds of idle time.\n\nSECURITY\n       The proxymap(8) server opens only tables that are approved via the\n       proxy_read_maps or proxy_write_maps configuration parameters, does not\n       talk to users, and can run at fixed low privilege, chrooted or not.\n       However, running the proxymap server chrooted severely limits\n       usability, because it can open only chrooted tables.\n\n       The proxymap(8) server is not a trusted daemon process, and must not be\n       used to look up sensitive information such as UNIX user or group IDs,\n       mailbox file/directory names or external commands.\n\n       In Postfix version 2.2 and later, the proxymap client recognizes\n       requests to access a table for security-sensitive purposes, and opens\n       the table directly. This allows the same main.cf setting to be used by\n       sensitive and non-sensitive processes.\n\n       Postfix-writable data files should be stored under a dedicated\n       directory that is writable only by the Postfix mail system, such as the\n       Postfix-owned data_directory.\n\n       In particular, Postfix-writable files should never exist in root-owned\n       directories. That would open up a particular type of security hole\n       where ownership of a file or directory does not match the provider of\n       its content.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\nBUGS\n       The proxymap(8) server provides service to multiple clients, and must\n       therefore not be used for tables that have high-latency lookups.\n\n       The proxymap(8) read-write service does not explicitly close lookup\n       tables (even if it did, this could not be relied on, because the\n       process may be terminated between table updates).  The read-write\n       service should therefore not be used with tables that leave persistent\n       storage in an inconsistent state between updates (for example, CDB).\n       Tables that support \"sync on update\" should be safe (for example,\n       Berkeley DB) as should tables that are implemented by a real DBMS.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       On busy mail systems a long time may pass before proxymap(8) relevant\n       changes to main.cf are picked up. Use the command \"postfix reload\" to\n       speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary.
