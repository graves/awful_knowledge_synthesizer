The output is standardized to mime-types.\n\n       The core part of the recognizer was generated from a \"magic(5)\" file\n       containing the checks to perform to recognize files, and associated\n       mime-types.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::mimetype filename\n\t      This command is similar to the command fileutil::fileType.\n\n\t      The output of the command for the specified file is not a list\n\t      of attributes describing the type of the file, but a list of\n\t      standard mime-types the file may have."
