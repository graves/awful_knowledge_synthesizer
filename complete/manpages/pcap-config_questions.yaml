When run with the --libs option, pcap-config writes to the\n       standard output the -L and -l linker flags required to link with\n       libpcap, including -l flags for libraries required by libpcap.  When\n       run with the --additional-libs option, pcap-config writes to the\n       standard output the -L and -l flags for libraries required by libpcap,\n       but not the -lpcap flag to link with libpcap itself.\n\n       By default, it writes flags appropriate for compiling with a\n       dynamically-linked version of libpcap; the --static flag causes it to\n       write flags appropriate for compiling with a statically-linked version\n       of libpcap."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the pcap-config tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How can I use pcap-config to obtain the compiler flags needed to include libpcap's header files?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would I use to get the linker flags required to link with libpcap, excluding the -lpcap flag?
