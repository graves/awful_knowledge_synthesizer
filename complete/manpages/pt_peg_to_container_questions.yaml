Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package implements the converter from parsing expression grammars\n       to CONTAINER markup.\n\n       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools, and\n       can be used either directly with the other packages of this layer, or\n       indirectly through the export manager provided by pt::peg::export. The\n       latter is intented for use in untrusted environments and done through\n       the corresponding export plugin pt::peg::export::container sitting\n       between converter and export manager.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       Converter API found in the Parser Tools Export API specification.\n\n       pt::peg::to::container reset\n\t      This command resets the configuration of the package to its\n\t      default settings.\n\n       pt::peg::to::container configure\n\t      This command returns a dictionary containing the current\n\t      configuration of the package.\n\n       pt::peg::to::container configure option\n\t      This command returns the current value of the specified\n\t      configuration option of the package. For the set of legal\n\t      options, please read the section Options.\n\n       pt::peg::to::container configure option value...\n\t      This command sets the given configuration options of the\n\t      package, to the specified values. For the set of legal options,\n\t      please read the section Options.\n\n       pt::peg::to::container convert serial\n\t      This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing\n\t      expression grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization\n\t      format, and contained in serial, and generates CONTAINER markup\n\t      encoding the grammar, per the current package configuration.\n\t      The created string is then returned as the result of the\n\t      command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The converter to the CONTAINER format recognizes the following options\n       and changes its behaviour as they specify.\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -mode bulk|incremental\n\t      The value of this option controls which methods of\n\t      pt::peg::container instances are used to specify the grammar,\n\t      i.e. preload it into the container. There are two legal values,\n\t      as listed below. The default is bulk.\n\n\t      bulk   In this mode the methods start, add, modes, and rules are\n\t\t     used to specify the grammar in a bulk manner, i.e. as a\n\t\t     set of nonterminal symbols, and two dictionaries mapping\n\t\t     from the symbols to their semantic modes and parsing\n\t\t     expressions.\n\n\t\t     This mode is the default.\n\n\t      incremental\n\t\t     In this mode the methods start, add, mode, and rule are\n\t\t     used to specify the grammar piecemal, with each\n\t\t     nonterminal having its own block of defining commands.\n\n       -template string\n\t      The value of this option is a string into which to put the\n\t      generated code and the other configuration settings. The various\n\t      locations for user-data are expected to be specified with the\n\t      placeholders listed below. The default value is \"@code@\".\n\n\t      @user@ To be replaced with the value of the option -user.\n\n\t      @format@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the the constant CONTAINER.\n\n\t      @file@ To be replaced with the value of the option -file.\n\n\t      @name@ To be replaced with the value of the option -name.\n\n\t      @mode@ To be replaced with the value of the option -mode.\n\n\t      @code@ To be replaced with the generated code.\n\nGRAMMAR CONTAINER\n       The container format is another form of describing parsing expression\n       grammars. While data in this format is executable it does not\n       constitute a parser for the grammar. It always has to be used in\n       conjunction with the package pt::peg::interp, a grammar interpreter.\n\n       The format represents grammars by a snit::type, i.e. class, whose\n       instances are API-compatible to the instances of the pt::peg::container\n       package, and which are preloaded with the grammar in question.\n\n       It has no direct formal specification beyond what was said above.\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions"
