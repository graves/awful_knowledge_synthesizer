Output is\n       sent to the standard output.  Status and progress messages are sent to\n       the standard error.\n\n       ippevepcl prints to B&W HP PCL laser printers and supports printing of\n       HP PCL (application/vnd.hp-pcl), PWG Raster (image/pwg-raster), and\n       Apple Raster (image/urf) print files.\n\n       ippeveps print to Adobe PostScript printers and supports printing of\n       PDF (application/pdf), PostScript (application/postscript), JPEG\n       (image/jpeg), PWG Raster (image/pwg-raster), and Apple Raster\n       (image/urf) print files.  Printer-specific commands are read from a\n       supplied PPD file.  If no PPD file is specified, generic commands\n       suitable for any Level 2 or Level 3 PostScript printer are used instead\n       to specify duplex printing and media size."
