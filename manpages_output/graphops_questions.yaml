It provides a series of common\n       operations and algorithms applicable to (un)directed graphs.\n\n       Despite being a companion the package is not directly dependent on\n       struct::graph, only on the API defined by that package. I.e. the\n       operations of this package can be applied to any and all graph objects\n       which provide the same API as the objects created through\n       struct::graph.\n\nOPERATIONS\n       struct::graph:op::toAdjacencyMatrix g\n\t      This command takes the graph g and returns a nested list\n\t      containing the adjacency matrix of g.\n\n\t      The elements of the outer list are the rows of the matrix, the\n\t      inner elements are the column values in each row. The matrix has\n\t      \"n+1\" rows and columns, with the first row and column (index 0)\n\t      containing the name of the node the row/column is for. All other\n\t      elements are boolean values, True if there is an arc between the\n\t      2 nodes of the respective row and column, and False otherwise.\n\n\t      Note that the matrix is symmetric. It does not represent the\n\t      directionality of arcs, only their presence between nodes. It is\n\t      also unable to represent parallel arcs in g.\n\n       struct::graph:op::toAdjacencyList G ?options...?\n\t      Procedure creates for input graph G, it's representation as\n\t      Adjacency List.  It handles both directed and undirected graphs\n\t      (default is undirected).\tIt returns dictionary that for each\n\t      node (key) returns list of nodes adjacent to it. When\n\t      considering weighted version, for each adjacent node there is\n\t      also weight of the edge included."

Using this option tells the\n\t\t\t    command to handle G as the directed graph it is.\n\n\t\t     -weights\n\t\t\t    By default any weight information the graph G may\n\t\t\t    have is ignored.  Using this option tells the\n\t\t\t    command to put weight information into the result.\n\t\t\t    In that case it is expected that all arcs have a\n\t\t\t    proper weight, and an error is thrown if that is\n\t\t\t    not the case.\n\n       struct::graph:op::kruskal g\n\t      This command takes the graph g and returns a list containing the\n\t      names of the arcs in g which span up a minimum weight spanning\n\t      tree (MST), or, in the case of an un-connected graph, a minimum\n\t      weight spanning forest (except for the 1-vertex components).\n\t      Kruskal's algorithm is used to compute the tree or forest.  This\n\t      algorithm has a time complexity of O(E*log E) or O(E* log V),\n\t      where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges\n\t      in graph g.\n\n\t      The command will throw an error if one or more arcs in g have no\n\t      weight associated with them.\n\n\t      A note regarding the result, the command refrains from\n\t      explicitly listing the nodes of the MST as this information is\n\t      implicitly provided in the arcs already.\n\n       struct::graph:op::prim g\n\t      This command takes the graph g and returns a list containing the\n\t      names of the arcs in g which span up a minimum weight spanning\n\t      tree (MST), or, in the case of an un-connected graph, a minimum\n\t      weight spanning forest (except for the 1-vertex components).\n\t      Prim's algorithm is used to compute the tree or forest.  This\n\t      algorithm has a time complexity between O(E+V*log V) and O(V*V),\n\t      depending on the implementation (Fibonacci heap + Adjacency list\n\t      versus Adjacency Matrix).  As usual V is the number of vertices\n\t      and E the number of edges in graph g.\n\n\t      The command will throw an error if one or more arcs in g have no\n\t      weight associated with them.\n\n\t      A note regarding the result, the command refrains from\n\t      explicitly listing the nodes of the MST as this information is\n\t      implicitly provided in the arcs already.\n\n       struct::graph:op::isBipartite? g ?bipartvar?\n\t      This command takes the graph g and returns a boolean value\n\t      indicating whether it is bipartite (true) or not (false). If the\n\t      variable bipartvar is specified the two partitions of the graph\n\t      are there as a list, if, and only if the graph is bipartit. If\n\t      it is not the variable, if specified, is not touched.\n\n       struct::graph:op::tarjan g\n\t      This command computes the set of strongly connected components\n\t      (SCCs) of the graph g. The result of the command is a list of\n\t      sets, each of which contains the nodes for one of the SCCs of g.\n\t      The union of all SCCs covers the whole graph, and no two SCCs\n\t      intersect with each other.\n\n\t      The graph g is acyclic if all SCCs in the result contain only a\n\t      single node. The graph g is strongly connected if the result\n\t      contains only a single SCC containing all nodes of g.\n\n       struct::graph:op::connectedComponents g\n\t      This command computes the set of connected components (CCs) of\n\t      the graph g. The result of the command is a list of sets, each\n\t      of which contains the nodes for one of the CCs of g. The union\n\t      of all CCs covers the whole graph, and no two CCs intersect with\n\t      each other.\n\n\t      The graph g is connected if the result contains only a single\n\t      SCC containing all nodes of g.\n\n       struct::graph:op::connectedComponentOf g n\n\t      This command computes the connected component (CC) of the graph\n\t      g containing the node n. The result of the command is a sets\n\t      which contains the nodes for the CC of n in g.\n\n\t      The command will throw an error if n is not a node of the graph\n\t      g.\n\n       struct::graph:op::isConnected? g\n\t      This is a convenience command determining whether the graph g is\n\t      connected or not.  The result is a boolean value, true if the\n\t      graph is connected, and false otherwise.\n\n       struct::graph:op::isCutVertex? g n\n\t      This command determines whether the node n in the graph g is a\n\t      cut vertex (aka articulation point). The result is a boolean\n\t      value, true if the node is a cut vertex, and false otherwise.\n\n\t      The command will throw an error if n is not a node of the graph\n\t      g.\n\n       struct::graph:op::isBridge? g a\n\t      This command determines whether the arc a in the graph g is a\n\t      bridge (aka cut edge, or isthmus). The result is a boolean\n\t      value, true if the arc is a bridge, and false otherwise.\n\n\t      The command will throw an error if a is not an arc of the graph\n\t      g.\n\n       struct::graph:op::isEulerian? g ?tourvar?\n\t      This command determines whether the graph g is eulerian or not.\n\t      The result is a boolean value, true if the graph is eulerian,\n\t      and false otherwise.\n\n\t      If the graph is eulerian and tourvar is specified then an euler\n\t      tour is computed as well and stored in the named variable. The\n\t      tour is represented by the list of arcs traversed, in the order\n\t      of traversal.\n\n       struct::graph:op::isSemiEulerian? g ?pathvar?\n\t      This command determines whether the graph g is semi-eulerian or\n\t      not.  The result is a boolean value, true if the graph is semi-\n\t      eulerian, and false otherwise.\n\n\t      If the graph is semi-eulerian and pathvar is specified then an\n\t      euler path is computed as well and stored in the named variable.\n\t      The path is represented by the list of arcs traversed, in the\n\t      order of traversal.\n\n       struct::graph:op::dijkstra g start ?options...?\n\t      This command determines distances in the weighted g from the\n\t      node start to all other nodes in the graph. The options specify\n\t      how to traverse graphs, and the format of the result.\n\n\t      Two options are recognized\n\n\t      -arcmode mode\n\t\t     The accepted mode values are directed and undirected.\n\t\t     For directed traversal all arcs are traversed from source\n\t\t     to target. For undirected traversal all arcs are\n\t\t     traversed in the opposite direction as well. Undirected\n\t\t     traversal is the default.\n\n\t      -outputformat format\n\t\t     The accepted format values are distances and tree. In\n\t\t     both cases the result is a dictionary keyed by the names\n\t\t     of all nodes in the graph. For distances the value is the\n\t\t     distance of the node to start, whereas for tree the value\n\t\t     is the path from the node to start, excluding the node\n\t\t     itself, but including start. Tree format is the default.\n\n       struct::graph:op::distance g origin destination ?options...?\n\t      This command determines the (un)directed distance between the\n\t      two nodes origin and destination in the graph g. It accepts the\n\t      option -arcmode of struct::graph:op::dijkstra.\n\n       struct::graph:op::eccentricity g n ?options...?\n\t      This command determines the (un)directed eccentricity of the\n\t      node n in the graph g. It accepts the option -arcmode of\n\t      struct::graph:op::dijkstra.\n\n\t      The (un)directed eccentricity of a node is the maximal\n\t      (un)directed distance between the node and any other node in the\n\t      graph.\n\n       struct::graph:op::radius g ?options...?\n\t      This command determines the (un)directed radius of the graph g.\n\t      It accepts the option -arcmode of struct::graph:op::dijkstra.\n\n\t      The (un)directed radius of a graph is the minimal (un)directed\n\t      eccentricity of all nodes in the graph.\n\n       struct::graph:op::diameter g ?options...?\n\t      This command determines the (un)directed diameter of the graph\n\t      g. It accepts the option -arcmode of struct::graph:op::dijkstra.\n\n\t      The (un)directed diameter of a graph is the maximal (un)directed\n\t      eccentricity of all nodes in the graph.\n\n       struct::graph::op::BellmanFord G startnode\n\t      Searching for shortests paths between chosen node and all other\n\t      nodes in graph G. Based on relaxation method. In comparison to\n\t      struct::graph::op::dijkstra it doesn't need assumption that all\n\t      weights on edges in input graph G have to be positive.\n\n\t      That generality sets the complexity of algorithm to - O(V*E),\n\t      where V is the number of vertices and E is number of edges in\n\t      graph G."

This can be\n\t\t     reduced to the single-source shortest path problem by\n\t\t     reversing the edges in the graph.\n\n\t      •      The all-pairs shortest path problem, in which we have to\n\t\t     find shortest paths between every pair of vertices v, v'\n\t\t     in the graph.\n       Note: The result of Shortest Path problem can be Shortest Path tree,\n       which is a subgraph of a given (possibly weighted) graph constructed so\n       that the distance between a selected root node and all other nodes is\n       minimal. It is a tree because if there are two paths between the root\n       node and some vertex v (i.e. a cycle), we can delete the last edge of\n       the longer path without increasing the distance from the root node to\n       any node in the subgraph.\n\n   TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM\n       Definition:\n\t      For given edge-weighted (weights on edges should be positive)\n\t      graph the goal is to find the cycle that visits each node in\n\t      graph exactly once (Hamiltonian cycle).\n\n       Generalizations:\n\n\t      •      Metric TSP - A very natural restriction of the TSP is to\n\t\t     require that the distances between cities form a metric,\n\t\t     i.e., they satisfy the triangle inequality. That is, for\n\t\t     any 3 cities A, B and C, the distance between A and C\n\t\t     must be at most the distance from A to B plus the\n\t\t     distance from B to C. Most natural instances of TSP\n\t\t     satisfy this constraint.\n\n\t      •      Euclidean TSP - Euclidean TSP, or planar TSP, is the TSP\n\t\t     with the distance being the ordinary Euclidean distance.\n\t\t     Euclidean TSP is a particular case of TSP with triangle\n\t\t     inequality, since distances in plane obey triangle\n\t\t     inequality. However, it seems to be easier than general\n\t\t     TSP with triangle inequality. For example, the minimum\n\t\t     spanning tree of the graph associated with an instance of\n\t\t     Euclidean TSP is a Euclidean minimum spanning tree, and\n\t\t     so can be computed in expected O(n log n) time for n\n\t\t     points (considerably less than the number of edges). This\n\t\t     enables the simple 2-approximation algorithm for TSP with\n\t\t     triangle inequality above to operate more quickly.\n\n\t      •      Asymmetric TSP - In most cases, the distance between two\n\t\t     nodes in the TSP network is the same in both directions.\n\t\t     The case where the distance from A to B is not equal to\n\t\t     the distance from B to A is called asymmetric TSP.  A\n\t\t     practical application of an asymmetric TSP is route\n\t\t     optimisation using street-level routing (asymmetric due\n\t\t     to one-way streets, slip-roads and motorways).\n\n   MATCHING PROBLEM\n       Definition:\n\t      Given a graph G = (V,E), a matching or edge-independent set M in\n\t      G is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges, that is, no two edges\n\t      share a common vertex. A vertex is matched if it is incident to\n\t      an edge in the matching M.  Otherwise the vertex is unmatched.\n\n       Generalizations:\n\n\t      •      Maximal matching - a matching M of a graph G with the\n\t\t     property that if any edge not in M is added to M, it is\n\t\t     no longer a matching, that is, M is maximal if it is not\n\t\t     a proper subset of any other matching in graph G.\tIn\n\t\t     other words, a matching M of a graph G is maximal if\n\t\t     every edge in G has a non-empty intersection with at\n\t\t     least one edge in M.\n\n\t      •      Maximum matching - a matching that contains the largest\n\t\t     possible number of edges. There may be many maximum\n\t\t     matchings.  The matching number of a graph G is the size\n\t\t     of a maximum matching. Note that every maximum matching\n\t\t     is maximal, but not every maximal matching is a maximum\n\t\t     matching.\n\n\t      •      Perfect matching - a matching which matches all vertices\n\t\t     of the graph. That is, every vertex of the graph is\n\t\t     incident to exactly one edge of the matching. Every\n\t\t     perfect matching is maximum and hence maximal. In some\n\t\t     literature, the term complete matching is used. A perfect\n\t\t     matching is also a minimum-size edge cover. Moreover, the\n\t\t     size of a maximum matching is no larger than the size of\n\t\t     a minimum edge cover.\n\n\t      •      Near-perfect matching - a matching in which exactly one\n\t\t     vertex is unmatched. This can only occur when the graph\n\t\t     has an odd number of vertices, and such a matching must\n\t\t     be maximum. If, for every vertex in a graph, there is a\n\t\t     near-perfect matching that omits only that vertex, the\n\t\t     graph is also called factor-critical.\n\n       Related terms:\n\n\t      •      Alternating path - given a matching M, an alternating\n\t\t     path is a path in which the edges belong alternatively to\n\t\t     the matching and not to the matching.\n\n\t      •      Augmenting path - given a matching M, an augmenting path\n\t\t     is an alternating path that starts from and ends on free\n\t\t     (unmatched) vertices.\n\n   CUT PROBLEMS\n       Definition:\n\t      A cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two\n\t      disjoint subsets. The cut-set of the cut is the set of edges\n\t      whose end points are in different subsets of the partition.\n\t      Edges are said to be crossing the cut if they are in its cut-\n\t      set.\n\n\t      Formally:\n\n\t      •      a cut C = (S,T) is a partition of V of a graph G = (V,\n\t\t     E).\n\n\t      •      an s-t cut C = (S,T) of a flow network N = (V, E) is a\n\t\t     cut of N such that s is included in S and t is included\n\t\t     in T, where s and t are the source and the sink of N\n\t\t     respectively.\n\n\t      •      The cut-set of a cut C = (S,T) is such set of edges from\n\t\t     graph G = (V, E) that each edge (u, v) satisfies\n\t\t     condition that u is included in S and v is included in T.\n\n       In an unweighted undirected graph, the size or weight of a cut is the\n       number of edges crossing the cut. In a weighted graph, the same term is\n       defined by the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut.\n\n       In a flow network, an s-t cut is a cut that requires the source and the\n       sink to be in different subsets, and its cut-set only consists of edges\n       going from the source's side to the sink's side. The capacity of an s-t\n       cut is defined by the sum of capacity of each edge in the cut-set.\n\n       The cut of a graph can sometimes refer to its cut-set instead of the\n       partition.\n\n       Generalizations:\n\n\t      •      Minimum cut - A cut is minimum if the size of the cut is\n\t\t     not larger than the size of any other cut.\n\n\t      •      Maximum cut - A cut is maximum if the size of the cut is\n\t\t     not smaller than the size of any other cut.\n\n\t      •      Sparsest cut - The Sparsest cut problem is to bipartition\n\t\t     the vertices so as to minimize the ratio of the number of\n\t\t     edges across the cut divided by the number of vertices in\n\t\t     the smaller half of the partition.\n\n   K-CENTER PROBLEM\n       Definitions:\n\n\t      Unweighted K-Center\n\t\t     For any set S ( which is subset of V ) and node v, let\n\t\t     the connect(v,S) be the cost of cheapest edge connecting\n\t\t     v with any node in S. The goal is to find such S, that\n\t\t     |S| = k and max_v{connect(v,S)} is possibly small.\n\n\t\t     In other words, we can use it i.e. for finding best\n\t\t     locations in the city ( nodes of input graph ) for\n\t\t     placing k buildings, such that those buildings will be as\n\t\t     close as possible to all other locations in town."

As\n\t\t     flow F we define set of non-negative integer attributes\n\t\t     f(u,v) assigned to edges, satisfying such conditions:\n\n\t\t     [1]    for each edge (u, v) in G such condition should be\n\t\t\t    satisfied:\t    0 <= f(u,v) <= c(u,v)\n\n\t\t     [2]    Network G has source node s such that the flow F\n\t\t\t    is equal to the sum of outcoming flow decreased by\n\t\t\t    the sum of incoming flow from that source node s.\n\n\t\t     [3]    Network G has sink node t such that the the -F\n\t\t\t    value is equal to the sum of the incoming flow\n\t\t\t    decreased by the sum of outcoming flow from that\n\t\t\t    sink node t.\n\n\t\t     [4]    For each node that is not a source or sink the sum\n\t\t\t    of incoming flow and sum of outcoming flow should\n\t\t\t    be equal.\n\n\t      •      the minimum cost flow problem - the goal is finding the\n\t\t     cheapest possible way of sending a certain amount of flow\n\t\t     through a flow network.\n\n\t      •      blocking flow - a blocking flow for a residual network Gf\n\t\t     we name such flow b in Gf that:\n\n\t\t     [1]    Each path from sink to source is the shortest path\n\t\t\t    in Gf.\n\n\t\t     [2]    Each shortest path in Gf contains an edge with\n\t\t\t    fully used throughput in Gf+b.\n\n\t      •      residual network - for a flow network G and flow f\n\t\t     residual network is built with those edges, which can\n\t\t     send larger flow. It contains only those edges, which can\n\t\t     send flow larger than 0.\n\n\t      •      level network - it has the same set of nodes as residual\n\t\t     graph, but has only those edges (u,v) from Gf for which\n\t\t     such equality is satisfied: distance(s,u)+1 =\n\t\t     distance(s,v).\n\n\t      •      augmenting network - it is a modification of residual\n\t\t     network considering the new flow values.
