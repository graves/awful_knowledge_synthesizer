To make this work this also\n\t      implies that indented is set as well.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set, the output is formatted as per the\n\t      value of indented, without trying to align the values for object\n\t      keys.\n\n       ::json::write string s\n\t      This method takes the string s and returns it properly quoted\n\t      for JSON as its result.\n\n       ::json::write array arg...\n\t      This method takes a series of JSON formatted arguments and\n\t      returns them as a properly formatted JSON array as its result.\n\n       ::json::write object key value...\n\t      This method takes a series of key/value arguments, the values\n\t      already formatted for JSON, and returns them as a properly\n\t      formatted JSON object as its result, with the keys formatted as\n\t      JSON strings.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.

Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       data exchange, exchange format, javascript, json\n\nCATEGORY\n       CGI programming\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2009 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@sourceforge.net>"
