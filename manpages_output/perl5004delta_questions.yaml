    NAME
           perl5004delta - what's new for perl5.004

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.003 release (as
           documented in Programming Perl, second edition--the Camel Book) and
           this one.

    Supported Environments
           Perl5.004 builds out of the box on Unix, Plan 9, LynxOS, VMS, OS/2,
           QNX, AmigaOS, and Windows NT.  Perl runs on Windows 95 as well, but it
           cannot be built there, for lack of a reasonable command interpreter.

    Core Changes
           Most importantly, many bugs were fixed, including several security
           problems.  See the Changes file in the distribution for details.

       List assignment to %ENV works
           "%ENV = ()" and "%ENV = @list" now work as expected (except on VMS
           where it generates a fatal error).

       Change to "Can't locate Foo.pm in @INC" error
           The error "Can't locate Foo.pm in @INC" now lists the contents of @INC
           for easier debugging.

       Compilation option: Binary compatibility with 5.003
           There is a new Configure question that asks if you want to maintain
           binary compatibility with Perl 5.003.  If you choose binary
           compatibility, you do not have to recompile your extensions, but you
           might have symbol conflicts if you embed Perl in another application,
           just as in the 5.003 release.  By default, binary compatibility is
           preserved at the expense of symbol table pollution.

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use perl5004delta to understand changes between Perl 5.003 and Perl 5.004?

PERL5OPT\n       may only be used to set the following switches: -[DIMUdmw].\n\n   Limitations on -M, -m, and -T options\n       The \"-M\" and \"-m\" options are no longer allowed on the \"#!\" line of a\n       script.\tIf a script needs a module, it should invoke it with the \"use\"\n       pragma.\n\n       The -T option is also forbidden on the \"#!\" line of a script, unless it\n       was present on the Perl command line.  Due to the way \"#!\" works, this\n       usually means that -T must be in the first argument.  Thus:\n\n\t   #!/usr/bin/perl -T -w\n\n       will probably work for an executable script invoked as \"scriptname\",\n       while:\n\n\t   #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T\n\n       will probably fail under the same conditions.  (Non-Unix systems will\n       probably not follow this rule.)\tBut \"perl scriptname\" is guaranteed to\n       fail, since then there is no chance of -T being found on the command\n       line before it is found on the \"#!\" line."

    More precise warnings
           If you removed the -w option from your Perl 5.003 scripts because it
           made Perl too verbose, we recommend that you try putting it back when
           you upgrade to Perl 5.004.  Each new perl version tends to remove some
           undesirable warnings, while adding new warnings that may catch bugs in
           your scripts.

       Deprecated: Inherited "AUTOLOAD" for non-methods
           Before Perl 5.004, "AUTOLOAD" functions were looked up as methods
           (using the @ISA hierarchy), even when the function to be autoloaded was
           called as a plain function (e.g. "Foo::bar()"), not a method (e.g.
           "Foo->bar()" or "$obj->bar()").

           Perl 5.005 will use method lookup only for methods' "AUTOLOAD"s.
           However, there is a significant base of existing code that may be using
           the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl 5.004 issues an
           optional warning when a non-method uses an inherited "AUTOLOAD".

           The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-
           methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used to
           depend on inheriting "AUTOLOAD" for non-methods from a base class named
           "BaseClass", execute "*AUTOLOAD = \&BaseClass::AUTOLOAD" during
           startup.

    After this code executes in Perl 5.004, $a{b} exists but $a[2] does
           not.  In Perl 5.002 and 5.003, both $a{b} and $a[2] would have existed
           (but $a[2]'s value would have been undefined).

       Group vector changeable with $)
           The $) special variable has always (well, in Perl 5, at least)
           reflected not only the current effective group, but also the group list
           as returned by the "getgroups()" C function (if there is one).
           However, until this release, there has not been a way to call the
           "setgroups()" C function from Perl.

           In Perl 5.004, assigning to $) is exactly symmetrical with examining
           it: The first number in its string value is used as the effective gid;
           if there are any numbers after the first one, they are passed to the
           "setgroups()" C function (if there is one).

       Fixed parsing of $$<digit>, &$<digit>, etc.
           Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed by
           "$" and a digit.  For example, "$$0" was incorrectly taken to mean
           "${$}0" instead of "${$0}".  This bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.

    Manpage text:

    However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug
           completely, because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old
           meaning of "$$0" in a string.  So Perl 5.004 still interprets
           "$$<digit>" in the old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates
           this message as a warning.  And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment
           will cease.

       Fixed localization of $<digit>, $&, etc.
           Perl versions before 5.004 did not always properly localize the regex-
           related special variables.  Perl 5.004 does localize them, as the
           documentation has always said it should.  This may result in $1, $2,
           etc. no longer being set where existing programs use them.

       No resetting of $. on implicit close
           The documentation for Perl 5.0 has always stated that $. is not reset
           when an already-open file handle is reopened with no intervening call
           to "close".  Due to a bug, perl versions 5.000 through 5.003 did reset
           $. under that circumstance; Perl 5.004 does not.
