When reading back the response\n     from the wspd socket, first DWROD (32bits) read is the size of the WSP\n     response packet to recieve.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     --s     The UNIX socket wspd listens to.\n\n     --d     The delay between last connection was disconnected and the time\n\t     wspd will close if no new connection arrived.\n\nDarwin\t\t\t\tApril 28, 2019\t\t\t\tDarwin"
