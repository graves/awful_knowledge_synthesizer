Depending on local policies, a flow can contain packets for a\n     single TCP connection, or from/to a given host, or entire subnet, or a\n     protocol type, etc.\n\n     Packets belonging to the same flow are then passed to either of two\n     different objects, which implement the traffic regulation:\n\n\t pipe\t A pipe emulates a link with given bandwidth, propagation\n\t\t delay, queue size and packet loss rate.  Packets are queued\n\t\t in front of the pipe as they come out from the classifier,\n\t\t and then transferred to the pipe according to the pipe's\n\t\t parameters."
