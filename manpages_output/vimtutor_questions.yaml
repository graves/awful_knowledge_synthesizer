It copies the tutor file first, so that\n       it can be modified without changing the original file.\n\n       The Vimtutor is useful for people that want to learn their first Vim\n       commands.\n\n       The optional argument -g starts vimtutor with gvim rather than vim, if\n       the GUI version of Vim is available, or falls back to vim if gvim is\n       not found.\n\n       The optional [language] argument is the two-letter name of a language,\n       like \"it\" or \"es\".  If the [language] argument is missing, the language\n       of the current locale will be used.  If a tutor in this language is\n       available, it will be used.  Otherwise the English version will be\n       used.\n\n       Vim is always started in Vi compatible mode.\n\nFILES\n       /usr/local/share/vim/vim??/tutor/tutor[.language]\n\t\t      The Vimtutor text file(s).\n\t\t      vim??  is short version number, like vim91 for Vim 9.1"
