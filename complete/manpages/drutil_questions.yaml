Common verbs include burn, erase, eject, help, info, list,\n     status, and tray.\n\n     The rest of the verbs are: bulkerase, cdtext, discinfo, dumpiso, dumpudf,\n     filename, getconfig, poll, size, subchannel, trackinfo, and version.\n\nVERBS\n     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.  Drive\n     selection arguments must appear before individual arguments.  Drive\n     selection and argument descriptions can be found after the verb\n     descriptions in the Drive Selection Criteria section.\n\n     -drive drive(s)\n\t\tLets you specify a drive or drives, per the output of list,\n\t\tfor those verbs that can operate on one or more drives.  See\n\t\tthe Drive Selection Criterion section for more info.\n\n     help verb\n\t\tDisplay the usage information for the specified verb.\n\n     atip\n\t\tDisplays the Absolute Time in Pre-Groove (ATIP) for inserted\n\t\tCD-R/RW media.\n\n     bulkerase type\n\t\tStarts bulk erase mode, in which the drive will continually\n\t\terase inserted -RW media, eject it, and prompt for another\n\t\tdisc until terminated.\n\n\t\tTypes of erase:\n\t\tquick\t Performs a quick erase, doing the minimal amount of\n\t\t\t work to make the disc appear blank. This operation\n\t\t\t typically takes only a minute or two.\n\n\t\tfull\t Performs a complete erase, erasing every block on the\n\t\t\t disk. This operation is slow (on the order of 30\n\t\t\t minutes) to complete.\n\n     burn options path\n\t\tBurns a valid directory or image file to disc. The default is\n\t\tto burn the specified directory to a new filesystem. The\n\t\t-audio option creates an audio CD (redbook) in which any valid\n\t\tQuickTime audio file present in the path is converted to a\n\t\ttrack (in alphabetical order). If a file is specified (valid\n\t\timage files only: .dmg, .iso, .cue/bin, and .toc) the contents\n\t\tof the image file are burned. Pre-burn and post-burn options,\n\t\tand filesystem exclusions can be specificed for enhanced\n\t\tfunctionality. Last option takes precedence. Invalid commands\n\t\tare ignored.\n\n\t\tpath\t A valid path to a directory or file.\n\n\t\toptions  Specify an arbitrary valid burn option(s): -test,\n\t\t\t -appendable, -erase, -mount, -noverify, -nohfsplus,\n\t\t\t -noiso9660, -nojoliet, -noudf, -nofs, -audio, -speed,\n\t\t\t -pregap.  Or specify a default burn option: -notest,\n\t\t\t -noappendable, -noerase, -allfs, -hfsplus, -iso9660,\n\t\t\t -joliet, -udf, -data, -eject, -verify.\n\n     cdtext\n\t\tReads and displays any CD-Text information reported by the\n\t\tdrive. The drive must contain an audio CD, and be capable of\n\t\treading CD-Text.\n\n     discinfo [-xml]\n\t\tDisplays detailed information about present media.\n\n\t\tFrom the MMC command of the same name.\n\n     dumpiso device block [format]\n\t\tTool to inspect and interpret ISO-9660 and Joliet structures\n\t\ton the media.\n\n\t\tdevice\t Disk node, e.g. /dev/disk1, /dev/disk1s1,\n\t\t\t /dev/rdisk1.\n\n\t\tblock\t Block number to dump (in decimal or 0x hex notation).\n\t\t\t Blocks are assumed to be 2048-byte blocks.\n\n\t\tformat\t How to interpret the block. If format is not\n\t\t\t specified, dumpiso will attempt to guess.  If\n\t\t\t present, this argument should be one of the\n\t\t\t following: None, Boot, BootCat, PVD, SVD, VPD, VDST,\n\t\t\t MPath, LPath, Dir, HFSPlusVH.\n\n     dumpudf device block\n\t\tTool to inspect and interpret UDF structures on the media.\n\n\t\tdevice\t Disk node, e.g. /dev/disk1, /dev/disk1s1,\n\t\t\t /dev/rdisk1.\n\n\t\tblock\t Block number to dump (in decimal or 0x hex notation).\n\t\t\t Blocks are assumed to be 2048-byte blocks.\n\n     eject\n\t\tSynonym for drutil tray eject.\n\n     erase type\n\t\tErases -RW media in the drive(s) and ejects it.\n\n\t\tTypes of erase:\n\t\tquick\t Performs a quick erase, doing the minimal amount of\n\t\t\t work to make the disc appear blank. This operation\n\t\t\t typically takes only a minute or two.\n\n\t\tfull\t Performs a complete erase, erasing every block on the\n\t\t\t disk. This operation is slow (on the order of 30\n\t\t\t minutes) to complete.\n\n     filename name\n\t\tShows how the specified filename will be modified to comply\n\t\twith the naming rules of the filesystems that DiscRecording\n\t\tgenerates.\n\n     getconfig type\n\t\tDisplays device feature and profile list.\n\n\t\tTypes of config information:\n\t\tcurrent  Displays current features and profiles for a drive.\n\n\t\tsupported Displays all supported features and profiles for a\n\t\t\t drive.\n\n     info [-xml]\n\t\tDisplays various pieces of information for each drive,\n\t\tincluding how it's connected to the computer and a summary of\n\t\tcapabilities.\n\n     list [-xml]\n\t\tLists all burning devices connected to the machine.\n\n     poll\n\t\tDisplays device and media notifications until terminated.\n\n     size options path\n\t\tEstimates the size of a valid directory or image file (in\n\t\tblocks). The default is to estimate the size of the specified\n\t\tpath as a hybrid filesystem. The -audio option calculates the\n\t\tcontents of the directory as an audio CD (redbook) (for\n\t\tapplicable files). If a file is specified (valid image files\n\t\tonly: .dmg, .iso, .cue/bin, and .toc) the contents of the\n\t\timage file will be calculated. Filesystem exclusions can be\n\t\tspecificed for enhanced functionality. Calculated size will be\n\t\tcompared against blank media that is found unless the -nodrive\n\t\targument is specified. Last option takes precedence. Invalid\n\t\tcommands are ignored.\n\n\t\tpath\t A valid path to a directory or file.\n\n\t\toptions  Specify an arbitrary valid burn option(s): -nodrive,\n\t\t\t -nohfsplus, -noiso9660, -nojoliet, -noudf, -nofs,\n\t\t\t -audio, -pregap.  Or specify a default burn option:\n\t\t\t -allfs, -hfsplus, -iso9660, -joliet, -udf, -data.\n\n     status [-xml]\n\t\tDisplays detailed media-specific information.\n\n     subchannel\n\t\tDisplays information from the subchannels on CD media. This\n\t\tprints the MCN (media catalog number) for the disc, and the\n\t\tISRC (international standard recording code) for all tracks.\n\t\tThis command only works when CD media is present.\n\n\t\tFrom the MMC command of the same name.\n\n     toc\n\t\tDisplays table of contents (TOC) of inserted media.\n\n     trackinfo [-xml]\n\t\tDisplays detailed information about all tracks present on the\n\t\tmedia.\n\n\t\tFrom the MMC command of the same name.\n\n     tray command\n\t\tPerforms a tray/media related command. Note that some drives\n\t\tdo not have trays, and some have trays but may lack motorized\n\t\teject or inject capability.\n\n\t\tTray commands:\n\t\topen\t Opens a drive's tray, if no media is present and the\n\t\t\t drive has a tray capable of motorized eject.\n\n\t\tclose\t Closes a drive's tray, if the drive has a tray\n\t\t\t capable of motorized inject.\n\n\t\teject\t Ejects media from the drive, if the drive has a tray\n\t\t\t capable of motorized eject. If no media is present,\n\t\t\t this is equivalent to open.  If media is present and\n\t\t\t can be unmounted, it will be unmounted and then\n\t\t\t ejected.  If media is present but cannot be\n\t\t\t unmounted, the eject will fail.\n\n     version\n\t\tDisplays operating system and DiscRecording framework version\n\t\tnumbers."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `drutil`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOPTIONS\n     -xml\n\t\tWhen specified (valid options only: discinfo, info, list,\n\t\tstatus, and trackinfo) the output for the specified verb will\n\t\tbe shown in xml format.\n\nDRIVE SELECTION CRITERIA\n     Some functions of drutil operate on a specific drive. Since any number of\n     drives may be available, and they may come and go at any time, the device\n     selection arguments provide a method for selecting among them.\n\n     The candidate list starts out as a list of all attached drives. One or\n     more arguments of the form -drive drive(s) may be specified. Each\n     argument has the effect of narrowing the candidate list, depending on\n     what drive(s) is. It may be:\n\n\t •\t  A positive decimal number, assumed to be a 1-based index\n\t\t  into the candidate list. The candidate list is trimmed to\n\t\t  just that device.\n\n\t •\t  One of the following keywords: internal, external, usb,\n\t\t  firewire, atapi, scsi.  The candidate list is trimmed to\n\t\t  devices which match the specified location / bus. Case is\n\t\t  ignored in this comparison.\n\n\t •\t  Any other string, assumed to be a vendor/product name. The\n\t\t  candidate list is trimmed to devices whose vendor or product\n\t\t  strings exactly match the argument. Case (but not\n\t\t  whitespace) is ignored in this comparison.\n\n     Multiple -drive arguments may be specified; each argument narrows the\n     candidate list further. After all the -drive arguments have been\n     processed, the candidate list is considered. If it contains exactly one\n     item, that drive is used. If it contains zero items, drutil prints an\n     error message and exits. If it contains more than one item, the selected\n     function is executed on all drives remaining in the list."
