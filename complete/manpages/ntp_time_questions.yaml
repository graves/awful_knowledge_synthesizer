RFC 868 returns the time in seconds since\n       1 January 1900 to either tcp or udp clients. RFC 2030 also gives this\n       time but also provides a fractional part which is not used in this\n       client.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::time::gettime ?options? timeserver ?port?\n\t      Get the time from timeserver. You may specify any of the options\n\t      listed for the configure command here. This command returns a\n\t      token which must then be used with the remaining commands in\n\t      this package. Once you have finished, you should use cleanup to\n\t      release all resources. The default port is 37.\n\n       ::time::getsntp ?options? timeserver ?port?\n\t      Get the time from an SNTP server. This accepts exactly the same\n\t      arguments as ::time::gettime except that the default port is\n\t      123. The result is a token as per ::time::gettime and should be\n\t      handled in the same way.\n\n\t      Note that it is unlikely that any SNTP server will reply using\n\t      tcp so you will require the tcludp or the ceptcl package. If a\n\t      suitable package can be loaded then the udp protocol will be\n\t      used by default.\n\n       ::time::configure ?options?\n\t      Called with no arguments this command returns all the current\n\t      configuration options and values. Otherwise it should be called\n\t      with pairs of option name and value.\n\n\t      -protocol number\n\t\t     Set the default network protocol. This defaults to udp if\n\t\t     the tcludp package is available. Otherwise it will use\n\t\t     tcp.\n\n\t      -port number\n\t\t     Set the default port to use. RFC 868 uses port 37, RFC\n\t\t     2030 uses port 123.\n\n\t      -timeout number\n\t\t     Set the default timeout value in milliseconds. The\n\t\t     default is 10 seconds.\n\n\t      -command number\n\t\t     Set a command procedure to be run when a reply is\n\t\t     received. The procedure is called with the time token\n\t\t     appended to the argument list.\n\n\t      -loglevel number\n\t\t     Set the logging level. The default is 'warning'.\n\n       ::time::cget name\n\t      Get the current value for the named configuration option.\n\n       ::time::unixtime token\n\t      Format the returned time for the unix epoch. RFC 868 time\n\t      defines time 0 as 1 Jan 1900, while unix time defines time 0 as\n\t      1 Jan 1970. This command converts the reply to unix time.\n\n       ::time::status token\n\t      Returns the status flag. For a successfully completed query this\n\t      will be ok. May be error or timeout or eof.  See also\n\t      ::time::error\n\n       ::time::error token\n\t      Returns the error message provided for requests whose status is\n\t      error.  If there is no error message then an empty string is\n\t      returned.\n\n       ::time::reset token ?reason?\n\t      Reset or cancel the query optionally specfying the reason to\n\t      record for the error command.\n\n       ::time::wait token\n\t      Wait for a query to complete and return the status upon\n\t      completion.\n\n       ::time::cleanup token\n\t      Remove all state variables associated with the request."
