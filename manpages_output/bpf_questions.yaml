All packets on the network, even\n     those destined for other hosts, are accessible through this mechanism.\n\n     The packet filter appears as a character special device, /dev/bpf0,\n     /dev/bpf1, etc.  After opening the device, the file descriptor must be\n     bound to a specific network interface with the BIOCSETIF ioctl.  A given\n     interface can be shared by multiple listeners, and the filter underlying\n     each descriptor will see an identical packet stream.\n\n     A separate device file is required for each minor device.\tIf a file is\n     in use, the open will fail and errno will be set to EBUSY.\n\n     Associated with each open instance of a bpf file is a user-settable\n     packet filter.  Whenever a packet is received by an interface, all file\n     descriptors listening on that interface apply their filter.  Each\n     descriptor that accepts the packet receives its own copy."

Note that an individual packet larger than this size is\n     necessarily truncated.\n\n     A packet can be sent out on the network by writing to a bpf file\n     descriptor.
