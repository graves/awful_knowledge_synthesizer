    NAME
           perl5220delta - what is new for perl v5.22.0

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.20.0 release and the
           5.22.0 release.

           If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read
           perl5200delta, which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.20.0.

    Core Enhancements
       New bitwise operators
           A new experimental facility has been added that makes the four standard
           bitwise operators ("& | ^ ~") treat their operands consistently as
           numbers, and introduces four new dotted operators ("&. |. ^. ~.") that
           treat their operands consistently as strings.  The same applies to the
           assignment variants ("&= |= ^= &.= |.= ^.=").

           To use this, enable the "bitwise" feature and disable the
           "experimental::bitwise" warnings category.  See "Bitwise String
           Operators" in perlop for details.  [GH #14348]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14348>.

       New double-diamond operator
           "<<>>" is like "<>" but uses three-argument "open" to open each file in
           @ARGV.  This means that each element of @ARGV will be treated as an
           actual file name, and "|foo" won't be treated as a pipe open.

    "use locale" can restrict which locale categories are affected
           It is now possible to pass a parameter to "use locale" to specify a
           subset of locale categories to be locale-aware, with the remaining ones
           unaffected.  See "The "use locale" pragma" in perllocale for details.

       Perl now supports POSIX 2008 locale currency additions
           On platforms that are able to handle POSIX.1-2008, the hash returned by
           "POSIX::localeconv()" includes the international currency fields added
           by that version of the POSIX standard.  These are "int_n_cs_precedes",
           "int_n_sep_by_space", "int_n_sign_posn", "int_p_cs_precedes",
           "int_p_sep_by_space", and "int_p_sign_posn".

       Better heuristics on older platforms for determining locale UTF-8ness
           On platforms that implement neither the C99 standard nor the POSIX 2001
           standard, determining if the current locale is UTF-8 or not depends on
           heuristics.  These are improved in this release.

       Aliasing via reference
           Variables and subroutines can now be aliased by assigning to a
           reference:

    Infinity and NaN (not-a-number) handling improved
           Floating point values are able to hold the special values infinity,
           negative infinity, and NaN (not-a-number).  Now we more robustly
           recognize and propagate the value in computations, and on output
           normalize them to the strings "Inf", "-Inf", and "NaN".

           See also the POSIX enhancements.

       Floating point parsing has been improved
           Parsing and printing of floating point values has been improved.

           As a completely new feature, hexadecimal floating point literals (like
           "0x1.23p-4")  are now supported, and they can be output with
           "printf "%a"". See "Scalar value constructors" in perldata for more
           details.

       Packing infinity or not-a-number into a character is now fatal
           Before, when trying to pack infinity or not-a-number into a (signed)
           character, Perl would warn, and assumed you tried to pack 0xFF; if you
           gave it as an argument to "chr", "U+FFFD" was returned.

    But now, all such actions ("pack", "chr", and "print '%c'") result in a
           fatal error.

       Experimental C Backtrace API
           Perl now supports (via a C level API) retrieving the C level backtrace
           (similar to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).

           The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames, with the
           symbol names (function names), the object names (like "perl"), and if
           it can, also the source code locations (file:line).

           The supported platforms are Linux and OS X (some *BSD might work at
           least partly, but they have not yet been tested).

           The feature needs to be enabled with "Configure -Dusecbacktrace".

           See "C backtrace" in perlhacktips for more information.

    Security
       Perl is now compiled with "-fstack-protector-strong" if available
           Perl has been compiled with the anti-stack-smashing option
           "-fstack-protector" since 5.10.1.  Now Perl uses the newer variant

    The Safe module could allow outside packages to be replaced
           Critical bugfix: outside packages could be replaced.  Safe has been

       Perl is now always compiled with "-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2" if available
           The 'code hardening' option called "_FORTIFY_SOURCE", available in gcc
           4.*, is now always used for compiling Perl, if available.

           Note that this isn't necessarily a huge step since in many platforms
           the step had already been taken several years ago: many Linux
           distributions (like Fedora) have been using this option for Perl, and
           OS X has enforced the same for many years.

    Incompatible Changes
       Subroutine signatures moved before attributes
           The experimental sub signatures feature, as introduced in 5.20, parsed
           signatures after attributes. In this release, following feedback from
           users of the experimental feature, the positioning has been moved such

    Deprecations
       Setting "${^ENCODING}" to anything but "undef"
           This variable allows Perl scripts to be written in an encoding other
           than ASCII or UTF-8.  However, it affects all modules globally, leading
           to wrong answers and segmentation faults.  New scripts should be
           written in UTF-8; old scripts should be converted to UTF-8, which is
           easily done with the piconv utility.

       Use of non-graphic characters in single-character variable names
           The syntax for single-character variable names is more lenient than for
           longer variable names, allowing the one-character name to be a
           punctuation character or even invisible (a non-graphic).  Perl v5.20
           deprecated the ASCII-range controls as such a name.  Now, all non-
           graphic characters that formerly were allowed are deprecated.  The
           practical effect of this occurs only when not under "use utf8", and
           affects just the C1 controls (code points 0x80 through 0xFF), NO-BREAK
           SPACE, and SOFT HYPHEN.

This can break the closure behavior in those\n       cases where $var is subsequently modified, since the subroutine won't\n       return the changed value. (Note that this all only applies to anonymous\n       subroutines with an empty prototype (\"sub ()\").)\n\n       This usage is now deprecated in those cases where the variable could be\n       modified elsewhere.  Perl detects those cases and emits a deprecation\n       warning.  Such code will likely change in the future and stop producing\n       a constant.\n\n       If your variable is only modified in the place where it is declared,\n       then Perl will continue to make the sub inlinable with no warnings.\n\n\t   sub make_constant {\n\t       my $var = shift;\n\t       return sub () { $var }; # fine\n\t   }\n\n\t   sub make_constant_deprecated {\n\t       my $var;\n\t       $var = shift;\n\t       return sub () { $var }; # deprecated\n\t   }"

That it happens in a spot other than the\n       \"my\" declaration is enough for Perl to find it suspicious.\n\n       This deprecation warning happens only for a simple variable for the\n       body of the sub.  (A \"BEGIN\" block or \"use\" statement inside the sub is\n       ignored, because it does not become part of the sub's body.)  For more\n       complex cases, such as \"sub () { do_something() if 0; $var }\" the\n       behavior has changed such that inlining does not happen if the variable\n       is modifiable elsewhere.

By analogy with the Perl function\n\t   \"splice()\", it allows you to cut out zero or more ops from a\n\t   sibling chain and replace them with zero or more new ops.  It\n\t   transparently handles all the updating of sibling, parent, op_last\n\t   pointers etc."

           Perl 5.22.0 represents approximately 12 months of development since
           Perl 5.20.0 and contains approximately 590,000 lines of changes across
           2,400 files from 94 authors.

           Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
           were approximately 370,000 lines of changes to 1,500 .pm, .t, .c and .h

    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
           generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
           include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
           reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

           Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
           modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
           community for helping Perl to flourish.

           For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
           please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
           recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
           database at <https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
           <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by

Please only use this address for security issues in the\n       Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5220DELTA(1)"
