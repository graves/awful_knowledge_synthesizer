If specified, these flags are combined with the\n     system-wide audit flags in the audit_control(5) file to determine which\n     classes of events to audit for that user.\tThese settings take effect\n     when the user logs in."

These sets can indicate the inclusion or exclusion of\n     multiple classes, and whether to audit successful or failed events.  See\n     audit_control(5) for more information about audit flags.\n\n     Example entries in this file are:\n\n\t   root:lo,ad:no\n\t   jdoe:-fc,ad:+fw\n\n     These settings would cause login/logout and administrative events that\n     are performed on behalf of user “root” to be audited.  No failure events\n     are audited.  For the user “jdoe”, failed file creation events are\n     audited, administrative events are audited, and successful file write\n     events are never audited.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION NOTES\n     Per-user and global audit preselection configuration are evaluated at\n     time of login, so users must log out and back in again for audit changes\n     relating to preselection to take effect."
