The relief changes according to the select state, with a\n       traditionally sunken relief when selected.\n\n       The label has a specific tag, which can be used to retrieve the\n       coordinates of the object or move it, thanks to the canvas facilities.\n\n       stooop::new canvasLabel canvas ?options?\n\t      Creates a canvasLabel object in the specified Tk canvas. The\n\t      canvasLabel object identifier is returned (referred to as\n\t      canvasLabelObject in this document).\n\n       switched::configure canvasLabelObject ?options?\n\t      Configures a canvasLabel object or returns all the options with\n\t      their current values if no options are passed as parameters.\n\n       switched::cget canvasLabelObject option\n\t      Returns an option value for the specified canvasLabel object.\n\n       stooop::delete canvasLabelObject\n\t      Deletes the specified canvasLabel object.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -anchor value\n\t      Specifies the anchor position of the rectangle and the text,\n\t      relative to the positioning point. The behavior is similar to\n\t      the -anchor option of the canvas text item, except that the\n\t      rectangle is taken into account. The default is center.\n\n       -background color\n\t      Specifies the background color of the bullet rectangle, as in\n\t      the -fill option of the canvas rectangle item. The default is\n\t      transparent (empty string).\n\n       -bordercolor color\n\t      Specifies the border color of the rectangle, as in the -outline\n\t      option of the canvas rectangle item. The default is black.\n\n       -borderwidth value\n\t      Specifies the border width of the rectangle, as in the -width\n\t      option of the canvas rectangle item. By default, the width is 1\n\t      pixel, which is the minimum width.\n\n       -bulletwidth value\n\t      Specifies the width of the rectangle placed to the left of the\n\t      text. Defaults to 10.\n\n       -font value\n\t      Specifies the font of the text, as in the -font option of the\n\t      canvas text item. The default is system dependent.\n\n       -foreground color\n\t      Specifies the color of the text, as in the -fill option of the\n\t      canvas text item. The default is black.\n\n       -justify value\n\t      Specifies how to justify the text, as in the -justify option of\n\t      the canvas text item. The default is left.\n\n       -minimumwidth value\n\t      The total label width will not go below the specified value, but\n\t      may be larger if the label text requires it.\n\n       -padding value\n\t      Specifies how much space to leave between the text and the\n\t      closest rectangle edge. Units are identical to those specified\n\t      in the canvas COORDINATES manual section.\n\n       -scale list\n\t      List of 2 floating point numbers used to set the scaling factor\n\t      in the x and y axis. Scaling is applied immediately and defaults\n\t      to 1.\n\n       -select boolean\n\t      Sets the label state.\n\n       -selectrelief value\n\t      Either flat, raised or sunken. Specifies the 3D effect desired\n\t      for the text area when the label is selected.\n\n       -stipple bitmap\n\t      Specifies the stipple pattern filling the rectangle, as in the\n\t      -stipple option of the canvas rectangle item. There is no bitmap\n\t      by default.\n\n       -text text\n\t      Specifies the string to be displayed in the text area, as in the\n\t      -text option of the canvas text item. The default is an empty\n\t      string.\n\n       -textbackground color\n\t      Specifies the color of the text area background.\n\n       -width value\n\t      Specifies a maximum line length for the text, as in the -width\n\t      option of the canvas text item. The default is 0.\n\nTAGS\n       The labeler has the following specific tag (see the canvas manual page\n       ITEM IDS AND TAGS section for more information):\n\n       â€¢      canvasLabel(canvasLabelObject)\n\nSEE ALSO\n       pie, pieBoxLabeler, piePeripheralLabeler\n\nKEYWORDS\n       canvas, labeler, pie, slice\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 1995-2004 Jean-Luc Fontaine <jfontain@free.fr>"
