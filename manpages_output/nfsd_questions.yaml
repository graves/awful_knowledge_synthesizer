In order for a machine to act as an\n     NFS server an NFS exports file, /etc/exports, must exist and the nfsd\n     service must be enabled.\n\n     nfsd listens for NFS service requests at the port indicated in the NFS\n     server specification (2049) and the mountd thread listens for MOUNT\n     service requests at an available port registered with portmap(8).\n\n     For more information on the NFS and MOUNT protocols see Network File\n     System Protocol Specification, RFC1094 and NFS: Network File System\n     Version 3 Protocol Specification.\n\n     The nfsd daemon is a multi-threaded process that includes a number of\n     threads processing NFS requests, a thread to accept new socket\n     connections and a thread that processes NFS MOUNT protocol requests."

After changing the list of\n     exports (either directly or indirectly via a change in netgroup\n     membership), a hangup signal should be sent to the daemon to get it to\n     reload the export information.

A verbose level of two will increase the\n     log level to LOG_INFO which includes logging successful mount attempts.\n     A log level of three or more will add LOG_DEBUG messages and cause\n     increasing amounts of debug information to be logged.
