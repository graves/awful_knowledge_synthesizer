It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands tar(1) and\n       compress(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS\n       systems).\n\n       A companion program (unzip(1L)) unpacks zip archives.  The zip and\n       unzip(1L) programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting\n       most PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6), and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can\n       work with archives produced by zip (with some exceptions, notably\n       streamed archives, but recent changes in the zip file standard may\n       facilitate better compatibility).  zip version 3.0 is compatible with\n       PKZIP 2.04 and also supports the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which\n       allow archives as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB\n       in some cases).\tzip also now supports bzip2 compression if the bzip2\n       library is included when zip is compiled.  Note that PKUNZIP 1.10\n       cannot extract files produced by PKZIP 2.04 or zip_3.0. You must use\n       PKUNZIP 2.04g or unzip_5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract them.\n\n       See the EXAMPLES section at the bottom of this page for examples of\n       some typical uses of zip.\n\n       Large Archives and Zip64. zip automatically uses the Zip64 extensions\n       when files larger than 4 GB are added to an archive, an archive\n       containing Zip64 entries is updated (if the resulting archive still\n       needs Zip64), the size of the archive will exceed 4 GB, or when the\n       number of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K.\tZip64 is also\n       used for archives streamed from standard input as the size of such\n       archives are not known in advance, but the option -fz- can be used to\n       force zip to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long as Zip64\n       extensions are not needed).  You must use a PKZIP 4.5 compatible unzip,\n       such as unzip_6.0 or later, to extract files using the Zip64\n       extensions.\n\n       In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard\n       encryption, or split archives created with the pause option may not be\n       compatible with PKZIP as data descriptors are used and PKZIP at the\n       time of this writing does not support data descriptors (but recent\n       changes in the PKWare published zip standard now include some support\n       for the data descriptor format zip uses)."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zip`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nMac OS X.  Though previous Mac versions had their own zip port, zip\n       supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and most Unix features\n       apply.  References to \"MacOS\" below generally refer to MacOS versions\n       older than OS X.  Support for some Mac OS features in the Unix Mac OS X\n       port, such as resource forks, is expected in the next zip release.\n\n\n       For a brief help on zip and unzip, run each without specifying any\n       parameters on the command line.\n\n\nUSE\n       The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution;\n       for archiving files; and for saving disk space by temporarily\n       compressing unused files or directories.\n\n       The zip program puts one or more compressed files into a single zip\n       archive, along with information about the files (name, path, date, time\n       of last modification, protection, and check information to verify file\n       integrity).  An entire directory structure can be packed into a zip\n       archive with a single command.  Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are\n       common for text files.  zip has one compression method (deflation) and\n       can also store files without compression.  (If bzip2 support is added,\n       zip can also compress using bzip2 compression, but such entries require\n       a reasonably modern unzip to decompress.  When bzip2 compression is\n       selected, it replaces deflation as the default method.)\tzip\n       automatically chooses the better of the two (deflation or store or, if\n       bzip2 is selected, bzip2 or store) for each file to be compressed.\n\n       Command format.\tThe basic command format is\n\n\t      zip options archive inpath inpath ...\n\n       where archive is a new or existing zip archive and inpath is a\n       directory or file path optionally including wildcards.  When given the\n       name of an existing zip archive, zip will replace identically named\n       entries in the zip archive (matching the relative names as stored in\n       the archive) or add entries for new names.  For example, if foo.zip\n       exists and contains foo/file1 and foo/file2, and the directory foo\n       contains the files foo/file1 and foo/file3, then:\n\n\t      zip -r foo.zip foo\n\n       or more concisely\n\n\t      zip -r foo foo\n\n       will replace foo/file1 in foo.zip and add foo/file3 to foo.zip.\tAfter\n       this, foo.zip contains foo/file1, foo/file2, and foo/file3, with\n       foo/file2 unchanged from before.\n\n       So if before the zip command is executed foo.zip has:\n\n\t       foo/file1 foo/file2\n\n       and directory foo has:\n\n\t       file1 file3\n\n       then foo.zip will have:\n\n\t       foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3\n\n       where foo/file1 is replaced and foo/file3 is new.\n\n       -@ file lists.  If a file list is specified as -@ [Not on MacOS], zip\n       takes the list of input files from standard input instead of from the\n       command line.  For example,\n\n\t      zip -@ foo\n\n       will store the files listed one per line on stdin in foo.zip.\n\n       Under Unix, this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction\n       with the find (1) command.  For example, to archive all the C source\n       files in the current directory and its subdirectories:\n\n\t      find . -name \"*.[ch]\" -print | zip source -@\n\n       (note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding\n       it).\n\n       Streaming input and output. zip will also accept a single dash (\"-\") as\n       the zip file name, in which case it will write the zip file to standard\n       output, allowing the output to be piped to another program. For\n       example:\n\n\t      zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\n\n       would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block\n       size for the purpose of backing up the current directory.\n\n       zip also accepts a single dash (\"-\") as the name of a file to be\n       compressed, in which case it will read the file from standard input,\n       allowing zip to take input from another program. For example:\n\n\t      tar cf - . | zip backup -\n\n       would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing\n       up the current directory. This generally produces better compression\n       than the previous example using the -r option because zip can take\n       advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored using\n       the command\n\n\t      unzip -p backup | tar xf -\n\n       When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal, zip acts\n       as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.  For\n       example,\n\n\t      tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\n\n       is equivalent to\n\n\t      tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\n\n       zip archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program\n       funzip which is provided in the unzip package, or by gunzip which is\n       provided in the gzip package (but some gunzip may not support this if\n       zip used the Zip64 extensions). For example:\n\n\t      dd if=/dev/nrst0\tibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -\n\n       The stream can also be saved to a file and unzip used.\n\n       If Zip64 support for large files and archives is enabled and zip is\n       used as a filter, zip creates a Zip64 archive that requires a PKZIP 4.5\n       or later compatible unzip to read it.  This is to avoid amgibuities in\n       the zip file structure as defined in the current zip standard (PKWARE\n       AppNote) where the decision to use Zip64 needs to be made before data\n       is written for the entry, but for a stream the size of the data is not\n       known at that point.  If the data is known to be smaller than 4 GB, the\n       option -fz- can be used to prevent use of Zip64, but zip will exit with\n       an error if Zip64 was in fact needed.  zip_3 and unzip_6 and later can\n       read archives with Zip64 entries.  Also, zip removes the Zip64\n       extensions if not needed when archive entries are copied (see the -U\n       (--copy) option).\n\n       When directing the output to another file, note that all options should\n       be before the redirection including -x.\tFor example:\n\n\t      zip archive \"*.h\" \"*.c\" -x donotinclude.h orthis.h > tofile\n\n       Zip files.  When changing an existing zip archive, zip will write a\n       temporary file with the new contents, and only replace the old one when\n       the process of creating the new version has been completed without\n       error.\n\n       If the name of the zip archive does not contain an extension, the\n       extension .zip is added. If the name already contains an extension\n       other than .zip, the existing extension is kept unchanged.  However,\n       split archives (archives split over multiple files) require the .zip\n       extension on the last split.\n\n       Scanning and reading files. When zip starts, it scans for files to\n       process (if needed).  If this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds,\n       zip will display a \"Scanning files\" message and start displaying\n       progress dots every 2 seconds or every so many entries processed,\n       whichever takes longer.\tIf there is more than 2 seconds between dots\n       it could indicate that finding each file is taking time and could mean\n       a slow network connection for example.  (Actually the initial file scan\n       is a two-step process where the directory scan is followed by a sort\n       and these two steps are separated with a space in the dots.  If\n       updating an existing archive, a space also appears between the existing\n       file scan and the new file scan.)  The scanning files dots are not\n       controlled by the -ds dot size option, but the dots are turned off by\n       the -q quiet option.  The -sf show files option can be used to scan for\n       files and get the list of files scanned without actually processing\n       them.\n\n       If zip is not able to read a file, it issues a warning but continues.\n       See the -MM option below for more on how zip handles patterns that are\n       not matched and files that are not readable.  If some files were\n       skipped, a warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how\n       many files were read and how many skipped.\n\n       Command modes.  zip now supports two distinct types of command modes,\n       external and internal.  The external modes (add, update, and freshen)\n       read files from the file system (as well as from an existing archive)\n       while the internal modes (delete and copy) operate exclusively on\n       entries in an existing archive.\n\n       add\n\t      Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive does\n\t      not exist create it.  This is the default mode.\n\n       update (-u)\n\t      Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new\n\t      files.  If the archive does not exist issue warning then create\n\t      a new archive.\n\n       freshen (-f)\n\t      Update existing entries of an archive if newer on the file\n\t      system.  Does not add new files to the archive.\n\n       delete (-d)\n\t      Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.\n\n       copy (-U)\n\t      Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new\n\t      archive.\tThis new mode is similar to update but command line\n\t      patterns select entries in the existing archive rather than\n\t      files from the file system and it uses the --out option to write\n\t      the resulting archive to a new file rather than update the\n\t      existing archive, leaving the original archive unchanged.\n\n       The new File Sync option (-FS) is also considered a new mode, though it\n       is similar to update.  This mode synchronizes the archive with the\n       files on the OS, only replacing files in the archive if the file time\n       or size of the OS file is different, adding new files, and deleting\n       entries from the archive where there is no matching file.  As this mode\n       can delete entries from the archive, consider making a backup copy of\n       the archive.\n\n       Also see -DF for creating difference archives.\n\n       See each option description below for details and the EXAMPLES section\n       below for examples.\n\n       Split archives.\tzip version 3.0 and later can create split archives.\n       A split archive is a standard zip archive split over multiple files.\n       (Note that split archives are not just archives split in to pieces, as\n       the offsets of entries are now based on the start of each split.\n       Concatenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets, but\n       unzip can usually deal with it.\tzip will usually refuse to process\n       such a spliced archive unless the -FF fix option is used to fix the\n       offsets.)\n\n       One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple\n       removable media.  For a split archive with 20 split files the files are\n       typically named (replace ARCHIVE with the name of your archive)\n       ARCHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19, ARCHIVE.zip.  Note that the\n       last file is the .zip file.  In contrast, spanned archives are the\n       original multi-disk archive generally requiring floppy disks and using\n       volume labels to store disk numbers.  zip supports split archives but\n       not spanned archives, though a procedure exists for converting split\n       archives of the right size to spanned archives.\tThe reverse is also\n       true, where each file of a spanned archive can be copied in order to\n       files with the above names to create a split archive.\n\n       Use -s to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is\n       given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB),\n       or t (TB) (the default is m).  The -sp option can be used to pause zip\n       between splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read\n       the descriptions and warnings for both -s and -sp below.\n\n       Though zip does not update split archives, zip provides the new option\n       -O (--output-file or --out) to allow split archives to be updated and\n       saved in a new archive.\tFor example,\n\n\t      zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip\n\n       reads archive inarchive.zip, even if split, adds the files foo.c and\n       bar.c, and writes the resulting archive to outarchive.zip.  If\n       inarchive.zip is split then outarchive.zip defaults to the same split\n       size.  Be aware that if outarchive.zip and any split files that are\n       created with it already exist, these are always overwritten as needed\n       without warning.  This may be changed in the future.\n\n       Unicode.  Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an archive\n       using a specific character set, in practice zips have stored paths in\n       archives in whatever the local character set is.  This creates problems\n       when an archive is created or updated on a system using one character\n       set and then extracted on another system using a different character\n       set.  When compiled with Unicode support enabled on platforms that\n       support wide characters, zip now stores, in addition to the standard\n       local path for backward compatibility, the UTF-8 translation of the\n       path.  This provides a common universal character set for storing paths\n       that allows these paths to be fully extracted on other systems that\n       support Unicode and to match as close as possible on systems that\n       don't.\n\n       On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but\n       represented in the local character set, it's possible that some paths\n       will be skipped during a local character set directory scan.  zip with\n       Unicode support now can read and store these paths.  Note that Win 9x\n       systems and FAT file systems don't fully support Unicode.\n\n       Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes\n       don't accurately show all characters due to how each operating system\n       switches in character sets for display.\tHowever, directory navigation\n       tools should show the correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.\n\n       Command line format.  This version of zip has updated command line\n       processing and support for long options.\n\n       Short options take the form\n\n\t      -s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][ value]\n\n       where s is a one or two character short option.\tA short option that\n       takes a value is last in an argument and anything after it is taken as\n       the value.  If the option can be negated and \"-\" immediately follows\n       the option, the option is negated.  Short options can also be given as\n       separate arguments\n\n\t      -s[-][value][=value][ value] -s[-][value][=value][ value] ...\n\n       Short options in general take values either as part of the same\n       argument or as the following argument.  An optional = is also\n       supported.  So\n\n\t      -ttmmddyyyy\n\n       and\n\n\t      -tt=mmddyyyy\n\n       and\n\n\t      -tt mmddyyyy\n\n       all work.  The -x and -i options accept lists of values and use a\n       slightly different format described below.  See the -x and -i options.\n\n       Long options take the form\n\n\t      --longoption[-][=value][ value]\n\n       where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can include\n       a trailing dash to negate the option (if the option supports it), and\n       can have a value (option argument) specified by preceeding it with =\n       (no spaces).  Values can also follow the argument.  So\n\n\t      --before-date=mmddyyyy\n\n       and\n\n\t      --before-date mmddyyyy\n\n       both work.\n\n       Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique abbreviation.\n       See the option descriptions below for which support long options.  To\n       avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating a negatable option with an embedded\n       dash (\"-\") at the dash if you plan to negate it (the parser would\n       consider a trailing dash, such as for the option --some-option using\n       --some- as the option, as part of the name rather than a negating\n       dash).  This may be changed to force the last dash in --some- to be\n       negating in the future.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a\n       --ascii\n\t      [Systems using EBCDIC] Translate file to ASCII format."

The resulting archive should be\n\t      valid, but any inconsistent entries will be left out.\n\n\t      When doubled as in -FF, the archive is scanned from the\n\t      beginning and zip scans for special signatures to identify the\n\t      limits between the archive members. The single -F is more\n\t      reliable if the archive is not too much damaged, so try this\n\t      option first.\n\n\t      If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you\n\t      must use -FF.  This is a change from zip_2.32, where the -F\n\t      option is able to read a truncated archive.  The -F option now\n\t      more reliably fixes archives with minor damage and the -FF\n\t      option is needed to fix archives where -F might have been\n\t      sufficient before.\n\n\t      Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly\n\t      transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair,\n\t      the -t option of unzip may show that some files have a bad CRC.\n\t      Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the\n\t      archive using the -d option of zip.\n\n\t      Note that -FF may have trouble fixing archives that include an\n\t      embedded zip archive that was stored (without compression) in\n\t      the archive and, depending on the damage, it may find the\n\t      entries in the embedded archive rather than the archive itself.\n\t      Try -F first as it does not have this problem.\n\n\t      The format of the fix commands have changed.  For example, to\n\t      fix the damaged archive foo.zip,\n\n\t\t     zip -F foo --out foofix\n\n\t      tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to the\n\t      new archive foofix.zip.  If this doesn't work, as when the\n\t      archive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in the\n\t      archive are missed, then try\n\n\t\t     zip -FF foo --out foofixfix\n\n\t      and compare the resulting archive to the archive created by -F.\n\t      The -FF option may create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on\n\t      what is damaged, you can then use the -F option to fix that\n\t      archive.\n\n\t      A split archive with missing split files can be fixed using -F\n\t      if you have the last split of the archive (the .zip file).

Obviously this second case will also\n\t      be obtained (without the 'I' option) if SparkFS isn't loaded.\n\n\n       -ic\n       --ignore-case\n\t      [VMS, WIN32] Ignore case when matching archive entries.  This\n\t      option is only available on systems where the case of files is\n\t      ignored.\tOn systems with case-insensitive file systems, case is\n\t      normally ignored when matching files on the file system but is\n\t      not ignored for -f (freshen), -d (delete), -U (copy), and\n\t      similar modes when matching against archive entries (currently\n\t      -f ignores case on VMS) because archive entries can be from\n\t      systems where case does matter and names that are the same\n\t      except for case can exist in an archive.\tThe -ic option makes\n\t      all matching case insensitive.  This can result in multiple\n\t      archive entries matching a command line pattern."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zip`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-j\n       --junk-paths\n\t      Store just the name of a saved file (junk the path), and do not\n\t      store directory names. By default, zip will store the full path\n\t      (relative to the current directory).\n\n\n       -jj\n       --absolute-path\n\t      [MacOS] record Fullpath (+ Volname). The complete path including\n\t      volume will be stored. By default the relative path will be\n\t      stored.\n\n\n       -J\n       --junk-sfx\n\t      Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the archive.\n\n       -k\n       --DOS-names\n\t      Attempt to convert the names and paths to conform to MSDOS,\n\t      store only the MSDOS attribute (just the user write attribute\n\t      from Unix), and mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though\n\t      it was not); for compatibility with PKUNZIP under MSDOS which\n\t      cannot handle certain names such as those with two dots.\n\n       -l\n       --to-crlf\n\t      Translate the Unix end-of-line character LF into the MSDOS\n\t      convention CR LF. This option should not be used on binary\n\t      files.  This option can be used on Unix if the zip file is\n\t      intended for PKUNZIP under MSDOS. If the input files already\n\t      contain CR LF, this option adds an extra CR. This is to ensure\n\t      that unzip -a on Unix will get back an exact copy of the\n\t      original file, to undo the effect of zip -l.  See -ll for how\n\t      binary files are handled.\n\n       -la\n       --log-append\n\t      Append to existing logfile.  Default is to overwrite.\n\n       -lf logfilepath\n       --logfile-path logfilepath\n\t      Open a logfile at the given path.  By default any existing file\n\t      at that location is overwritten, but the -la option will result\n\t      in an existing file being opened and the new log information\n\t      appended to any existing information.  Only warnings and errors\n\t      are written to the log unless the -li option is also given, then\n\t      all information messages are also written to the log.\n\n       -li\n       --log-info\n\t      Include information messages, such as file names being zipped,\n\t      in the log.  The default is to only include the command line,\n\t      any warnings and errors, and the final status.\n\n       -ll\n       --from-crlf\n\t      Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.  This option\n\t      should not be used on binary files.  This option can be used on\n\t      MSDOS if the zip file is intended for unzip under Unix.  If the\n\t      file is converted and the file is later determined to be binary\n\t      a warning is issued and the file is probably corrupted.  In this\n\t      release if -ll detects binary in the first buffer read from a\n\t      file, zip now issues a warning and skips line end conversion on\n\t      the file.  This check seems to catch all binary files tested,\n\t      but the original check remains and if a converted file is later\n\t      determined to be binary that warning is still issued.  A new\n\t      algorithm is now being used for binary detection that should\n\t      allow line end conversion of text files in UTF-8 and similar\n\t      encodings.\n\n       -L\n       --license\n\t      Display the zip license.\n\n       -m\n       --move\n\t      Move the specified files into the zip archive; actually, this\n\t      deletes the target directories/files after making the specified\n\t      zip archive. If a directory becomes empty after removal of the\n\t      files, the directory is also removed. No deletions are done\n\t      until zip has created the archive without error.\tThis is useful\n\t      for conserving disk space, but is potentially dangerous so it is\n\t      recommended to use it in combination with -T to test the archive\n\t      before removing all input files.\n\n       -MM\n       --must-match\n\t      All input patterns must match at least one file and all input\n\t      files found must be readable.  Normally when an input pattern\n\t      does not match a file the \"name not matched\" warning is issued\n\t      and when an input file has been found but later is missing or\n\t      not readable a missing or not readable warning is issued.  In\n\t      either case zip continues creating the archive, with missing or\n\t      unreadable new files being skipped and files already in the\n\t      archive remaining unchanged.  After the archive is created, if\n\t      any files were not readable zip returns the OPEN error code (18\n\t      on most systems) instead of the normal success return (0 on most\n\t      systems).  With -MM set, zip exits as soon as an input pattern\n\t      is not matched (whenever the \"name not matched\" warning would be\n\t      issued) or when an input file is not readable.  In either case\n\t      zip exits with an OPEN error and no archive is created.\n\n\t      This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped\n\t      so any missing or unreadable files will result in an error.  It\n\t      is less useful when used with wildcards, but zip will still exit\n\t      with an error if any input pattern doesn't match at least one\n\t      file and if any matched files are unreadable.  If you want to\n\t      create the archive anyway and only need to know if files were\n\t      skipped, don't use -MM and just check the return code.  Also -lf\n\t      could be useful.\n\n       -n suffixes\n       --suffixes suffixes\n\t      Do not attempt to compress files named with the given suffixes.\n\t      Such files are simply stored (0% compression) in the output zip\n\t      file, so that zip doesn't waste its time trying to compress\n\t      them.  The suffixes are separated by either colons or\n\t      semicolons.  For example:\n\n\t\t     zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo\n\n\t      will copy everything from foo into foo.zip, but will store any\n\t      files that end in .Z, .zip, .tiff, .gif, or .snd without trying\n\t      to compress them (image and sound files often have their own\n\t      specialized compression methods).  By default, zip does not\n\t      compress files with extensions in the list\n\t      .Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.  Such files are stored directly in\n\t      the output archive.  The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used\n\t      to change the default options. For example under Unix with csh:\n\n\t\t     setenv ZIPOPT \"-n .gif:.zip\"\n\n\t      To attempt compression on all files, use:\n\n\t\t     zip -n : foo\n\n\t      The maximum compression option -9 also attempts compression on\n\t      all files regardless of extension.\n\n\t      On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes (3\n\t      hex digit format). By default, zip does not compress files with\n\t      filetypes in the list DDC:D96:68E (i.e. Archives, CFS files and\n\t      PackDir files).\n\n       -nw\n       --no-wild\n\t      Do not perform internal wildcard processing (shell processing of\n\t      wildcards is still done by the shell unless the arguments are\n\t      escaped).  Useful if a list of paths is being read and no\n\t      wildcard substitution is desired.\n\n       -N\n       --notes\n\t      [Amiga, MacOS] Save Amiga or MacOS filenotes as zipfile\n\t      comments. They can be restored by using the -N option of unzip.\n\t      If -c is used also, you are prompted for comments only for those\n\t      files that do not have filenotes.\n\n       -o\n       --latest-time\n\t      Set the \"last modified\" time of the zip archive to the latest\n\t      (oldest) \"last modified\" time found among the entries in the zip\n\t      archive.\tThis can be used without any other operations, if\n\t      desired.\tFor example:\n\n\t      zip -o foo\n\n\t      will change the last modified time of foo.zip to the latest time\n\t      of the entries in foo.zip.\n\n       -O output-file\n       --output-file output-file\n\t      Process the archive changes as usual, but instead of updating\n\t      the existing archive, output the new archive to output-file.\n\t      Useful for updating an archive without changing the existing\n\t      archive and the input archive must be a different file than the\n\t      output archive.\n\n\t      This option can be used to create updated split archives.  It\n\t      can also be used with -U to copy entries from an existing\n\t      archive to a new archive.  See the EXAMPLES section below.\n\n\t      Another use is converting zip files from one split size to\n\t      another.\tFor instance, to convert an archive with 700 MB CD\n\t      splits to one with 2 GB DVD splits, can use:\n\n\t\t     zip -s 2g cd-split.zip --out dvd-split.zip\n\n\t      which uses copy mode.  See -U below.  Also:\n\n\t\t     zip -s 0 split.zip --out unsplit.zip\n\n\t      will convert a split archive to a single-file archive.\n\n\t      Copy mode will convert stream entries (using data descriptors\n\t      and which should be compatible with most unzips) to normal\n\t      entries (which should be compatible with all unzips), except if\n\t      standard encryption was used.  For archives with encrypted\n\t      entries, zipcloak will decrypt the entries and convert them to\n\t      normal entries.\n\n       -p\n       --paths\n\t      Include relative file paths as part of the names of files stored\n\t      in the archive.  This is the default.  The -j option junks the\n\t      paths and just stores the names of the files.\n\n       -P password\n       --password password\n\t      Use password to encrypt zipfile entries (if any).  THIS IS\n\t      INSECURE!  Many multi-user operating systems provide ways for\n\t      any user to see the current command line of any other user; even\n\t      on stand-alone systems there is always the threat of over-the-\n\t      shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext password as part of a\n\t      command line in an automated script is even worse.  Whenever\n\t      possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter\n\t      passwords.  (And where security is truly important, use strong\n\t      encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively\n\t      weak standard encryption provided by zipfile utilities.)\n\n       -q\n       --quiet\n\t      Quiet mode; eliminate informational messages and comment\n\t      prompts.\t(Useful, for example, in shell scripts and background\n\t      tasks).\n\n       -Qn\n       --Q-flag n\n\t      [QDOS] store information about the file in the file header with\n\t      n defined as\n\t      bit  0: Don't add headers for any file\n\t      bit  1: Add headers for all files\n\t      bit  2: Don't wait for interactive key press on exit\n\n       -r\n       --recurse-paths\n\t      Travel the directory structure recursively; for example:\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo.zip foo\n\n\t      or more concisely\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo foo\n\n\t      In this case, all the files and directories in foo are saved in\n\t      a zip archive named foo.zip, including files with names starting\n\t      with \".\", since the recursion does not use the shell's file-name\n\t      substitution mechanism.  If you wish to include only a specific\n\t      subset of the files in directory foo and its subdirectories, use\n\t      the -i option to specify the pattern of files to be included.\n\t      You should not use -r with the name \".*\", since that matches\n\t      \"..\" which will attempt to zip up the parent directory (probably\n\t      not what was intended).\n\n\t      Multiple source directories are allowed as in\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo foo1 foo2\n\n\t      which first zips up foo1 and then foo2, going down each\n\t      directory.\n\n\t      Note that while wildcards to -r are typically resolved while\n\t      recursing down directories in the file system, any -R, -x, and\n\t      -i wildcards are applied to internal archive pathnames once the\n\t      directories are scanned.\tTo have wildcards apply to files in\n\t      subdirectories when recursing on Unix and similar systems where\n\t      the shell does wildcard substitution, either escape all\n\t      wildcards or put all arguments with wildcards in quotes.\tThis\n\t      lets zip see the wildcards and match files in subdirectories\n\t      using them as it recurses.\n\n       -R\n       --recurse-patterns\n\t      Travel the directory structure recursively starting at the\n\t      current directory; for example:\n\n\t\t     zip -R foo \"*.c\"\n\n\t      In this case, all the files matching *.c in the tree starting at\n\t      the current directory are stored into a zip archive named\n\t      foo.zip.\tNote that *.c will match file.c, a/file.c and a/b/.c.\n\t      More than one pattern can be listed as separate arguments.  Note\n\t      for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is\n\n\t\t     pkzip -rP foo *.c\n\n\t      Patterns are relative file paths as they appear in the archive,\n\t      or will after zipping, and can have optional wildcards in them.\n\t      For example, given the current directory is foo and under it are\n\t      directories foo1 and foo2 and in foo1 is the file bar.c,\n\n\t\t     zip -R foo/*\n\n\t      will zip up foo, foo/foo1, foo/foo1/bar.c, and foo/foo2.\n\n\t\t     zip -R */bar.c\n\n\t      will zip up foo/foo1/bar.c.  See the note for -r on escaping\n\t      wildcards."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zip`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-RE\n       --regex\n\t      [WIN32]  Before zip 3.0, regular expression list matching was\n\t      enabled by default on Windows platforms.\tBecause of confusion\n\t      resulting from the need to escape \"[\" and \"]\" in names, it is\n\t      now off by default for Windows so \"[\" and \"]\" are just normal\n\t      characters in names.  This option enables [] matching again.\n\n\n       -s splitsize\n       --split-size splitsize\n\t      Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split\n\t      archive is an archive that could be split over many files.  As\n\t      the archive is created, if the size of the archive reaches the\n\t      specified split size, that split is closed and the next split\n\t      opened.  In general all splits but the last will be the split\n\t      size and the last will be whatever is left.  If the entire\n\t      archive is smaller than the split size a single-file archive is\n\t      created.\n\n\t      Split archives are stored in numbered files.  For example, if\n\t      the output archive is named archive and three splits are\n\t      required, the resulting archive will be in the three files\n\t      archive.z01, archive.z02, and archive.zip.  Do not change the\n\t      numbering of these files or the archive will not be readable as\n\t      these are used to determine the order the splits are read.\n\n\t      Split size is a number optionally followed by a multiplier.\n\t      Currently the number must be an integer.\tThe multiplier can\n\t      currently be one of k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), g (gigabytes),\n\t      or t (terabytes).  As 64k is the minimum split size, numbers\n\t      without multipliers default to megabytes.  For example, to\n\t      create a split archive called foo with the contents of the bar\n\t      directory with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning\n\t      on CDs, the command:\n\n\t\t     zip -s 670m -r foo bar\n\n\t      could be used.\n\n\t      Currently the old splits of a split archive are not excluded\n\t      from a new archive, but they can be specifically excluded.  If\n\t      possible, keep the input and output archives out of the path\n\t      being zipped when creating split archives.\n\n\t      Using -s without -sp as above creates all the splits where foo\n\t      is being written, in this case the current directory.  This\n\t      split mode updates the splits as the archive is being created,\n\t      requiring all splits to remain writable, but creates split\n\t      archives that are readable by any unzip that supports split\n\t      archives.  See -sp below for enabling split pause mode which\n\t      allows splits to be written directly to removable media.\n\n\t      The option -sv can be used to enable verbose splitting and\n\t      provide details of how the splitting is being done.  The -sb\n\t      option can be used to ring the bell when zip pauses for the next\n\t      split destination.\n\n\t      Split archives cannot be updated, but see the -O (--out) option\n\t      for how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a new\n\t      archive.\tA split archive can also be converted into a single-\n\t      file archive using a split size of 0 or negating the -s option:\n\n\t\t     zip -s 0 split.zip --out single.zip\n\n\t      Also see -U (--copy) for more on using copy mode.\n\n       -sb\n       --split-bell\n\t      If splitting and using split pause mode, ring the bell when zip\n\t      pauses for each split destination.\n\n       -sc\n       --show-command\n\t      Show the command line starting zip as processed and exit.  The\n\t      new command parser permutes the arguments, putting all options\n\t      and any values associated with them before any non-option\n\t      arguments.  This allows an option to appear anywhere in the\n\t      command line as long as any values that go with the option go\n\t      with it.\tThis option displays the command line as zip sees it,\n\t      including any arguments from the environment such as from the\n\t      ZIPOPT variable.\tWhere allowed, options later in the command\n\t      line can override options earlier in the command line.\n\n       -sf\n       --show-files\n\t      Show the files that would be operated on, then exit.  For\n\t      instance, if creating a new archive, this will list the files\n\t      that would be added.  If the option is negated, -sf-, output\n\t      only to an open log file.  Screen display is not recommended for\n\t      large lists.\n\n       -so\n       --show-options\n\t      Show all available options supported by zip as compiled on the\n\t      current system.  As this command reads the option table, it\n\t      should include all options.  Each line includes the short option\n\t      (if defined), the long option (if defined), the format of any\n\t      value that goes with the option, if the option can be negated,\n\t      and a small description.\tThe value format can be no value,\n\t      required value, optional value, single character value, number\n\t      value, or a list of values.  The output of this option is not\n\t      intended to show how to use any option but only show what\n\t      options are available.\n\n       -sp\n       --split-pause\n\t      If splitting is enabled with -s, enable split pause mode.  This\n\t      creates split archives as -s does, but stream writing is used so\n\t      each split can be closed as soon as it is written and zip will\n\t      pause between each split to allow changing split destination or\n\t      media.\n\n\t      Though this split mode allows writing splits directly to\n\t      removable media, it uses stream archive format that may not be\n\t      readable by some unzips.\tBefore relying on splits created with\n\t      -sp, test a split archive with the unzip you will be using.\n\n\t      To convert a stream split archive (created with -sp) to a\n\t      standard archive see the --out option.\n\n       -su\n       --show-unicode\n\t      As -sf, but also show Unicode version of the path if exists.\n\n       -sU\n       --show-just-unicode\n\t      As -sf, but only show Unicode version of the path if exists,\n\t      otherwise show the standard version of the path.\n\n       -sv\n       --split-verbose\n\t      Enable various verbose messages while splitting, showing how the\n\t      splitting is being done.\n\n       -S\n       --system-hidden\n\t      [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32 and ATARI] Include system and hidden files.\n\t      [MacOS] Includes finder invisible files, which are ignored\n\t      otherwise.\n\n       -t mmddyyyy\n       --from-date mmddyyyy\n\t      Do not operate on files modified prior to the specified date,\n\t      where mm is the month (00-12), dd is the day of the month\n\t      (01-31), and yyyy is the year.

For example:\n\n\t\t     zip -rt 12071991 infamy foo\n\n\t\t     zip -rt 1991-12-07 infamy foo\n\n\t      will add all the files in foo and its subdirectories that were\n\t      last modified on or after 7 December 1991, to the zip archive\n\t      infamy.zip.\n\n       -tt mmddyyyy\n       --before-date mmddyyyy\n\t      Do not operate on files modified after or at the specified date,\n\t      where mm is the month (00-12), dd is the day of the month\n\t      (01-31), and yyyy is the year.  The ISO_8601 date format\n\t      yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted.  For example:\n\n\t\t     zip -rtt 11301995 infamy foo\n\n\t\t     zip -rtt 1995-11-30 infamy foo\n\n\t      will add all the files in foo and its subdirectories that were\n\t      last modified before 30 November 1995, to the zip archive\n\t      infamy.zip.\n\n       -T\n       --test\n\t      Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails, the\n\t      old zip file is unchanged and (with the -m option) no input\n\t      files are removed.\n\n       -TT cmd\n       --unzip-command cmd\n\t      Use command cmd instead of 'unzip -tqq' to test an archive when\n\t      the -T option is used.  On Unix, to use a copy of unzip in the\n\t      current directory instead of the standard system unzip, could\n\t      use:\n\n\t       zip archive file1 file2 -T -TT \"./unzip -tqq\"\n\n\t      In cmd, {} is replaced by the name of the temporary archive,\n\t      otherwise the name of the archive is appended to the end of the\n\t      command.\tThe return code is checked for success (0 on Unix).\n\n       -u\n       --update\n\t      Replace (update) an existing entry in the zip archive only if it\n\t      has been modified more recently than the version already in the\n\t      zip archive.  For example:\n\n\t\t     zip -u stuff *\n\n\t      will add any new files in the current directory, and update any\n\t      files which have been modified since the zip archive stuff.zip\n\t      was last created/modified (note that zip will not try to pack\n\t      stuff.zip into itself when you do this).\n\n\t      Note that the -u option with no input file arguments acts like\n\t      the -f (freshen) option.\n\n       -U\n       --copy-entries\n\t      Copy entries from one archive to another.  Requires the --out\n\t      option to specify a different output file than the input\n\t      archive.\tCopy mode is the reverse of -d delete.\tWhen delete is\n\t      being used with --out, the selected entries are deleted from the\n\t      archive and all other entries are copied to the new archive,\n\t      while copy mode selects the files to include in the new archive.\n\t      Unlike -u update, input patterns on the command line are matched\n\t      against archive entries only and not the file system files.  For\n\t      instance,\n\n\t\t     zip inarchive \"*.c\" --copy --out outarchive\n\n\t      copies entries with names ending in .c from inarchive to\n\t      outarchive.  The wildcard must be escaped on some systems to\n\t      prevent the shell from substituting names of files from the file\n\t      system which may have no relevance to the entries in the\n\t      archive.\n\n\t      If no input files appear on the command line and --out is used,\n\t      copy mode is assumed:\n\n\t\t     zip inarchive --out outarchive\n\n\t      This is useful for changing split size for instance.  Encrypting\n\t      and decrypting entries is not yet supported using copy mode.\n\t      Use zipcloak for that.\n\n       -UN v\n       --unicode v\n\t      Determine what zip should do with Unicode file names.  zip_3.0,\n\t      in addition to the standard file path, now includes the UTF-8\n\t      translation of the path if the entry path is not entirely 7-bit\n\t      ASCII.  When an entry is missing the Unicode path, zip reverts\n\t      back to the standard file path.  The problem with using the\n\t      standard path is this path is in the local character set of the\n\t      zip that created the entry, which may contain characters that\n\t      are not valid in the character set being used by the unzip.\n\t      When zip is reading an archive, if an entry also has a Unicode\n\t      path, zip now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate the\n\t      standard path using the current local character set.\n\n\t      This option can be used to determine what zip should do with\n\t      this path if there is a mismatch between the stored standard\n\t      path and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard\n\t      path was updated).  In all cases, if there is a mismatch it is\n\t      assumed that the standard path is more current and zip uses\n\t      that.  Values for v are\n\n\t\t     q - quit if paths do not match\n\n\t\t     w - warn, continue with standard path\n\n\t\t     i - ignore, continue with standard path\n\n\t\t     n - no Unicode, do not use Unicode paths\n\n\t      The default is to warn and continue.\n\n\t      Characters that are not valid in the current character set are\n\t      escaped as #Uxxxx and #Lxxxxxx, where x is an ASCII character\n\t      for a hex digit.\tThe first is used if a 16-bit character number\n\t      is sufficient to represent the Unicode character and the second\n\t      if the character needs more than 16 bits to represent it's\n\t      Unicode character code.  Setting -UN to\n\n\t\t     e - escape\n\n\t      as in\n\n\t\t     zip archive -sU -UN=e\n\n\t      forces zip to escape all characters that are not printable 7-bit\n\t      ASCII.\n\n\t      Normally zip stores UTF-8 directly in the standard path field on\n\t      systems where UTF-8 is the current character set and stores the\n\t      UTF-8 in the new extra fields otherwise.\tThe option\n\n\t\t     u - UTF-8\n\n\t      as in\n\n\t\t     zip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8\n\n\t      forces zip to store UTF-8 as native in the archive.  Note that\n\t      storing UTF-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that\n\t      support it.  This option could be useful on Windows systems\n\t      where the escaped path is too large to be a valid path and the\n\t      UTF-8 version of the path is smaller, but native UTF-8 is not\n\t      backward compatible on Windows systems."

This should now work even if stdout\n\t      is redirected to a file, allowing easy saving of the information\n\t      for sending with bug reports to Info-ZIP.  The version screen\n\t      provides the help screen header with program name, version, and\n\t      release date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP home and\n\t      distribution sites, and shows information about the target\n\t      environment (compiler type and version, OS version, compilation\n\t      date and the enabled optional features used to create the zip\n\t      executable).\n\n       -V\n       --VMS-portable\n\t      [VMS] Save VMS file attributes.

The backslash avoids\n\t      the shell filename substitution, so that the name matching is\n\t      performed by zip at all directory levels.\n\n\t      Also possible:\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst\n\n\t      which will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while\n\t      excluding all the files that match the patterns in the file\n\t      exclude.lst.\n\n\t      The long option forms of the above are\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo foo --exclude \\*.o\n\n\t      and\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo foo --exclude @exclude.lst\n\n\t      Multiple patterns can be specified, as in:\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo foo -x \\*.o \\*.c\n\n\t      If there is no space between -x and the pattern, just one value\n\t      is assumed (no list):\n\n\t\t     zip -r foo foo -x\\*.o\n\n\t      See -i for more on include and exclude.\n\n       -X\n       --no-extra\n\t      Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2,\n\t      uid/gid and file times on Unix).\tThe zip format uses extra\n\t      fields to include additional information for each entry.\tSome\n\t      extra fields are specific to particular systems while others are\n\t      applicable to all systems.

The\n\t      comment is ended by a line containing just a period, or an end\n\t      of file condition (^D on Unix, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS).

Currently the main methods\n\t      supported by zip are store and deflate.  Compression method can\n\t      be set to:\n\n\t      store - Setting the compression method to store forces zip to\n\t      store entries with no compression.  This is generally faster\n\t      than compressing entries, but results in no space savings.  This\n\t      is the same as using -0 (compression level zero).\n\n\t      deflate - This is the default method for zip.  If zip determines\n\t      that storing is better than deflation, the entry will be stored\n\t      instead.\n\n\t      bzip2 - If bzip2 support is compiled in, this compression method\n\t      also becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently\n\t      support the bzip2 compression method, so test the unzip you will\n\t      be using before relying on archives using this method\n\t      (compression method 12).\n\n\t      For example, to add bar.c to archive foo using bzip2\n\t      compression:\n\n\t\t     zip -Z bzip2 foo bar.c\n\n\t      The compression method can be abbreviated:\n\n\t\t     zip -Zb foo bar.c\n\n       -#\n       (-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9)\n\t      Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit #,\n\t      where -0 indicates no compression (store all files), -1\n\t      indicates the fastest compression speed (less compression) and\n\t      -9 indicates the slowest compression speed (optimal compression,\n\t      ignores the suffix list). The default compression level is -6.\n\n\t      Though still being worked, the intention is this setting will\n\t      control compression speed for all compression methods.\n\t      Currently only deflation is controlled.\n\n       -!\n       --use-privileges\n\t      [WIN32] Use priviliges (if granted) to obtain all aspects of\n\t      WinNT security.\n\n       -@\n       --names-stdin\n\t      Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one\n\t      filename per line.\n\n       -$\n       --volume-label\n\t      [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32] Include the volume label for the drive\n\t      holding the first file to be compressed.\tIf you want to include\n\t      only the volume label or to force a specific drive, use the\n\t      drive name as first file name, as in:\n\n\t\t     zip -$ foo a: c:bar\n\nEXAMPLES\n       The simplest example:\n\n\t      zip stuff *\n\n       creates the archive stuff.zip (assuming it does not exist) and puts all\n       the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form (the .zip\n       suffix is added automatically, unless the archive name contains a dot\n       already; this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).\n\n       Because of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution, files\n       starting with \".\" are not included; to include these as well:\n\n\t      zip stuff .* *\n\n       Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current\n       directory.\n\n       To zip up an entire directory, the command:\n\n\t      zip -r foo foo\n\n       creates the archive foo.zip, containing all the files and directories\n       in the directory foo that is contained within the current directory.\n\n       You may want to make a zip archive that contains the files in foo,\n       without recording the directory name, foo.  You can use the -j option\n       to leave off the paths, as in:\n\n\t      zip -j foo foo/*\n\n       If you are short on disk space, you might not have enough room to hold\n       both the original directory and the corresponding compressed zip\n       archive.  In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the\n       -m option.  If foo contains the subdirectories tom, dick, and harry,\n       you can:\n\n\t      zip -rm foo foo/tom\n\t      zip -rm foo foo/dick\n\t      zip -rm foo foo/harry\n\n       where the first command creates foo.zip, and the next two add to it.\n       At the completion of each zip command, the last created archive is\n       deleted, making room for the next zip command to function.\n\n\n\n\n       Use -s to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is\n       given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB),\n       or t (TB).  The command\n\n\t      zip -s 2g -r split.zip foo\n\n       creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than\n       2 GB each.  If foo contained 5 GB of contents and the contents were\n       stored in the split archive without compression (to make this example\n       simple), this would create three splits, split.z01 at 2 GB, split.z02\n       at 2 GB, and split.zip at a little over 1 GB.\n\n       The -sp option can be used to pause zip between splits to allow\n       changing removable media, for example, but read the descriptions and\n       warnings for both -s and -sp below.\n\n       Though zip does not update split archives, zip provides the new option\n       -O (--output-file) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a\n       new archive.  For example,\n\n\t      zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip\n\n       reads archive inarchive.zip, even if split, adds the files foo.c and\n       bar.c, and writes the resulting archive to outarchive.zip.  If\n       inarchive.zip is split then outarchive.zip defaults to the same split\n       size.  Be aware that outarchive.zip and any split files that are\n       created with it are always overwritten without warning.\tThis may be\n       changed in the future."

           (include) options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using
           backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name expansion.
           In general, when zip encounters a name in the list of files to do, it
           first looks for the name in the file system.  If it finds it, it then
           adds it to the list of files to do.  If it does not find it, it looks
           for the name in the zip archive being modified (if it exists), using
           the pattern matching characters described above, if present.  For each
           match, it will add that name to the list of files to be processed,
           unless this name matches one given with the -x option, or does not
           match any name given with the -i option.

    BUGS
           zip 3.0 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use zip 1.1 to produce zip
           files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.

           zip files produced by zip 3.0 must not be updated by zip 1.1 or PKZIP
           1.10, if they contain encrypted members or if they have been produced
           in a pipe or on a non-seekable device. The old versions of zip or PKZIP
           would create an archive with an incorrect format.  The old versions can
           list the contents of the zip file but cannot extract it anyway (because
           of the new compression algorithm).  If you do not use encryption and
           use regular disk files, you do not have to care about this problem.

           Under VMS, not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.  Only
           stream-LF format zip files are expected to work with zip.  Others can
           be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program.  This version of zip
           handles some of the conversion internally.  When using Kermit to
           transfer zip files from VMS to MSDOS, type "set file type block" on
           VMS.  When transfering from MSDOS to VMS, type "set file type fixed" on
           VMS.  In both cases, type "set file type binary" on MSDOS.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zip`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nUnder some older VMS versions, zip may hang for file specifications\n       that use DECnet syntax foo::*.*.\n\n       On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an\n       exclamation mark or a hash sign.  This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the\n       32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.\tOther programs such as\n       GNU tar are also affected by this bug.\n\n       Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for\n       compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of\n       DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different\n       EA sizes when DIRing a file.  However, the structure layout returned by\n       the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo() is a bit different, it uses extra padding\n       bytes and link pointers (it's a linked list) to have all fields on\n       4-byte boundaries for portability to future RISC OS/2 versions.\n       Therefore the value reported by zip (which uses this 32-bit-mode size)\n       differs from that reported by DIR.  zip stores the 32-bit format for\n       portability, even the 16-bit MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3,\n       so even this one shows the 32-bit-mode size."

    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
           Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his Shrink.Pas program, which inspired this
           project, and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen; to Phil Katz
           for placing in the public domain the zip file format, compression
           format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for accepting minor changes to
           the file format; to Steve Burg for clarifications on the deflate
           format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid Broukhis for providing some
           useful ideas for the compression algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich
           Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark Adler for providing a mailing list and
           ftp site for the Info-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the
           Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the file infozip.who) without whose
           tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable zip would not have
           been possible.  Finally we should thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP
           moderator, David Kirschbaum, for getting us into this mess in the first
           place.  The manual page was rewritten for Unix by R. P. C. Rodgers and
           updated by E. Gordon for zip 3.0.
