It\n       also provides a few simple filter procedures as an illustrations of how\n       such filters can be implemented.\n\n       The purpose of this document is to describe the implemented procedures\n       and provide some examples of their usage. As there is ample literature\n       on the algorithms involved, we refer to relevant text books for more\n       explanations. We also refer to the original Wiki page on the subject\n       which describes some of the considerations behind the current\n       implementation.\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n       The two top-level procedures defined are\n\n       •      dft data-list\n\n       •      inverse_dft data-list\n\n       Both take a list of complex numbers and apply a Discrete Fourier\n       Transform (DFT) or its inverse respectively to these lists of numbers.\n       A \"complex number\" in this case is either (i) a pair (two element list)\n       of numbers, interpreted as the real and imaginary parts of the complex\n       number, or (ii) a single number, interpreted as the real part of a\n       complex number whose imaginary part is zero. The return value is always\n       in the first format. (The DFT generally produces complex results even\n       if the input is purely real.) Applying first one and then the other of\n       these procedures to a list of complex numbers will (modulo rounding\n       errors due to floating point arithmetic) return the original list of\n       numbers.\n\n       If the input length N is a power of two then these procedures will\n       utilize the O(N log N) Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. If input\n       length is not a power of two then the DFT will instead be computed\n       using a the naive quadratic algorithm.\n\n       Some examples:\n\n\t   % dft {1 2 3 4}\n\t   {10 0.0} {-2.0 2.0} {-2 0.0} {-2.0 -2.0}\n\t   % inverse_dft {{10 0.0} {-2.0 2.0} {-2 0.0} {-2.0 -2.0}}\n\t   {1.0 0.0} {2.0 0.0} {3.0 0.0} {4.0 0.0}\n\t   % dft {1 2 3 4 5}\n\t   {15.0 0.0} {-2.5 3.44095480118} {-2.5 0.812299240582} {-2.5 -0.812299240582} {-2.5 -3.44095480118}\n\t   % inverse_dft {{15.0 0.0} {-2.5 3.44095480118} {-2.5 0.812299240582} {-2.5 -0.812299240582} {-2.5 -3.44095480118}}\n\t   {1.0 0.0} {2.0 8.881784197e-17} {3.0 4.4408920985e-17} {4.0 4.4408920985e-17} {5.0 -8.881784197e-17}"

This is reflected in the variable names by Re_ and\n       Im_ prefixes.\n\n       The package includes two simple filters. They have an analogue\n       equivalent in a simple electronic circuit, a resistor and a capacitance\n       in series. Using these filters requires the math::complexnumbers\n       package.\n\nPROCEDURES\n       The public Fourier transform procedures are:\n\n       ::math::fourier::dft in_data\n\t      Determine the Fourier transform of the given list of complex\n\t      numbers.
