- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `sociallayerd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSOCIALLAYERD(8) \t    System Manager's Manual\t       SOCIALLAYERD(8)\n\nNAME\n     sociallayerd â€“ Vends privacy-sensitive social UI for display throughout\n     the system.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     takes no arguments, and users should not launch it manually.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     When sensitive social UI elements (such as contact photos and names) are\n     displayed in an application via SocialLayer.framework, that application\n     should not have access to the contents of those elements. In order to\n     protect users' private information, the actual layers for those elements\n     are generated by sociallayerd, while keeping them out of the app's\n     address space. CoreAnimation can then render the sensitive layers\n     together with the application layers.\n\nHISTORY\n     sociallayerd first appeared in macOS 12.0 and iOS 15.0\n\nDarwin\t\t\t       October 21, 2020 \t\t\tDarwin"
