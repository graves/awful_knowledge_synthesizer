Generally speaking, they implement algorithms\n       more complex or specialized than the ones provided by Tcl itself.\n\n       It exports only a single command, struct::list. All functionality\n       provided here can be reached through a subcommand of this command.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::struct::list longestCommonSubsequence sequence1 sequence2 ?maxOccurs?\n\t      Returns the longest common subsequence of elements in the two\n\t      lists sequence1 and sequence2. If the maxOccurs parameter is\n\t      provided, the common subsequence is restricted to elements that\n\t      occur no more than maxOccurs times in sequence2.\n\n\t      The return value is a list of two lists of equal length. The\n\t      first sublist is of indices into sequence1, and the second\n\t      sublist is of indices into sequence2.  Each corresponding pair\n\t      of indices corresponds to equal elements in the sequences; the\n\t      sequence returned is the longest possible.\n\n       ::struct::list longestCommonSubsequence2 sequence1 sequence2\n       ?maxOccurs?\n\t      Returns an approximation to the longest common sequence of\n\t      elements in the two lists sequence1 and sequence2.  If the\n\t      maxOccurs parameter is omitted, the subsequence computed is\n\t      exactly the longest common subsequence; otherwise, the longest\n\t      common subsequence is approximated by first determining the\n\t      longest common sequence of only those elements that occur no\n\t      more than maxOccurs times in sequence2, and then using that\n\t      result to align the two lists, determining the longest common\n\t      subsequences of the sublists between the two elements.\n\n\t      As with longestCommonSubsequence, the return value is a list of\n\t      two lists of equal length.  The first sublist is of indices into\n\t      sequence1, and the second sublist is of indices into sequence2.\n\t      Each corresponding pair of indices corresponds to equal elements\n\t      in the sequences.  The sequence approximates the longest common\n\t      subsequence.\n\n       ::struct::list lcsInvert lcsData len1 len2\n\t      This command takes a description of a longest common subsequence\n\t      (lcsData), inverts it, and returns the result. Inversion means\n\t      here that as the input describes which parts of the two\n\t      sequences are identical the output describes the differences\n\t      instead.\n\n\t      To be fully defined the lengths of the two sequences have to be\n\t      known and are specified through len1 and len2.\n\n\t      The result is a list where each element describes one chunk of\n\t      the differences between the two sequences. This description is a\n\t      list containing three elements, a type and two pairs of indices\n\t      into sequence1 and sequence2 respectively, in this order.  The\n\t      type can be one of three values:\n\n\t      added  Describes an addition. I.e. items which are missing in\n\t\t     sequence1 can be found in sequence2.  The pair of indices\n\t\t     into sequence1 describes where the added range had been\n\t\t     expected to be in sequence1. The first index refers to\n\t\t     the item just before the added range, and the second\n\t\t     index refers to the item just after the added range.  The\n\t\t     pair of indices into sequence2 describes the range of\n\t\t     items which has been added to it. The first index refers\n\t\t     to the first item in the range, and the second index\n\t\t     refers to the last item in the range.\n\n\t      deleted\n\t\t     Describes a deletion. I.e. items which are in sequence1\n\t\t     are missing from sequence2.  The pair of indices into\n\t\t     sequence1 describes the range of items which has been\n\t\t     deleted. The first index refers to the first item in the\n\t\t     range, and the second index refers to the last item in\n\t\t     the range.  The pair of indices into sequence2 describes\n\t\t     where the deleted range had been expected to be in\n\t\t     sequence2. The first index refers to the item just before\n\t\t     the deleted range, and the second index refers to the\n\t\t     item just after the deleted range.\n\n\t      changed\n\t\t     Describes a general change. I.e a range of items in\n\t\t     sequence1 has been replaced by a different range of items\n\t\t     in sequence2.  The pair of indices into sequence1\n\t\t     describes the range of items which has been replaced. The\n\t\t     first index refers to the first item in the range, and\n\t\t     the second index refers to the last item in the range.\n\t\t     The pair of indices into sequence2 describes the range of\n\t\t     items replacing the original range. Again the first index\n\t\t     refers to the first item in the range, and the second\n\t\t     index refers to the last item in the range."

The execution of any of the possible outer join\n\t      operation is triggered by the presence of either option -left,\n\t      -right, or -full. If none of these options is present a regular\n\t      inner join will be performed. This can also be triggered by\n\t      specifying -inner. The various possible join operations are\n\t      explained in detail in section TABLE JOIN.\n\n\t      If the -keys is present its argument is the name of a variable\n\t      to store the full list of found keys into. Depending on the\n\t      exact nature of the input table and the join mode the output\n\t      table may not contain all the keys by default. In such a case\n\t      the caller can declare a variable for this information and then\n\t      insert it into the output table on its own, as she will have\n\t      more information about the placement than this command.\n\n\t      What is left to explain is the format of the arguments.\n\n\t      The keycol arguments are the indices of the columns in the\n\t      tables which contain the key values to use for the joining. Each\n\t      argument applies to the table following immediately after it.\n\t      The columns are counted from 0, which references the first\n\t      column. The table associated with the column index has to have\n\t      at least keycol+1 columns. An error will be thrown if there are\n\t      less.\n\n\t      The table arguments represent a table or matrix of rows and\n\t      columns of values. We use the same representation as generated\n\t      and consumed by the methods get rect and set rect of matrix\n\t      objects. In other words, each argument is a list, representing\n\t      the whole matrix.  Its elements are lists too, each representing\n\t      a single rows of the matrix. The elements of the row-lists are\n\t      the column values.\n\n\t      The table resulting from the join operation is returned as the\n\t      result of the command. We use the same representation as\n\t      described above for the input tables.\n\n       ::struct::list dbJoinKeyed ?-inner|-left|-right|-full? ?-keys varname?\n       table...\n\t      The operations performed by this method are the same as\n\t      described above for dbJoin. The only difference is in the\n\t      specification of the keys to use. Instead of using column\n\t      indices separate from the table here the keys are provided\n\t      within the table itself. The row elements in each table are not\n\t      the lists of column values, but a two-element list where the\n\t      second element is the regular list of column values and the\n\t      first element is the key to use.\n\n       ::struct::list swap listvar i j\n\t      The subcommand exchanges the elements at the indices i and j in\n\t      the list stored in the variable named by listvar. The list is\n\t      modified in place, and also returned as the result of the\n\t      subcommand.\n\n       ::struct::list firstperm list\n\t      This subcommand returns the lexicographically first permutation\n\t      of the input list.\n\n       ::struct::list nextperm perm\n\t      This subcommand accepts a permutation of a set of elements\n\t      (provided by perm) and returns the next permutatation in\n\t      lexicographic sequence.\n\n\t      The algorithm used here is by Donal E. Knuth, see section\n\t      REFERENCES for details.\n\n       ::struct::list permutations list\n\t      This subcommand returns a list containing all permutations of\n\t      the input list in lexicographic order.\n\n       ::struct::list foreachperm var list body\n\t      This subcommand executes the script body once for each\n\t      permutation of the specified list. The permutations are visited\n\t      in lexicographic order, and the variable var is set to the\n\t      permutation for which body is currently executed. The result of\n\t      the loop command is the empty string.\n\nLONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE AND FILE COMPARISON\n       The longestCommonSubsequence subcommand forms the core of a flexible\n       system for doing differential comparisons of files, similar to the\n       capability offered by the Unix command diff.  While this procedure is\n       quite rapid for many tasks of file comparison, its performance degrades\n       severely if sequence2 contains many equal elements (as, for instance,\n       when using this procedure to compare two files, a quarter of whose\n       lines are blank.  This drawback is intrinsic to the algorithm used (see\n       the Reference for details).\n\n       One approach to dealing with the performance problem that is sometimes\n       effective in practice is arbitrarily to exclude elements that appear\n       more than a certain number of times.  This number is provided as the\n       maxOccurs parameter.  If frequent lines are excluded in this manner,\n       they will not appear in the common subsequence that is computed; the\n       result will be the longest common subsequence of infrequent elements.\n       The procedure longestCommonSubsequence2 implements this heuristic.  It\n       functions as a wrapper around longestCommonSubsequence; it computes the\n       longest common subsequence of infrequent elements, and then subdivides\n       the subsequences that lie between the matches to approximate the true\n       longest common subsequence.\n\nTABLE JOIN\n       This is an operation from relational algebra for relational databases.\n\n       The easiest way to understand the regular inner join is that it creates\n       the cartesian product of all the tables involved first and then keeps\n       only all those rows in the resulting table for which the values in the\n       specified key columns are equal to each other.\n\n       Implementing this description naively, i.e. as described above will\n       generate a huge intermediate result. To avoid this the cartesian\n       product and the filtering of row are done at the same time. What is\n       required is a fast way to determine if a key is present in a table. In\n       a true database this is done through indices. Here we use arrays\n       internally.\n\n       An outer join is an extension of the inner join for two tables. There\n       are three variants of outerjoins, called left, right, and full outer\n       joins. Their result always contains all rows from an inner join and\n       then some additional rows.\n\n       [1]    For the left outer join the additional rows are all rows from\n\t      the left table for which there is no key in the right table.\n\t      They are joined to an empty row of the right table to fit them\n\t      into the result.\n\n       [2]    For the right outer join the additional rows are all rows from\n\t      the right table for which there is no key in the left table.\n\t      They are joined to an empty row of the left table to fit them\n\t      into the result.\n\n       [3]    The full outer join combines both left and right outer join. In\n\t      other words, the additional rows are as defined for left outer\n\t      join, and right outer join, combined.\n\n       We extend all the joins from two to n tables (n > 2) by executing\n\n\t   (...((table1 join table2) join table3) ...) join tableN"
