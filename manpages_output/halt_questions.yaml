Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `halt`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nREBOOT(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t     REBOOT(8)\n\nNAME\n     halt, reboot – stopping and restarting the system\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     halt [-lNnq]\n     reboot [-lNnq]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The halt and reboot utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send\n     all running processes a SIGTERM (and subsequently a SIGKILL) and,\n     respectively, halt or restart the system.\tThe action is logged,\n     including entering a shutdown record into the user accounting database.\n\n     When the system is halted with the halt command, the system is powered\n     off.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -l      The halt or reboot is not logged to the system log.  This option\n\t     is intended for applications such as shutdown(8), that call halt\n\t     or reboot and log this themselves.\n\n     -N      The file system cache is not flushed during the initial process\n\t     clean-up, however the kernel level reboot(2) is still processed\n\t     with a sync.  This option can be useful for performing a\n\t     “best-effort” reboot when devices might be unavailable.  This can\n\t     happen when devices have been disconnected."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the halt and reboot commands?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the halt command to stop the system without logging the action?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how to perform a reboot that does not flush the file system cache but still processes the kernel-level reboot?
