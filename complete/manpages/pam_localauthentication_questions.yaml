The\n     blob will be queried by pam_get_data(3) as data named “token_la”.\n\n     When the LAContext instance is successfully created, the module will try\n     to evaluate “LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics” on it with\n     user interaction disabled. The expectation is that the policy was already\n     successfully evaluated before. If so, then the authentication performed\n     by this module will succeed as well.\n\n     The following options may be passed to this authentication module:\n\n     continuityunlock\n\t     Use the alternative LAContext for AppleWatch unlock. The\n\t     LAContext blob will be queried by pam_get_data(3) as data named\n\t     “token_lacont” and the policy evaluated will be\n\t     “LAPolicyContinuityUnlock”."
