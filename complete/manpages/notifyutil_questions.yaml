It may be used to post\n     notifications, detect and report notifications, and to examine and set\n     the state values associated with notification keys.\n\n     If notifyutil is used to monitor one or more notification keys, it prints\n     the notification key when the corresponding notification is received.\n     The -v (verbose) and -q (quiet) flags, if specified, modify the output\n     behavior.\n\n     The -v flag causes notifyutil to print a time stamp, the notification\n     key, the current state value for that key, and the type of the\n     notification (port, file, etc).  The -q flag supresses any output except\n     for state values fetched following a -g command."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `notifyutil`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nBy default, notifyutil uses mach port registration (using\n     notify_register_mach_port()) for keys given with a -w or -# flag.\tThe\n     -file command causes notifyutil to use notify_register_file_descriptor()\n     for any subsequent -w or -# registrations.  Similarly, -check causes\n     notifyutil to use notify_register_check() for subsequent registrations,\n     -signal switches to notify_register_signal(), and -dispatch causes it to\n     use notify_register_dispatch() for subsequent registrations.\n\n     If any registrations are made following the use of the -check command,\n     notifyutil will start a timer and check for shared memory notifications\n     every 100 milliseconds.  An alternate timer value may be set following\n     the -z flag.\n\n     The -M flag causes notifyutil to use multiplex all notifications over a\n     single mach connection with notifyd.  Notifications (except shared memory\n     notifications) are received and redistributed by a dispatch handler.\n\n     The -R flag causes notifyutil to regenerate all its registrations in the\n     unlikely event that notifyd restarts."

Setting\n     the state for a key that has no registrations has no effect.
