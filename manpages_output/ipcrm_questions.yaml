These System V IPC objects can be specified by\n     their creation ID or any associated key.\n\n     The following options are used to specify which IPC objects will be\n     removed.  Any number and combination of these options can be used:\n\n     -q msqid\n\t     Remove the message queue associated with the ID msqid from the\n\t     system.\n\n     -m shmid\n\t     Mark the shared memory segment associated with ID shmid for\n\t     removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last\n\t     detach.\n\n     -s semid\n\t     Remove the semaphore set associated with ID semid from the\n\t     system.\n\n     -Q msgkey\n\t     Remove the message queue associated with key msgkey from the\n\t     system."
