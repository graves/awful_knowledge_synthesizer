    Manpage text:

    The IPConfiguration agent is responsible for configuring and managing the
         IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on direct, connectionless interfaces such as
         ethernet and Wi-Fi.  The IPConfiguration agent is a program bundle that
         is loaded and executed by the configd(8) process.

         The IPConfiguration agent implements the client side of the DHCP and
         BOOTP protocols described in RFC951, RFC1542, RFC2131, and RFC2132.  It
         also assigns and maintains static IP addresses.  It may also allocate and
         assign a link-local IP address if DHCP fails to acquire an IP address.

         The IPConfiguration agent enables and controls the IPv6 SLAAC (RFC 4862)
         state in the kernel, and also handles statically configured IPv6
         addresses.  The agent implements the client side of the DHCPv6 protocol
         (RFC 3315) and supports both stateless and stateful operation.

         In all cases, the IPConfiguration agent performs IP address conflict
         detection before assigning an IP address to an interface.

This is only\n\t     useful for initial system start-up time synchronization for\n\t     legacy network services that are incapable of dealing with\n\t     dynamic network configuration changes.\n\n     getifaddr interface-name\n\t     Prints to standard output the IP address for the first network\n\t     service associated with the given interface.  The output will be\n\t     empty if no service is currently configured or active on the\n\t     interface.\n\n     ifcount\n\t     Prints the number of interfaces that IPConfiguration is capable\n\t     of configuring.  The value that's printed will not change unless\n\t     relevant network interfaces are either added to or removed from\n\t     the system.\n\n     getoption interface-name (option-name | option-code)\n\t     Prints the BOOTP/DHCP option with the given name or option code\n\t     integer value.  See bootpd(8) for option code names.  If an\n\t     option has multiple values e.g. domain_name_server, only the\n\t     first value is printed."
