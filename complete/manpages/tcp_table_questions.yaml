These tables are usually in dbm or db format.\n       Alternatively, table lookups can be directed to a TCP server.\n\n       To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix system supports\n       use the \"postconf -m\" command.\n\n       To test lookup tables, use the \"postmap -q\" command as described in the\n       SYNOPSIS above.\n\nPROTOCOL DESCRIPTION\n       The TCP map class implements a very simple protocol: the client sends a\n       request, and the server sends one reply. Requests and replies are sent\n       as one line of ASCII text, terminated by the ASCII newline character.\n       Request and reply parameters (see below) are separated by whitespace.\n\n       Send and receive operations must complete in 100 seconds.\n\nREQUEST FORMAT\n       Each request specifies a command, a lookup key, and possibly a lookup\n       result.\n\n       get SPACE key NEWLINE\n\t      Look up data under the specified key.\n\n       put SPACE key SPACE value NEWLINE\n\t      This request is currently not implemented.\n\nREPLY FORMAT\n       Each reply specifies a status code and text. Replies must be no longer\n       than 4096 characters including the newline terminator.\n\n       500 SPACE text NEWLINE\n\t      In case of a lookup request, the requested data does not exist.\n\t      In case of an update request, the request was rejected.  The\n\t      text describes the nature of the problem.\n\n       400 SPACE text NEWLINE\n\t      This indicates an error condition. The text describes the nature\n\t      of the problem. The client should retry the request later.\n\n       200 SPACE text NEWLINE\n\t      The request was successful. In the case of a lookup request, the\n\t      text contains an encoded version of the requested data.\n\nENCODING\n       In request and reply parameters, the character %, each non-printing\n       character, and each whitespace character must be replaced by %XX, where\n       XX is the corresponding ASCII hexadecimal character value. The\n       hexadecimal codes can be specified in any case (upper, lower, mixed).\n\n       The Postfix client always encodes a request.  The server may omit the\n       encoding as long as the reply is guaranteed to not contain the % or\n       NEWLINE character.\n\nSECURITY\n       Do not use TCP lookup tables for security critical purposes.  The\n       client-server connection is not protected and the server is not\n       authenticated.\n\nBUGS\n       Only the lookup method is currently implemented.\n\n       The client does not hang up when the connection is idle for a long\n       time.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       postmap(1), Postfix lookup table manager\n       regexp_table(5), format of regular expression tables\n       pcre_table(5), format of PCRE tables\n       cidr_table(5), format of CIDR tables\n\nREADME FILES\n       Use \"postconf readme_directory\" or \"postconf html_directory\" to locate\n       this information.\n       DATABASE_README, Postfix lookup table overview\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the tcp_table resource?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the tcp_table to test a lookup table for a specific key-value pair?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using tcp_table to perform a lookup operation with encoded parameters?
