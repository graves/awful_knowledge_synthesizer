It can only handle multiplicative or\n     affine scale changes.\n\n     units can work interactively by prompting the user for input (see\n     EXAMPLES) or non-interactively, providing a conversion for given\n     arguments from and to.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -e, --exponential\n\t      Same as -o %6e (see the description of the -o flag).\n\n     -f unitsfile, --file unitsfile\n\t      Specify the name of the units data file to load.\tThis option\n\t      may be specified multiple times.\n\n     -H historyfile, --history historyfile\n\t      Ignored, for compatibility with GNU units.\n\n     -h, --help\n\t      Show an overview of options.\n\n     -o format, --output-format format\n\t      Select the output format string by which numbers are printed.\n\t      Defaults to “%.8g”."

    HISTORY
         The units first appeared in NetBSD and was ported to FreeBSD 2.2.0.

         The manual page was significantly rewritten in FreeBSD 13.0 by Mateusz
         Piotrowski <0mp@FreeBSD.org>.

    AUTHORS
         Adrian Mariano <adrian@cam.cornell.edu>

    BUGS
         The effect of including a “/” in a prefix is surprising.

         Exponents entered by the user can be only one digit.  You can work around
         this by multiplying several terms.

         The user must use “|” to indicate division of numbers and “/” to indicate
         division of symbols.  This distinction should not be necessary.

         The program contains various arbitrary limits on the length of the units
         converted and on the length of the data file.

         The program should use a hash table to store units so that it does not
         take so long to load the units list and check for duplication.

         It is not possible to convert a negative value.

         The units program does not handle reductions of long lists of units very
         well:
