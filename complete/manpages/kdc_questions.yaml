When it starts, it first checks the\n     flags passed, any options that are not specified with a command line flag\n     are taken from a config file, or from a default compiled-in value.\n\n     Options supported:\n\n     -c file, --config-file=file\n\t     Specifies the location of the config file, the default is\n\t     /var/heimdal/kdc.conf.  This is the only value that can't be\n\t     specified in the config file.\n\n     -p, --no-require-preauth\n\t     Turn off the requirement for pre-autentication in the initial AS-\n\t     REQ for all principals.  The use of pre-authentication makes it\n\t     more difficult to do offline password attacks.  You might want to\n\t     turn it off if you have clients that don't support pre-\n\t     authentication.  Since the version 4 protocol doesn't support any\n\t     pre-authentication, serving version 4 clients is just about the\n\t     same as not requiring pre-athentication.  The default is to\n\t     require pre-authentication.  Adding the require-preauth per\n\t     principal is a more flexible way of handling this."
