It uses kadmin to add service principals to the KDC\n     database and create the krb5.keytab file. And then edits/creates the\n     config files of the given service to use the proper service principal.\n     krbservicesetup knows how to configure the FTP, AFP, POP, IMAP, SMTP and\n     SSH services shipped by Apple in Mac OS X 10.3 krbservicesetup takes\n     either a service_type, service_principal pair or a plist file with a list\n     of services to configure. The plist file also allows more control over\n     the options used when creating the principals.\n\n     krbservicesetup arguments:\n\n     -x       Use kadmin.local instead of kadmin."
