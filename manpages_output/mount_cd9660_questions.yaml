This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot\n     time.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -e      Enable the use of extended attributes.\n\n     -g      Do not strip version numbers on files.  (By default, if there are\n\t     files with different version numbers on the disk, only the last\n\t     one will be listed.)  In either case, files may be opened without\n\t     explicitly stating a version number.\n\n     -j      Do not use any Joliet extensions included in the filesystem.\n\n     -o      Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma\n\t     separated string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for\n\t     possible options and their meanings."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use mount_cd9660 to mount an ISO-9660 filesystem with extended attributes enabled and the Joliet extensions disabled?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using mount_cd9660 to mount a CD-ROM device at /mnt/cdrom with the option to preserve file version numbers?

Normally, if the underlying\n\t     device is a CD-ROM drive, mount_cd9660 will try to figure out the\n\t     last track from the CD-ROM containing data, and start the\n\t     filesystem there.\tIf the device is not a CD-ROM, or the table of\n\t     contents cannot be examined, the filesystem will be started at\n\t     sector 0.\tThis option can be used to override the behaviour.\n\t     Note that startsector is measured in CD-ROM blocks, with 2048\n\t     bytes each.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     mount(2), unmount(2), fstab(5), mount(8)\n\nBUGS\n     POSIX device node mapping is currently not supported.\n\n     Version numbers are not stripped if Rockridge extensions are in use.  In\n     this case, accessing files that don't have Rockridge names without\n     version numbers gets the one with the lowest version number and not the\n     one with the highest.\n\n     There is no ECMA support."
