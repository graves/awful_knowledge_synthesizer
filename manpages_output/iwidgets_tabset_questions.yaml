A value of 0 with angle set to\n\t      0 results in square tabs. A bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab\n\t      will be drawn with angled corners that cut in 4 pixels from the\n\t      edge of the tab. The default is 0.\n\n       Name:\t       command\n       Class:\t       Command\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -command\n       Specifes the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke to change the view in the\n       widget associated with the tabset. When a user selects a tab, a Tcl command\n       is invoked. The actual command consists of this option followed by a space\n       and a number. The number is the numerical index of the tab that has been\n       selected.\n\n       Name:\t       equalTabs\n       Class:\t       EqualTabs\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -equaltabs\n\n\t      Specifies whether to force tabs to be equal sized or not. A\n\t      value of true means constrain tabs to be equal sized. A value of\n\t      false allows each tab to size based on the text label size. The\n\t      value may have any of the forms accepted by the Tcl_GetBoolean,\n\t      such as true, false, 0, 1, yes, or no.\n\n\t      For horizontally positioned tabs (tabPos is either s or n), true\n\t      forces all tabs to be equal width (the width being equal to the\n\t      longest label plus any padX specified). Horizontal tabs are\n\t      always equal in height.\n\n\t      For vertically positioned tabs (tabPos is either w or e), true\n\t      forces all tabs to be equal height (the height being equal to\n\t      the height of the label with the largest font). Vertically\n\t      oriented tabs are always equal in width.\n\n       Name:\t       gap\n       Class:\t       Gap\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -gap\n\n\t      Specifies the amount of pixel space to place between each tab.\n\t      Value may be any pixel offset value. In addition, a special\n\t      keyword overlap can be used as the value to achieve a standard\n\t      overlap of tabs. This value may have any of the forms acceptable\n\t      to Tk_GetPixels.\n\n       Name:\t       margin\n       Class:\t       Margin\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -margin\n\n\t      Specifies the amount of space to place between the outside edge\n\t      of the tabset and the outside edge of its tabs. If tabPos is s,\n\t      this is the amount of space between the bottom edge of the\n\t      tabset and the bottom edge of the set of tabs. If tabPos is n,\n\t      this is the amount of space between the top edge of the tabset\n\t      and the top edge of the set of tabs. If tabPos is e, this is the\n\t      amount of space between the right edge of the tabset and the\n\t      right edge of the set of tabs.  If tabPos is w, this is the\n\t      amount of space between the left edge of the tabset and the left\n\t      edge of the set of tabs. This value may have any of the forms\n\t      acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\n\n       Name:\t       padX\n       Class:\t       PadX\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -padx\n\n\t      Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space\n\t      to request for a tab around its label in the X-direction. When\n\t      computing how large a window it needs, the tab will add this\n\t      amount to the width it would normally need The tab will end up\n\t      with extra internal space to the left and right of its text\n\t      label. This value may have any of the forms acceptable to\n\t      Tk_GetPixels.\n\n       Name:\t       padY\n       Class:\t       PadY\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -pady\n\n\t      Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space\n\t      to request for a tab around its label in the Y-direction. When\n\t      computing how large a window it needs, the tab will add this\n\t      amount to the height it would normally need The tab will end up\n\t      with extra internal space to the top and bottom of its text\n\t      label. This value may have any of the forms acceptable to\n\t      Tk_GetPixels.\n\n       Name:\t       raiseSelect\n       Class:\t       RaiseSelect\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -raiseselect\n\n\t      Specifes whether to slightly raise the selected tab from the\n\t      rest of the tabs. The selected tab is drawn 2 pixels closer to\n\t      the outside edge of the tabset than the unselected tabs. A value\n\t      of true says to raise selected tabs, a value of false turns this\n\t      off. The default is false. The value may have any of the forms\n\t      accepted by the Tcl_GetBoolean, such as true, false, 0, 1, yes,\n\t      or no.\n\n       Name:\t       start\n       Class:\t       Start\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -start\n\n\t      Specifies the amount of space to place between the left or top\n\t      edge of the tabset and the starting edge of its tabs. For\n\t      horizontally positioned tabs, this is the amount of space\n\t      between the left edge of the tabset and the left edge of the\n\t      first tab. For vertically positioned tabs, this is the amount of\n\t      space between the top of the tabset and the top of the first\n\t      tab. This value may change if the user performs a MButton-2\n\t      scroll on the tabs. This value may have any of the forms\n\t      acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.\n\n       Name:\t       state\n       Class:\t       State\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -state\n\n\t      Sets the active state of the tabset. Specifying normal allows\n\t      all tabs to be selectable. Specifying disabled disables the\n\t      tabset causing all tabs to be drawn in the disabledForeground\n\t      color.\n\n       Name:\t       tabBorders\n       Class:\t       TabBorders\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -tabborders\n\n\t      Specifies whether to draw the borders of tabs that are not\n\t      selected.  Specifying true (the default) draws these borders,\n\t      specifying false draws only the border around the selected tab.\n\t      The value may have any of the forms accepted by the\n\t      Tcl_GetBoolean, such as true, false, 0, 1, yes, or no.\n\n       Name:\t       tabPos\n       Class:\t       TabPos\n       Command-Line Switch:\t      -tabpos\n\n\t      Specifies the location of the set of tabs in relation to another\n\t      widget. Must be n, s, e, or w. Defaults to s. North tabs open\n\t      downward, South tabs open upward. West tabs open to the right,\n\t      east tabs open to the left.\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The iwidgets::tabset command creates a new window (given by the\n       pathName argument) and makes it into a tabset widget. Additional\n       options, described above may be specified on the command line or in the\n       option database to configure aspects of the tabset such as its colors,\n       font, and text. The iwidgets::tabset command returns its pathName\n       argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a\n       window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A tabset is a widget that contains a set of Tab buttons. It displays\n       these tabs in a row or column depending on it tabpos. When a tab is\n       clicked on, it becomes the only tab in the tab set that is selected.\n       All other tabs are deselected. The Tcl command prefix associated with\n       this tab (through the command tab configure option) is invoked with the\n       tab index number appended to its argument list. This allows the tabset\n       to control another widget such as a Notebook.\n\nTABS\n       Tabs are drawn to appear attached to another widget. The tabset draws\n       an edge boundary along one of its edges. This edge is known as the\n       attachment edge. This edge location is dependent on the value of\n       tabPos. For example, if tabPos is s, the attachment edge wil be on the\n       top side of the tabset (in order to attach to the bottom or south side\n       of its attached widget). The selected tab is draw with a 3d relief to\n       appear above the other tabs. This selected tab \"opens\" toward\n       attachment edge.\n\n       Tabs can be controlled in their location along the edges, the angle\n       that tab sides are drawn with, gap between tabs, starting margin of\n       tabs, internal padding around labels in a tab, the font, and its text\n       or bitmap.\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       The iwidgets::tabset command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget. It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n       Many of the widget commands for a tabset take as one argument an\n       indicator of which tab of the tabset to operate on. These indicators\n       are called indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:\n\n       number Specifies the tab numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first\n\t      tab in the tab set, 1 to the second, and so on.\n\n       select Specifies the currently selected tab's index. If no tab is\n\t      currently selected, the value -1 is returned.\n\n       end    Specifes the last tab in the tabset's index. If the tabset is\n\t      empty this will return -1.\n\n       pattern\n\t      If the index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms, then this\n\t      form is used. Pattern is pattern-matched against the label of\n\t      each tab in the tabset, in order from the first to the last tab,\n\t      until a matching entry is found. The rules of Tcl_StringMatch\n\t      are used.\n\n       The following commands are possible for tabset widgets:\n\n\t      pathName add ?option value option value ...?\n\t\t     Add a new tab at the end of the tabset. Returns the child\n\t\t     site pathName. If additional arguments are present, they\n\t\t     specify any of the following options:\n\n\t\t     -angle value\n\t\t\t    Specifes the angle of slope from the inner edge to\n\t\t\t    the outer edge of the tab. An angle of 0 specifies\n\t\t\t    square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees\n\t\t\t    inclusive. Default is 15 degrees. If this option\n\t\t\t    is specified as an empty string (the default),\n\t\t\t    then the angle option for the overall tabset is\n\t\t\t    used.\n\n\t\t     -background value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a background color to use for displaying\n\t\t\t    tabs when they are in their normal state\n\t\t\t    (unselected). If this option is specified as an\n\t\t\t    empty string (the default), then the background\n\t\t\t    option for the overall tabset is used.\n\n\t\t     -bevelamount value\n\t\t\t    Specifes the size of tab corners. A value of 0\n\t\t\t    with angle set to 0 results in square tabs. A\n\t\t\t    bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab will be drawn\n\t\t\t    with angled corners that cut in 4 pixels from the\n\t\t\t    edge of the tab. The default is 0. This is\n\t\t\t    generally only set at the tabset configuration\n\t\t\t    level. Tabs normally will want to share the same\n\t\t\t    bevelAmount.\n\n\t\t     -bitmap value\n\t\t\t    If label is a non-empty string, specifies a bitmap\n\t\t\t    to display in the tab. Bitmap may be of any of the\n\t\t\t    forms accepted by Tk_GetBitmap.\n\n\t\t     -disabledforeground value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying\n\t\t\t    tab labels when tabs are in their disable state.\n\t\t\t    If this option is specified as an empty string\n\t\t\t    (the default), then the disabledforeground option\n\t\t\t    for the overall tabset is used.\n\n\t\t     -font value\n\t\t\t    Specifies the font to use when drawing the label\n\t\t\t    on a tab. If this option is specified as an empty\n\t\t\t    string then the font option for the overall tabset\n\t\t\t    is used.\n\n\t\t     -foreground value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying\n\t\t\t    tab labels when tabs are in their normal\n\t\t\t    unselected state. If this option is specified as\n\t\t\t    an empty string (the default), then the foreground\n\t\t\t    option for the overall tabset is used.\n\n\t\t     -image value\n\t\t\t    If label is a non-empty string, specifies an image\n\t\t\t    to display in the tab. Image must have been\n\t\t\t    created with the image create command. Typically,\n\t\t\t    if the image option is specified then it overrides\n\t\t\t    other options that specify a bitmap or textual\n\t\t\t    value to display in the widget; the image option\n\t\t\t    may be reset to an empty string to re-enable a\n\t\t\t    bitmap or text display.\n\n\t\t     -label value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a text string to be placed in the tabs\n\t\t\t    label. If this value is set, the bitmap option is\n\t\t\t    overridden and this option is used instead. This\n\t\t\t    label serves as an additional identifier used to\n\t\t\t    reference the tab. This label may be used for the\n\t\t\t    index value in widget commands.\n\n\t\t     -selectbackground value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a background color to use for displaying\n\t\t\t    the selected tab. If this option is specified as\n\t\t\t    an empty string (the default), then the\n\t\t\t    selectBackground option for the overall tabset is\n\t\t\t    used.\n\n\t\t     -selectforeground value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying\n\t\t\t    the selected tab. If this option is specified as\n\t\t\t    an empty string (the default), then the\n\t\t\t    selectForeground option for the overall tabset is\n\t\t\t    used.\n\n\t\t     -padx value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much\n\t\t\t    extra space to request for a tab around its label\n\t\t\t    in the X-direction. When computing how large a\n\t\t\t    window it needs, the tab will add this amount to\n\t\t\t    the width it would normally need The tab will end\n\t\t\t    up with extra internal space to the left and right\n\t\t\t    of its text label. This value may have any of the\n\t\t\t    forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option\n\t\t\t    is specified as an empty string (the default),\n\t\t\t    then the padX option for the overall tabset is\n\t\t\t    used\n\n\t\t     -pady value\n\t\t\t    Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much\n\t\t\t    extra space to request for a tab around its label\n\t\t\t    in the Y-direction. When computing how large a\n\t\t\t    window it needs, the tab will add this amount to\n\t\t\t    the height it would normally need The tab will end\n\t\t\t    up with extra internal space to the top and bottom\n\t\t\t    of its text label. This value may have any of the\n\t\t\t    forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option\n\t\t\t    is specified as an empty string (the default),\n\t\t\t    then the padY option for the overall tabset is\n\t\t\t    used\n\n\t\t     -state value\n\t\t\t    Sets the state of the tab. Specifying normal\n\t\t\t    allows this tab to be selectable. Specifying\n\t\t\t    disabled disables the this tab causing its tab\n\t\t\t    label to be drawn in the disabledForeground color.\n\t\t\t    The tab will not respond to events until the state\n\t\t\t    is set back to normal.\n\n\t      pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t\t     Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\n\t\t     If no option is specified, returns a list describing all\n\t\t     of the available options for pathName (see\n\t\t     Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of this\n\t\t     list). If option is specified with no value, then the\n\t\t     command returns a list describing the one named option\n\t\t     (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist\n\t\t     of the value returned if no option is specified). If one\n\t\t     or more option-value pairs are specified, then the\n\t\t     command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t\t     given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty\n\t\t     string. Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t\t     iwidgets::tabset command.\n\n\t      pathName delete index1 ?index2?\n\t\t     Delete all of the tabs between index1 and index2\n\t\t     inclusive.  If index2 is omitted then it defaults to\n\t\t     index1. Returns an empty string.\n\n\t      pathName index index\n\t\t     Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.\n\n\t      pathName insert index ?option value option value ...?\n\t\t     Insert a new tab in the tabset before the tab specified\n\t\t     by index. The additional arguments are the same as for\n\t\t     the add command. Returns the tab's pathName.\n\n\t      pathName next\n\t\t     Advances the selected tab to the next tab (order is\n\t\t     determined by insertion order). If the currently selected\n\t\t     tab is the last tab in the tabset, the selection wraps\n\t\t     around to the first tab. It behaves as if the user\n\t\t     selected the next tab.\n\n\t      pathName tabconfigure index ?option? ?value?\n\t\t     This command is similar to the configure command, except\n\t\t     that it applies to the options for an individual tab,\n\t\t     whereas configure applies to the options for the tabset\n\t\t     as a whole. Options may have any of the values accepted\n\t\t     by the add widget command. If options are specified,\n\t\t     options are modified as indicated in the command and the\n\t\t     command returns an empty string. If no options are\n\t\t     specified, returns a list describing the current options\n\t\t     for tab index (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on\n\t\t     the format of this list).\n\n\t      pathName prev\n\t\t     Moves the selected tab to the previous tab (order is\n\t\t     determined by insertion order). If the currently selected\n\t\t     tab is the first tab in the tabset, the selection wraps\n\t\t     around to the last tab in the tabset. It behaves as if\n\t\t     the user selected the previous tab.\n\n\t      pathName select index\n\t\t     Selects the tab specified by index as the currently\n\t\t     selected tab. It behaves as if the user selected the new\n\t\t     tab."
