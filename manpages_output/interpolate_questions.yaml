This is mainly of theoretical interest,\n\t      because there is no guarantee about error bounds. One possible\n\t      use: if you need a line or a parabola through given points (it\n\t      will calculate the values, but not return the coefficients).\n\n\t      A variation is Neville's method which has better behaviour and\n\t      error bounds.\n\n       •      Spatial interpolation using a straightforward distance-weight\n\t      method. This procedure allows any number of spatial dimensions\n\t      and any number of dependent variables.\n\n       •      Interpolation in one dimension using cubic splines.\n\n       This document describes the procedures and explains their usage.\n\nPROCEDURES\n       The interpolation package defines the following public procedures:\n\n       ::math::interpolate::defineTable name colnames values\n\t      Define a table with one or two independent variables (the\n\t      distinction is implicit in the data). The procedure returns the\n\t      name of the table - this name is used whenever you want to\n\t      interpolate the values. Note: this procedure is a convenient\n\t      wrapper for the struct::matrix procedure. Therefore you can\n\t      access the data at any location in your program.\n\n\t      string name (in)\n\t\t     Name of the table to be created\n\n\t      list colnames (in)\n\t\t     List of column names\n\n\t      list values (in)\n\t\t     List of values (the number of elements should be a\n\t\t     multiple of the number of columns. See EXAMPLES for more\n\t\t     information on the interpretation of the data.\n\n\t\t     The values must be sorted with respect to the independent\n\t\t     variable(s)."
