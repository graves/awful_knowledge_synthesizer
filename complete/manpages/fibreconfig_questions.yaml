Note: Cannot be used in\n\t\t conjunction with -c option.\n\n     -c \t Defines the host port used for an operation. By default, if\n\t\t no other options are specified, fibreconfig will display\n\t\t information about the specified host port.\n\n     -a \t Sets the AL_PA for specified host port. The AL_PA must be one\n\t\t of the values defined in Table 1.1 located in the examples\n\t\t section.\n\n     -s \t Sets speed to [ 1gigabit, 2gigabit, 4gigabit, auto ] for\n\t\t specified host port.\n\n     -t \t Sets topology to [ nport, nlport, auto ] for specified host\n\t\t port.\n\n     -l \t Lists all known information about all nodes ( controllers,\n\t\t targets, and their LUNs )."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the fibreconfig tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use fibreconfig to set the speed of a host port to 4 gigabits per second?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using fibreconfig to list all information about all nodes, including controllers and targets?
