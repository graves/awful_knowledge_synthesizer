Please use the kmutil(8)\n     equivalent: kmutil unload.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The kextunload program is used to terminate and unregister I/O Kit\n     objects associated with a kernel extension (kext) and to unload the code\n     and personalities for that kext.  kextunload must run with superuser\n     privileges.\n\n     If another loaded kext has a dependency on the kext being unloaded, the\n     unload will fail.\tYou can determine whether a kext has dependents using\n     the kextstat(8) tool.\n\n     kextunload is a formal interface for unloading kexts in the Darwin OS and\n     in macOS.\tSoftware and installers can rely on its presence and invoke it\n     in order to unload kexts.\tNote that long options are present as of Mac\n     OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)."
