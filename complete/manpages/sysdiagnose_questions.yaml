A great deal of information is\n     harvested, spanning system state and configuration. The data is stored\n     /var/tmp directory.  sysdiagnose needs to be run as root. To cancel an\n     in-flight sysdiagnose triggered via command line interface, press Ctrl-\\.\n     sysdiagnose is automatically triggered when the following key chord is\n     pressed: Control-Option-Command-Shift-Period.\n\n   What sysdiagnose collects:\n\t   •   A spindump of the system\n\t   •   Several seconds of top output\n\t   •   Data about kernel zones\n\t   •   Status of loaded kernel extensions\n\t   •   Resident memory usage of user processes\n\t   •   Recent system logs\n\t   •   A System Profiler report\n\t   •   Recent crash reports\n\t   •   Disk usage information\n\t   •   I/O Kit registry information\n\t   •   Network status\n\t   •   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: list of\n\t       malloc-allocated buffers in the process's heap is collected\n\t   •   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about\n\t       unreferenced malloc buffers in the process's memory is\n\t       collected\n\t   •   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about\n\t       the virtual memory regions allocated in the process"
