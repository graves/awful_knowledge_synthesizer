This means that keys given to the\n       put subcommand must have this type.\n\n       This also sets the priority ordering. For key types -ascii and\n       -dictionary the data is sorted in ascending order (as with lsort\n       -increasing), thereas for -integer and -real the data is sorted in\n       descending order (as with lsort -decreasing).\n\n       Prioqueue names are unrestricted, but may be recognized as options if\n       no priority type is given.\n\n       ::struct::prioqueue ?-ascii|-dictionary|-integer|-real? ?prioqueueName?\n\t      The ::struct::prioqueue command creates a new prioqueue object\n\t      with an associated global Tcl command whose name is\n\t      prioqueueName. This command may be used to invoke various\n\t      operations on the prioqueue.  It has the following general form:\n\n       prioqueueName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t      option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\t      The following commands are possible for prioqueue objects:\n\n       prioqueueName clear\n\t      Remove all items from the prioqueue.\n\n       prioqueueName remove item\n\t      Remove the selected item from this priority queue.\n\n       prioqueueName destroy\n\t      Destroy the prioqueue, including its storage space and\n\t      associated command.\n\n       prioqueueName get ?count?\n\t      Return the front count items of the prioqueue (but not their\n\t      priorities) and remove them from the prioqueue.  If count is not\n\t      specified, it defaults to 1.  If count is 1, the result is a\n\t      simple string; otherwise, it is a list.  If specified, count\n\t      must be greater than or equal to 1.  If there are no or too few\n\t      items in the prioqueue, this command will throw an error.\n\n       prioqueueName peek ?count?\n\t      Return the front count items of the prioqueue (but not their\n\t      priorities), without removing them from the prioqueue.  If count\n\t      is not specified, it defaults to 1.  If count is 1, the result\n\t      is a simple string; otherwise, it is a list.  If specified,\n\t      count must be greater than or equal to 1.  If there are no or\n\t      too few items in the queue, this command will throw an error.\n\n       prioqueueName peekpriority ?count?\n\t      Return the front count items priority keys, without removing\n\t      them from the prioqueue.\tIf count is not specified, it defaults\n\t      to 1.  If count is 1, the result is a simple string; otherwise,\n\t      it is a list.  If specified, count must be greater than or equal\n\t      to 1.  If there are no or too few items in the queue, this\n\t      command will throw an error.\n\n       prioqueueName put item prio ?item prio ...?\n\t      Put the item or items specified into the prioqueue. prio must be\n\t      a valid priority key for this type of prioqueue, otherwise an\n\t      error is thrown and no item is added.  Items are inserted at\n\t      their priority ranking. Items with equal priority are added in\n\t      the order they were added.\n\n       prioqueueName size\n\t      Return the number of items in the prioqueue.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
