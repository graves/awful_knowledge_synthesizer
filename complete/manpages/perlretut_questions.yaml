    NAME
           perlretut - Perl regular expressions tutorial

    DESCRIPTION
           This page provides a basic tutorial on understanding, creating and
           using regular expressions in Perl.  It serves as a complement to the
           reference page on regular expressions perlre.  Regular expressions are
           an integral part of the "m//", "s///", "qr//" and "split" operators and
           so this tutorial also overlaps with "Regexp Quote-Like Operators" in
           perlop and "split" in perlfunc.

           Perl is widely renowned for excellence in text processing, and regular
           expressions are one of the big factors behind this fame.  Perl regular
           expressions display an efficiency and flexibility unknown in most other
           computer languages.  Mastering even the basics of regular expressions
           will allow you to manipulate text with surprising ease.

           What is a regular expression?  At its most basic, a regular expression
           is a template that is used to determine if a string has certain
           characteristics.  The string is most often some text, such as a line,
           sentence, web page, or even a whole book, but it doesn't have to be.
           It could be binary data, for example.  Biologists often use Perl to
           look for patterns in long DNA sequences.

We use the term pattern for it.  The process of looking\n       to see if the pattern occurs in the string is called matching, and the\n       \"=~\" operator along with the \"m//\" tell Perl to try to match the\n       pattern against the string.  Note that the pattern is also a string,\n       but a very special kind of one, as we will see.\tPatterns are in common\n       use these days; examples are the patterns typed into a search engine to\n       find web pages and the patterns used to list files in a directory,\n       e.g., \"\"ls *.txt\"\" or \"\"dir *.*\"\".  In Perl, the patterns described by\n       regular expressions are used not only to search strings, but to also\n       extract desired parts of strings, and to do search and replace\n       operations."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlretut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nRegular expressions have the undeserved reputation of being abstract\n       and difficult to understand.  This really stems simply because the\n       notation used to express them tends to be terse and dense, and not\n       because of inherent complexity.\tWe recommend using the \"/x\" regular\n       expression modifier (described below) along with plenty of white space\n       to make them less dense, and easier to read.  Regular expressions are\n       constructed using simple concepts like conditionals and loops and are\n       no more difficult to understand than the corresponding \"if\"\n       conditionals and \"while\" loops in the Perl language itself.\n\n       This tutorial flattens the learning curve by discussing regular\n       expression concepts, along with their notation, one at a time and with\n       many examples.  The first part of the tutorial will progress from the\n       simplest word searches to the basic regular expression concepts.  If\n       you master the first part, you will have all the tools needed to solve\n       about 98% of your needs.  The second part of the tutorial is for those\n       comfortable with the basics and hungry for more power tools.  It\n       discusses the more advanced regular expression operators and introduces\n       the latest cutting-edge innovations."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlretut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nA note: to save time, \"regular expression\" is often abbreviated as\n       regexp or regex.  Regexp is a more natural abbreviation than regex, but\n       is harder to pronounce.\tThe Perl pod documentation is evenly split on\n       regexp vs regex; in Perl, there is more than one way to abbreviate it.\n       We'll use regexp in this tutorial.\n\n       New in v5.22, \"use re 'strict'\" applies stricter rules than otherwise\n       when compiling regular expression patterns.  It can find things that,\n       while legal, may not be what you intended.\n\nPart 1: The basics\n   Simple word matching\n       The simplest regexp is simply a word, or more generally, a string of\n       characters.  A regexp consisting of just a word matches any string that\n       contains that word:\n\n\t   \"Hello World\" =~ /World/;  # matches\n\n       What is this Perl statement all about? \"Hello World\" is a simple\n       double-quoted string.  \"World\" is the regular expression and the \"//\"\n       enclosing \"/World/\" tells Perl to search a string for a match.  The\n       operator \"=~\" associates the string with the regexp match and produces\n       a true value if the regexp matched, or false if the regexp did not\n       match.  In our case, \"World\" matches the second word in \"Hello World\",\n       so the expression is true.  Expressions like this are useful in\n       conditionals:"

The sense of the match can\n       be reversed by using the \"!~\" operator:\n\n\t   if (\"Hello World\" !~ /World/) {\n\t       print \"It doesn't match\\n\";\n\t   }\n\t   else {\n\t       print \"It matches\\n\";\n\t   }\n\n       The literal string in the regexp can be replaced by a variable:\n\n\t   my $greeting = \"World\";\n\t   if (\"Hello World\" =~ /$greeting/) {\n\t       print \"It matches\\n\";\n\t   }\n\t   else {\n\t       print \"It doesn't match\\n\";\n\t   }\n\n       If you're matching against the special default variable $_, the \"$_ =~\"\n       part can be omitted:\n\n\t   $_ = \"Hello World\";\n\t   if (/World/) {\n\t       print \"It matches\\n\";\n\t   }\n\t   else {\n\t       print \"It doesn't match\\n\";\n\t   }\n\n       And finally, the \"//\" default delimiters for a match can be changed to\n       arbitrary delimiters by putting an 'm' out front:\n\n\t   \"Hello World\" =~ m!World!;\t# matches, delimited by '!'\n\t   \"Hello World\" =~ m{World};\t# matches, note the paired '{}'\n\t   \"/usr/bin/perl\" =~ m\"/perl\"; # matches after '/usr/bin',\n\t\t\t\t\t# '/' becomes an ordinary char"

The space character ' ' is treated\n       like any other character in a regexp and is needed to match in this\n       case.  The lack of a space character is the reason the third regexp\n       'oW' doesn't match.  The fourth regexp \"\"World \"\" doesn't match because\n       there is a space at the end of the regexp, but not at the end of the\n       string.\tThe lesson here is that regexps must match a part of the\n       string exactly in order for the statement to be true."

First of all, not all characters can be used \"as-\n       is\" in a match.\tSome characters, called metacharacters, are generally\n       reserved for use in regexp notation.  The metacharacters are\n\n\t   {}[]()^$.|*+?-#\\\n\n       This list is not as definitive as it may appear (or be claimed to be in\n       other documentation).  For example, \"#\" is a metacharacter only when\n       the \"/x\" pattern modifier (described below) is used, and both \"}\" and\n       \"]\" are metacharacters only when paired with opening \"{\" or \"[\"\n       respectively; other gotchas apply.\n\n       The significance of each of these will be explained in the rest of the\n       tutorial, but for now, it is important only to know that a\n       metacharacter can be matched as-is by putting a backslash before it:"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlretut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIn addition to the metacharacters, there are some ASCII characters\n       which don't have printable character equivalents and are instead\n       represented by escape sequences.  Common examples are \"\\t\" for a tab,\n       \"\\n\" for a newline, \"\\r\" for a carriage return and \"\\a\" for a bell (or\n       alert).\tIf your string is better thought of as a sequence of arbitrary\n       bytes, the octal escape sequence, e.g., \"\\033\", or hexadecimal escape\n       sequence, e.g., \"\\x1B\" may be a more natural representation for your\n       bytes.  Here are some examples of escapes:\n\n\t   \"1000\\t2000\" =~ m(0\\t2)   # matches\n\t   \"1000\\n2000\" =~ /0\\n20/   # matches\n\t   \"1000\\t2000\" =~ /\\000\\t2/ # doesn't match, \"0\" ne \"\\000\"\n\t   \"cat\"   =~ /\\o{143}\\x61\\x74/ # matches in ASCII, but a weird way\n\t\t\t\t\t# to spell cat\n\n       If you've been around Perl a while, all this talk of escape sequences\n       may seem familiar.

Just like double-quoted strings, the values of the variables in\n       the regexp will be substituted in before the regexp is evaluated for\n       matching purposes.  So we have:"

With the knowledge above you can already perform\n       searches with just about any literal string regexp you can dream up.\n       Here is a very simple emulation of the Unix grep program:\n\n\t   % cat > simple_grep\n\t   #!/usr/bin/perl\n\t   $regexp = shift;\n\t   while (<>) {\n\t       print if /$regexp/;\n\t   }\n\t   ^D\n\n\t   % chmod +x simple_grep\n\n\t   % simple_grep abba /usr/dict/words\n\t   Babbage\n\t   cabbage\n\t   cabbages\n\t   sabbath\n\t   Sabbathize\n\t   Sabbathizes\n\t   sabbatical\n\t   scabbard\n\t   scabbards\n\n       This program is easy to understand.  \"#!/usr/bin/perl\" is the standard\n       way to invoke a perl program from the shell.  \"$regexp = shift;\" saves\n       the first command line argument as the regexp to be used, leaving the\n       rest of the command line arguments to be treated as files.\n       \"while (<>)\" loops over all the lines in all the files.\tFor each line,\n       \"print if /$regexp/;\" prints the line if the regexp matches the line.\n       In this line, both \"print\" and \"/$regexp/\" use the default variable $_\n       implicitly."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlretut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWith all of the regexps above, if the regexp matched anywhere in the\n       string, it was considered a match.  Sometimes, however, we'd like to\n       specify where in the string the regexp should try to match.  To do\n       this, we would use the anchor metacharacters '^' and '$'.  The anchor\n       '^' means match at the beginning of the string and the anchor '$' means\n       match at the end of the string, or before a newline at the end of the\n       string.\tHere is how they are used:\n\n\t   \"housekeeper\" =~ /keeper/;\t # matches\n\t   \"housekeeper\" =~ /^keeper/;\t # doesn't match\n\t   \"housekeeper\" =~ /keeper$/;\t # matches\n\t   \"housekeeper\\n\" =~ /keeper$/; # matches\n\n       The second regexp doesn't match because '^' constrains \"keeper\" to\n       match only at the beginning of the string, but \"housekeeper\" has keeper\n       starting in the middle.\tThe third regexp does match, since the '$'\n       constrains \"keeper\" to match only at the end of the string.\n\n       When both '^' and '$' are used at the same time, the regexp has to\n       match both the beginning and the end of the string, i.e., the regexp\n       matches the whole string.  Consider\n\n\t   \"keeper\" =~ /^keep$/;      # doesn't match\n\t   \"keeper\" =~ /^keeper$/;    # matches\n\t   \"\"\t    =~ /^$/;\t      # ^$ matches an empty string\n\n       The first regexp doesn't match because the string has more to it than\n       \"keep\".\tSince the second regexp is exactly the string, it matches.\n       Using both '^' and '$' in a regexp forces the complete string to match,\n       so it gives you complete control over which strings match and which\n       don't.  Suppose you are looking for a fellow named bert, off in a\n       string by himself:\n\n\t   \"dogbert\" =~ /bert/;   # matches, but not what you want\n\n\t   \"dilbert\" =~ /^bert/;  # doesn't match, but ..\n\t   \"bertram\" =~ /^bert/;  # matches, so still not good enough\n\n\t   \"bertram\" =~ /^bert$/; # doesn't match, good\n\t   \"dilbert\" =~ /^bert$/; # doesn't match, good\n\t   \"bert\"    =~ /^bert$/; # matches, perfect\n\n       Of course, in the case of a literal string, one could just as easily\n       use the string comparison \"$string eq 'bert'\" and it would be more\n       efficient.   The  \"^...$\" regexp really becomes useful when we add in\n       the more powerful regexp tools below.\n\n   Using character classes\n       Although one can already do quite a lot with the literal string regexps\n       above, we've only scratched the surface of regular expression\n       technology.  In this and subsequent sections we will introduce regexp\n       concepts (and associated metacharacter notations) that will allow a\n       regexp to represent not just a single character sequence, but a whole\n       class of them.\n\n       One such concept is that of a character class.  A character class\n       allows a set of possible characters, rather than just a single\n       character, to match at a particular point in a regexp.  You can define\n       your own custom character classes.  These are denoted by brackets\n       \"[...]\", with the set of characters to be possibly matched inside.\n       Here are some examples:\n\n\t   /cat/;\t# matches 'cat'\n\t   /[bcr]at/;\t# matches 'bat, 'cat', or 'rat'\n\t   /item[0123456789]/;\t# matches 'item0' or ... or 'item9'\n\t   \"abc\" =~ /[cab]/;\t# matches 'a'\n\n       In the last statement, even though 'c' is the first character in the\n       class, 'a' matches because the first character position in the string\n       is the earliest point at which the regexp can match.\n\n\t   /[yY][eE][sS]/;\t# match 'yes' in a case-insensitive way\n\t\t\t\t# 'yes', 'Yes', 'YES', etc.\n\n       This regexp displays a common task: perform a case-insensitive match.\n       Perl provides a way of avoiding all those brackets by simply appending\n       an 'i' to the end of the match.\tThen \"/[yY][eE][sS]/;\" can be\n       rewritten as \"/yes/i;\".\tThe 'i' stands for case-insensitive and is an\n       example of a modifier of the matching operation.  We will meet other\n       modifiers later in the tutorial.\n\n       We saw in the section above that there were ordinary characters, which\n       represented themselves, and special characters, which needed a\n       backslash '\\' to represent themselves.  The same is true in a character\n       class, but the sets of ordinary and special characters inside a\n       character class are different than those outside a character class.\n       The special characters for a character class are \"-]\\^$\" (and the\n       pattern delimiter, whatever it is).  ']' is special because it denotes\n       the end of a character class.  '$' is special because it denotes a\n       scalar variable.  '\\' is special because it is used in escape\n       sequences, just like above.  Here is how the special characters \"]$\\\"\n       are handled:\n\n\t  /[\\]c]def/; # matches ']def' or 'cdef'\n\t  $x = 'bcr';\n\t  /[$x]at/;   # matches 'bat', 'cat', or 'rat'\n\t  /[\\$x]at/;  # matches '$at' or 'xat'\n\t  /[\\\\$x]at/; # matches '\\at', 'bat, 'cat', or 'rat'\n\n       The last two are a little tricky.  In \"[\\$x]\", the backslash protects\n       the dollar sign, so the character class has two members '$' and 'x'.\n       In \"[\\\\$x]\", the backslash is protected, so $x is treated as a variable\n       and substituted in double quote fashion.\n\n       The special character '-' acts as a range operator within character\n       classes, so that a contiguous set of characters can be written as a\n       range.  With ranges, the unwieldy \"[0123456789]\" and \"[abc...xyz]\"\n       become the svelte \"[0-9]\" and \"[a-z]\".  Some examples are\n\n\t   /item[0-9]/;  # matches 'item0' or ... or 'item9'\n\t   /[0-9bx-z]aa/;  # matches '0aa', ..., '9aa',\n\t\t\t   # 'baa', 'xaa', 'yaa', or 'zaa'\n\t   /[0-9a-fA-F]/;  # matches a hexadecimal digit\n\t   /[0-9a-zA-Z_]/; # matches a \"word\" character,\n\t\t\t   # like those in a Perl variable name\n\n       If '-' is the first or last character in a character class, it is\n       treated as an ordinary character; \"[-ab]\", \"[ab-]\" and \"[a\\-b]\" are all\n       equivalent.\n\n       The special character '^' in the first position of a character class\n       denotes a negated character class, which matches any character but\n       those in the brackets.  Both \"[...]\" and \"[^...]\" must match a\n       character, or the match fails.  Then\n\n\t   /[^a]at/;  # doesn't match 'aat' or 'at', but matches\n\t\t      # all other 'bat', 'cat, '0at', '%at', etc.\n\t   /[^0-9]/;  # matches a non-numeric character\n\t   /[a^]at/;  # matches 'aat' or '^at'; here '^' is ordinary\n\n       Now, even \"[0-9]\" can be a bother to write multiple times, so in the\n       interest of saving keystrokes and making regexps more readable, Perl\n       has several abbreviations for common character classes, as shown below.\n       Since the introduction of Unicode, unless the \"/a\" modifier is in\n       effect, these character classes match more than just a few characters\n       in the ASCII range.\n\n       •   \"\\d\" matches a digit, not just \"[0-9]\" but also digits from non-\n\t   roman scripts\n\n       •   \"\\s\" matches a whitespace character, the set \"[\\ \\t\\r\\n\\f]\" and\n\t   others\n\n       •   \"\\w\" matches a word character (alphanumeric or '_'), not just\n\t   \"[0-9a-zA-Z_]\" but also digits and characters from non-roman\n\t   scripts\n\n       •   \"\\D\" is a negated \"\\d\"; it represents any other character than a\n\t   digit, or \"[^\\d]\"\n\n       •   \"\\S\" is a negated \"\\s\"; it represents any non-whitespace character\n\t   \"[^\\s]\"\n\n       •   \"\\W\" is a negated \"\\w\"; it represents any non-word character\n\t   \"[^\\w]\"\n\n       •   The period '.' matches any character but \"\\n\" (unless the modifier\n\t   \"/s\" is in effect, as explained below).\n\n       •   \"\\N\", like the period, matches any character but \"\\n\", but it does\n\t   so regardless of whether the modifier \"/s\" is in effect.\n\n       The \"/a\" modifier, available starting in Perl 5.14,  is used to\n       restrict the matches of \"\\d\", \"\\s\", and \"\\w\" to just those in the ASCII\n       range.  It is useful to keep your program from being needlessly exposed\n       to full Unicode (and its accompanying security considerations) when all\n       you want is to process English-like text.  (The \"a\" may be doubled,\n       \"/aa\", to provide even more restrictions, preventing case-insensitive\n       matching of ASCII with non-ASCII characters; otherwise a Unicode\n       \"Kelvin Sign\" would caselessly match a \"k\" or \"K\".)\n\n       The \"\\d\\s\\w\\D\\S\\W\" abbreviations can be used both inside and outside of\n       bracketed character classes.  Here are some in use:\n\n\t   /\\d\\d:\\d\\d:\\d\\d/; # matches a hh:mm:ss time format\n\t   /[\\d\\s]/;\t     # matches any digit or whitespace character\n\t   /\\w\\W\\w/;\t     # matches a word char, followed by a\n\t\t\t     # non-word char, followed by a word char\n\t   /..rt/;\t     # matches any two chars, followed by 'rt'\n\t   /end\\./;\t     # matches 'end.'\n\t   /end[.]/;\t     # same thing, matches 'end.'\n\n       Because a period is a metacharacter, it needs to be escaped to match as\n       an ordinary period. Because, for example, \"\\d\" and \"\\w\" are sets of\n       characters, it is incorrect to think of \"[^\\d\\w]\" as \"[\\D\\W]\"; in fact\n       \"[^\\d\\w]\" is the same as \"[^\\w]\", which is the same as \"[\\W]\". Think\n       DeMorgan's laws.\n\n       In actuality, the period and \"\\d\\s\\w\\D\\S\\W\" abbreviations are\n       themselves types of character classes, so the ones surrounded by\n       brackets are just one type of character class.  When we need to make a\n       distinction, we refer to them as \"bracketed character classes.\"\n\n       An anchor useful in basic regexps is the word anchor \"\\b\".  This\n       matches a boundary between a word character and a non-word character\n       \"\\w\\W\" or \"\\W\\w\":\n\n\t   $x = \"Housecat catenates house and cat\";\n\t   $x =~ /cat/;    # matches cat in 'housecat'\n\t   $x =~ /\\bcat/;  # matches cat in 'catenates'\n\t   $x =~ /cat\\b/;  # matches cat in 'housecat'\n\t   $x =~ /\\bcat\\b/;  # matches 'cat' at end of string\n\n       Note in the last example, the end of the string is considered a word\n       boundary.\n\n       For natural language processing (so that, for example, apostrophes are\n       included in words), use instead \"\\b{wb}\"\n\n\t   \"don't\" =~ / .+? \\b{wb} /x;\t# matches the whole string\n\n       You might wonder why '.' matches everything but \"\\n\" - why not every\n       character? The reason is that often one is matching against lines and\n       would like to ignore the newline characters.  For instance, while the\n       string \"\\n\" represents one line, we would like to think of it as empty.\n       Then\n\n\t   \"\"\t=~ /^$/;    # matches\n\t   \"\\n\" =~ /^$/;    # matches, $ anchors before \"\\n\"\n\n\t   \"\"\t=~ /./;      # doesn't match; it needs a char\n\t   \"\"\t=~ /^.$/;    # doesn't match; it needs a char\n\t   \"\\n\" =~ /^.$/;    # doesn't match; it needs a char other than \"\\n\"\n\t   \"a\"\t=~ /^.$/;    # matches\n\t   \"a\\n\"  =~ /^.$/;  # matches, $ anchors before \"\\n\"\n\n       This behavior is convenient, because we usually want to ignore newlines\n       when we count and match characters in a line.  Sometimes, however, we\n       want to keep track of newlines.\tWe might even want '^' and '$' to\n       anchor at the beginning and end of lines within the string, rather than\n       just the beginning and end of the string.  Perl allows us to choose\n       between ignoring and paying attention to newlines by using the \"/s\" and\n       \"/m\" modifiers.\t\"/s\" and \"/m\" stand for single line and multi-line and\n       they determine whether a string is to be treated as one continuous\n       string, or as a set of lines.  The two modifiers affect two aspects of\n       how the regexp is interpreted: 1) how the '.' character class is\n       defined, and 2) where the anchors '^' and '$' are able to match.  Here\n       are the four possible combinations:\n\n       •   no modifiers: Default behavior.  '.' matches any character except\n\t   \"\\n\".  '^' matches only at the beginning of the string and '$'\n\t   matches only at the end or before a newline at the end.\n\n       •   s modifier (\"/s\"): Treat string as a single long line.  '.' matches\n\t   any character, even \"\\n\".  '^' matches only at the beginning of the\n\t   string and '$' matches only at the end or before a newline at the\n\t   end.\n\n       •   m modifier (\"/m\"): Treat string as a set of multiple lines.\t'.'\n\t   matches any character except \"\\n\".  '^' and '$' are able to match\n\t   at the start or end of any line within the string.\n\n       •   both s and m modifiers (\"/sm\"): Treat string as a single long line,\n\t   but detect multiple lines.  '.' matches any character, even \"\\n\".\n\t   '^' and '$', however, are able to match at the start or end of any\n\t   line within the string.\n\n       Here are examples of \"/s\" and \"/m\" in action:\n\n\t   $x = \"There once was a girl\\nWho programmed in Perl\\n\";\n\n\t   $x =~ /^Who/;   # doesn't match, \"Who\" not at start of string\n\t   $x =~ /^Who/s;  # doesn't match, \"Who\" not at start of string\n\t   $x =~ /^Who/m;  # matches, \"Who\" at start of second line\n\t   $x =~ /^Who/sm; # matches, \"Who\" at start of second line\n\n\t   $x =~ /girl.Who/;   # doesn't match, \".\" doesn't match \"\\n\"\n\t   $x =~ /girl.Who/s;  # matches, \".\" matches \"\\n\"\n\t   $x =~ /girl.Who/m;  # doesn't match, \".\" doesn't match \"\\n\"\n\t   $x =~ /girl.Who/sm; # matches, \".\" matches \"\\n\"\n\n       Most of the time, the default behavior is what is wanted, but \"/s\" and\n       \"/m\" are occasionally very useful.  If \"/m\" is being used, the start of\n       the string can still be matched with \"\\A\" and the end of the string can\n       still be matched with the anchors \"\\Z\" (matches both the end and the\n       newline before, like '$'), and \"\\z\" (matches only the end):\n\n\t   $x =~ /^Who/m;   # matches, \"Who\" at start of second line\n\t   $x =~ /\\AWho/m;  # doesn't match, \"Who\" is not at start of string\n\n\t   $x =~ /girl$/m;  # matches, \"girl\" at end of first line\n\t   $x =~ /girl\\Z/m; # doesn't match, \"girl\" is not at end of string\n\n\t   $x =~ /Perl\\Z/m; # matches, \"Perl\" is at newline before end\n\t   $x =~ /Perl\\z/m; # doesn't match, \"Perl\" is not at end of string\n\n       We now know how to create choices among classes of characters in a\n       regexp.\tWhat about choices among words or character strings? Such\n       choices are described in the next section.\n\n   Matching this or that\n       Sometimes we would like our regexp to be able to match different\n       possible words or character strings.  This is accomplished by using the\n       alternation metacharacter '|'.  To match \"dog\" or \"cat\", we form the\n       regexp \"dog|cat\".  As before, Perl will try to match the regexp at the\n       earliest possible point in the string.  At each character position,\n       Perl will first try to match the first alternative, \"dog\".  If \"dog\"\n       doesn't match, Perl will then try the next alternative, \"cat\".  If\n       \"cat\" doesn't match either, then the match fails and Perl moves to the\n       next position in the string.  Some examples:\n\n\t   \"cats and dogs\" =~ /cat|dog|bird/;  # matches \"cat\"\n\t   \"cats and dogs\" =~ /dog|cat|bird/;  # matches \"cat\"\n\n       Even though \"dog\" is the first alternative in the second regexp, \"cat\"\n       is able to match earlier in the string.\n\n\t   \"cats\"\t   =~ /c|ca|cat|cats/; # matches \"c\"\n\t   \"cats\"\t   =~ /cats|cat|ca|c/; # matches \"cats\"\n\n       Here, all the alternatives match at the first string position, so the\n       first alternative is the one that matches.  If some of the alternatives\n       are truncations of the others, put the longest ones first to give them\n       a chance to match.\n\n\t   \"cab\" =~ /a|b|c/ # matches \"c\"\n\t\t\t    # /a|b|c/ == /[abc]/\n\n       The last example points out that character classes are like\n       alternations of characters.  At a given character position, the first\n       alternative that allows the regexp match to succeed will be the one\n       that matches.\n\n   Grouping things and hierarchical matching\n       Alternation allows a regexp to choose among alternatives, but by itself\n       it is unsatisfying.  The reason is that each alternative is a whole\n       regexp, but sometime we want alternatives for just part of a regexp.\n       For instance, suppose we want to search for housecats or housekeepers.\n       The regexp \"housecat|housekeeper\" fits the bill, but is inefficient\n       because we had to type \"house\" twice.  It would be nice to have parts\n       of the regexp be constant, like \"house\", and some parts have\n       alternatives, like \"cat|keeper\".\n\n       The grouping metacharacters \"()\" solve this problem.  Grouping allows\n       parts of a regexp to be treated as a single unit.  Parts of a regexp\n       are grouped by enclosing them in parentheses.  Thus we could solve the\n       \"housecat|housekeeper\" by forming the regexp as \"house(cat|keeper)\".\n       The regexp \"house(cat|keeper)\" means match \"house\" followed by either\n       \"cat\" or \"keeper\".  Some more examples are\n\n\t   /(a|b)b/;\t# matches 'ab' or 'bb'\n\t   /(ac|b)b/;\t# matches 'acb' or 'bb'\n\t   /(^a|b)c/;\t# matches 'ac' at start of string or 'bc' anywhere\n\t   /(a|[bc])d/; # matches 'ad', 'bd', or 'cd'\n\n\t   /house(cat|)/;  # matches either 'housecat' or 'house'\n\t   /house(cat(s|)|)/;  # matches either 'housecats' or 'housecat' or\n\t\t\t       # 'house'.  Note groups can be nested.\n\n\t   /(19|20|)\\d\\d/;  # match years 19xx, 20xx, or the Y2K problem, xx\n\t   \"20\" =~ /(19|20|)\\d\\d/;  # matches the null alternative '()\\d\\d',\n\t\t\t\t    # because '20\\d\\d' can't match\n\n       Alternations behave the same way in groups as out of them: at a given\n       string position, the leftmost alternative that allows the regexp to\n       match is taken.\tSo in the last example at the first string position,\n       \"20\" matches the second alternative, but there is nothing left over to\n       match the next two digits \"\\d\\d\".  So Perl moves on to the next\n       alternative, which is the null alternative and that works, since \"20\"\n       is two digits.\n\n       The process of trying one alternative, seeing if it matches, and moving\n       on to the next alternative, while going back in the string from where\n       the previous alternative was tried, if it doesn't, is called\n       backtracking.  The term \"backtracking\" comes from the idea that\n       matching a regexp is like a walk in the woods.  Successfully matching a\n       regexp is like arriving at a destination.  There are many possible\n       trailheads, one for each string position, and each one is tried in\n       order, left to right.  From each trailhead there may be many paths,\n       some of which get you there, and some which are dead ends.  When you\n       walk along a trail and hit a dead end, you have to backtrack along the\n       trail to an earlier point to try another trail.\tIf you hit your\n       destination, you stop immediately and forget about trying all the other\n       trails.\tYou are persistent, and only if you have tried all the trails\n       from all the trailheads and not arrived at your destination, do you\n       declare failure.  To be concrete, here is a step-by-step analysis of\n       what Perl does when it tries to match the regexp\n\n\t   \"abcde\" =~ /(abd|abc)(df|d|de)/;\n\n       0. Start with the first letter in the string 'a'."

    Manpage text:

    9.  We are at the end of the regexp, so we are done! We have matched
           'abcd' out of the string "abcde".

           There are a couple of things to note about this analysis.  First, the
           third alternative in the second group 'de' also allows a match, but we
           stopped before we got to it - at a given character position, leftmost
           wins.  Second, we were able to get a match at the first character
           position of the string 'a'.  If there were no matches at the first
           position, Perl would move to the second character position 'b' and
           attempt the match all over again.  Only when all possible paths at all
           possible character positions have been exhausted does Perl give up and
           declare "$string =~ /(abd|abc)(df|d|de)/;" to be false.

           Even with all this work, regexp matching happens remarkably fast.  To
           speed things up, Perl compiles the regexp into a compact sequence of
           opcodes that can often fit inside a processor cache.  When the code is
           executed, these opcodes can then run at full throttle and search very
           quickly.

For each grouping, the part that matched\n       inside goes into the special variables $1, $2, etc.  They can be used\n       just as ordinary variables:\n\n\t   # extract hours, minutes, seconds\n\t   if ($time =~ /(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d)/) {    # match hh:mm:ss format\n\t       $hours = $1;\n\t       $minutes = $2;\n\t       $seconds = $3;\n\t   }\n\n       Now, we know that in scalar context, \"$time =~ /(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d)/\"\n       returns a true or false value.

To refer to the immediately\n       preceding capture group one now may write \"\\g-1\" or \"\\g{-1}\", the next\n       but last is available via \"\\g-2\" or \"\\g{-2}\", and so on.\n\n       Another good reason in addition to readability and maintainability for\n       using relative backreferences is illustrated by the following example,\n       where a simple pattern for matching peculiar strings is used:\n\n\t   $a99a = '([a-z])(\\d)\\g2\\g1';   # matches a11a, g22g, x33x, etc.\n\n       Now that we have this pattern stored as a handy string, we might feel\n       tempted to use it as a part of some other pattern:\n\n\t   $line = \"code=e99e\";\n\t   if ($line =~ /^(\\w+)=$a99a$/){   # unexpected behavior!\n\t       print \"$1 is valid\\n\";\n\t   } else {\n\t       print \"bad line: '$line'\\n\";\n\t   }\n\n       But this doesn't match, at least not the way one might expect. Only\n       after inserting the interpolated $a99a and looking at the resulting\n       full text of the regexp is it obvious that the backreferences have\n       backfired. The subexpression \"(\\w+)\" has snatched number 1 and demoted\n       the groups in $a99a by one rank. This can be avoided by using relative\n       backreferences:\n\n\t   $a99a = '([a-z])(\\d)\\g{-1}\\g{-2}';  # safe for being interpolated\n\n   Named backreferences\n       Perl 5.10 also introduced named capture groups and named\n       backreferences.\tTo attach a name to a capturing group, you write\n       either \"(?<name>...)\" or \"(?'name'...)\".  The backreference may then be\n       written as \"\\g{name}\".  It is permissible to attach the same name to\n       more than one group, but then only the leftmost one of the eponymous\n       set can be referenced.  Outside of the pattern a named capture group is\n       accessible through the \"%+\" hash.\n\n       Assuming that we have to match calendar dates which may be given in one\n       of the three formats yyyy-mm-dd, mm/dd/yyyy or dd.mm.yyyy, we can write\n       three suitable patterns where we use 'd', 'm' and 'y' respectively as\n       the names of the groups capturing the pertaining components of a date.\n       The matching operation combines the three patterns as alternatives:\n\n\t   $fmt1 = '(?<y>\\d\\d\\d\\d)-(?<m>\\d\\d)-(?<d>\\d\\d)';\n\t   $fmt2 = '(?<m>\\d\\d)/(?<d>\\d\\d)/(?<y>\\d\\d\\d\\d)';\n\t   $fmt3 = '(?<d>\\d\\d)\\.(?<m>\\d\\d)\\.(?<y>\\d\\d\\d\\d)';\n\t   for my $d (qw(2006-10-21 15.01.2007 10/31/2005)) {\n\t       if ( $d =~ m{$fmt1|$fmt2|$fmt3} ){\n\t\t   print \"day=$+{d} month=$+{m} year=$+{y}\\n\";\n\t       }\n\t   }\n\n       If any of the alternatives matches, the hash \"%+\" is bound to contain\n       the three key-value pairs.\n\n   Alternative capture group numbering\n       Yet another capturing group numbering technique (also as from Perl\n       5.10) deals with the problem of referring to groups within a set of\n       alternatives.  Consider a pattern for matching a time of the day, civil\n       or military style:\n\n\t   if ( $time =~ /(\\d\\d|\\d):(\\d\\d)|(\\d\\d)(\\d\\d)/ ){\n\t       # process hour and minute\n\t   }\n\n       Processing the results requires an additional if statement to determine\n       whether $1 and $2 or $3 and $4 contain the goodies. It would be easier\n       if we could use group numbers 1 and 2 in second alternative as well,\n       and this is exactly what the parenthesized construct \"(?|...)\", set\n       around an alternative achieves. Here is an extended version of the\n       previous pattern:\n\n\t if($time =~ /(?|(\\d\\d|\\d):(\\d\\d)|(\\d\\d)(\\d\\d))\\s+([A-Z][A-Z][A-Z])/){\n\t     print \"hour=$1 minute=$2 zone=$3\\n\";\n\t }\n\n       Within the alternative numbering group, group numbers start at the same\n       position for each alternative. After the group, numbering continues\n       with one higher than the maximum reached across all the alternatives.\n\n   Position information\n       In addition to what was matched, Perl also provides the positions of\n       what was matched as contents of the \"@-\" and \"@+\" arrays. \"$-[0]\" is\n       the position of the start of the entire match and $+[0] is the position\n       of the end. Similarly, \"$-[n]\" is the position of the start of the $n\n       match and $+[n] is the position of the end. If $n is undefined, so are\n       \"$-[n]\" and $+[n]. Then this code\n\n\t   $x = \"Mmm...donut, thought Homer\";\n\t   $x =~ /^(Mmm|Yech)\\.\\.\\.(donut|peas)/; # matches\n\t   foreach $exp (1..$#-) {\n\t       no strict 'refs';\n\t       print \"Match $exp: '$$exp' at position ($-[$exp],$+[$exp])\\n\";\n\t   }\n\n       prints\n\n\t   Match 1: 'Mmm' at position (0,3)\n\t   Match 2: 'donut' at position (6,11)\n\n       Even if there are no groupings in a regexp, it is still possible to\n       find out what exactly matched in a string.  If you use them, Perl will\n       set \"$`\" to the part of the string before the match, will set $& to the\n       part of the string that matched, and will set \"$'\" to the part of the\n       string after the match.\tAn example:\n\n\t   $x = \"the cat caught the mouse\";\n\t   $x =~ /cat/;  # $` = 'the ', $& = 'cat', $' = ' caught the mouse'\n\t   $x =~ /the/;  # $` = '', $& = 'the', $' = ' cat caught the mouse'\n\n       In the second match, \"$`\" equals '' because the regexp matched at the\n       first character position in the string and stopped; it never saw the\n       second \"the\".\n\n       If your code is to run on Perl versions earlier than 5.20, it is\n       worthwhile to note that using \"$`\" and \"$'\" slows down regexp matching\n       quite a bit, while $& slows it down to a lesser extent, because if they\n       are used in one regexp in a program, they are generated for all regexps\n       in the program.\tSo if raw performance is a goal of your application,\n       they should be avoided.\tIf you need to extract the corresponding\n       substrings, use \"@-\" and \"@+\" instead:\n\n\t   $` is the same as substr( $x, 0, $-[0] )\n\t   $& is the same as substr( $x, $-[0], $+[0]-$-[0] )\n\t   $' is the same as substr( $x, $+[0] )\n\n       As of Perl 5.10, the \"${^PREMATCH}\", \"${^MATCH}\" and \"${^POSTMATCH}\"\n       variables may be used.  These are only set if the \"/p\" modifier is\n       present.  Consequently they do not penalize the rest of the program.\n       In Perl 5.20, \"${^PREMATCH}\", \"${^MATCH}\" and \"${^POSTMATCH}\" are\n       available whether the \"/p\" has been used or not (the modifier is\n       ignored), and \"$`\", \"$'\" and $& do not cause any speed difference.\n\n   Non-capturing groupings\n       A group that is required to bundle a set of alternatives may or may not\n       be useful as a capturing group.\tIf it isn't, it just creates a\n       superfluous addition to the set of available capture group values,\n       inside as well as outside the regexp.  Non-capturing groupings, denoted\n       by \"(?:regexp)\", still allow the regexp to be treated as a single unit,\n       but don't establish a capturing group at the same time.\tBoth capturing\n       and non-capturing groupings are allowed to co-exist in the same regexp.\n       Because there is no extraction, non-capturing groupings are faster than\n       capturing groupings.  Non-capturing groupings are also handy for\n       choosing exactly which parts of a regexp are to be extracted to\n       matching variables:\n\n\t   # match a number, $1-$4 are set, but we only want $1\n\t   /([+-]?\\ *(\\d+(\\.\\d*)?|\\.\\d+)([eE][+-]?\\d+)?)/;\n\n\t   # match a number faster , only $1 is set\n\t   /([+-]?\\ *(?:\\d+(?:\\.\\d*)?|\\.\\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\\d+)?)/;\n\n\t   # match a number, get $1 = whole number, $2 = exponent\n\t   /([+-]?\\ *(?:\\d+(?:\\.\\d*)?|\\.\\d+)(?:[eE]([+-]?\\d+))?)/;\n\n       Non-capturing groupings are also useful for removing nuisance elements\n       gathered from a split operation where parentheses are required for some\n       reason:\n\n\t   $x = '12aba34ba5';\n\t   @num = split /(a|b)+/, $x;\t # @num = ('12','a','34','a','5')\n\t   @num = split /(?:a|b)+/, $x;  # @num = ('12','34','5')\n\n       In Perl 5.22 and later, all groups within a regexp can be set to non-\n       capturing by using the new \"/n\" flag:\n\n\t   \"hello\" =~ /(hi|hello)/n; # $1 is not set!\n\n       See \"n\" in perlre for more information.\n\n   Matching repetitions\n       The examples in the previous section display an annoying weakness.  We\n       were only matching 3-letter words, or chunks of words of 4 letters or\n       less.  We'd like to be able to match words or, more generally, strings\n       of any length, without writing out tedious alternatives like\n       \"\\w\\w\\w\\w|\\w\\w\\w|\\w\\w|\\w\".\n\n       This is exactly the problem the quantifier metacharacters '?', '*',\n       '+', and \"{}\" were created for.\tThey allow us to delimit the number of\n       repeats for a portion of a regexp we consider to be a match.\n       Quantifiers are put immediately after the character, character class,\n       or grouping that we want to specify.  They have the following meanings:\n\n       •   \"a?\" means: match 'a' 1 or 0 times\n\n       •   \"a*\" means: match 'a' 0 or more times, i.e., any number of times\n\n       •   \"a+\" means: match 'a' 1 or more times, i.e., at least once\n\n       •   \"a{n,m}\" means: match at least \"n\" times, but not more than \"m\"\n\t   times.\n\n       •   \"a{n,}\" means: match at least \"n\" or more times\n\n       •   \"a{,n}\" means: match at most \"n\" times, or fewer\n\n       •   \"a{n}\" means: match exactly \"n\" times\n\n       If you like, you can add blanks (tab or space characters) within the\n       braces, but adjacent to them, and/or next to the comma (if any).\n\n       Here are some examples:\n\n\t   /[a-z]+\\s+\\d*/;  # match a lowercase word, at least one space, and\n\t\t\t    # any number of digits\n\t   /(\\w+)\\s+\\g1/;    # match doubled words of arbitrary length\n\t   /y(es)?/i;\t    # matches 'y', 'Y', or a case-insensitive 'yes'\n\t   $year =~ /^\\d{2,4}$/;  # make sure year is at least 2 but not more\n\t\t\t\t  # than 4 digits\n\t   $year =~ /^\\d{ 2, 4 }$/;    # Same; for those who like wide open\n\t\t\t\t       # spaces.\n\t   $year =~ /^\\d{2, 4}$/;      # Same.\n\t   $year =~ /^\\d{4}$|^\\d{2}$/; # better match; throw out 3-digit dates\n\t   $year =~ /^\\d{2}(\\d{2})?$/; # same thing written differently.\n\t\t\t\t       # However, this captures the last two\n\t\t\t\t       # digits in $1 and the other does not.\n\n\t   % simple_grep '^(\\w+)\\g1$' /usr/dict/words\t# isn't this easier?\n\t   beriberi\n\t   booboo\n\t   coco\n\t   mama\n\t   murmur\n\t   papa\n\n       For all of these quantifiers, Perl will try to match as much of the\n       string as possible, while still allowing the regexp to succeed.\tThus\n       with \"/a?.../\", Perl will first try to match the regexp with the 'a'\n       present; if that fails, Perl will try to match the regexp without the\n       'a' present.  For the quantifier '*', we get the following:\n\n\t   $x = \"the cat in the hat\";\n\t   $x =~ /^(.*)(cat)(.*)$/; # matches,\n\t\t\t\t    # $1 = 'the '\n\t\t\t\t    # $2 = 'cat'\n\t\t\t\t    # $3 = ' in the hat'\n\n       Which is what we might expect, the match finds the only \"cat\" in the\n       string and locks onto it.  Consider, however, this regexp:\n\n\t   $x =~ /^(.*)(at)(.*)$/; # matches,\n\t\t\t\t   # $1 = 'the cat in the h'\n\t\t\t\t   # $2 = 'at'\n\t\t\t\t   # $3 = ''   (0 characters match)\n\n       One might initially guess that Perl would find the \"at\" in \"cat\" and\n       stop there, but that wouldn't give the longest possible string to the\n       first quantifier \".*\".  Instead, the first quantifier \".*\" grabs as\n       much of the string as possible while still having the regexp match.  In\n       this example, that means having the \"at\" sequence with the final \"at\"\n       in the string.  The other important principle illustrated here is that,\n       when there are two or more elements in a regexp, the leftmost\n       quantifier, if there is one, gets to grab as much of the string as\n       possible, leaving the rest of the regexp to fight over scraps.  Thus in\n       our example, the first quantifier \".*\" grabs most of the string, while\n       the second quantifier \".*\" gets the empty string.   Quantifiers that\n       grab as much of the string as possible are called maximal match or\n       greedy quantifiers.\n\n       When a regexp can match a string in several different ways, we can use\n       the principles above to predict which way the regexp will match:\n\n       •   Principle 0: Taken as a whole, any regexp will be matched at the\n\t   earliest possible position in the string.\n\n       •   Principle 1: In an alternation \"a|b|c...\", the leftmost alternative\n\t   that allows a match for the whole regexp will be the one used.\n\n       •   Principle 2: The maximal matching quantifiers '?', '*', '+' and\n\t   \"{n,m}\" will in general match as much of the string as possible\n\t   while still allowing the whole regexp to match.\n\n       •   Principle 3: If there are two or more elements in a regexp, the\n\t   leftmost greedy quantifier, if any, will match as much of the\n\t   string as possible while still allowing the whole regexp to match.\n\t   The next leftmost greedy quantifier, if any, will try to match as\n\t   much of the string remaining available to it as possible, while\n\t   still allowing the whole regexp to match.  And so on, until all the\n\t   regexp elements are satisfied.\n\n       As we have seen above, Principle 0 overrides the others. The regexp\n       will be matched as early as possible, with the other principles\n       determining how the regexp matches at that earliest character position.\n\n       Here is an example of these principles in action:\n\n\t   $x = \"The programming republic of Perl\";\n\t   $x =~ /^(.+)(e|r)(.*)$/;  # matches,\n\t\t\t\t     # $1 = 'The programming republic of Pe'\n\t\t\t\t     # $2 = 'r'\n\t\t\t\t     # $3 = 'l'\n\n       This regexp matches at the earliest string position, 'T'.  One might\n       think that 'e', being leftmost in the alternation, would be matched,\n       but 'r' produces the longest string in the first quantifier.\n\n\t   $x =~ /(m{1,2})(.*)$/;  # matches,\n\t\t\t\t   # $1 = 'mm'\n\t\t\t\t   # $2 = 'ing republic of Perl'\n\n       Here, The earliest possible match is at the first 'm' in \"programming\".\n       \"m{1,2}\" is the first quantifier, so it gets to match a maximal \"mm\".\n\n\t   $x =~ /.*(m{1,2})(.*)$/;  # matches,\n\t\t\t\t     # $1 = 'm'\n\t\t\t\t     # $2 = 'ing republic of Perl'\n\n       Here, the regexp matches at the start of the string. The first\n       quantifier \".*\" grabs as much as possible, leaving just a single 'm'\n       for the second quantifier \"m{1,2}\".\n\n\t   $x =~ /(.?)(m{1,2})(.*)$/;  # matches,\n\t\t\t\t       # $1 = 'a'\n\t\t\t\t       # $2 = 'mm'\n\t\t\t\t       # $3 = 'ing republic of Perl'\n\n       Here, \".?\" eats its maximal one character at the earliest possible\n       position in the string, 'a' in \"programming\", leaving \"m{1,2}\" the\n       opportunity to match both 'm''s. Finally,\n\n\t   \"aXXXb\" =~ /(X*)/; # matches with $1 = ''\n\n       because it can match zero copies of 'X' at the beginning of the string.\n       If you definitely want to match at least one 'X', use \"X+\", not \"X*\".\n\n       Sometimes greed is not good.  At times, we would like quantifiers to\n       match a minimal piece of string, rather than a maximal piece.  For this\n       purpose, Larry Wall created the minimal match or non-greedy quantifiers\n       \"??\", \"*?\", \"+?\", and \"{}?\".  These are the usual quantifiers with a\n       '?' appended to them.  They have the following meanings:\n\n       •   \"a??\" means: match 'a' 0 or 1 times. Try 0 first, then 1.\n\n       •   \"a*?\" means: match 'a' 0 or more times, i.e., any number of times,\n\t   but as few times as possible\n\n       •   \"a+?\" means: match 'a' 1 or more times, i.e., at least once, but as\n\t   few times as possible\n\n       •   \"a{n,m}?\" means: match at least \"n\" times, not more than \"m\" times,\n\t   as few times as possible\n\n       •   \"a{n,}?\" means: match at least \"n\" times, but as few times as\n\t   possible\n\n       •   \"a{,n}?\" means: match at most \"n\" times, but as few times as\n\t   possible\n\n       •   \"a{n}?\" means: match exactly \"n\" times.  Because we match exactly\n\t   \"n\" times, \"a{n}?\" is equivalent to \"a{n}\" and is just there for\n\t   notational consistency.\n\n       Let's look at the example above, but with minimal quantifiers:\n\n\t   $x = \"The programming republic of Perl\";\n\t   $x =~ /^(.+?)(e|r)(.*)$/; # matches,\n\t\t\t\t     # $1 = 'Th'\n\t\t\t\t     # $2 = 'e'\n\t\t\t\t     # $3 = ' programming republic of Perl'\n\n       The minimal string that will allow both the start of the string '^' and\n       the alternation to match is \"Th\", with the alternation \"e|r\" matching\n       'e'.  The second quantifier \".*\" is free to gobble up the rest of the\n       string.\n\n\t   $x =~ /(m{1,2}?)(.*?)$/;  # matches,\n\t\t\t\t     # $1 = 'm'\n\t\t\t\t     # $2 = 'ming republic of Perl'\n\n       The first string position that this regexp can match is at the first\n       'm' in \"programming\". At this position, the minimal \"m{1,2}?\" matches\n       just one 'm'.  Although the second quantifier \".*?\" would prefer to\n       match no characters, it is constrained by the end-of-string anchor '$'\n       to match the rest of the string.\n\n\t   $x =~ /(.*?)(m{1,2}?)(.*)$/;  # matches,\n\t\t\t\t\t # $1 = 'The progra'\n\t\t\t\t\t # $2 = 'm'\n\t\t\t\t\t # $3 = 'ming republic of Perl'\n\n       In this regexp, you might expect the first minimal quantifier \".*?\" to\n       match the empty string, because it is not constrained by a '^' anchor\n       to match the beginning of the word.  Principle 0 applies here, however.\n       Because it is possible for the whole regexp to match at the start of\n       the string, it will match at the start of the string.  Thus the first\n       quantifier has to match everything up to the first 'm'.\tThe second\n       minimal quantifier matches just one 'm' and the third quantifier\n       matches the rest of the string.\n\n\t   $x =~ /(.??)(m{1,2})(.*)$/;\t# matches,\n\t\t\t\t\t# $1 = 'a'\n\t\t\t\t\t# $2 = 'mm'\n\t\t\t\t\t# $3 = 'ing republic of Perl'\n\n       Just as in the previous regexp, the first quantifier \".??\" can match\n       earliest at position 'a', so it does.  The second quantifier is greedy,\n       so it matches \"mm\", and the third matches the rest of the string.\n\n       We can modify principle 3 above to take into account non-greedy\n       quantifiers:\n\n       •   Principle 3: If there are two or more elements in a regexp, the\n\t   leftmost greedy (non-greedy) quantifier, if any, will match as much\n\t   (little) of the string as possible while still allowing the whole\n\t   regexp to match.  The next leftmost greedy (non-greedy) quantifier,\n\t   if any, will try to match as much (little) of the string remaining\n\t   available to it as possible, while still allowing the whole regexp\n\t   to match.  And so on, until all the regexp elements are satisfied.\n\n       Just like alternation, quantifiers are also susceptible to\n       backtracking.  Here is a step-by-step analysis of the example\n\n\t   $x = \"the cat in the hat\";\n\t   $x =~ /^(.*)(at)(.*)$/; # matches,\n\t\t\t\t   # $1 = 'the cat in the h'\n\t\t\t\t   # $2 = 'at'\n\t\t\t\t   # $3 = ''   (0 matches)\n\n       0.  Start with the first letter in the string 't'."

There are many\n       different ways of partitioning a string of length n between the '+' and\n       '*': one repetition with \"b+\" of length n, two repetitions with the\n       first \"b+\" length k and the second with length n-k, m repetitions whose\n       bits add up to length n, etc.  In fact there are an exponential number\n       of ways to partition a string as a function of its length.  A regexp\n       may get lucky and match early in the process, but if there is no match,\n       Perl will try every possibility before giving up.  So be careful with\n       nested '*''s, \"{n,m}\"'s, and '+''s.

We will build a\n       regexp that matches numbers.\n\n       The first task in building a regexp is to decide what we want to match\n       and what we want to exclude.  In our case, we want to match both\n       integers and floating point numbers and we want to reject any string\n       that isn't a number.\n\n       The next task is to break the problem down into smaller problems that\n       are easily converted into a regexp.\n\n       The simplest case is integers.  These consist of a sequence of digits,\n       with an optional sign in front.\tThe digits we can represent with \"\\d+\"\n       and the sign can be matched with \"[+-]\".  Thus the integer regexp is\n\n\t   /[+-]?\\d+/;\t# matches integers\n\n       A floating point number potentially has a sign, an integral part, a\n       decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent.  One or more of\n       these parts is optional, so we need to check out the different\n       possibilities.  Floating point numbers which are in proper form include\n       123., 0.345, .34, -1e6, and 25.4E-72.  As with integers, the sign out\n       front is completely optional and can be matched by \"[+-]?\".  We can see\n       that if there is no exponent, floating point numbers must have a\n       decimal point, otherwise they are integers.  We might be tempted to\n       model these with \"\\d*\\.\\d*\", but this would also match just a single\n       decimal point, which is not a number.  So the three cases of floating\n       point number without exponent are"

The modifier \"/g\" stands for global matching and\n       allows the matching operator to match within a string as many times as\n       possible.  In scalar context, successive invocations against a string\n       will have \"/g\" jump from match to match, keeping track of position in\n       the string as it goes along.

Search and replace is accomplished with the \"s///\"\n       operator.  The general form is \"s/regexp/replacement/modifiers\", with\n       everything we know about regexps and modifiers applying in this case as\n       well.  The replacement is a Perl double-quoted string that replaces in\n       the string whatever is matched with the \"regexp\".  The operator \"=~\" is\n       also used here to associate a string with \"s///\".  If matching against\n       $_, the \"$_ =~\" can be dropped.\tIf there is a match, \"s///\" returns\n       the number of substitutions made; otherwise it returns false.  Here are\n       a few examples:"

    Part 2: Power tools
           OK, you know the basics of regexps and you want to know more.  If
           matching regular expressions is analogous to a walk in the woods, then
           the tools discussed in Part 1 are analogous to topo maps and a compass,
           basic tools we use all the time.  Most of the tools in part 2 are
           analogous to flare guns and satellite phones.  They aren't used too
           often on a hike, but when we are stuck, they can be invaluable.

           What follows are the more advanced, less used, or sometimes esoteric
           capabilities of Perl regexps.  In Part 2, we will assume you are
           comfortable with the basics and concentrate on the advanced features.

       More on characters, strings, and character classes
           There are a number of escape sequences and character classes that we
           haven't covered yet.

           There are several escape sequences that convert characters or strings
           between upper and lower case, and they are also available within
           patterns.  "\l" and "\u" convert the next character to lower or upper
           case, respectively:

    It does not protect '$' or '@', so that variables can still be
           substituted.

           "\Q", "\L", "\l", "\U", "\u" and "\E" are actually part of double-
           quotish syntax, and not part of regexp syntax proper.  They will work
           if they appear in a regular expression embedded directly in a program,
           but not when contained in a string that is interpolated in a pattern.

           Perl regexps can handle more than just the standard ASCII character
           set.  Perl supports Unicode, a standard for representing the alphabets
           from virtually all of the world's written languages, and a host of
           symbols.  Perl's text strings are Unicode strings, so they can contain
           characters with a value (codepoint or character number) higher than
           255.

           What does this mean for regexps? Well, regexp users don't need to know
           much about Perl's internal representation of strings.  But they do need
           to know 1) how to represent Unicode characters in a regexp and 2) that
           a matching operation will treat the string to be searched as a sequence
           of characters, not bytes.  The answer to 1) is that Unicode characters
           greater than "chr(255)" are represented using the "\x{hex}" notation,
           because "\x"XY (without curly braces and XY are two hex digits) doesn't
           go further than 255.  (Starting in Perl 5.14, if you're an octal fan,
           you can also use "\o{oct}".)

           than the single form, and in fact most of the single forms are just
           Perl-defined shortcuts for common compound forms.  For example, the

    Manpage text:

    In Perl regular expressions, most regexp elements "eat up" a certain
           amount of string when they match.  For instance, the regexp element
           "[abc]" eats up one character of the string when it matches, in the
           sense that Perl moves to the next character position in the string
           after the match.  There are some elements, however, that don't eat up
           characters (advance the character position) if they match.  The
           examples we have seen so far are the anchors.  The anchor '^' matches
           the beginning of the line, but doesn't eat any characters.  Similarly,
           the word boundary anchor "\b" matches wherever a character matching
           "\w" is next to a character that doesn't, but it doesn't eat up any
           characters itself.  Anchors are examples of zero-width assertions:
           zero-width, because they consume no characters, and assertions, because
           they test some property of the string.  In the context of our walk in
           the woods analogy to regexp matching, most regexp elements move us
           along a trail, but anchors have us stop a moment and check our
           surroundings.  If the local environment checks out, we can proceed
           forward.  But if the local environment doesn't satisfy us, we must
           backtrack.

    Manpage text:

    $x =~ /\( ( (?> [ ^ () ]+ ) | \([ ^ () ]* \) )+ \)/xx;

           Here, "(?>[^()]+)" breaks the degeneracy of string partitioning by
           gobbling up as much of the string as possible and keeping it.   Then
           match failures fail much more quickly.

       Conditional expressions
           A conditional expression is a form of if-then-else statement that
           allows one to choose which patterns are to be matched, based on some
           condition.  There are two types of conditional expression:
           "(?(condition)yes-regexp)" and "(?(condition)yes-regexp|no-regexp)".
           "(?(condition)yes-regexp)" is like an 'if () {}' statement in Perl.  If
           the condition is true, the yes-regexp will be matched.  If the
           condition is false, the yes-regexp will be skipped and Perl will move
           onto the next regexp element.  The second form is like an
           'if () {} else {}' statement in Perl.  If the condition is true, the
           yes-regexp will be matched, otherwise the no-regexp will be matched.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlretut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe condition can have several forms.  The first form is simply an\n       integer in parentheses \"(integer)\".  It is true if the corresponding\n       backreference \"\\integer\" matched earlier in the regexp.\tThe same thing\n       can be done with a name associated with a capture group, written as\n       \"(<name>)\" or \"('name')\".  The second form is a bare zero-width\n       assertion \"(?...)\", either a lookahead, a lookbehind, or a code\n       assertion (discussed in the next section).  The third set of forms\n       provides tests that return true if the expression is executed within a\n       recursion (\"(R)\") or is being called from some capturing group,\n       referenced either by number (\"(R1)\", \"(R2)\",...) or by name\n       (\"(R&name)\").\n\n       The integer or name form of the \"condition\" allows us to choose, with\n       more flexibility, what to match based on what matched earlier in the\n       regexp. This searches for words of the form \"$x$x\" or \"$x$y$y$x\":\n\n\t   % simple_grep '^(\\w+)(\\w+)?(?(2)\\g2\\g1|\\g1)$' /usr/dict/words\n\t   beriberi\n\t   coco\n\t   couscous\n\t   deed\n\t   ...\n\t   toot\n\t   toto\n\t   tutu"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor.

For\n       instance,\n\n\t   /[ATGC]+(?(?<=AA)G|C)$/;\n\n       matches a DNA sequence such that it either ends in \"AAG\", or some other\n       base pair combination and 'C'.  Note that the form is \"(?(?<=AA)G|C)\"\n       and not \"(?((?<=AA))G|C)\"; for the lookahead, lookbehind or code\n       assertions, the parentheses around the conditional are not needed.\n\n   Defining named patterns\n       Some regular expressions use identical subpatterns in several places.\n       Starting with Perl 5.10, it is possible to define named subpatterns in\n       a section of the pattern so that they can be called up by name anywhere\n       in the pattern.\tThis syntactic pattern for this definition group is\n       \"(?(DEFINE)(?<name>pattern)...)\".  An insertion of a named pattern is\n       written as \"(?&name)\".\n\n       The example below illustrates this feature using the pattern for\n       floating point numbers that was presented earlier on.  The three\n       subpatterns that are used more than once are the optional sign, the\n       digit sequence for an integer and the decimal fraction.\tThe \"DEFINE\"\n       group at the end of the pattern contains their definition.

Because the group reference may\n       be contained within the group it refers to, it is now possible to apply\n       pattern matching to tasks that hitherto required a recursive parser.\n\n       To illustrate this feature, we'll design a pattern that matches if a\n       string contains a palindrome.

(It's remarkable that an alternative solution using\n       something like\n\n\t  $count{lc($_)}++ for split('', \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\");\n\t  printf \"%3d '%s'\\n\", $count2{$_}, $_ for ( qw{ a e i o u } );\n\n       is considerably slower.)\n\n   Pragmas and debugging\n       Speaking of debugging, there are several pragmas available to control\n       and debug regexps in Perl.  We have already encountered one pragma in\n       the previous section, \"use re 'eval';\", that allows variable\n       interpolation and code expressions to coexist in a regexp.
