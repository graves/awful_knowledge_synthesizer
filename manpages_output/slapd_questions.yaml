It listens for LDAP connections\n       on any number of ports (default 389), responding to the LDAP operations\n       it receives over these connections.  slapd is typically invoked at boot\n       time, usually out of /etc/rc.local.  Upon startup, slapd normally forks\n       and disassociates itself from the invoking tty.\tIf configured in the\n       config file (or config directory), the slapd process will print its\n       process ID (see getpid(2)) to a .pid file, as well as the command line\n       options during invocation to an .args file (see slapd.conf(5)).\tIf the\n       -d flag is given, even with a zero argument, slapd will not fork and\n       disassociate from the invoking tty."
