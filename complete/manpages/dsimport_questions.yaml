    Manpage text:

    --crypt
           is used to signify that all user passwords are crypt-based. Entries in
           the import file can also be prefixed with {CRYPT} on a per record basis
           if not all users are crypt-based.  By default all passwords are assumed
           to be provided as listed in the import file.

         --force attribute value
           forces a specific value for the named attribute for all records during
           the import. The new value will overwrite any value specified in the
           import file. This option may be specified multiple times for forcing
           more than one attribute.

         --groupid value
           is the GID used for any records that do not specify a primary GID.

         --grouppreset value
           designate a preset record to be applied to imported group records.

         --loglevel value
           changes the amount of logging detail output to the log file.

         --outputfile value
           Outputs a plist to the specified file with a list of changed users or
           groups and rejected records due to name conflicts.  Also includes a
           list of deleted records (overwrite mode), and lists of records that
           failed and succeeded during import.  The format of this file is likely
           to change in a future release of Mac OS X.

    Manpage text:

    --password value
           is the admin's password for import operations. Used to authenticate to
           the directory node during import. A secure prompt will be used for
           interactive input if not supplied via parameter.  Using the prompt
           method is the most secure method of providing password to dsimport.

         --recordformat string
           passes in the delimiters and attributes and record type to specify the
           order and names of attributes in the file to be imported. An example
           record format string:

           0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 7
           dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName dsAttrTypeStandard:Password
           dsAttrTypeStandard:UniqueID dsAttrTypeStandard:PrimaryGroupID
           dsAttrTypeStandard:RealName dsAttrTypeStandard:NFSHomeDirectory
           dsAttrTypeStandard:UserShell

           A special value of IGNORE can be used for values that should be ignored
           in the import file on a record-by-record basis.

         --recordtype type
           Override the record type defined in the import file. For example, to
           import ComputerGroups as ComputerLists, use:

    Manpage text:

    --recordtype dsRecTypeStandard:ComputerLists

           The opposite works for importing ComputerLists as ComputerGroups, and
           so on.

         --remotehost hostname | ipaddress
           connects to a remote host at the network address specified.  Commonly
           used to import to a remote Mac OS X Server.

         --remoteusername value
           specifies user name to use for the remote connection.

         --remotepassword value
           specifies password to use for the remote connection. A secure prompt
           will be used to ask for the password if --remoteusername is specified
           and --remotepassword is not.  Using the prompt method is the most
           secure method of providing password to dsimport.

         --startid value
           indicates the ID number to start with when the import tool generates
           user or group IDs for any import file that lacks an ID as part of the
           import data.

         --template StandardUser | StandardGroup
           is used for delimited import of files that lack field descriptions.
