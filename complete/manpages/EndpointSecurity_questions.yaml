ES clients\n     can either be standalone applications/executables or installed as system\n     extensions.\n\n     If the ES client is a system extension, the following optional keys can\n     be set in the bundle's Info.plist:\n\n     NSEndpointSecurityEarlyBoot\n\t      Type: Boolean\n\n\t      If set to TRUE, the ES subsystem will hold up all mounts and\n\t      third party executions (anything that is not a platform binary)\n\t      until all early boot ES extensions make their first\n\t      subscription.\n\n     NSEndpointSecurityRebootRequired\n\t      Type: Boolean\n\n\t      If not set or set to FALSE, the new version of the extension is\n\t      started immediately after terminating the old version."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the EndpointSecurity subsystem?
  manpageQuestion2: How can an ES client configure itself to delay system boot processes until all early boot extensions have made their first subscription?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the effect of setting the NSEndpointSecurityRebootRequired key to FALSE in an ES system extension's Info.plist?
