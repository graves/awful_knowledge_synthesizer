    NOTEBOOK PAGES
           A notebook's pages area contains a single child site frame. When a new
           page is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site
           frame serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets
           into. It is this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when
           the auto option is true. This creates the effect of one page being
           visible at a time. When a new page is selected, the previously selected
           page's child site frame is automatically unpacked from the notebook's
           child site frame and the newly selected page's child site is packed
           into the notebook's child site frame.

           However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a
           different manner. By specifying the auto option as false, child site
           packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets
           might be packed into the first page's child site frame. Then when a new
           page is selected, the application can reconfigure the widgets and give
           the appearance that the page was flipped.

           In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl Command to
           execute when the page is selected. In the case of auto being true, it
           is called between the unpacking of the previously selected page and the
           packing of the newly selected page.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `iwidgets_notebook`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       The iwidgets::notebookfR command creates a new Tcl command whose name\n       is pathName. This command may be used to invoke various operations on\n       the widget. It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n       Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an\n       indicator of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators\n       are called indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:\n\n       number Specifies the index of the the component. For menus, 0\n\t      corresponds to the left-most menu of the menu bar. For entries,\n\t      0 corresponds to the top-most entry of the menu.\tnumber\n\t      Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first\n\t      page in the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on.\n\n       select Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is\n\t      currently selected, the value -1 is returned.\n\n       end    Specifes the last page in the notebooks's index. If the notebook\n\t      is empty this will return -1.\n\n       pattern\n\t      If the index doesn't satisfy the form of a number, then this\n\t      form is used.  Pattern is pattern-matched against the label of\n\t      each page in the notebook, in order from the first to the last\n\t      page, until a matching entry is found. The rules of\n\t      Tcl_StringMatch are used.\n\n       The following commands are possible for notebook widgets:\n\n       pathName add ?option value?\n\t      Add a new page at the end of the notebook. A new child site\n\t      frame is created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional\n\t      arguments are present, they specify any of the following\n\t      options:\n\n\t      -background value\n\t\t     Specifies a background color to use for displaying the\n\t\t     child site frame of this page. If this option is\n\t\t     specified as an empty string (the default), then the\n\t\t     background option for the overall notebook is used.\n\n\t      -command value\n\t\t     Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is\n\t\t     selected. This allows the programmer a hook to\n\t\t     reconfigure this page's widgets or any other page's\n\t\t     widgets.\n\n\t\t     If the notebook has the auto option set to true, when a\n\t\t     page is selected this command will be called immediately\n\t\t     after the previously selected page is unpacked and\n\t\t     immediately before this page is selected. The index value\n\t\t     select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select'\n\t\t     will return this page's page number.\n\n\t\t     If the auto option is set to false, when a page is\n\t\t     selected the unpack and pack calls are bypassed. This Tcl\n\t\t     command is still called.\n\n\t      -foreground value\n\t\t     Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab\n\t\t     labels when tabs are in their normal unselected state. If\n\t\t     this option is specified as an empty string (the\n\t\t     default), then the foreground option for the overall\n\t\t     notebook is used.\n\n\t      -label value\n\t\t     Specifies a string to associate with this page. This\n\t\t     label serves as an additional identifier used to\n\t\t     reference the page. This label may be used for the index\n\t\t     value in widget commands.\n\n       pathName childSite ?index?\n\t      If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for all the\n\t      pages in the notebook. If the notebook is empty, an empty list\n\t      is returned\n\n\t      If index is passed, it returns the pathName for the page's child\n\t      site frame specified by index. Widgets that are created with\n\t      this pathName will be displayed when the associated page is\n\t      selected. If index is not a valid index, an empty string is\n\t      returned.\n\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list). If option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string. Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::notebook command.\n\n       pathName delete index1 ?index2?\n\t      Delete all of the pages between index1 and index2 inclusive.  If\n\t      index2 is omitted then it defaults to index1. Returns an empty\n\t      string.\n\n       pathName index index\n\t      Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.\n\n       pathName insert index ?option value?\n\t      Insert a new page in the notebook before the page specified by\n\t      index.  A new child site frame is created. See the add command\n\t      for valid options. Returns the child site pathName.\n\n       pathName next\n\t      Advances the selected page to the next page (order is determined\n\t      by insertion order). If the currently selected page is the last\n\t      page in the notebook, the selection wraps around to the first\n\t      page in the notebook.\n\n\t      For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child\n\t      site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the\n\t      next page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site\n\t      frame. The Tcl command given with the command option will be\n\t      invoked between these two operations.\n\n\t      For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with\n\t      the command option will be invoked.\n\n       pathName pagecget index ?option?\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option for the page specified by index. The valid available\n\t      options are the same as available to the add command.\n\n       pathName pageconfigure index ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      This command is similar to the configure command, except that it\n\t      applies to the options for an individual page, whereas configure\n\t      applies to the options for the notebook. Options may have any of\n\t      the values accepted by the add widget command. If options are\n\t      specified, options are modified as indicated in the command and\n\t      the command returns an empty string. If no options are\n\t      specified, returns a list describing the current options for\n\t      page index (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format\n\t      of this list).\n\n       pathName prev\n\t      Moves the selected page to the previous page (order is\n\t      determined by insertion order). If the currently selected page\n\t      is the first page in the notebook, the selection wraps around to\n\t      the last page in the notebook.\n\n\t      For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child\n\t      site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the\n\t      previous page's child site is packed into the notebooks child\n\t      site frame. The Tcl command given with the command option will\n\t      be invoked between these two operations.\n\n\t      For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with\n\t      the command option will be invoked.\n\n       pathName select index\n\t      Selects the page specified by index as the currently selected\n\t      page.\n\n\t      For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child\n\t      site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the\n\t      index page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site\n\t      frame. The Tcl command given with the command option will be\n\t      invoked between these two operations.\n\n\t      For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with\n\t      the command option will be invoked.\n\n       pathName view\n\t      Returns the currently selected page. This command is for\n\t      compatibility with the scrollbar widget.\n\n       pathName view index\n\t      Selects the page specified by index as the currently selected\n\t      page.  This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar\n\t      widget.\n\n       pathName view moveto fraction\n\t      Uses the fraction value to determine the corresponding page to\n\t      move to.\tThis command is for compatibility with the scrollbar\n\t      widget.\n\n       pathName view scroll num what\n\t      Uses the num value to determine how many pages to move forward\n\t      or backward (num can be negative or positive). The what argument\n\t      is ignored. This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar\n\t      widget."
