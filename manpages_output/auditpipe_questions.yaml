For example, the log may be cycled and new\n     records written to a new file without notice to applications that may be\n     accessing the file.\n\n     The audit facility provides an audit pipe facility for applications\n     requiring direct access to live BSM audit data for the purposes of real-\n     time monitoring.  Audit pipes are available via a clonable special\n     device, /dev/auditpipe, subject to the permissions on the device node,\n     and provide a \"tee\" of the audit event stream.  As the device is\n     clonable, more than one instance of the device may be opened at a time;\n     each device instance will provide independent access to all records."
