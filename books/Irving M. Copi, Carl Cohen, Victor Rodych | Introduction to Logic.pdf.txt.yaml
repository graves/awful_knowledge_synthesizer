    Introduction to
    
    LOGIC
    
    Irving M. Copi
    Carl Cohen
    Victor Rodych
    
    15th edition
    
    Introduction to Logic has been the gold standard in introductory logic texts for more than six decades, and for thousands of students. In this fifteenth edition, Carl Cohen and Victor Rodych update Irving M. Copi's classic text, improving on its many strengths and introducing new and helpful material that will greatly assist both students and instructors.
    
    In particular, Chapters 1, 8, and 9 have been greatly enhanced without disturbing the book's clear and gradual pedagogical approach.
    
    Specifically:
    
    ° Chapter 1 now uses a simpler and better definition of "deductive validity," which enhances the rest of the book (especially Chapters 1 and 8-10, and their new components).
    
    ° Chapter 8 now has:
    
    Simpler definitions of "simple statement" and "compound statement"
    More and more detailed examples of the Complete Truth-Table Method.
    
    ° Chapter 9 now has:
    
    A detailed, step-by-step account of the Shorter Truth-Table Method (with detailed step-by-step examples for conclusions of different types)
    A more complete and detailed account of Indirect Proof
    A detailed justification for Indirect Proof treating each of the three distinct ways in which an argument can be valid
    A new section on Conditional Proof, which complements the 19 Rules of Inference and Indirect Proof
    Explications of proofs of tautologies using both Indirect Proof and Conditional Proof
    A new section at the end of the chapter explaining the important difference between sound and demonstrative arguments.
    
    ° The Appendices now include:
    
    A new appendix on making the Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT) more efficient by selecting the most efficient sequence of STTT steps
    A new appendix on Step 1 calculations for multiple-line shorter truth tables
    A new appendix on unforced truth-value assignments, invalid arguments, and Maxims II-V.
    
    In addition, a Companion Website
    
    for Students:
    
    ° A Proof Checker
    ° Complete Truth-Table Exercises
    ° Shorter Truth-Table Exercises
    ° A Truth-Table Video
    ° Venn Diagram Testing of Syllogisms
    ° Hundreds of True/False and Multiple Choice Questions
    
    for Instructors:
    ° An Instructor's Manual
    ° A Solutions Manual

    Irving M. Copi was a logician who studied under Bertrand Russell while at the University
    of Chicago. He held appointments at, among other institutions, Princeton University,
    the University of Michigan, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Among the books
    he published before his death in 2002 was The Theory of Logical Types (Routledge, 1971).
    
    Carl Cohen is the Senior Faculty Member in the Department of Philosophy at the
    University of Michigan, having taught at this university since 1955. Among his many
    published books is his account of the battle over affirmative action at the University of
    Michigan, A Conflict of Principles (2014). His most recent book is a concise philosophical
    rejection of all forms of race preference, Both Wrong and Bad (2018).
    
    Victor Rodych is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Lethbridge. He has
    published extensively on Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics. Together
    with Timothy Pope, Rodych is working on Ludwig Wittgenstein, Writings on Mathematics
    and Logic, 1937-1944, to be published in five volumes by Cambridge University Press.

    Foreword  
    
    In a republican nation, whose citizens are to be led by persuasion and not by force, the art  
    of reasoning becomes of the first importance.  
    —Thomas Jefferson  
    
    Logic is an old subject, and since 1879 it has been a great one.  
    —Willard V. O. Quine (Methods of Logic, 1950)  
    
    Logic has sometimes been defined as the science of the laws of thought. This is inac-  
    curate. Thinking is one of the processes studied by psychologists. If thought refers to  
    any process that occurs in people's minds, not all thought is an object of study for the  
    logician. Thus, one may think of a number between one and ten without doing any  
    reasoning about it. One may also remember, imagine, free-associate, or perform any of a  
    number of mental processes. All reasoning is thinking, but not all thinking is reasoning.  
    The laws that describe the movements of the mind are psychological laws rather than  
    logical principles. To define logic in this way is to include too much.
  - |-
    Logic has also been called the science of reasoning. This is better, but reasoning is a
    kind of thinking in which inference takes place and conclusions are drawn from prem-
    ises. This process is extremely complex, characterized by a combination of trial and error,
    occasionally illuminated by flashes of insight. Logicians are not concerned with the ways
    in which the mind arrives at its conclusions in the process of reasoning; they are con-
    cerned only with the correctness of the completed process: Does the conclusion reached
    follow by necessity from the premises? The study of the methods and principles used to
    distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning is the central issue with which logic deals.
    
    Reason is the instrument on which one must depend when reliable judgments are
    needed. Nonrational instruments—feelings, beliefs, habits, hunches, and the like—are
    commonly employed, but when a great deal depends on the judgments one makes—
    when one must decide how to act in complicated circumstances, or determine what
    is true in matters that have a serious impact—reason is our best recourse; nothing can
    replace it.
    
    There are rational methods, methods well tested and confirmed, for determining
    what is true. There are well-established, rational techniques, for drawing new inferences
    from what is already known to be true. Our ignorance is vast, and therefore people
    often resort to some authority in reaching judgment—but the need for reason cannot
    be escaped even then, because one must decide which authorities deserve respect. Every
    serious intellectual pursuit comes ultimately to rely on reasoning, because there is noth-
    ing that can successfully replace it.
    
    By nature humans are endowed with powers of reasoning. Logic is the study of the
    uses of those powers. Intuitively, we may have long acted on sound principles, only partly
    grasped. With care, these principles can be brought to the surface, formulated precisely,
    and applied with confidence to problems solvable by reason. Through studying logic,
    people come first to recognize their own native capacities, then to learn to strengthen

    Whatever the sphere in which knowledge is sought—whether in science, politics,
    or in the conduct of one's private life—logic is used to reach warranted conclusions.
    In the formal study of logic, with which this book is concerned, the student will learn
    how to acquire truths and how to evaluate competing claims for truth, to critique argu-
    ments, recognize inconsistencies, detect logical fallacies, and construct formal arguments
    according to demonstrably valid inference patterns. In sum, the study of logic will help
    the student to reason more carefully and, in general, to think and act more rationally.
    
    Ideally, every college course should contribute to this end, yet many do not. Much
    that is taught in college classes soon grows out of date. But the skills of accurate think-
    ing never become obsolete, and the development of these skills lies squarely within the
    province of the study of logic. The study of logic helps us to identify arguments that
    are good and to understand why they are good. The study of logic helps us to identify
    arguments that are bad and to understand why they are bad. No study is more useful or
    more widely relevant to serious concerns than this.
    
    This considered assurance we give to our readers: A command of the fundamental
    principles of correct reasoning, which the study of this book promotes, will make a
    deeply satisfying, significant, and permanent contribution to one's intellectual life.
    Preface
    
    Through fourteen previous editions, instructors and students have warmly told us how
    Introduction to Logic has made a positive difference in their lives. We are gratified by such
    kind words, of course, but we are not content. In this, the 15th Edition of Introduction
    to Logic, we have made every effort to address and improve several core topics in our
    treatment of symbolic logic, without altering the essential structure and substance of
    the book.
  - |-
    As in all previous editions, Part I presents the basic concepts of logic. We explore
    the difficulties encountered in everyday uses of language, and the different functions of
    language. We explain the nature and functions of definitions in ordinary discourse, and
    then identify and exhibit the many informal fallacies that are commonly encountered.
    In Part II the methods of deductive reasoning are presented and analyzed. Here we first
    give an account of syllogistic logic, and then introduce the more powerful notation and
    techniques of modern symbolic logic. Finally, in Part III, the techniques of inductive logic
    are presented, beginning with the appraisal of simple analogical arguments and proceed-
    ing to an analysis of causal reasoning, and the canons of scientific method. We conclude
    with an account of alternative theories of probability, and the uses of the theorems in
    the elementary calculus of probability.
    
    In this edition of Introduction to Logic, Chapters 1, 8, and 9 have been greatly enhanced,
    without disturbing the book's clear and gradual pedagogical approach.
    
    New to This Edition
    
    ° Chapter 1 now uses a simpler and better definition of "deductive validity," which
    enhances the rest of the book (especially Chapters 1 and 8-10, and their new
    components).
    
    e Chapter 8 now has:
    
    e Simpler definitions of "simple statement" and "compound statement"
    
    ° More, and more detailed, examples of the Complete Truth-Table Method
    
    ° An updated section on ‘The Three "Laws of Thought",' reflecting the central-
    ity of the Principles of Excluded Middle and Non-Contradiction in Classical
    Symbolic Logic, and indicating some of the extensions and alternatives to
    Classical Symbolic Logic that have emerged over the last 100 years.
    
    e Chapter 9 now has:
    
    ° A detailed, step-by-step account of the Shorter Truth-Table Method (with
    detailed step-by-step examples for conclusions of different types)
    
    e A more complete and detailed account of Indirect Proof
    
    e A detailed justification for Indirect Proof treating each of the three distinct
    ways in which an argument can be valid
    
    e A new section on Conditional Proof, which complements the 19 Rules of
    Inference and Indirect Proof
    
    e Explications of proofs of tautologies using both Indirect Proof and Conditional
    Proof
  - |-
    A new section at the end of the chapter explaining the important difference between sound and demonstrative arguments.
    
    The Appendices now include:
    
    A new appendix on making the Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT) more efficient by selecting the most efficient sequence of STTT steps
    
    A new appendix on Step 1 calculations for multiple-line shorter truth tables
    
    A new appendix on unforced truth-value assignments, invalid arguments, and Maxims II-V.
    
    Introduction to Logic in all of its editions has been rich with illustrative materials and exercises taken from events and controversies in real life, from history and some classical sources, but mainly from contemporary periodicals and books. We take pride in the fact that, as our reviewers have noted, those studying Introduction to Logic are inescapably introduced to a very wide range of intellectual concerns and thus learn much more than logic. Exhibiting arguments and theories (good and bad) by illustrating them with genuine controversies in the world of college students, rather than with illustrations artificially devised for the purpose, has been our continuing concern. Logical theory is most fully grasped when it is vividly applied to contemporary human affairs. In the selection of illustrations and exercises, especially those concerning lively issues in the first years of the twenty-first century, we seek scrupulously to avoid partisanship. On all sides of controversial issues, good arguments, and bad ones, may appear. Support for one view or another in current controversy is not our proper business; the understanding and analysis of arguments is.
  - |-
    In all editions of Introduction to Logic we strove to achieve that combination of accuracy, clarity, and penetration that has always been our objective. To this end we have relied on the support and advice of students and instructors who use the book and who are sensitive to its shortcomings. We conclude, therefore, with an earnest invitation to our readers to join us in advancing this never-ending project. Send us corrections as needed, and suggestions of every kind. Your contributions, warmly welcome, may be most conveniently addressed to Carl Cohen at ccohen@umich.edu or Victor Rodych at rodych@uleth.ca. The feedback from students and instructors who rely on Introduction to Logic has helped to make it the world's most widely used book in the study of logic. We will receive your responses to it with respect and heartfelt gratitude.

    A Very Brief History of Logic  
    
    Philosophy begins with wonder. What is the world made of? Where does it come from? Why are we here? The speculations of primitive peoples were often imaginative, but were unfounded, irrational. Philosophy as we think of it today did not arise until the Greek philosophers of the sixth century sought some overriding theories about the world. Is there one stuff of which the world is made? One principle that is fundamental throughout?  
    
    We think of Socrates and Plato as the great figures in the birth of Western philosophy, and we study them still today. Their greatness lies in part in their efforts to bring things into intellectual order—to provide, or at least to seek, some coherent system that can explain why things are the way they are. But even before Socrates there had been deep thinkers—Thales, Parmenides, Heraclitus, Democritus, and others who had proposed assorted accounts of the fundamental stuff of the world, or of the fundamental principle by which all is governed.  
    
    They were theorizing, not merely guessing—but there was no real science in these early speculations. Dogmatic suppositions, supernatural forces, the gods, ancient myths and legends had always to be called upon. As philosophy gradually matured there grew the drive to know, to discover principles that could be relied upon in giving explanations.  
    
    Thus logic begins. Judgments are sought that can be tested and confirmed. The methods with which we discover and confirm whatever we really know need to be identified and refined. We must reason about things, and we hunger to understand the principles of right reasoning.  
    
    That first climb from chaotic thought into some well-ordered system of reasoning was an enterprise of extraordinary difficulty. Its first master, Aristotle (see p. 3), having developed a system within which the principles of reasoning could be precisely formulated, was rightly held in awe by rational thinkers from his day to ours. He was the first great logician.

    Aristotle approached reasoning as an activity in which we first identify classes of
    things. We then recognize the relations among these classes. Then we can manipulate
    the propositions in which these relations are specified. The fundamental elements of
    reasoning are, he thought, the groups themselves, the categories into which we can put
    things. He therefore distinguished types of categorical propositions (e.g., "All Xs are Ys"—a
    universal affirmative proposition; "Some Ys are not Xs'—a particular negative proposi-
    tion; and so on) and with those understood we can reason immediately to conclusions
    about the relations among these propositions (e.g., "If some Xs are Ys, then it cannot be
    true that no Ys are Xs"). More importantly, by combining categorical propositions
    involving three terms (say, Xs, Ys, and Zs) in various ways, we can reason accurately by
    constructing categorical syllogisms (e.g., "If all Xs are Ys, and some Xs are Zs, it must be
    that some Zs are Ys"). Using such techniques, a great system of deductive logic can be
    built, as will be shown in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of this book.
    
    A century after Aristotle the work of the Stoic philosopher, Chrysippus (see p. 7),
    carried logical analysis to a higher level. The fundamental elements of reasoning were
    taken to be not the Aristotelian categories, but propositions, the units with which we can
    affirm or deny some states of affairs (e.g., "X is in Athens," or "X is in Sparta"). We can
    then discover the logical relations among propositions: "If X is in Athens then X is not
    in Sparta." We can then identify elementary arguments that depend upon these various
    relations: "If X is in Athens then X is not in Sparta. X is in Athens. Therefore X is not in
    Sparta." The form of this simple argument, called modus ponens, is common and useful;
    many other such elementary forms may be identified and applied in rational discourse,
    as we will see in later portions of this book.
  - |-
    With these advances it soon becomes clear that the validity of a deductive argument,
    the solidity with which a conclusion may be inferred if the premises are true, depends
    upon the form of the argument, its shape rather than its content—or as logicians say,
    its syntactic features rather than its semantic content. Modus ponens, and every such
    argument form, can have an unlimited number of realizations, or instances. The conse-
    quences of this formal nature of validity remained to be investigated. With the decline
    of the Roman Empire, the work of the Greek logicians had been preserved by Muslim
    scholars, most notably Al-Farabi (c. 872-c. 950), who wrote, in Baghdad, a commentary
    on the works of Aristotle, and came to be called "the Second Teacher," second only to
    Aristotle in breadth and depth of learning. He was followed by the great Muslim poly-
    math, Ibn Sina, known by his Latinized name, Avicenna. Their scholarship eventually
    penetrated and refreshed Western thought. Syntactic forms came again to be of central
    interest in logic in the twelfth century, in France, with the work of the monk, Peter
    Abelard (1079-1142).
    
    In England the great logical figure of those early modern years was William of Ockham
    (1287-1348). He identified some of the theorems more precisely formulated many years
    later by the mathematical logician, Augustus De Morgan; De Morgan's theorems we will
    encounter and apply in Part I of this book. Ockham sought to rid metaphysics, in which
    he was chiefly interested, of useless concepts. He urged that when a term or notion has
    been shown fruitless it should be simply cut out and discarded. This imperative principle,
    "Ockham's razor," remains a common guideline: In all rational thinking, entities must
    not be multiplied beyond necessity.
  - |-
    Deductive logic had largely begun with Aristotle's compiled treatises, The Organon.  
    That logic allowed and encouraged the powerful manipulation of what is already known,  
    and that is indeed extremely useful. However, the long-studied analysis of propositions  
    and their relations did not provide the stuff of new knowledge, desperately needed and  
    widely sought in the early modern centuries. What the intellectual world required,  
    many thought, was a new Organon. That *Novum Organum* was published by Francis  
    Bacon (1561-1626) in England in 1620. The Baconian method aimed to codify the  
    procedures used by scientists when investigating all natural things. Called "the father  
    of empiricism," Bacon, with other pioneers of the scientific revolution in astronomy  
    and medicine, did not reject the work of classical logicians, but supplemented that  
    work by formulating the methods that make possible the acquisition of empirical truths.  
    Facts—what we learn about the world—constitute the premises upon which deductive  
    arguments can be built. These were the first great steps in formulating the principles of  
    inductive logic.  
    
    A Very Brief History of Logic
  - |-
    It was time to gather the threads of logical analysis, deductive and inductive, into one coherent fabric. The first textbook of logic (Logic, or the Art of Thinking), was published anonymously in 1662 by a group known as the Port-Royal logicians. The principal authors, Antoine Arnauld (famous for his published disputes with Descartes) and Pierre Nicole, were joined by Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), a great French mathematician who had invented, while a teenager, a functioning mechanical calculator. Pascal was also one of the originators of the theory of probability—a sphere of logic that we will enter in the final chapter of this book. Other textbooks followed, including Logick, or the Right Use of Reason (1725) by Isaac Watts; then Logic (1826) by Richard Whately. Then, in 1843, there was published in England one of the greatest of all logic textbooks: A System of Logic, by John Stuart Mill (1806-1873). In this work the techniques with which we uncover and confirm causal connections in the real world were for the first time set forth in accurate detail. Mill's methods, his still relevant contributions to the study of inductive logic, we discuss at length in Part II of this book.
    
    In deductive logic much creative work remained to be done. Reasoning was known to be burdened by the ambiguities and imprecision of ordinary language. One of the greatest of early modern thinkers, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), set himself the task of overcoming these deficiencies by developing a mathematically exact symbolic language, one in which concepts might be expressed with unambiguous clarity. Leibniz (also one of the independent inventors of the infinitesimal calculus) had envisioned a sort of logic machine—one with which operations of a logical nature might be performed efficiently and accurately, as can be done in the algebra that he knew well. That great logic machine he never produced, but his dream of it may be seen as the foreshadowing of the modern electronic computer.
  - |-
    A major advance toward Leibniz's goal was made by the English logician George
    Boole (see p. 189), who devised, in his Investigation into the Laws of Thought (1854),
    a general system for the accurate expression and thus manipulation of propositions.
    Propositions had played a central role in logic since the time of Aristotle and Chrysippus.
    But it was only with Boole's deep analysis of propositions—the Boolean interpretation
    discussed in great detail in Chapter 5 of this book—that a fully consistent system of the
    logic of propositions was at last possible.
    
    Other mathematicians and logicians made significant advances that brought greater
    precision and efficiency to the realm of deductive logic. One of these was Augustus
    De Morgan (1806-1871), alluded to above in connection with the work of William of
    Ockham. The theorems that still carry his name remain to this day critical logical tools
    in proving the validity of deductive arguments. Another English logician, John Venn
    (1834-1923), contributed brilliantly to the process of determining deductive validity
    by designing a system, as beautiful as it is simple, for the iconic exhibition of the rela-
    tions of the terms in categorical propositions. Venn diagrams, consisting of interlocking
    circles, are now very widely used. They serve as an easily applied device with which the
    sense of propositions can be given visual force, and with which the validity or invalidity
    of categorical syllogisms can be established. We use Venn diagrams extensively in Part
    IL of this book.
    
    One of the greatest American philosophers, Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), best
    known as the founder of the movement known as pragmatism, thought of himself pri-
    marily as a logician. Logic was for him a very broad study, involving the methods of
    all inquiry; formal deductive logic, to which he made some notable contributions, he
    took to be one of its branches. We think with signs, said Peirce, and logic is the formal

     theory of signs. He introduced some new concepts, such as inclusion and logical sum;
    he devised symbols for the expression of novel logical operations; he explored the logic
    of relations—and he anticipated work later done in expressing Boolean operations using
    the features of electrical switching circuits, a key step toward the actual development of
    the all-conquering logic machine that had been envisioned by Gottfried Leibniz.
    
    A rigorous, formal system of Propositional Logic was produced by the German logi-
    cian Gottlob Frege (1848-1925). That system, and his invention of the concept of quanti-
    fication, establish him as one of the greatest of modern logicians. With quantification—as
    we explain in detail in Chapter 10 of this book—it is possible to deal accurately with a
    huge body of deductive argument that cannot otherwise be readily penetrated by the
    machinery of modern symbolic logic.
    
    Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) sought to
    integrate all this modern work on deductive logic in one great and remarkable treatise:
    Principia Mathematica, published in three volumes in 1910, 1912, and 1913. Using (with
    some adjustments) the notation that had been devised by the Italian logician Giuseppe
    Peano (1858-1932), as well as the logical system earlier developed by Frege, Russell and
    Whitehead attempted to show that the whole of mathematics could be derived from a
    few basic logical axioms. Much of what appears in Chapters 8, 9, and 10 of this book is
    derived from their work and, more indirectly, the work of Gottlob Frege.
  - |-
    Deductive logic continued to develop. Under the leadership of the great mathematician David Hilbert (1862-1943), the completeness and decidability of axiomatic systems became a matter of great interest in the twentieth century. In his 1929 Ph.D. Dissertation, Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) proved the completeness of First Order Predicate Logic (Chapter 10). A year later, Gödel shocked the worlds of logic and mathematics by demonstrating that for any consistent axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers, there are undecidable propositions, such that neither proposition B nor its negation ~B is derivable in the system. Other aspects of deductive logic have been more recently investigated: the distinction between "fuzzy" and "crisp" logic has been explored; modal logic, in which the concepts of possibility and necessity are manipulated, has been highly developed.
    
    But perhaps nothing that modern logicians have accomplished has had more profound impact than the development—by Alan Turing (1912-1954), John von Neumann (1903-1957), and others—of a rigorous concept of computability and the intellectual architecture of the circuits of digital computers. Not long thereafter, with the actual construction and gradual perfection of the electronic digital computer during the twentieth century, Leibniz's great vision was at last made real.

    The account above sketches the history of logic in the West, mainly in Europe and
    North America. Elsewhere on the planet logic was also studied, of course—but we do not
    have accessible and accurate records of the discoveries made long ago in China and India.
    We know that in India much work had been done on the principles of logic. Augustus
    De Morgan was influenced by that work; the theorems that bear his name, explained in
    Chapter 9 of this book, were developed independently in India. George Boole was influ-
    enced by Indian thinkers as well. The rules of immediate inference, discussed in this book
    in Chapter 5, appear also to have been articulated in India, but logic there emphasized
    effective philosophical argumentation, including both deductive and inductive elements,
    rather than formal systems. In China, at the time of the philosopher Mozi (470-391 BCE),
    the principles of analogical reasoning, discussed in Chapter 11 of this book, were devel-
    oped. But of that history we cannot be sure, because in the years 213-206 BCE the Qin
    dynasty, to erase all marks of preceding dynasties, burned many books and killed many
    scholars. Much work done in earlier periods was thus permanently lost.
    
    From the time of Aristotle's Organon to the twenty-first century more people have
    studied logic from one book than from any other; that book, now in your hands, is
    Introduction to Logic, originally conceived and written by one of the most powerful and
    incisive thinkers of the twentieth century, the late Irving M. Copi (1917-2002).

    When we reason about any matter, we produce arguments to support our conclu-
    sions. Our arguments include reasons that we think justify our beliefs. However, not all
    reasons are good reasons. Therefore we may always ask, when we confront an argument:
    Does the conclusion reached follow from the premises assumed? To answer this ques-
    tion there are objective criteria; in the study of logic we seek to discover and apply those
    criteria.
    
    Reasoning is not the only way in which people support assertions they make or
    accept. They may appeal to authority or to emotion, which can be very persuasive, or
    they may rely, without reflection, simply on habits. However, when someone wants to
    make judgments that can be completely relied upon, their only solid foundation will be
    correct reasoning. Using the methods and techniques of logic—the subject matter of this
    book—one can distinguish reliably between sound and faulty reasoning.
    
    4.2) Propositions and Arguments
    
    We begin by examining more closely the most fundamental concepts in the study of
    logic, concepts presupposed in the paragraphs just above. In reasoning we construct and
    evaluate arguments; arguments are built with propositions. Although these concepts are
    apparently simple, they require careful analysis.
    
    1.2 Propositions and Arguments
    
    A. Propositions
    
    Propositions are the building blocks of our reasoning. A proposition asserts that some-
    thing is the case or it asserts that something is not. We may affirm a proposition, or deny
    it—but every proposition either asserts what really is the case, or it asserts something that
    is not. Therefore every proposition is either true or false.
    
    Aristotle
    
    Of all the great philosophers and logicians, ancient and modern, none is greater than
    Aristotle (384-322 BCE), whose works and influence largely ruled the world of intellect for
    two millennia. He was often referred to as "The Philosopher"; his authority (even when he
    was mistaken!) was rarely questioned.
  - |-
    Born in Macedonia, in the city of Stagira, where his father was physician to the king,
    he was viewed from birth as a member of the aristocracy, and was a friend of the king's
    son, Philip. When Philip became king of Macedonia, he summoned Aristotle, who had for
    many years been studying in Athens at Plato's school, The Academy, to return to Macedonia
    as tutor to his son Alexander (who later would be known as Alexander the Great). As he
    advanced on his subsequent conquests in Asia, Alexander remained in contact with his
    respected teacher, sending back, at Aristotle's request, specimens and artifacts that contrib-
    uted to the early growth of the sciences.
    
    Aristotle—one of the trio, with Plato and Socrates, who largely
    founded Western philosophy—had a truly encyclopedic mind. He
    investigated, contributed to, wrote about, and taught virtually all sub-
    jects on which some knowledge had been accumulated at his time: the
    natural sciences (biology, zoology, embryology, anatomy, astronomy,
    meteorology, physics, and optics); the arts (poetry, music, theater, and
    rhetoric); government and politics; psychology and education; eco-
    nomics; ethics; metaphysics—and of course logic, of which he alone
    was the systematic founder. His treatises on logic, later combined into
    one great work entitled The Organon ("The Instrument"), constitute
    the earliest formal study of our subject. The penetration and coher-
    ence of his logical analyses, and the comprehensiveness and general
    accuracy of his scientific studies, justify his acknowledged status as
    one of the finest thinkers ever to have graced our planet.
    
    At the age of 49 Aristotle returned to Athens and established
    his own highly influential school, the Lyceum, where he taught for
    twelve years. He died of natural causes in 322 BCE. In his will, he asked
    to be buried next to his wife, Pythias.
    
    In logic Aristotle grasped the overriding necessity of determining
    the rules of correct reasoning. He explained validity and characterized the four fundamen-
    tal types of categorical propositions and their relations. In the Prior Analytics, one of the

    its truth or falsity may
    be unknown.

    Statement
    
    A proposition; what
    is typically asserted
    by a declarative
    sentence, but not
    the sentence itself.
    Every statement
    must be either true
    or false, although
    the truth or falsity
    of a given statement
    may be unknown.
    
    six books of The Organon, he developed a sophisticated theoretical account of categorical
    syllogisms, an account that long dominated the realm of deductive logic and that remains
    today an effective tool of sound reasoning.
    
    It is said of Aristotle that he was probably the last person to know everything there was
    to be known in his own time.
    
    There are many propositions about whose truth we are uncertain. "There is life on
    some other planet in our galaxy," for example, is a proposition that, so far as we now
    know, may be true or may be false. Its "truth value" is unknown, but this proposition,
    like every proposition, must be either true or false.
    
    A question asserts nothing, and therefore it is not a proposition. "Do you know
    how to play chess?" is indeed a sentence, but that sentence makes no claim about the
    world. Neither is a command a proposition ("Come quickly!"), nor is an exclamation
    a proposition ("Oh my gosh!"). Questions, commands, and exclamations—unlike
    propositions—are neither true nor false.
    
    When we assert some proposition, we do so using a sentence in some language.
    However, the proposition we assert is not identical to that sentence. This is evident
    because two different sentences, consisting of different words differently arranged, may
    have the same meaning and may be used to assert the very same proposition. For exam-
    ple, "Leslie won the election" and "The election was won by Leslie" are plainly two dif-
    ferent sentences that make the same assertion.
    
    Sentences are always parts of some language, but propositions are not tied to English
    or to any given language. The four sentences
    
    It is raining. (English)
    Esta lloviendo. (Spanish)
    Il pleut. (French)

    are in different languages, but they have a single meaning: all four, using different words,
    may be uttered to assert the very same proposition. Proposition is the term we use to refer
    to what it is that declarative sentences are typically used to assert.
    
    The term statement is not an exact synonym of proposition, but it is often used in
    logic in much the same sense. Some logicians prefer statement to proposition, although
    the latter has been more commonly used in the history of logic. Other logicians eschew
    both terms as metaphysical, using only the term sentence. However, the concept of a
    proposition is seen by many as making a useful distinction between a sentence and what
    the sentence asserts. Consequently, in this book we use both terms.
    
    The very same sentence can be used to make very different statements (or to assert
    very different propositions), depending on the context in which it is expressed. For
    example, the sentence, "The largest state in the United States was once an independent
    republic," once expressed a true statement or proposition (about Texas), but if asserted
    today would express a false statement or proposition (about Alaska). We use the same
    words, the very same sentence, to assert different propositions at different times.
    
    Propositions may be simple, like those used in the preceding illustrations, but they may
    also be compound, containing other propositions within themselves. Consider the follow-
    ing proposition, from a 2007 account of the exploitation of the Amazon Basin in Brazil:
    1.2 Propositions and Arguments
    
    The Amazon Basin produces roughly 20 percent of the Earth's oxygen, creates much of its own rainfall, and
    harbors many unknown species. |
    
    This sentence simultaneously asserts three propositions, concerning what the Amazon
    Basin produces and what it creates and what it harbors. The passage thus constitutes a
    conjunctive proposition. Asserting a conjunctive proposition is equivalent to asserting
    each of its component propositions separately.
    
    Some compound propositions do not assert the truth of their components. In disjunc-
    tive (or alternative) propositions, no one of the components is asserted. Abraham Lincoln
    (in a message to Congress in December 1861) said, "Circuit courts are useful, or they are
    not useful." This disjunctive proposition is plainly true, but either one of its components
    might be false.

    Other compound propositions that do not assert their components are hypothetical (or conditional) propositions. The eighteenth-century freethinker, Voltaire, said, "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." Here, again, neither of the two components is asserted. The proposition "God does not exist," is not asserted, nor is the proposition, "it is necessary to invent him." Only the "if-then" proposition is asserted by the hypothetical or conditional statement, and that compound statement might be true even if both of its components were false.
    
    In logic, the internal structure of propositions is important. To evaluate an argument we need a full understanding of the propositions that appear in that argument. Propositions of many different kinds will be analyzed in this book.
    
    B. Arguments
    
    With propositions as building blocks, we construct arguments. In any argument we affirm one proposition on the basis of one or more other propositions. In doing this, an inference is drawn: one proposition is inferred from one or more other propositions. Some inferences (arguments) are warranted (or correct); others are not. The logician analyzes the relations between propositions, examining the propositions on which an inference is based and the proposition inferred. Such a cluster of propositions constitutes an argument. Arguments are the chief concern of logic.
    
    In everyday discourse, the word "argument" is used in two distinct senses: sometimes we mean dispute, and sometimes we mean inference. The first sense of the word is operative, for example, when we say that Jerome and Megan had an argument about where to go on their vacation. In this case we mean they had a dispute, where a dispute is a disagreement involving multiple people. In logic, however, argument is a technical term, designed to make the meaning of "argument" as inference more rigorous. In logic, argument refers strictly to any group of propositions of which one is claimed to be supported by the other(s). An inference, from one or more propositions to an inferred proposition, is an argument.

    In writing or in speech, a passage will often contain several related propositions
    and yet contain no argument. An argument is not merely a collection of propositions;
    it is a cluster with a structure that captures or exhibits some inference. We describe this
    structure with the terms conclusion and premise. The conclusion of an argument is the
    proposition that is affirmed on the basis of the other propositions of the argument. Those
    other propositions, which are affirmed (or assumed) as providing support for the conclu-
    sion, are the premises of the argument. The conclusion of an argument is inferred from

    the premises from

    an inference—

    propositions.

    In any argument, the
    proposition to which the
    other propositions in the

    to give support, or for
    which they are given as
    reasons. The conclusion
    is the proposition
    inferred from one or
    more other propositions
    (.e., the premises).
    
    Premises
    
    In an argument, the
    propositions upon
    which the inference is
    based; the propositions
    that are claimed to
    provide grounds or
    reasons for the inferred
    conclusion.
    
    Chapter 1
    
    Basic Logical Concepts
    
    the premises of the argument. Thus, in the technical sense of logic, an argument consists
    of one or more premises and a conclusion inferred from the premise(s). The structure of
    an argument is
    
    Premises > Conclusion
    
    where the arrow indicates that the direction of an inference is from premises to a conclu-
    sion. We will usually write arguments vertically, so we can show an argument and the
    relation between its premises and its conclusion as follows.
    
    Premises
    
    U
    
    Conclusion
    
    It is customary to use the ‘..' symbol to mean ‘therefore,' so the structure given by the
    foregoing diagram will typically be exhibited as:
    
    Premise
    Premise
    -. Conclusion

    All three of these indicate, as is necessary, which propositions are premises and which proposition is the conclusion.
    
    We will encounter a vast range of arguments in this book—arguments of many different kinds, on many different topics. We will analyze arguments in politics, in ethics, in sports, in religion, in science, in law, and in everyday life. Those who defend these arguments, or who attack them, are usually aiming to establish the truth (or the falsehood) of the conclusions drawn. As logicians, however, our interest is in the arguments as such. As agents or as citizens we may be deeply concerned about the truth or falsity of the conclusions drawn. However, as logicians we put those interests aside, for we are concerned with the form of an argument, not with its content. Our task is to determine how well the premises support the conclusion, and, for deductive arguments, whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
    
    Arguments vary greatly in the degree of their complexity. Some are very simple. Other arguments, as we will see, are quite intricate, sometimes because of the structure or formulation of the propositions they contain, sometimes because of the relations among the premises, and sometimes because of the relations between premises and conclusion.
    
    The simplest kind of argument consists of one premise and a conclusion that is claimed to be supported by it. Each may be stated in a separate sentence, as in the following argument that, until 2016, appeared on or in biology textbooks in the state of Alabama:
    
    No one was present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.
    
    1.2 Propositions and Arguments
    
    Both premise and conclusion may be stated within the same sentence, as in this argument arising out of recent advances in the science of human genetics:
    
    Since it turns out that all humans are descended from a small number of African ancestors in our recent evolutionary past, believing in profound differences between the races is as ridiculous as believing in a flat earth.'
    
    Chrysippus
  - |-
    Of all the logicians of ancient times, Aristotle and Chrysippus stand out as the two greatest. The enormous influence of Aristotle, who first systematized logic and was its principal authority for two thousand years, has already been recognized. Born a century later, Chrysippus (c. 279-c. 206 sce) developed a conceptual scheme whose influence has only more recently been appreciated.
    
    The logic of Aristotle was one of classes. In the Aristotelian argument "All men are mortal; Greeks are men; therefore Greeks are mortal," the fundamental elements are the categories, or terms ("men," "mortal things," and "Greeks"). In contrast, the logic of Chrysippus was one built of propositions and the connections between them (e.g.,
    "Tf it is now day, it is now light. It is now day. Therefore it is now
    light."). This simple argument form (now called modus ponens) and
    many other fundamental argument forms, Chrysippus analyzed and
    classified. His logical insights were creative and profound.
    
    Born in Asia Minor, in Soli, Chrysippus studied the philosophy
    of the Stoics—most famous among them Zeno and Cleanthes—and
    eventually became head of the Stoic school in Athens. In that capac-
    ity he taught the need to control one's emotions, which he thought
    to be disorders or diseases. He urged the patient acceptance of the
    outcomes of a fate one cannot control, and the recognition that
    the one God (of which the traditional Greek gods are but aspects) is
    the universe itself.
    
    But it is as a logician that his influence has been greatest. He
    grasped the central role of the proposition—"that which is, in itself,
    capable of being denied or affirmed." From this base he developed the
    first coherent system of Propositional Logic.
    
    Biography
    
    The order in which premises and conclusion appear can also vary, but it is not critical
    in determining the quality of the argument. It is common for the conclusion of an argu-
    ment to precede the statement of its premise or premises. On the day Babe Ruth hit his
    700th home run (13 July 1934), the following argument appeared in The New York Times:
  - |-
    A record that promises to endure for all time was attained on Navin Field today when Babe Ruth smashed
    his seven-hundredth home run in a lifetime career. It promises to live, first because few players in history have
    enjoyed the longevity on the diamond of the immortal Bambino, and, second, because only two other players
    in the history of baseball have hit more than 300 home runs.
    
    chapter 1
    
    Basic Logical Concepts
    
    This is an example of an argument whose two premises, each numbered, appear
    after the conclusion is stated. It is also an example of a very plausible argument whose
    conclusion is false, given that Hank Aaron hit his 700th home run on 21 July 1973,
    thirty-nine years later.
    
    Even when premise and conclusion are united in one sentence, the conclusion of
    the argument may come first. The English utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham,
    presented this crisp argument in his Principles of Legislation (1802):
    
    Every law is an evil, for every law is an infraction of liberty.
    
    Although this is only one short sentence, it is an argument because it contains two
    propositions, of which the first (every law is an evil) is the conclusion and the second
    (every law is an infraction of liberty) is the premise. However, no single proposition can
    be an argument, because an argument consists of at least one premise and a conclusion.
    Yet some propositions, because they are compound, do sound like arguments, and care
    must be taken to distinguish them from the arguments they resemble. Consider the fol-
    lowing hypothetical proposition:
    
    If a state aims to be a society composed of equals, then a state that is based on the middle class is bound
    to be the best constituted.
    
    Neither the first nor the second component of this proposition is asserted. All that is
    asserted is that the former implies the latter, and both might well be false. No inference
    is drawn, no conclusion is claimed to be true. Aristotle, who studied the constitution and
    quality of actual states in Greece more than two thousand years ago, wrote confidently
    in Politics, Book IV, Chapter 11:
    
    A state aims at being a society composed of equals, and therefore a state that is based on the middle class
    is bound to be the best constituted.
  - |-
    In this case we do have an argument. This argument of Aristotle is short and simple;
    most arguments are longer and more complicated. Every argument, however—short or
    long, simple or complex—consists of a group of propositions of which one is the conclu-
    sion and the other(s) are the premises offered to support it.
    
    Although every argument is a structured cluster of propositions, not every struc-
    tured cluster of propositions is an argument. Consider the following 2006 account of
    global inequality:
    
    In the same world in which more than a billion people live at a level of affluence never previously known,
    roughly a billion other people struggle to survive on the purchasing power equivalent of less than one U.S.
    dollar per day. Most of the world's poorest people are undernourished—lack access to safe drinking water
    or even the most basic health services and cannot send their children to school. According to UNICEF, more
    than 10 million children die every year—about 30,000 per day—trom avoidable, poverty-related causes.*
    
    This report is deeply troubling—but there is no argument here.
    
    Reasoning is an art, as well as a science. It is something we do, as well as something
    we understand. Giving reasons for our beliefs comes naturally, but skill in the art of build-
    ing arguments, and testing them, requires practice. One who has practiced and strength-
    ened these skills is more likely to reason correctly than one who has never thought about
    the principles involved. Therefore we provide in this book very many opportunities for
    practice in the analysis of arguments.

    1.3 | Recognizing Arguments
    
    Before we can evaluate an argument, we must recognize it. We must be able to distinguish
    argumentative passages in writing or speech. Doing this assumes, of course, an under-
    standing of the language of the passage. However, even with a thorough comprehension
    of the language, the identification of an argument can be problematic because of the
    peculiarities of its formulation. Even when we are confident that an argument is intended
    in some context, we may be unsure about which propositions are serving as its premises
    and which as its conclusion. As we have seen, that judgment cannot be made on the basis
    of the order in which the propositions appear. How then shall we proceed?
    
    A. Conclusion Indicators and Premise Indicators
    
    One useful method depends on the appearance of certain common indicators, certain
    words or phrases that typically serve to signal the appearance of an argument's conclu-
    sion or of its premises. Here is a partial list of conclusion indicators:
    
    for these reasons

    for this reason which points to the conclusion that
    thus we may infer
    
    Other words or phrases typically serve to mark the premises of an argument and
    hence are called premise indicators. Usually, but not always, what follows any one of
    these will be the premise of some argument. Here is a partial list of premise indicators:

    argument.

    B. Arguments in Context
    
    The words and phrases we have listed may help to indicate the presence of an argument
    or identify its premises or conclusion, but such indicators do not necessarily appear.
    Sometimes it is just the meaning of the passage, or its setting, that indicates the presence
    of an argument. For example, during the intense controversy over the deployment of
    additional U.S. troops to Iraq in 2007, one critic of that deployment wrote:
    
    As we send our young men and women abroad to bring order to Iraq, many of its so-called leaders have
    abandoned their posts. We have given the Iraqis an opportunity to iron out their differences and they throw
    it back in our faces. Iraq does not deserve our help.°
    
    No premise indicators or conclusion indicators are used here, yet the argument is clear.
    Indicators are also absent in the following argument in Sam Harris's Letter to a Christian
    Nation, whose premises and conclusions are unmistakable:
    
    Half the American population believes that the universe is 6,000 years old. They are wrong about this.
    Declaring them so is not "irreligious intolerance." It is intellectual honesty.®

    Often, however, the force of an argument can be appreciated only when one under-
    stands the context in which that argument is presented. For example, the undergraduate
    admission system of the University of Michigan that gave a fixed number of extra points
    to all members of certain minority groups was held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme
    Court in Gratz v. Bollinger in 2003. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, defending the
    Michigan system with the following argument:
    
    Universities will seek to maintain their minority enrollment ... whether or not they can do so in full candor... .
    [They] may resort to camouflage. If honesty is the best policy, surely Michigan's accurately described, fully
    disclosed College affirmative action program is preferable to achieving similar numbers through winks, nods,
    and disguises.'
    
    This argument derives its force from the realization that universities had in fact long
    disguised their preferential admission programs to avoid attacks based on the equal protec-
    tion clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Chief Justice William
    Rehnquist's response to Justice Ginsburg's argument is also intelligible only in the context
    of her defense of the preferential admission system. Rehnquist wrote the following:
    
    These observations are remarkable for two reasons. First, they suggest that universities—to whose academic
    judgment we are told we should defer—will pursue their affirmative action programs whether or not they
    violate the United States Constitution. Second, they recommend that these violations should be dealt with,
    not by requiring the Universities to obey the Constitution, but by changing the Constitution so that it conforms
    to the conduct of the universities.®
    
    Rehnquist's reference to "changing the Constitution" must be understood in
    light of the fact that the Michigan undergraduate admission system had been held
    1.3. Recognizing Arguments
    
    unconstitutional. His reference to the pursuit of affirmative action programs "whether
    or not they violate the United States Constitution" can best be understood in light of
    Ginsburg's earlier reference to the possible use of "winks, nods, and disguises."
  - |-
    The full force of argument and counterargument can be grasped, in most circumstances, only with an understanding of the context in which those arguments are presented. In real life, context is critical. For example, if you are told that I am bringing a lobster home for dinner, you will have little doubt that I intend to eat it, not feed it.
    
    C. Premises or Conclusions Not in Declarative Form
    
    It is not uncommon for the premises of an argument to be presented in the form of questions. However, if questions assert nothing, and do not express propositions, how is this possible? On the surface they make no assertions; beneath the surface an interrogative sentence can serve as a premise when its question is rhetorical—that is, when it suggests or assumes an answer that is made to serve as the premise of an argument. The sentence may be interrogative even though its meaning is declarative.
    
    This use of questions is sometimes obvious, as in a letter dated 7 January 2007 to The New York Times, objecting to a new series of U.S. coins that will honor former presidential wives. Irit R. Rasooly wrote:
    
    "I am irked by the new set of coins being issued. While some first ladies have influenced our country, should we bestow this honor on people who are unelected, whose only credential is having a prominent spouse?"
    
    Plainly, the critic means to affirm the proposition that we should not bestow this honor on such people. He continues:
    
    "Wouldn't honoring women who have served as governors, Supreme Court justices or legislators be a more fitting tribute to this nation's women than coins featuring 'First Spouses'?"
    
    This critic obviously believes that honoring such achievements would be a more fitting tribute, but he again expresses that proposition with a question. His letter also provides an illustration of the need to rely on context to interpret declarative statements that are actually made. The writer's report that he is "irked" by the new set of coins is no doubt true, but this statement is more than a mere description of his state of mind; he means to express the judgment that such a set of coins ought not to be issued.

    Using questions to express a premise is sometimes counterproductive, however,
    because it may invite answers (by the listener, or silently by the reader) that threaten the
    conclusion at which the argument aims. For example, the archbishop of the Anglican
    Church in Nigeria, who is an ardent opponent of homosexuality and views it as deeply
    sinful, argues thus:
    
    Why didn't God make a lion to be a man's companion? Why didn't He make a tree to be a man's companion?
    Or better still, why didn't He make another man to be a man's companion? So even from the creation story
    you can see that the mind of God, God's intention, is for man and woman to be together.
    
    Conclusions drawn about God's intentions, using as premises questions that invite a
    
    myriad of different responses, may be undermined by the answers they elicit.
    Questions can serve most effectively as premises when the answers assumed really do
    
    seem to be clear and inescapable. In such cases the readers (or hearers) are led to provide
    
    Rhetorical question
    A sentence or
    utterance used to
    
    make a statement, but
    which, because it is in
    interrogative form and
    is therefore neither
    
    true nor false, does not
    literally assert anything.
    
    Chapter 1
    
    Basic Logical Concepts
    
    the apparently evident answers for themselves, thus augmenting the persuasiveness
    of the argument. Here is an example: Some who find euthanasia morally unacceptable
    reject the defense of that practice as grounded in the right to self-determination pos-
    sessed by the terminally ill patient. They argue as follows:
    
    If a right to euthanasia is grounded in self-determination, it cannot reasonably be limited to the terminally
    ill. If people have a right to die, why must they wait until they are actually dying before they are permitted
    to exercise that right?
  - |-
    The question is forceful because its answer appears to be undeniable. It seems obvious that there is no good reason why, if people have a right to die grounded in self-determination, they must wait until they are dying to exercise that right. Hence (this critique concludes) the right to euthanasia, if there is one, cannot be limited to the terminally ill. The argument has much merit, but from the perspective of its religious advocates, it may prove to be a two-edged sword.
    
    Arguments that depend on rhetorical questions are always suspect. Because the question is neither true nor false, it may be serving as a device to suggest the truth of some proposition while avoiding responsibility for asserting it. That proposition is likely to be dubious, and it may in fact be false. To illustrate: In 2007 Arab leaders in Jerusalem expressed great anxiety about the safety of the Al-Aqsa mosque when the Israeli government began construction of a ramp leading to the platform (also sacred to the Jews) on which that very holy mosque is situated. In reviewing the situation, David Gelernter, an Israeli partisan asked: "Is it possible that Arab leaders are more interested in attacking Israel than protecting religious and cultural monuments?" Well, yes, that is possible, of course—but it may not be true, and the question framed in this way is plainly intended to cause the reader to believe that Arab leaders were being duplicitous in voicing their concerns. Did the author assert that such duplicity lay behind the Arab objections? No, he didn't say!
    
    Gossip columnists thrive on suggestive questions. Celebrity tidbits commonly appear in the form, "Does Paris Hilton have any talent as an actress?" Similarly, in discussing social issues, rhetorical questions can be an effective method of covert assertion. When riots in France spread through Islamic neighborhoods, many wondered what motivated those rioters. Journalist Christopher Caldwell wrote:
    
    Were they admirers of France's majority culture, frustrated at not being able to join it on equal terms? Or did they simply aspire to burn to the ground a society they despised?"
  - |-
    Accusers who protect themselves by framing their accusations in interrogative sentences may shield themselves from the indignant complaints of their target. "No," they may insist, "that is not what I said!"
    
    It is wise policy to refrain from arguing with questions.
    
    In some arguments the conclusion appears in the form of an imperative. The reason, or reasons, we ought to perform a given act are set forth as premises, and we are then directed to act in that way. Thus in Proverbs 4:7 we read:
    
    Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom.
    
    Here the second clause is a command, and a command, like a question, is neither true nor false and cannot express a proposition. Therefore, strictly speaking, it cannot be the conclusion of an argument. Nonetheless, it surely is meant to be the conclusion of an argument in this passage from Proverbs. How can we explain this apparent inconsistency? It is useful in many contexts to regard a command as no different from a proposition in which hearers (or readers) are told that they would be wise to act, or ought to act, in the manner specified in the command. Thus the conclusion of the argument in Proverbs may be rephrased as "Getting wisdom is what you should do." Assertions of this kind may be true or false, as most will agree. What difference there is between a command to do something and a statement that it should be done is an issue that need not be explored here. By ignoring that difference (if there really is one), we are able to deal uniformly with arguments whose conclusions are expressed in this form.
    
    Reformulations of this kind can clarify the roles of an argument's constituent propositions. It is necessary to grasp the substance of what is being asserted, to understand which claims are serving to support which inferences, whatever their external forms. Some needed reformulations are merely grammatical. A proposition that functions as a premise may take the form of a phrase rather than a declarative sentence. This is well illustrated in the following argumentative passage, whose conclusion is a very sharp criticism of the United States:
  - |-
    What is a failed state? It is one that fails to provide security for the population, to guarantee rights at home or abroad, or to maintain functioning democratic institutions. On this definition the United States is the world's biggest failed state.
    
    The second and third premises of this argument are compressed into phrases, but the propositions for which these phrases are shorthand are clear enough, and their critical role in the author's reasoning is evident.
    
    D. Unstated Propositions
    
    Arguments are sometimes obscure because one (or more) of their constituent propositions is not stated but is assumed to be understood. An illustration will be helpful here.
    The chair of the Department of Sociology at City College, CUNY, presented two strong but controversial arguments, in parallel, regarding the justifiability of the death penalty. The first premise of each argument is the hypothesis that the factual belief (of the proponent, or of the opponent, of the penalty) about what does in fact deter homicide is mistaken. The second premise of each argument, although entirely plausible, is not stated, leaving the reader the task of reconstructing it.
    The first argument went like this:
    
    If the proponent of the death penalty is incorrect in his belief that the [death] penalty deters homicide, then
    he is responsible for the execution of murderers who should not be executed. "4"
    
    This argument relies on the unstated second premise: "No one should be executed to advance an objective that is not promoted by execution." Hence one who mistakenly believes that the objective (deterring murders) is achieved by executing those convicted is responsible for the execution of murderers who should not be executed.
    
    The second argument went like this:
    
    If the opponent of the death penalty is incorrect in his belief that the death penalty doesn't deter, he is
    responsible for the murder of innocent individuals who would not have been murdered if the death penalty
    had been invoked."
    
    chapter 1 Basic Logical Concepts
    
    Enthymeme
    
    An argument that is
    stated incompletely, the
    unstated part of it being
    taken for granted.
  - |-
    This argument relies on the unstated second premise: "Protecting the lives of innocent individuals from murder justifies the execution of murderers if other murderers are then deterred by the fear of execution." Hence one who mistakenly believes that the death penalty does not deter murderers is responsible for the lives of innocents who are subsequently murdered.
    
    In each of these arguments the assumed but unstated second premise is plausible. One might find both arguments persuasive—leaving open for empirical investigation the question of whether, in fact, the death penalty does deter murder. However, the force of each of the arguments depends on the truth of the unstated premise on which it relies.
    
    A premise may be left unstated because the arguer supposes that it is unquestioned common knowledge. In the controversy over the cloning of human beings, one angry critic wrote:
    
    "Human cloning—like abortion, contraception, pornography and euthanasia—is intrinsically evil and thus should never be allowed."®
    
    This is plainly an argument, but part of it is missing. The argument relies on the very plausible but unstated premise that "what is intrinsically evil should never be allowed." Arguments in everyday discourse very often rely on some proposition that is understood but not stated. Such arguments are called enthymemes. We will examine them more closely later in this book.
    
    The unstated premise on which an enthymeme relies may not be universally accepted; it may be uncertain or controversial. An arguer may deliberately refrain from formulating that critical premise, believing that by allowing it to remain tacit, the premise is shielded from attack. For example, medical research using embryonic stem cells (cells found in the human embryo that can develop into other types of cells and into most types of tissue) is highly controversial. One U.S. senator used the following enthymeme in attacking legislation that would permit government financing of such research:
    
    "This research [involving the use of embryonic stem cells] is illegal, for this reason: The deliberate killing of a human embryo is an essential component of the contemplated research.""
  - |-
    The stated premise is true: Research of this kind is not possible without destroying the embryo. However, the conclusion that such research is illegal depends on the unstated premise that the killing of a human embryo is illegal—and that claim is very much in dispute.
    
    The effectiveness of an enthymeme may depend on the hearer's knowledge that some proposition is false. To emphasize the falsity of some proposition, a speaker may construct an argument in which the first premise is a hypothetical proposition of which the antecedent (the "if" component), is the proposition whose falsity the speaker wishes to show, and the consequent (the "then" component) is a proposition known by everyone to be false. The unstated falsehood of this second component is the second premise of the enthymematic argument. The unstated falsehood of the first component is the conclusion of the argument. To illustrate: The distinguished political philosopher John Rawls admired Abraham Lincoln as the president who most appreciated the moral equality of human beings. Rawls frequently quoted Lincoln's enthymematic argument, "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong."* It is of course wildly false to say that nothing is wrong—from which it follows that it is equally false to say that slavery is not wrong. Similarly, distinguished psychiatrist Bruno Bettelheim, survivor of both Dachau and Buchenwald, wrote: "If all men are good, then there never was an Auschwitz."
    
    1.4 | Arguments and Explanations
    
    Passages that appear to be arguments are sometimes not arguments but explanations. The appearance of words that are common indicators—such as "because," "for," "since," and "therefore"—cannot settle the matter, because those words are used both in explanations and in arguments (although "since" can sometimes refer to temporal succession). We need to know the intention of the author. Compare the following two passages:
    
    1. Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
    
    —Matt. 7:19
  - |-
    2. Therefore is the name of it [the tower] called Babel; because the Lord did there con-
    found the language of all the earth.
    —Gen. 11:19
    
    The first passage is clearly an argument. Its conclusion, that one ought to lay up
    treasures in heaven, is supported by the premise (here marked by the word "for") that
    one's heart will be where one's treasure is laid up. The second passage, which uses the
    word "therefore" quite appropriately, is not an argument. It explains why the tower
    (whose construction is recounted in Genesis) is called Babel. The tower was given this
    name, we are told, because it was the place where humankind, formerly speaking one
    language, became confounded by many languages—the name is derived from a Hebrew
    word meaning "to confound." The passage assumes that the reader knows that the tower
    had that name; the intention is to explain why that name was given to it. The phrase,
    "Therefore is the name of it called Babel," is not a conclusion but a completion of the
    explanation of the naming. In addition, the clause, "because the Lord did there confound
    the language of all the earth," is not a premise; it could not serve as a reason for believing
    that Babel was the name of the tower, because the fact that that was the name is known
    by those to whom the passage is addressed. In this context, "because" indicates that what
    follows will explain the giving of that name, Babel, to that tower.
    
    These two passages illustrate the fact that superficially similar passages may have
    very different functions. Whether some passage is an argument or an explanation
    depends on the purpose to be served by it. If our aim is to establish the truth of some
    proposition, Q, and we offer some evidence, P, in support of Q, we may appropriately
    say "Q because P." In this case we are giving an argument for Q, and P is our premise.
    Alternatively, suppose that Q is known to be true. In that case we don't have to give
    any reasons to support its truth, but we may wish to give an account of why it is true.
    Here also we may say "Q because P"—but in this case we are giving not an argument
    for Q, but an explanation of Q.

    In responding to a query about the apparent color of quasars (celestial objects lying
    far beyond our galaxy), one scientist wrote:
    
    The most distant quasars look like intense points of infrared radiation. This is because space is scattered with
    hydrogen atoms (about two per cubic meter) that absorb blue light, and if you filter the blue from visible
    white light, red is what's left. On its multibillion-light-year journey to earth quasar light loses so much blue
    that only infrared remains.
    
    Chapter 1
    
    Basic Logical Concepts
    
    The author is not seeking to convince his reader that quasars have the apparent color
    they do, but rather giving the causes of this fact; he is explaining, not arguing.
    
    However, it may be difficult at times to determine whether an author intends to
    be explaining some state of affairs, or to be arguing for some conclusion that is critical in that explanation. Here, for example, is a passage that may be interpreted in
    either way.
    
    I would like to highlight another property of water, unique but also vital to making life on Earth possible.
    As water cools, approaching its freezing point, its density suddenly decreases, reversing the usual "natural
    convection" patterns in which colder fluids sink. This reversal causes the coldest strata of water to rise to
    the top of an ocean or lake. These large bodies of water now freeze from the top down. Were it not for this
    unique property of water, the oceans and lakes would have long and completely frozen over from the bottom
    up with dire consequences for any life-sustaining liquid water on Earth.
    
    More than one conclusion may be inferred from the same premise, thus presenting
    two arguments. Similarly, more than one thing may be accounted for by the same fact,
    thus presenting two explanations. Here is an illustration:
    
    The Oxford English Dictionary is a historical dictionary, providing citations meant to show the evolution of
    every word, beginning with the earliest known usage. Therefore, a key task, and a popular sport for thousands
    of volunteer word aficionados, is antedating: finding earlier citations than those already known."
    
    That antedating is a key task for the makers of that dictionary is accounted for by the fact
    that the Oxford English Dictionary is a historical dictionary. This fact about the dictionary
    also explains why, for word aficionados, antedating is a popular sport.

    EXERCISES
    
    Some of the following passages contain explanations, some contain arguments, and some may be interpreted as either an argument or an explanation. What is your judgment about the chief function of each passage? What would have to be the case for the passage in question to be an argument? To be an explanation? Where you find an argument, identify its premises and conclusion. Where you find an explanation, indicate what is being explained and what the explanation is.

    1. Humans have varying skin colors as a consequence of the distance our ancestors lived from the Equator. It's all about sun. Skin color is what regulates our body's reaction to the sun and its rays. Dark skin evolved to protect the body from excessive sun rays. Light skin evolved when people migrated away from the Equator and needed to make vitamin D in their skin. To do that they had to lose pigment. Repeatedly over history, many people moved dark to light and light to dark. That shows that color is not a permanent trait.
    
    —Nina Jablonski, "The Story of Skin," The New York Times,
    9 January 2007
    
    Solution
    
    This is essentially an explanation. What is being explained is the fact that humans have varying skin colors. The explanation is that different skin colors evolved as humans came to live at different distances from the Equator and hence needed different degrees of protection from the rays of the sun. One might interpret the passage as an argument whose conclusion is that skin color is not a permanent trait of all humans. Under this interpretation, all the propositions preceding the final sentence of the passage serve as premises.
    
    2. David Bernstein [in Only One Place of Redress: African Americans, Labor Regulations, and the Courts from Reconstruction to the New Deal, 2001] places labor laws at the center of the contemporary plight of black Americans. Many of these ostensibly neutral laws (e.g., licensing laws, minimum-wage laws, and collective bargaining laws) were either directly aimed at stymieing black economic and social advancement or, if not so aimed, were quickly turned to that use. A huge swath of the American labor market was handed over to labor unions from which blacks, with few exceptions, were totally excluded. The now longstanding gap between black and white unemployment rates dates precisely from the moment of government intervention on labor's behalf. In short (Bernstein argues) the victories of American labor were the undoing of American blacks.

    Animals born without traits that led to reproduction died out, whereas the ones that had traits that led to reproduction survived. This is the process of natural selection. The survival and reproduction of organisms with traits that enhance their ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment leads to the prevalence of those traits in the population over time. This process is fundamental to the mechanism of evolution.

    1.4 Arguments and Explanations
    
    An article in The New York Times, "Why Humans and Their Fur Parted Ways," suggested that the fact that women have less body hair than men is somehow related to greater sexual selection pressure on women. A reader responded with the following letter:
    
    Here is an elaboration for which I have no evidence but it is consistent with what we think we know: sexual selection has probably strongly influenced numerous traits of both sexes.
    
    Youthful appearance is more important to men when selecting a mate than it is to women. The longer a woman can look young, the longer she will be sexually attractive and the more opportunities she will have to bear offspring with desirable men. Hairlessness advertises youth.
    
    Hence a greater sexual selection pressure on women to lose body hair.

    MAD, mutually assured destruction, was effective in deterring nuclear attack right
    through the cold war. Both sides had nuclear weapons. Neither side used them,
    because both sides knew the other would retaliate in kind. This will not work with a
    religious fanatic [like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran]. For him, mutual assured destruction is not a deterrent, it is an inducement. We
    know already that Iran's leaders do not give a damn about killing their own people
    in great numbers. We have seen it again and again. In the final scenario, and this
    applies all the more strongly if they kill large numbers of their own people, they
    are doing them a favor. They are giving them a quick free pass to heaven and all its
    delights.

    1.5 | Deductive and Inductive Arguments
  - |-
    Every argument makes the claim that its premises provide grounds for the truth of its
    conclusion; that claim is the mark of an argument. However, there are two very different
    ways in which a conclusion may be supported by its premises, and thus there are two
    great classes of arguments: the deductive and the inductive. Understanding this distinction
    is essential in the study of logic.
    
    A deductive argument makes the claim that its conclusion is supported by its premises
    
    conclusively; it claims that if its premises are all true, its conclusion must be true. An induc-
    tive argument, in contrast, does not make such a claim. Therefore, if we judge that in some
    passage a claim for conclusiveness is being made, we treat the argument as deductive;
    if we judge that such a claim is not being made, we treat it as inductive. Because every
    argument either makes this claim of conclusiveness (explicitly or implicitly) or does not
    make it, every argument is either deductive or inductive.
    
    When the claim is made that the premises of an argument (if true) provide incontro-
    vertible grounds for the truth of its conclusion, that claim will be either correct or not
    correct. If it is correct, that argument is valid. If it is not correct (that is, if the premises
    when true fail to establish the conclusion irrefutably although claiming to do so), that
    argument is invalid.
    
    For logicians the term validity is applicable only to deductive arguments. To say that
    a deductive argument is valid is to say that it cannot have all true premises and a false
    conclusion. Thus we define validity as follows: A deductive argument is valid if and only
    if it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion. In everyday speech, of course,
    the term valid is used much more loosely.
    
    Although every deductive argument makes the claim that its premises guarantee
    the truth of its conclusion, not all deductive arguments live up to that claim. Deductive
    arguments that fail to do so are invalid.
    
    Because every deductive argument either succeeds or does not succeed in achieving its
    objective, every deductive argument is either valid or invalid. This point is important: If
    a deductive argument is not valid, it must be invalid; if it is not invalid, it must be valid.
  - |-
    The central task of deductive logic (treated at length in Part II of this book) is to discriminate valid arguments from invalid ones. Over centuries, logicians have devised powerful techniques to do this—but the traditional techniques for determining validity differ from those used by most modern logicians. The former, collectively known as Aristotelian Syllogistic logic and rooted in the analytical works of Aristotle, are explained in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of this book. The techniques of modern symbolic logic are presented in detail in Chapters 8, 9, and 10. Logicians of the two schools differ in their methods and in their interpretations of some arguments, but ancients and moderns agree that the fundamental task of deductive logic is to develop the tools that enable us to distinguish arguments that are valid from those that are not.
    
    In contrast, the central task of inductive arguments is to ascertain the facts by which conduct may be guided directly, or on which other arguments may be built. Empirical investigations are undertaken—as in medicine, or social science, or astronomy—leading, when inductive techniques are applied appropriately, to factual conclusions, most often concerning cause-and-effect relationships of some importance.
    
    A great variety of inductive techniques are examined in detail in Part II of this book, but an illustration of the inductive process will be helpful at this point to contrast induction with deduction. Medical investigators, using inductive methods, are eager to learn the causes of disease, or the causes of the transmission of infectious diseases. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), are of special concern because of their great seriousness and worldwide spread. Can we learn inductively how to reduce the spread of STDs? Yes, we can.
  - |-
    In 2006 the National Institutes of Health announced that large-scale studies of the spread of STDs in Kenya and Uganda (African countries in which the risk of HIV infection, commonly resulting in AIDS, is very high) showed that the risk of contracting HIV was sharply lower among circumcised men than among those who were not circumcised. Circumcision is not a "magic bullet" for the treatment of disease, of course. However, we did learn, by examining the experience of very many voluntary subjects (3,000 in Uganda, 5,000 in Kenya, divided into circumcised and uncircumcised groups) that
    
    Validity
    
    A characteristic of any
    deductive argument
    that cannot have all true
    premises and a false
    conclusion. Such an
    argument is said to be
    valid. Validity is a formal
    characteristic; it applies
    only to arguments,
    
    as distinguished from
    truth, which applies to
    propositions.
    
    chapter 1
    
    Basic Logical Concepts
    
    a man's risk of contracting HIV from heterosexual sex is reduced by half as a result of
    circumcision. The risk to women is also reduced by about 30 percent.*
    
    These are discoveries (using the inductive method called concomitant variation, which
    is discussed in detail in Chapter 12) of very great importance. The causal connection
    between the absence of circumcision and the spread of HIV is not known with certainty,
    the way the conclusion of a deductive argument is known, but it is now known with a
    very high degree of probability.
  - |-
    Inductive arguments make weaker claims than those made by deductive arguments.  
    Because their conclusions are never certain, the terms validity and invalidity do not apply  
    to inductive arguments. We can evaluate inductive arguments, of course; appraising such  
    arguments is a central task of scientists in every sphere. The higher the level of probability  
    conferred on its conclusion by the premises of an inductive argument, the greater is the  
    merit of that argument. We can say that inductive arguments may be "better" or "worse,"  
    "weaker" or "stronger," and so on. The argument constituted by the circumcision study  
    is very strong, the probability of its conclusion very high. Even when the premises are  
    all true, however, and provide strong support for the conclusion, that conclusion is not  
    established with certainty. The entire theory of induction, techniques of analogical and  
    causal reasoning, and methods for appraising inductive arguments and for quantifying  
    and calculating probabilities are presented at length in Chapters 11, 12, 13, and 14.
    
    Because an inductive argument can yield no more than some degree of probability for  
    its conclusion, it is always possible that additional information will strengthen or weaken  
    it. Newly discovered facts may cause us to change our estimate of the probabilities, and  
    thus may lead us to judge the argument to be better (or worse) than we had previously  
    thought. In the world of inductive argument—even when the conclusion is judged to  
    be very highly probable—all the evidence is never in. New discoveries may eventually  
    disconfirm what was earlier believed, and therefore we never assert that the conclusion  
    of an inductive argument is absolutely certain.
  - |-
    Deductive arguments, on the other hand, either succeed or they do not succeed in
    having a necessary and conclusive inference relation between premises and conclusion.
    If a deductive argument succeeds in this way, it is valid, and no additional premises can
    possibly add to the strength of that argument. For example, if all humans are mortal and
    Socrates is human, it necessarily is the case that Socrates is mortal—and that conclusion
    follows necessarily from those premises no matter what else may be true in the world, and no
    matter what other information may be discovered or added. If we come to learn that Socrates
    is ugly, or that immortality is a burden, or that cows give milk, none of those findings
    nor any other findings can have any bearing on the validity of the original argument.
    Thus, the valid argument
    
    All humans are mortal.
    Socrates is human.
    Therefore, Socrates is mortal
    
    * So great is the advantage of circumcision shown by these studies that they were stopped, on 13 December 2006, by
    the Data Safety and Monitoring Board of the National Institutes of Health, to be fair to all participants by announcing
    the probable risks of the two patterns of conduct.
    
    1.5 Deductive and Inductive Arguments
    
    may be modified by adding an additional premise, such as "Socrates is ugly":
    
    All humans are mortal.
    Socrates is human.
    
    Socrates is ugly.
    
    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
    
    The second argument is just as a valid as the first. The conclusion, "Socrates is mor-
    tal," follows necessarily from the premises of the first argument, and since those same
    propositions are premises of the second argument, the conclusion, "Socrates is mortal,"
    (still) follows necessarily from those same two propositions (plus an additional prem-
    ise). In general, the conclusion that follows with necessity from the premises of a valid
    deductive argument follows from any enlarged set of premises with the same necessity,
    regardless of the nature of the premises added." If an argument is valid, nothing in
    the world can make it more (or less) valid; if a conclusion is validly inferred from some
    set of premises, nothing can be added to that set to make that conclusion follow more
    validly (or less validly).
  - |-
    This is not true of inductive arguments, however, for which the relationship claimed between premises and conclusion is much less strict and very different in kind. Consider the following inductive argument:
    
    Most corporation lawyers are conservatives.
    Miriam Graf is a corporation lawyer.
    Therefore, Miriam Graf is probably a conservative.
    
    This is a fairly good inductive argument; its first premise is true, and if its second premise also is true, its conclusion is more likely to be true than false. But in this case (in contrast to the argument about Socrates' mortality), new premises added to the original pair might weaken or (depending on the content of those new premises) strengthen the original argument. Suppose we also learn that
    
    Miriam Graf is an officer of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
    and suppose we add the (true) premise that
    
    Most officers of the ACLU are not conservatives.
    Now the conclusion (that Miriam Graf is a conservative) no longer seems very probable; the original inductive argument has been greatly weakened by the presence of this additional information about Miriam Graf. Indeed, if the final premise were to be transformed into the universal proposition
    
    No officers of the ACLU are conservatives.
    
    the opposite of the original conclusion would then follow deductively—and validly—from the full set of premises affirmed.
    
    chapter 1
    
    Deductive argument
    
    One of the two major types of argument traditionally distinguished, the other being the inductive argument. A deductive argument claims that its conclusion follows from its premises with absolute necessity. If its conclusion does follow necessarily from its premises, it is valid; if not, it is invalid.
    
    Inductive argument
    
    One of the two major types of argument traditionally distinguished, the other being the deductive argument. An inductive argument claims that its premises give only some degree of probability, but not certainty, to its conclusion.
    
    Basic Logical Concepts
    
    On the other hand, suppose we enlarge the original set of premises by adding the following additional premise:
    
    Miriam Graf has long been an officer of the National Rifle Association (NRA).
    
    The original conclusion (that she is a conservative) would be supported by this enlarged set of premises with even greater likelihood than it was by the original set.
  - |-
    Inductive arguments do not always acknowledge explicitly that their conclusions are  
    supported only with some degree of probability. On the other hand, the mere presence of  
    the word "probability" in an argument gives no assurance that the argument is inductive.  
    There are some strictly deductive arguments about probabilities themselves, in which the  
    probability of a certain combination of events is deduced from the probabilities of other  
    events. For example, if the probability of three successive heads in three tosses of a coin  
    is 1/8, one may infer deductively that the probability of getting at least one tail in three  
    tosses of a coin is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. Other illustrations of such arguments are given in Chapter 14.
    
    In sum, the distinction between induction and deduction rests on the nature of  
    the claims made by the two types of arguments about the relations between their prem-  
    ises and their conclusions. Thus we characterize the two types of arguments as follows:  
    A deductive argument is one whose conclusion is claimed to follow from its prem-  
    ises with absolute necessity. In sharp contrast, an inductive argument is one whose  
    conclusion is claimed to follow from its premises only with probability, this probability  
    being a matter of degree and dependent on what else may be the case. Unlike an induc-  
    tive argument, the conclusion of a valid deductive argument follows necessarily from its  
    premises, and this necessity is not a matter of degree and does not depend in any way  
    on whatever else may be the case.
    
    1.6 | Validity and Truth
    
    A deductive argument is valid when it succeeds in linking, with logical necessity,  
    its conclusion to its premises. Its validity resides in the inference relation between its  
    propositions—between the set of propositions that serve as the premises and the one  
    proposition that serves as the conclusion of that argument. A deductive argument is valid  
    if and only if it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion—it and only if its conclu-  
    sion follows with logical necessity from its premises. Therefore validity can never apply  
    to any single proposition by itself, because the needed relation cannot possibly be found  
    within any one proposition.
  - |-
    Truth and falsehood, on the other hand, are attributes of individual propositions.
    A single statement that serves as a premise in an argument may be true; the statement
    that serves as the argument's conclusion may be false. This conclusion might have been
    validly inferred, but to say that any conclusion (or any single premise) is itself valid or
    invalid makes no sense.
    
    Truth is the attribute of those propositions that assert what really is the case. When
    I assert that Lake Superior is the largest of the five Great Lakes, I assert what really is the
    case, what is true. If I had claimed that Lake Michigan is the largest of the Great Lakes
    my assertion would not be in accord with the real world; therefore it would be false.
    This contrast between validity and truth is important: Truth and falsity are attributes
    of individual propositions or statements; validity and invalidity are attributes of deductive
    arguments.
    1.6 Validity and Truth
    
    Just as the concept of validity cannot apply to single propositions, the concept of
    truth cannot apply to arguments. Of the several propositions in an argument, some (or
    all) may be true and some (or all) may be false. However, the argument as a whole is
    neither true nor false. Propositions, which are statements about the world, may be true
    or false; deductive arguments, which consist of an inference from one set of propositions
    to another proposition, may be valid or invalid.
    
    The relations between true (or false) propositions and valid (or invalid) arguments are
    critical and complicated. Those relations lie at the heart of deductive logic. Part II of this
    book is devoted largely to the examination of those complex relations, but a preliminary
    discussion of the relation between validity and truth is in order here.
  - |-
    We begin by emphasizing that an argument may be valid even if one or more of its premises is not true. Every argument makes a claim about the relation between its premises and the conclusion drawn from them; that relation may hold even if the premises turn out to be false or the truth of the premises is in dispute. This point was made dramatically by Abraham Lincoln in 1858 in one of his debates with Stephen Douglas.
    Lincoln was attacking the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court, which had held that slaves who had escaped into Northern states must be returned to their owners in the South. Lincoln said:
    
    | think it follows [from the Dred Scott decision], and | submit to the consideration of men capable of arguing,
    whether as | state it, in syllogistic form, the argument has any fault in it:
    
    Nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy a right distinctly and expressly affirmed in
    the Constitution of the United States.
    
    The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution of the United
    States.
    
    Therefore, nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy the right of property in a slave.
    
    | believe that no fault can be pointed out in that argument; assuming the truth of the premises, the conclusion,
    so far as | have capacity at all to understand it, follows inevitably. There is a fault in it as | think, but the fault
    is not in the reasoning; the falsehood in fact is a fault of the premises. | believe that the right of property in
    a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, and Judge Douglas thinks it is. | believe
    that the Supreme Court and the advocates of that decision [the Dred Scott decision] may search in vain
    for the place in the Constitution where the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed.
    | say, therefore, that | think one of the premises is not true in fact.
  - |-
    The reasoning in the argument that Lincoln recapitulates and attacks is not faulty—
    but its second premise (that "the right of property in a slave is . . . affirmed in the
    Constitution") is plainly false. The conclusion has therefore not been established.
    Lincoln's logical point is correct and important: An argument may be valid even when its
    conclusion and one or more of its premises are false. The validity of an argument, we empha-
    size once again, depends only on the relation of the premises to the conclusion: a valid
    argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion because of its inference
    relation, but it can have a false conclusion (as in the argument just above), and it can
    have one or more false premises (as above).
    
    There are many possible combinations of true and false premises and conclusions in
    both valid and invalid arguments. In fact—and this is crucially important for an under-
    standing of logic—all but one combination of truth values is possible. The one exception
    is that a valid deductive argument cannot have all true premises and a false
    conclusion. An invalid argument can have every combination of truth values for its
    premises and conclusion; a valid argument can have every combination except one! This
    one exception is what makes a valid argument valid: A valid argument cannot have all true
    premises and a false conclusion because its premises are connected to its conclusion with
    logical necessity. An invalid argument can have all true premises and a false conclusion
    because its conclusion does not follow with necessity from its premises.
    
    This crucial difference between valid and invalid arguments is illustrated by the fol-
    lowing seven illustrative arguments. These arguments—four of them invalid, three of
    them valid—show that valid and invalid arguments can have various combinations of all
    true or all false premises and a true conclusion. What distinguishes an invalid argument
    from a valid argument is that an invalid argument can have all true premises and a false
    conclusion, but a valid argument cannot.
    
    I. Some valid arguments contain only true propositions—true premises and a true
    conclusion:
    
    All mammals have lungs.
    All whales are mammals.
    Therefore all whales have lungs.
    
    II. Some valid arguments contain only false propositions—false premises and a false
    conclusion:
    
    All four-legged creatures have wings.
    All spiders have exactly four legs.
    Therefore all spiders have wings.
  - |-
    This argument is valid because it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion. If the argument's premises were true, its conclusion would have to be true also—even though we know that in fact both the premises and the conclusion of this argument are false.
    
    III. Some invalid arguments contain only true propositions—all their premises are true, and their conclusions are true as well:
    
    If I owned all the gold in Fort Knox, then I would be wealthy.
    I do not own all the gold in Fort Knox.
    Therefore I am not wealthy.
    
    The true conclusion of this argument does not follow from its true premises, because its premises could all be true and its conclusion false (as they are for any person who is wealthy and does not own all the gold in Fort Knox). This will be seen more clearly when the immediately following illustration is considered.
    
    IV. Some invalid arguments have all true premises and a false conclusion. This is illustrated by an argument exactly like the previous one (III) in form, changed only enough to make the conclusion false.
    
    If Bill Gates owned all the gold in Fort Knox, then Bill Gates would be wealthy.
    Bill Gates does not own all the gold in Fort Knox.
    Therefore Bill Gates is not wealthy.
    
    The premises of this argument are true, but its conclusion is false. Such an argument is invalid because it can have all true premises and a false conclusion, as it does in fact have here. It is impossible for all the premises of a valid argument to be true and its conclusion to be false.
    
    1.6 Validity and Truth
    
    V. Some valid arguments have all false premises and a true conclusion:
    
    All fishes are mammals.
    All whales are fishes.
    Therefore all whales are mammals.
    
    The conclusion of this argument is true, as we know; moreover, it may be validly inferred from these two premises, both of which are wildly false. This argument is valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises; if all of the premises were true, the conclusion would necessarily be true.
    
    VI. Some invalid arguments also have all false premises and a true conclusion:
    
    All mammals have wings.
    All whales have wings.
    Therefore all whales are mammals.
    
    From Examples V and VI taken together, it is clear that we cannot tell from the fact that an argument has all false premises and a true conclusion whether it is valid or invalid.
  - |-
    VII. Some invalid arguments contain all false propositions—all false premises and a false conclusion:
    
    All mammals have wings.
    All whales have wings.
    Therefore all mammals are whales.
    
    These seven examples make it clear that there are valid arguments (Example II) and invalid arguments (Examples IV and VII) with false conclusions, as well as valid arguments (Examples I and V) and invalid arguments (Examples III and VI) with true conclusions. Hence it is clear that the truth or falsity of an argument's conclusion does not by itself determine the validity or invalidity of that argument. Moreover, the fact that an argument is valid does not guarantee the truth of its conclusion (Example ID.
    
    Two tables (referring to the seven preceding examples) will make very clear the variety of possible combinations of truth and falsity for the premises and conclusion of invalid arguments, and for valid arguments. The first table shows that invalid arguments can have every possible combination of true (or false) premises and true (or false) conclusion:
    
    Invalid Arguments
    
    True Conclusion False Conclusion
    True Premises Example III Example IV
    False Premises Example VI Example VII
    
    The second table shows that valid arguments can have only three of those combinations of true (or false) premises and true (or false) conclusion:
    
    Valid Arguments
    
    True Conclusion False Conclusion
    True Premises Example I —
    
    False Premises Example V Example II

    Sound
    
    argument
    
    An argument is sound if and only if (a) it is valid, and (b) it has all true premises. Given (a) and (b), a sound argument must have a true conclusion.
    
    The one blank position in the second table exhibits the fundamental point in deductive logic: A valid argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion. There are two vitally important logical consequences of this. First, if an argument is valid and its premises are all true, its conclusion must also be true. Second, if an argument is valid and its conclusion is false, not all of its premises can be true. Some perfectly valid arguments do have false conclusions, but any such argument must have at least one false premise.
  - |-
    When an argument is valid and all of its premises are true, we call it sound. The
    conclusion of a sound argument obviously must be true—and only a sound argument can
    establish the truth of its conclusion.* If a deductive argument is not sound—that is, if the
    argument is not valid or if not all of its premises are true—it fails to establish the truth of
    its conclusion even if in fact its conclusion is true.
    
    To test the truth or falsehood of premises is the task of science in general, because
    premises may deal with any subject matter at all. The logician is not (professionally)
    interested in the truth or falsehood of propositions so much as in the logical relations
    between them. By logical relations between propositions we mean those relations that deter-
    mine the correctness or incorrectness of the arguments in which they occur. The task of
    determining the correctness or incorrectness, the validity or invalidity, of arguments is
    the central task of logic. The logician is interested in the correctness even of arguments
    whose premises may be false.
    
    Given, however, that only a sound argument can establish the truth of its conclusion,
    why do we not confine ourselves to arguments with true premises, ignoring all others?
    Because the correctness of arguments whose premises are not known to be true may be of
    great importance. Since validity resides in the relation between premises and conclusion,
    we can determine validity and invalidity without knowing, or having to know, anything
    about the actual truth or falsity of the statements constituting an argument.
    
    This fact—the fact that we can determine the validity and invalidity of deductive
    arguments, and the strength of inductive arguments, without knowing whether the
    premises are true—is a very important fact, for it enables us to systematically learn about
    reality using the scientific method, and also to optimize our decision making.
  - |-
    To learn about reality, and especially about causal regularities, scientists deductively infer the logical and empirical consequences of a scientific theory or hypothesis without knowing whether that theory or hypothesis is true. In this manner, they compare the deduced consequences of a theory or hypothesis with observations and, where possible, the observational results of experiments. If the deduced predictions agree with observations, the theory or hypothesis is confirmed (corroborated), and if the deduced predictions disagree with observations, the theory or hypothesis is disconfirmed or refuted (falsified).
    
    Similarly, in everyday life, we must often choose between alternative courses of action. To avoid deceiving ourselves, we must reason correctly about the consequences of the alternatives. Taking each alternative action as a premise, we infer the consequences of each action (premise), seeking to determine the course of action with the most desirable consequences. We strive to decide on the best course of action by means of such reasoning, and then to act accordingly. If we were interested only in arguments with true premises, we would not know which set of consequences to trace out until we knew which of the alternative premises was true. But if we knew which of the alternative premises was true, we would not need to reason about it at all, because our purpose was to help us decide which alternative premise to make true—which course of action to take! To confine our attention to arguments with premises known to be true would therefore be self-defeating. Prudent conduct is based on prudent decision making, which is based on good reasoning.
    
    Effective methods for establishing the validity or invalidity of deductive arguments are presented and explained at length in Part I of this book.

    Summary
    
    The most fundamental concepts of logic are introduced in this chapter.
    
    In Section 1.1 we explained what logic is and why it is necessary, and we defined it as the study of
    the methods and principles used to distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning.
    
    In Section 1.2 we gave an account of propositions, which may be asserted or denied, and which are
    either true or false, and of arguments, which are clusters of propositions of which one is the conclusion
    and the others are the premises offered in its support. Arguments are the central concern of logicians.
    
    In Section 1.3 we discussed difficulties in the recognition of arguments, arising from the variety of
    ways in which the propositions they contain may be expressed, and sometimes even from the absence of
    their express statement in arguments called enthymemes.
    
    In Section 1.4 we discussed the differences between arguments and explanations, showing why this
    distinction often depends on the context and on the intent of the passage in that context.
    
    In Section 1.5 we explained the fundamental difference between deductive arguments, whose conclu-
    sions may be certain (if the premises are true and the reasoning valid), and inductive arguments, aiming
    to establish matters of fact, whose conclusions may be very probable but are never certain.
    
    In Section 1.6 we discussed validity and invalidity (which apply to deductive arguments) as contrasted
    with truth and falsity (which apply to propositions). We explored some of the key relations between valid-
    ity and invalidity, on the one hand, and truth and falsity, on the other. We emphasized that, whereas an
    invalid argument can have any combination of truth and falsity for its premises and conclusion, a valid
    deductive argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion.

    2.1 | Paraphrasing Arguments
    
    Arguments in everyday life are often more complex—more tangled and less precise—than
    those given as illustrations in Chapter 1. Premises may be numerous and in topsy-turvy
    order; they may be formulated awkwardly, and they may be repeated using different
    words; even the meaning of premises may be unclear. To sort out the connections of
    premises and conclusions so as to evaluate an argument fairly, we need some analytical
    techniques.
    
    The most common, and perhaps the most useful, technique for analysis is paraphrase.
    We paraphrase an argument by setting forth its propositions in clear language and in
    logical order. This may require the reformulation of sentences, and therefore great care
    must be taken to ensure that the paraphrase put forward captures correctly and com-
    pletely the argument that was to be analyzed.
    
    The following passage, whose premises are confusingly intertwined, was part of the
    majority decision of the U.S. Supreme Court when, in 2003, it struck down as unconsti-
    tutional a Texas statute that had made it a crime for persons of the same sex to engage
    in certain forms of intimate sexual conduct. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the
    majority, said this:
  - |-
    The [present] case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause [of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution] gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. It is a premise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.
    
    chapter 2
    
    chapter 2. Analyzing Arguments
    
    Although the general thrust of this decision is clear, the structure of the argument, which is really a complex of distinct arguments, is not. We can clarify the whole by paraphrasing the decision of the Court as follows:
    
    1. The Constitution of the United States guarantees a realm of personal liberty that includes the private, consensual sexual activity of adults.
    
    2. The conduct of these petitioners was within that realm of liberty and they therefore had a full right, under the Constitution, to engage in the sexual conduct in question without government intervention.
    
    3. The Texas statute intrudes, without justification, into the private lives of these petitioners, and demeans them, by making their protected, private sexual conduct a crime.
    
    4. The Texas statute that criminalizes such conduct therefore wrongly denies the rights of these petitioners and must be struck down as unconstitutional.
    
    In this case the paraphrase does no more than set forth clearly what the premises indubitably assert. Sometimes, however, paraphrasing can bring to the surface what was assumed in an argument but was not fully or clearly stated. For example, the great English mathematician, G. H. Hardy, in A Mathematician's Apology (Cambridge University Press, 1940), argued thus: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not." We may paraphrase this argument by spelling out its claims:
    
    Languages die.
    
    The plays of Aeschylus are written in a language.
    
    So the work of Aeschylus will eventually die.

    While working as a tutor to Heloise, the 17-year-old niece of a Parisian named Fulbert, a relationship developed that resulted in her becoming pregnant. The couple ran away to his home in Brittany, where she gave birth to a child. Abelard eventually married Heloise, later sending her to become a nun. Her uncle, outraged by the scandal, hired thugs to assault Abelard and castrate him. Abelard then became a monk and lecturer, unpopular among colleagues because of his intellectual arrogance. He was obliged to move from abbey to abbey, became embroiled in theological controversies, and died in Paris in 1142.
    
    In logic, Abelard explored the relations of premises and conclusions in deductive arguments. He was one of the first to emphasize the syntactic nature of validity. An argument is valid, he pointed out, not because of the semantic content of its propositions, but because of the formal relations among those propositions.

    Nicholas Kristof equates the hunting of whales by Eskimos with the whaling habits of Japanese, Norwegians, and Icelanders. The harsh environment of the Inupiat [Eskimos] dictates their diet, so not even the most rabid antiwhaling activist can deny their inalienable right to survive. The Japanese and the European whale-hunting countries can choose the food they consume; they have no need to eat whales. It is not hypocritical to give a pass to the relatively primitive society of the Inupiat to hunt a strictly controlled number of whales for survival while chastising the modern societies that continue to hunt these magnificent mammals for no good reason.

    2.2 | Diagramming Arguments
    
    A second technique for the analysis of arguments is diagramming. With a diagram we can
    represent the structure of an argument graphically; the flow of premises and conclusions
    is displayed in a two-dimensional chart, or picture, on the page. A diagram is not needed
    for a simple argument, even though drawing one can enhance our understanding. When
    an argument is complex, with many premises entwined in various ways, a diagram can
    be exceedingly helpful.
    
    To construct the diagram of an argument we must first number all the propositions it
    contains, in the order in which they appear, circling each number. Using arrows between
    the circled numbers, we can then construct a diagram that shows the relations of prem-
    ises and conclusions without having to restate them. To convey the process of inference
    on the two-dimensional page, we adopt this convention: A conclusion always appears
    in the space below the premises that give it support; coordinate premises are put on the
    same horizontal level. In this way, an argument whose wording may be confusing can
    be set forth vividly in iconic form. The structure of the argument is displayed visually."
    
    Here follows a straightforward argument that may be readily diagrammed:
    
    @ There is no consensus among biologists that a fertilized cell is alive in a sense that an unfertilized egg or
    unused sperm is not. @ Nor is there a consensus about whether a group of cells without even a rudimentary
    nervous system is in any sense human. @ Hence there are no compelling experimental data to decide the
    nebulous issue of when "human" life begins.?
    
    The circled numbers serve to represent the propositions, so we can diagram the argument
    as follows:
    
    1
    2
    3
    1 → 3
    2 → 3
  - |-
    When the several premises of an argument are not all coordinate—that is, when some
    premises give direct support not to the conclusion but to other premises that support the
    conclusion—the diagram can show this quite clearly. Here is an argument illustrating
    this feature of diagramming:
    
    ® Football analysis is trickier than the baseball kind because @ Football really is a team sport. @ Unlike in
    baseball, all eleven guys on the field are involved in every play. © Who deserves the credit or blame is harder
    to know than it looks.*
    
    Lee 1
    
    chapter 2
    
    Analyzing Arguments
    
    The diagram looks like this:
    
    An alternative plausible interpretation of this argument can be represented by a dif-
    ferent diagram:
    
    Another strength of diagrams is their ability to exhibit relations between the
    premises—relations that may be critical to the argument. Each premise of an argument
    may support its conclusion separately, as in the arguments above. In some arguments,
    however, the premises support the conclusion only when they are considered jointly—
    and this is a feature of the reasoning that a diagram is well suited to display, by provid-
    ing a visual representation of that connection. The following argument illustrates this:
    
    ® General Motors makes money (when it does) on new cars and on the financing of loans. @ Car dealers, by
    contrast, make most of their money on servicing old cars and selling used ones. @ So car dealers can thrive
    even when the automaker languishes.°
    
    By bracketing the premises in the diagram of this argument, we show that its premises
    give support only because they are joined, thus:
    
    In this argument, neither premise supports the conclusion independently. It is the
    combination of the facts that General Motors makes most of its money in one way, while
    car dealers make most of their money in another way, that supports the conclusion that
    the latter may thrive while the former languishes.
    
    2.2. Diagramming Arguments
    
    Often we can show what we cannot as conveniently say. Diagrams are particularly
    useful when an argument's structure is complicated. Consider the following argument:

    ® Desert mountaintops make good sites for astronomy. @ Being high, they sit above a portion of the atmosphere, enabling a star's light to reach a telescope without having to swim through the entire depths of the atmosphere. @ Being dry, the desert is also relatively cloud-free. © The merest veil of haze or cloud can render a sky useless for many astronomical measures.°
    
    Proposition © is plainly the conclusion of this argument, and the other three provide support for it—but they function differently in giving that support. Statement @ supports, by itself, the claim that mountaintops are good sites for telescopes.

    Some complications may be revealed more clearly using paraphrase. When an argument has a premise that is not stated explicitly, a paraphrase allows us to formulate the tacit premise and then add it to the list explicitly. A diagram requires the representation of the tacit premise in some way that indicates visually that it has been added (a broken circle around a number is commonly used), but even then the added premise remains to be precisely formulated. Thus the argument
    
    Since there are no certainties in the realm of politics, politics must be the arena for negotiation between different perspectives, with cautious moderation likely to be the best policy.'
    
    is best clarified by a paraphrase in which its tacit premise and internal complexity is made explicit, thus:
    
    1. There are no certainties in the realm of politics.
    
    2. Where there are no certainties, those with different perspectives must negotiate their differences.
    
    3. The best policy likely to emerge from such negotiation is one of cautious moderation.
    
    4. Therefore politics is the realm for negotiation between different perspectives, with cautious moderation likely to be the best policy.
    
    The number of arguments in a passage is determined, most logicians agree, by the number of conclusions it contains. If a passage contains two or more arguments, and a number of propositions whose relations are not obvious, a diagram may prove particularly useful in sorting things out. A passage in a letter from Karl Marx to Friedrich Engels illustrates this nicely:
  - |-
    ® To hasten the social revolution in England is the most important object of the International Workingman's Association. @ The sole means of hastening it is to make Ireland independent. Hence @ the task of the "International" is everywhere to put the conflict between England and Ireland in the foreground, and ® everywhere to side openly with Ireland.
      
    chapter 2. Analyzing Arguments
      
    There are two conclusions in this passage and hence two arguments. But both conclu-
    sions are inferred from the same two premises. A diagram exhibits this structure:
      
    Two conclusions (and hence two arguments) may have a single stated premise. For
    example,
      
    Older women have less freedom to fight sexual harassment at their jobs or to leave a battering husband,
    because age discrimination means they won't easily find other ways of supporting themselves.'
      
    The single premise here is that older women cannot easily find alternative ways to
    support themselves. The two conclusions supported by that premise are (a) that older
    women have less freedom to fight sexual harassment at their jobs, and (b) that older
    married women have less freedom to leave a battering husband. A single argument ordi-
    narily means an argument with a single conclusion, regardless of how many premises
    are adduced in its support.
      
    When there are two or more premises in an argument, or two or more arguments in
    a passage, the order of appearance of premises and conclusions may need to be clarified.
    The conclusion may be stated last, or first; it may sometimes be sandwiched between the
    premises offered in its support, as in the following passage:
      
    The real and original source of inspiration for the Muslim thinkers was the Quran and the sayings of the
    Holy Prophet. It is therefore clear that the Muslim philosophy was not a carbon copy of Greek thought, as
    it concerned itself primarily and specifically with those problems which originated from and had relevance
    to Muslims."
      
    Here the conclusion, that "Muslim philosophy was not a carbon copy of Greek thought,"
    appears after the first premise of the argument and before the second.
      
    The same proposition that serves as a conclusion in one argument may serve as
    premise in a different argument, just as the same person may be a commander in one
    context and a subordinate in another. This is well illustrated by a passage from the work
    of Thomas Aquinas. He argues:

    Human law is framed for the multitude of human beings.
    The majority of human beings are not perfect in virtue.
    Therefore human laws do not forbid all vices."
    2.2. Diagramming Arguments
    
    The conclusion of this argument is used immediately thereafter as a premise in another,
    quite different argument:
    
    Vicious acts are contrary to acts of virtue.
    But human law does not prohibit all vices... .
    Therefore neither does it prescribe all acts of virtue.'2
    
    No special techniques are needed to grasp these arguments of St. Thomas. However,
    when the cascade of arguments is compressed, a paraphrase is helpful in showing the
    flow of reasoning. Consider the following passage:
    
    Because @ the greatest mitochondrial variations occurred in African people, scientists concluded that
    @ they had the longest evolutionary history, indicating @ a probable African origin for modern humans."?
    
    We might diagram the passage thus:
    
    A paraphrase of this passage, although perhaps more clumsy, exhibits more fully the
    cascade of the two arguments that are compressed in it:
    
    =
    
    The more mitochondrial variation in a people, the longer its evolutionary history.
    2. The greatest mitochondrial variations occur in African people.
    
    Therefore African people have had the longest evolutionary history.
    
    1. African people have had the longest evolutionary history.
    2. Modern humans probably originated where people have had the longest evolution-
    ary history.
    
    Therefore modern humans probably originated in Africa.
    
    These examples make it evident that the same proposition can serve as a premise where
    it occurs as an assumption in an argument; or as a conclusion where it is claimed to fol-
    low from other propositions assumed in an argument. "Premise" and "conclusion" are
    always relative terms.
    
    Multiple arguments may be interwoven in patterns more complicated than cascades,
    and these will require careful analysis. The diagramming technique then becomes par-
    ticularly useful. In John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, for example, two argu-
    ments are combined in the following passage:
    
    It is not necessary—no, nor so much as convenient—that the legislative should be always in being; but
    absolutely necessary that the executive power should, because there is not always need of new laws to be
    made, but always need of execution of the laws that are made.
  - |-
    The component propositions here may be numbered thus: © It is not necessary or convenient that the legislative [branch of government] should be always in being; © it is absolutely necessary that the executive power should be always in being; © there is not always need of new laws to be made; © there is always need of execution of the laws that are made. The diagram for this passage is
    
    which shows that the conclusion of the second argument is stated between the conclusion and the premise of the first argument, and that the premise of the first argument is stated between the conclusion and the premise of the second argument. The diagram also shows that both conclusions are stated before their premises.
    
    That very same diagram shows the logical structure of two related arguments of the Roman philosopher Seneca, in support of the deterrence theory of punishment. He wrote:
    
    @ No one punishes because a sin has been committed, @ but in order that a sin will not be committed.
    [For] ® what has passed cannot be recalled, but © what lies in the future may be prevented.
    
    That "no one punishes because a sin has been committed" is the conclusion of one argument; its premise is that "what has passed cannot be recalled." That "[we do punish] in order that a sin will not be committed" is the conclusion of a second argument, whose premise is that "what lies in the future may be prevented."
    
    Diagramming and paraphrasing are both very useful tools with which we can analyze arguments so as to understand more fully the relations of premises to conclusions.

    Universals, or Platonic forms, of which some philosophers write, he believed to be no more
    than the products of abstraction by the human mind.
    
    William became deeply involved in the theological controversies of those medieval
    days. He was summoned to the Papal court in Avignon in 1324,
    apparently under charges of heresy. While there, a dispute arose con-
    cerning the poverty of Christ, many zealous Franciscans insisting
    that Jesus and his apostles owned no personal property. William
    came to share that view; he asserted that Pope John XXII, unwilling
    to accept the poverty of Jesus, was himself a heretic. William was
    then obliged to take refuge in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor,
    Ludwig of Bavaria, and while there, not surprisingly, was himself
    excommunicated. He died in Munich in 1348.
    
    William of Ockham was an inventive logician, suggesting that we
    might better rely upon a logical system that did not force us to view
    all propositions as either true or false (a so-called two-valued logic),
    but that a three-valued logic, developed more fully many centuries
    later, would permit a better reflection of the state of our knowledge.
    Some central logical equivalences, which came later to be known as
    De Morgan's theorems, he well understood and actually wrote out in
    words, not having at his disposal the modern notation with which
    we now express them.
    
    A powerful and widely respected mind, William of Ockham was
    referred to by many as Doctor Invincibilis—"unconquerable teacher."
    
    2.3 | Complex Argumentative Passages
    
    Some arguments are exceedingly complicated. Analyzing passages in which several argu-
    ments are interwoven, with some propositions serving as both premises and subconclusions while other propositions serve only as premises, and still others are repeated in
    different words, can be a challenge. The diagramming technique is certainly helpful, but
    there is no mechanical way to determine whether the diagram actually does represent the
    author's intent accurately. More than one plausible interpretation may be offered, and
    in that case more than one diagram can reasonably be used to show the logical structure
    of that passage.
  - |-
    To analyze fairly, we must strive to understand the flow of the author's reasoning, and
    to identify the role of each element in the passage as part of that flow. The examples that
    follow (in which component propositions have been numbered for purposes of analysis)
    show the ways in which we can set forth the connections between premises and conclu-
    sions. Only after that is done, when we have identified the arguments within a passage
    and the relations of those arguments, can we go about deciding whether the conclusions
    do indeed follow from the premises affirmed.
    
    In the following set of arguments, the final conclusion of the passage appears in the
    very first statement, which is not unusual. Four premises directly support this conclu-
    sion; two of these are subconclusions, which in turn are supported, in different ways,
    by other premises affirmed in the passage:
    
    ® It is very unlikely that research using animals will be unnecessary or poorly done. @ Before an experi-
    ment using a vertebrate animal is carried out, the protocol for that experiment must be reviewed by an
    institutional committee that includes a veterinarian and a member of the public, and @ during the research
    the animal's health and care are monitored regularly. @ Researchers need healthy animals for study in science
    and medicine, because © unhealthy animals could lead to erroneous results. This is a powerful incentive for
    © scientists to make certain that any animals they use are healthy and well nourished. Furthermore,
    @ research involving animals is expensive, and because ® funding is limited in science, © only high-quality
    research is able to compete effectively for support."
    
    The following diagram shows the logical structure of this passage. To "read" the
    diagram we replace the numbers with the indicated propositions, beginning with those
    highest on the page and therefore earliest in the logical cascade. We thus follow each of
    the several paths of reasoning to the final conclusion.

    L J
    
    Repetition complicates the task of analysis. Individual propositions are sometimes
    repeated within an argument in differently worded sentences, sometimes for emphasis
    and at other times by oversight. The diagram reveals this because we can assign the same
    number to different formulations of the same proposition. The following passage, com-
    prising three distinct arguments, exhibits this confusing duplication of propositions:
  - |-
    ® The Big Bang theory is crumbling. ... @ According to orthodox wisdom, the cosmos began with the Big
    Bang—an immense, perfectly symmetrical explosion 20 billion years ago. The problem is that @ astronomers
    have confirmed by observation the existence of huge conglomerations of galaxies that are simply too big
    to have been formed in a mere 20 billion years. . . . Studies based on new data collected by satellite, and
    backed up by earlier ground surveys, show that © galaxies are clustered into vast ribbons that stretch billions
    of light years, and © are separated by voids hundreds of millions of light years across. Because © galaxies
    are observed to travel at only a small fraction of the speed of light, mathematics shows that @ such large
    clumps of matter must have taken at least one hundred billion years to come together—five times as long
    as the time since the hypothetical Big Bang. ... @ Structures as big as those now seen can't be made in
    20 billion years. ... @ The Big Bang theorizes that matter was spread evenly through the universe. From this
    perfection, ® there is no way for such vast clumps to have formed so quickly. '®
    
    In this passage the premises that report observational evidence, ©, ©, and ©, give reasons for @, the great length of time that would have had to elapse since the Big Bang. This
    passage of time is used to support the subconclusion (formulated in three slightly dif-
    ferent ways) that © structures as big as those now seen are too big to have been formed
    in that period of time. From that subconclusion, combined with ©, a short statement
    (formulated in two slightly different ways) of the original symmetry and spread that the
    Big Bang theory supposes, we infer the final conclusion of the passage, ©: that the Big
    Bang theory is crumbling—the proposition with which the passage begins. The following
    diagram shows this set of logical relations:

    The fact that a premise may appear in compressed form, sometimes as a short noun phrase, must be borne in mind. In the following argument the phrase "the scattering in the atmosphere" serves as a premise, ©, that may be reformulated as "the sun's energy is scattered in the atmosphere." This compression, along with repetition, makes it more difficult to analyze this argument:
    
    ® Solar-powered cars can never be anything but experimental devices. @ Solar power is too weak to power even a mini-car for daily use. @ The solar power entering the atmosphere is about 1 kilowatt per square yard.
    Because of ® the scattering in the atmosphere, and because © the sun shines half a day on the average at any place on earth, © average solar power received is 1/6 kilowatt, or 4 kilowatt hours a day. . . . Tests on full-size cars indicate that ® 300,000 watt hours are required in a battery for an electric car to perform marginally satisfactorily. So, ® 40 square yards of cells would be needed to charge the car batteries, about the size of the roof of a tractor-trailer. © It is not undeveloped technologies that put solar power out of the running to be anything but a magnificently designed experimental car. It is cosmology.!"
    
    The first proposition in this passage, asserting that "solar-powered cars can never be more than experimental," is the final conclusion. It is repeated in more elaborate form at the end of the passage, as a diagram of the passage shows:

    Chapter 2. Analyzing Arguments
    
    Complex argumentative passages can be entirely cogent. The following complex argument, for example, was offered by a distinguished editor in defense of her highly controversial editorial policy:
  - |-
    The Journal [the New England Journal of Medicine] ... has taken the position that © it will not publish reports
    of unethical research, regardless of their scientific merit... . There are three reasons for our position. First, @
    the policy of publishing only ethical research, if generally applied, would deter unethical work. @ Publication
    is an important part of the reward system in medical research, and @ investigators would not undertake
    unethical studies if they knew the results would not be published. Furthermore, © any other policy would
    tend to lead to more unethical work, because, as | have indicated, © such studies may be easier to carry out
    and thus @ may give their practitioners a competitive edge. Second, © denying publication even when the
    ethical violations are minor protects the principle of the primacy of the research subject. © If small lapses
    were permitted we would become inured to them, and © this would lead to larger violations. And finally, &
    refusal to publish unethical work serves notice to society at large that even scientists do not consider science
    the primary measure of a civilization. @ Knowledge, although important, may be less important to a decent
    society than the way it is obtained. ®
    
    Again, the final conclusion appears at the beginning of the passage, and the three
    major premises that support it directly, @ ©, and ©, are themselves supported by various
    other premises arranged differently. However, each of the many propositions in the pas-
    sage has a clear logical role in leading to the conclusion that the passage aims to justify:
    Reports of research done in unethical ways will not be published in the New England
    Journal of Medicine, regardless of their scientific merit. The following diagram shows the
    logical structure of this complicated but carefully reasoned passage:

    Arguments in newspaper editorials and letters-to-the-editor columns often fall short
    of this standard. They may include statements whose role is unclear; connections among
    the statements in the argument may be tangled or misstated; the flow of argument may
    be confused even in the mind of the author. Logical analysis, paraphrase supported by
    diagrams, can expose such deficiencies. By exhibiting the structure of a reasoning pro-
    cess, we can better see what its strengths and weaknesses may be. The aim and special
    province of logic is the evaluation of arguments, but successful evaluation presupposes
    a clear grasp of the structure of the argument in question.

    Each of the following famous passages, taken from classical literature and philosophy,
    comprises a set of arguments whose complicated interrelations are critical for the force

    defensible.
    
    1. A question arises: whether it be better [for a prince] to be loved than feared or feared
    than loved? One should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in
    one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, one must be
    dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrate-
    ful, fickle, false, cowards, covetous. ... and that prince who, relying entirely on their
    promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined, because friendships that are
    obtained by payments may indeed be earned but they are not secured, and in time of
    need cannot be relied upon. Men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved
    than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing
    to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear
    preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.

    2. Democratic laws generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest possible number; for they emanate from the majority of the citizens, who are subject to error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to their own advantage. The laws of an aristocracy tend, on the contrary, to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of the minority; because an aristocracy, by its very nature, constitutes a minority. It may therefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the purpose of a democracy in its legislation is more useful to humanity than that of an aristocracy.

    3. "... You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan."
    
    "You were told, no doubt."
    
    "Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is a gentleman of medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished."
    
    "It is simple enough as you explain it," I said, smiling.
    
    —A. Conan Doyle, A Study in Scarlet, 1887
    
    4. Nothing is demonstrable unless the contrary implies a contradiction. Nothing that is distinctly conceivable implies a contradiction. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive as nonexistent. There is no being, therefore, whose non-existence implies a contradiction. Consequently there is no being whose existence is demonstrable.
  - |-
    —David Hume, *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*, Part IX, 1779
    
    **Challenge to the Reader**
    
    In the *Ethics* (1677), Baruch Spinoza, one of the most influential of all modern thinkers, presents a deductive philosophical system in which the central conclusions—about God, about nature, and about human life and human freedom—are demonstrated in "geometrical" fashion. Here follows an example.
    
    Proposition 29 of the first book of the *Ethics* (there are five books in all) reads:
    
    In nature there is nothing contingent, but all things are determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and act in a certain manner.
    
    Immediately after the statement of each proposition in the *Ethics* appears its proof. The proof of Prop. 29 (from which internal references to proofs given earlier in the same work have been omitted for the sake of clarity) appears immediately below. Analyze this proof, by constructing a diagram that shows the structure of the argument, or by paraphrasing it in a way that makes it clear and persuasive to a modern reader.
    
    **Proof of Proposition 29:**
    
    Whatever is, is in God. But God cannot be called a contingent thing, for He exists necessarily and not contingently. Moreover, the modes of the divine nature [the creations which depend on, or have been created by, God immediately] have followed from it necessarily and not contingently. ... But God is the cause of these modes not only in so far as they simply exist, but also in so far as they are considered as determined to any action. If they are not determined by God it is an impossibility and not a contingency that they should determine themselves; and, on the other hand, if they are determined by God it is an impossibility and not a contingency that they should render themselves indeterminate. Wherefore all things are determined from a necessity of the divine nature, not only to exist, but to exist and act in a certain manner, and there is nothing contingent.

    In reasoning we advance from premises known (or affirmed for the purpose) to conclusions. We construct arguments of our own every day, in deciding how we shall act, in judging the conduct of others, in defending our moral or political convictions, and so on. Skill in devising good arguments (and in deciding whether a proffered argument is good) is of enormous value, and this skill can be improved with practice. Ancient games of reasoning, such as chess and go, exercise that skill, and there are some widely known commercial games (Clue and Mastermind are examples) that also have this merit.
    
    2.4 Problems in Reasoning
    
    Problems may be contrived which are designed to test and strengthen logical skills; some of these are presented in this section. Such problems are far neater than those that arise in real life, of course. But solving them may require extended reasoning in patterns not very different from those employed by a detective, a journalist, or a juror. Chains of inferences will be needed, in which subconclusions are used as premises in subsequent arguments. Finding the solution may require the creative recombination of information given earlier or discovered. Contrived problems can prove frustrating—but solving them, like every successful application of reasoning, is quite satisfying. In addition to being models for the employment of reason, logical games and puzzles are good fun.
    "The enjoyment of the doubtful," wrote the philosopher John Dewey, "is a mark of the educated mind."
    
    One type of reasoning problem is the common brainteaser in which, using only the clues provided, we must determine the names or other facts about certain specified characters. Here is a simple example:
    
    In a certain flight crew, the positions of pilot, copilot, and flight engineer are held by three persons, Allen, Brown, and Carr, though not necessarily in that order. The copilot, who is an only child, earns the least. Carr, who married Brown's sister, earns more than the pilot. What position does each of the three persons hold?
  - |-
    To solve such problems we look first for a sphere in which we have enough information to reach some conclusions going beyond what is given in the premises. In this case we know most about Carr: he is not the pilot, because he earns more than the pilot; and he is not the copilot because the copilot earns the least. By elimination we may infer that Carr must be the flight engineer. Using that subconclusion we can determine Brown's position. Brown is not the copilot because he has a sister and the copilot is an only child; he is not the flight engineer because Carr is. Brown must therefore be the pilot. Allen, the only one left, must therefore be the copilot.
    
    When problems of this type become more complex, it is useful to construct a graphic display of the alternatives, called a matrix, which we fill in as we accumulate new information. The helpfulness of such a matrix will be seen in solving the following problem:
    
    Alonzo, Kurt, Rudolf, and Willard are four creative artists of great talent. One is a dancer, one is a painter, one is a singer, and one is a writer, though not necessarily in that order.
    
    Alonzo and Rudolf were in the audience the night the singer made his debut on the concert stage.
    Both Kurt and the writer have had their portraits painted from life by the painter.
    
    The writer, whose biography of Willard was a bestseller, is planning to write a biography of Alonzo.
    Alonzo has never heard of Rudolf.
    
    What is each man's artistic field?
    
    To remember the facts asserted in these premises, as well as the subconclusions that may be inferred from them, would be a demanding task. Written notes could become a confusing clutter. We need a method for storing and exhibiting the information given and the intermediate conclusions drawn, keeping it all available for use as the number of inferences increases and the chain of arguments lengthens. The matrix we construct allows us to represent all the relevant possibilities and to record each inference drawn.
    
    chapter 2. Analyzing Arguments
    
    For this problem the matrix must display an array of the four persons (in four rows) and the four artistic professions (in four columns) that they hold. It would look like this:
  - |-
    Dancer Painter Singer Writer  
    Alonzo N N  
    
    Kurt N N  
    Rudolf N  
    
    Willard N
  - |-
    From the information now clearly exhibited, we can conclude by elimination that
    Rudolf must be the writer, so we enter a Y (for "Yes") in the box to the right of Rudolf's
    name in the fourth (writer) column, and we place an N in the other boxes to the right
    of his name. The array now makes it evident that the painter must be either Alonzo or
    Willard, and we can eliminate Alonzo in this way: Rudolf had his portrait painted by
    the painter (from premise 2), and Alonzo has never heard of Rudolf (from premise 4)—
    therefore Alonzo cannot be the painter. So we enter an N to the right of Alonzo's name
    under column 2 (painter). We may conclude that Alonzo must be the dancer, so we enter
    a Y to the right of Alonzo's name in the first (dancer) column. In that same column we
    can now enter an N for both Kurt and Willard. The only possible category remaining for
    Kurt is singer, and therefore we enter a Y in that box for him, and an N in the singer col-
    umn for Willard. By elimination, we conclude that Willard must be the painter and put
    a Y in the last empty box in the matrix. Our completed graphic display looks like this:
    
    Dancer Painter Singer Writer
    Alonzo Y N N N
    Kurt N N Y N
    Rudolf N N N Y
    Willard N Y N N
    
    Our matrix now filled in, the full solution is evident: Alonzo is the dancer; Kurt is
    the singer; Rudolf is the writer; Willard is the painter.
    
    2.4 Problems in Reasoning
    
    Some brainteasers of this kind, requiring solutions on several dimensions, are very
    challenging and almost impossible to solve without using a matrix.
  - |-
    In the real world, we are often called upon to reason from some present state of affairs to its causes, from what is to what was. Scientists—especially archeologists, geologists, astronomers, and physicians—commonly confront events or conditions whose origins are problematic. Reasoning that seeks to explain how things must have developed from what went before is called retrograde analysis. For example, to the amazement of astronomers, comet Hyakutake, streaking by the Earth in 1996, was found to be emitting variable X-rays a hundred times stronger than anyone had ever predicted a comet might emit. A comet expert at the Max Planck Institute in Germany remarked, "We have our work cut out for us in explaining these data—but that's the kind of problem you love to have."
    
    We do love to have them, and for that reason problems in retrograde analysis are often devised for amusement. In the real world, logical problems arise within a theoretical framework that is supplied by scientific or historical knowledge; but in contrived problems that framework must be provided by the problem itself. Some rules or laws must be set forth within which logical analysis can proceed. The chessboard is the setting for the most famous of all problems in retrograde analysis; the rules of chess provide the needed theoretical context. No skill in playing chess is required, but readers who are not familiar with the rules of chess may skip the illustration that follows.
    
    Retrograde problems in chess commonly take this form: An arrangement of pieces on the chessboard is given; it was reached in a game of chess in which all the rules of the game were obeyed. What move, or series of moves, has just been completed? An example of such a problem follows. The diagram presents a position reached in an actual game of chess, all moves in that game having been made in accordance with the rules of chess. The black king has just moved.

    For the purpose of analysis, the rows are numbered from bottom to top, 1 to 8, and
    the columns are lettered from left to right, a to h. Each square on the board can then be
    identified by a unique letter-number combination: The black king is on a8, the white
    pawn on h2, and so on. The problem is this: The last move was made by black. What
    was that move? And what was white's move just before that? Can you reason out the
    solution before reading the next paragraph?
    
    Retrograde
    
    analysis
    
    Reasoning that seeks to
    explain how things must
    have developed from
    what went before.
    
    chapter 2. Analyzing Arguments
    
    Solution: Because the two kings may never rest on adjacent squares, the black king
    could not have moved to its present position from b7 or from b8; therefore we may be
    certain that the black king has moved from a7, where it was in check.
    
    That much is easily deduced. But what preceding white move could have put the
    black king in check? No move by the white bishop (on g1) could have done it, because
    there would have been no way for that bishop to move to that square, g1, without the
    black king having been in check with white to move. Therefore it must be that the check
    was discovered by the movement of a white piece that had been blocking the bishop's
    attack and was captured by the black king on its move to a8. What white piece could have
    been on that black diagonal and moved from there to the white square in the corner?
    Only a knight that had been on b6. We may therefore be certain that before black's last
    move (the black king from a7 to a8), white's last move was that of a white knight from
    b6 to a8."
    
    Problems of reasoning that confront us in the real world are rarely this tidy. Many
    real problems are not described accurately, and their misdescription may prove so mis-
    leading that no solution can be reached. In cases of that kind, some part or parts of the
    description of the problem need to be rejected or replaced. However, we cannot do this
    when we are seeking to solve logical puzzles of the sort presented here.
  - |-

    In the real world, moreover, even when they are described accurately, problems may
    be incomplete in that something not originally available may be essential for the solu-
    tion. The solution may depend on some additional scientific discovery, or some previ-
    ously unimagined invention or equipment, or the search of some as-yet-unexplored
    territory. In the statement of a logical puzzle, as in the writing of a good murder mystery,
    all the information that is sufficient for the solution must be given; otherwise we feel
    that the mystery writer, or the problem maker, has been unfair to us.
    
    Finally, the logical puzzle presents a sharply formulated question (for example, which
    member of the artistic foursome is the singer? What were black's and white's last moves?)
    whose answer, if given and proved, solves the problem definitively. But that is not the
    form in which many real-world problems arise. Real problems are often identified, ini-
    tially at least, only by the recognition of some inconsistency or the occurrence of an
    unusual event, or perhaps just by the feeling that something is amiss, rather than by
    a well-formed question seeking a clearly defined answer. In spite of these differences,
    contrived problems and puzzles are useful in strengthening our reasoning skills—and
    they are fun.
    
    EXERCISES
    
    The following problems require reasoning for their solution. To prove that an answer
    is correct requires an argument (often containing subsidiary arguments) whose prem-
    ises are contained in the statement of the problem—and whose final conclusion is the
    answer to it. If the answer is correct, it is possible to construct a valid argument prov-
    ing it. In working these problems, readers are urged to concern themselves not merely
    with discovering the answers but also with formulating arguments to prove that those
    answers are correct.

    Of three prisoners in a certain jail, one had normal vision, the second had only one eye, and the third was totally blind. The jailor told the prisoners that, from three white hats and two red hats, he would select three and put them on the prisoners' heads. None could see what color hat he wore. The jailor offered freedom to the prisoner with normal vision if he could tell what color hat he wore. To prevent a lucky guess, the jailor threatened execution for any incorrect answer. The first prisoner could not tell what hat he wore. Next the jailor made the same offer to the one-eyed prisoner. The second prisoner could not tell what hat he wore either. The jailor did not bother making the offer to the blind prisoner, but he agreed to extend the same terms to that prisoner when he made the request. The blind prisoner said:

    Six balls confront you. Two are red; two are green; two are blue. You know that in each color pair, one ball is heavier than the other. You also know that all three of the heavier balls weigh the same, as do all three of the lighter balls. The six balls (call them R1, R2, G1, G2, B1, and B2) are otherwise indistinguishable. You have only a balance scale; if equal weights are placed on the two sides of your scale, they will balance; if unequal weights are placed on the two sides, the heavier side will go down.
    
    With no more than two weighings on that balance scale, how can you identify the heavier and the lighter balls in all three pairs?

    Imagine a room with four walls, with a nail placed in the center of each wall, as well as in the ceiling and floor, six nails in all. The nails are connected to each other by strings, each nail connected to every other nail by a separate string. These strings are of two colors, red or blue, and of no other color. All these strings obviously make many triangles, because any three nails may be considered the apexes of a triangle.
    
    Can the colors of the strings be distributed so that no one triangle has all three sides (strings) of the same color? If so, how? And if not, why not?

     You are presented with a set of twelve metal balls, apparently identical in every respect: size, color,
    and so on. In fact, eleven of them are identical, but one of them is "odd": It differs from all the rest in
    weight only; it is either heavier, or lighter, than all the others. You are given a balance scale, on which the
    balls can be weighed against one another. If the same number of balls are put on each side of the balance,
    and the "odd" ball is on one side, that side will go down if the odd ball is heavier, or up if the odd ball
    is lighter; the two sides will balance if the odd ball is not among those weighed and the same number
    of balls are placed on each side. You are allowed three weighings only; any removal or addition of a ball
    constitutes a separate weighing.
    
    Your challenge is this: Devise a set of three weighings that will enable you to identify the odd ball
    wherever it may lie in a random mixing of the twelve balls, and that will enable you to determine whether
    the odd ball is heavier or lighter than the rest.

    In this chapter we have discussed techniques for the analysis of arguments, and some of the difficulties
    confronted in that process.
    
    In Section 2.1 we explained the paraphrasing of an argumentative passage, in which the essential
    propositions may be reworded (or supplied if they are assumed but missing), and in which premises and
    conclusions are put into the most intelligible order.
    
    In Section 2.2 we explained the diagramming of an argument, in which the propositions of an argu-
    ment are represented by numbers, and the relations of the premises and conclusions are then exhibited
    graphically in two dimensions, by showing on a page the relations of those numbered propositions.
    
    In Section 2.3 we discussed complex argumentative passages, in which the conclusions of subargu-
    ments may serve as premises for further arguments, and whose complete analysis generally requires an
    intricate diagram or an extensive paraphrase.
    
    In Section 2.4 we discussed contrived problems of reasoning, which often mirror the complexities
    confronted by many different kinds of investigation in real life, and whose solutions require the construc-
    tion of extended sets of arguments and subarguments.

    3.1 | Language Functions
    
    When people reason, they typically do so using language, manipulating propositions in
    a logical or informative spirit. But language is used in a great variety of ways, only some of
    which are informative. Without the intention to inform, we may express ourselves using
    language: "That's really great!" we may say; and the poet, overcome by the beauty of an
    ancient city, channels his emotions in writing these lines:
    
    Match me such marvel, save in Eastern clime—
    A rose-red city—""half as old as time." !
    
    Of course, some expressive discourse also has informative content, and may express
    attitudes as well as beliefs.
    
    Grow old along with me!
    The best is yet to be,
    The last of life for which the first was made.'
    
    Moreover, some discourse is directive, with or without expressive or informative ele-
    ments. It seeks to guide or to command. "Step on the scale, please," we may be told, or
    we may receive this good advice:
    
    Drive defensively. The cemetery is full of law-abiding citizens who had the right of way.
    
    A mixture of functions is a natural feature of almost all our uses of language. We can
    see this in our own speech and writing. Emotive language may be used to advance our
    purposes in directing others: "That conduct is utterly disgusting!" says parent to child,

    expressing an attitude, seeking to direct behavior, and (with those same words) probably
    reporting a fact. We may say that language has three major functions:
    
    1. Informative
    2. Expressive
    3. Directive
    
    To these we may add less common types of use:
    
    4. Ceremonial language (as when we say, "How do you do?" upon being introduced to
    a stranger), in which words may combine expressive and other functions; and
    
    5. Performative language (as when we say, "I apologize for my foolish remark"), in
    which words themselves serve, when spoken or written, to perform the function they announce. Other examples are "I congratulate you .. .," "I accept your
    offer ...," and "I promise you that... ."
    
    Logicians are chiefly concerned with language used informatively—affirming or denying propositions, formulating or evaluating arguments, and so on. In reasoning it is this
    informative function of language that is the principal concern.
    
    In this informative mode we can distinguish between facts a sentence formulates and
    facts about the speaker who formulates them. If someone says, "War is always the wrong
    solution to international conflict," that may indeed be true, but it is also evidence of
    the beliefs of the person who utters that remark. When someone says, "I strongly oppose
    our involvement in this war on moral grounds," that is a statement (very probably true)
    about the speaker, but it also serves to express a judgment about the morality of the war
    under discussion. To open an argument with a statement of one's own views is by no
    means deceptive; it is one of the common ways in which judgment and biographical
    report are appropriately integrated.
  - |-
    The uses of language must be distinguished from the forms of language. The several  
    uses of language (informative, expressive, etc.) are implemented using different forms.  
    Sentences (the units of our language that express complete thoughts) may be declara-  
    tive in form, or exclamatory, or imperative, or interrogative. When we are reasoning our  
    sentences are usually declarative. When we are expressing emotion our sentences (e.g.,  
    "That's fantastic!") are often exclamatory. When we are seeking to direct conduct our  
    sentences (e.g., "Take off your shirt!") are likely to be imperative in form—but there is  
    no strict correlation between function and form.
    
    For example, we noted earlier that a premise may be affirmed by asking a rhetorical  
    question. The devout believer asks in prayer, "Who is like unto Thee?"—but it is plain  
    that this interrogative expresses a religious belief. When one responds in a conversa-  
    tion, "What can you possibly mean by that?" a skeptical attitude is very plainly being  
    expressed. Similarly, a directive function may be served by reporting a fact in apparently  
    declarative mode, as when we urge a companion to move more quickly by saying, "It is  
    very late; we are running short of time." And the exclamation, "What lovely flowers!"  
    uttered by a young woman to her gentleman friend as they pass a florist's window, may  
    be intended to function more directively than expressively.
    
    The combination of functions can create a kind of dissonance, even at times leading  
    to troubling controversy. Here is a famous example: During the Vietnam War, a young  
    man protesting the military draft was arrested in the Los Angeles County Courthouse  
    for wearing a jacket on which a deliberate obscenity was emblazoned. He was convicted  
    of "offensive conduct" under the California penal code. His conviction was reversed,  
    3.1
    
    however, by the Supreme Court of the United States, whose majority recognized that  
    there was in this case a tension between the expressive spirit of his language and the  
    informative function of his protest, the latter being protected by the First Amendment  
    of the U.S. Constitution. Justice John Harlan wrote:

     [MJuch linguistic expression serves a dual communicative function: it conveys not only ideas capable of
    relatively precise, detached explication, but otherwise inexpressible emotions as well. In fact, words are often
    chosen as much for their emotive as their cognitive force. We cannot sanction the view that the Constitution,
    while solicitous of the cognitive content of individual speech, has little or no regard for that emotive function
    which, practically speaking, may often be the more important element of the message sought to be com-
    municated. ... and in the same vein, we cannot indulge the facile assumption that one can forbid particular
    words without also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process.?
    
    The emotional offensiveness of some words may (in some contexts) be overridden
    by their more important informative function. Being sensitive to the flexibility of lan-
    guage, and recognizing the different functions served by language in a given context, are
    necessary precursors to the application of the logical analysis that is our central concern
    in this book.
    
    It would be convenient if a given function were invariably executed using language
    in some specific grammatical form, but that is simply not the case. Language is too loose,
    and its uses too variable to expect that. In determining the real function of a sentence,
    therefore, context is always critical.
    
    In summary, the principal uses of language are three: informative, expressive, and
    directive. The grammatical forms of language are essentially four: declarative, interroga-
    tive, imperative, and exclamatory. There is no sure connection between the grammatical
    form of a passage and the use or uses its author intends. Language that serves any one of
    the three principal functions may take any one of the four grammatical forms.

    Emotive Language, Neutral
    Language, and Disputes
    
    Because a given sentence, or passage, can serve several functions—that is, for example,
    it can express feelings while reporting facts—the clever use of language can be deceptive
    or manipulative, and the careless use of language can lead to needless misunderstanding
    and dispute.
    
    The words we use to convey beliefs may be neutral and exact, but they may also have
    (by accident or by design) an impact on the attitudes of our listeners. A rose by any other
    name would smell as sweet (as Shakespeare wrote), but our response to a flower is likely
    to be influenced if we are told, as it is handed to us, that it is commonly called "skunk-
    weed." The negative attitudes that are commonly evoked by some words lead to the
    creation of euphemisms to replace them—gentle words for harsh realities. Janitors become
    "maintenance workers," and then "custodians." "Waiters" become "waitpersons," and
    then "servers"—and so on.
    
    The medical vocabulary dealing with human reproduction and elimination is neutral
    and not offensive, but the four-letter words that are vulgar synonyms of those medical
    terms are shocking to many because of the attitudes they evoke. There are "seven dirty
    words" that may not be used on the broadcast media in the United States—because they
    have unacceptable emotive meanings that are sharply distinguishable from their literal
    meanings.
  - |-
    Emotionally colored language is appropriate in some contexts—in poetry, for example—but it is highly inappropriate in other contexts, for example, in survey research. The responses to a survey will certainly depend in good measure on the words used in asking the questions. Whether we should avoid emotive language, or rely on it, depends on the purpose language is intended to serve in the context. If we aim to provide an unbiased report of facts, we undermine that objective if we use words that are heavily charged with emotional meaning. Sometimes, however, it is nearly impossible to avoid some emotive content—such as when those in conflict about the morality of abortion call themselves either "pro-life," or "pro-choice." In logic we generally strive for language that is, so far as possible, free of the distortion that emotive meanings introduce.
    
    Playing on the emotions of readers and listeners is a central technique in the advertising industry. When the overriding aims are to persuade and sell, manipulating attitudes becomes a sophisticated professional art. Rhetorical tricks are also common in political campaigns, and the choice of words is critical. The best defense against trickery, for voters as for consumers, is an awareness of the real uses to which the language before us is being put. We must be on guard against those who use words to make the worse appear the better cause. "With words," said Benjamin Disraeli, "we govern men."

    When parties are in dispute, the differences between them that lead to that dispute may be disagreements in beliefs about the facts, or disagreements in attitude about facts that are actually agreed upon. This uncertainty, and the confusion to which it can lead, may arise because the words being used in the dispute have very different emo-
    tive meanings. To illustrate this, imagine a dispute between X and Y about legislation authorizing the death penalty for murder. X and Y may agree or disagree about the facts: whether capital punishment really is an effective deterrent to murder. They may also agree or disagree about whether it is right for the state to execute criminals, whatever may be the facts about its deterrent effectiveness. So it is possible that they could agree about factual beliefs but disagree in their attitudes, or they might agree in their attitudes but disagree about their beliefs. It is also possible, of course, that they disagree both in attitude and in belief.
    
    When one seeks to resolve disputes that have both factual and emotional aspects, it is important to determine what really is at issue between the disputing parties. If the disagreement truly is one about whether the death penalty deters in fact, then resolution of the dispute will require, first, an effort to determine those facts objectively—although this may not be easy to do. If, on the other hand, the disagreement arises from conflict-
    ing convictions about the rightness of state-authorized executions, whether or not the death penalty deters, coming to agreement about the facts is likely to prove insufficient to resolve the dispute.
    
    In many cases a disagreement in attitude about some event or possible outcome is rooted in a disagreement in some belief about facts; in other cases it is not. One of the greatest of all football coaches and one of the greatest of all writers on sports differed profoundly about the importance of winning. Wrote the journalist, Grantland Rice:
    
    For when the One Great Scorer comes
    To write against your name,
    
    He marks—not that you won or lost—
    But how you played the game.
    
    Said the coach, Vince Lombardi:
    Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing.
    
    Do you believe that this disagreement in attitude was rooted in a disagreement in belief?
  - |-
    Of course, we do not reach agreement simply by recognizing the nature of the dispute. But until we recognize the real nature of a dispute, and the differing functions of the language used by the conflicting parties, it is unlikely that the resolution of differences can be achieved.

    16. Disputes and Ambiguity
    
    Many disputes, whether about beliefs or about attitudes, are genuine. However, some
    disputes are merely verbal, arising only as a result of linguistic misunderstanding. The
    terms used by the disputing parties may have more than one meaning—they may be
    ambiguous—but such ambiguity may be unrecognized by the disputing parties. To uncover
    and to resolve verbal disagreements, ambiguities must be identified, and the alternative
    meanings of the critical terms in the dispute must be distinguished and clarified.
  - |-
    3.3 Disputes and Ambiguity
    
    Disputes fall into three categories. The first is the obviously genuine dispute. If A roots for the Yankees, and B for the Red Sox, they are in genuine disagreement, although they disagree mainly in attitude. If C believes that Miami is south of Honolulu, and D denies this, they too are in genuine disagreement, but in this dispute about geographic facts a good map can settle the matter.
    
    A second category is disputes in which the apparent conflict is not genuine and can be resolved by coming to agreement about how some word or phrase is to be understood. These may be called merely verbal disputes. F may hold that a tree falling in the wilderness with no person to hear it creates no sound, while G insists that a sound really is produced by the falling tree. If a "sound" is the outcome of a human auditory sensation, then F and G may agree that there was none; or if a "sound" is simply what is produced by vibrations in the air, then they may agree that a sound was indeed produced. Getting clear about what is meant by "sound" will resolve the disagreement, which was no more than verbal.
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:
    
    A third category, more slippery, is disputes that are apparently verbal but really genuine.
    A misunderstanding about the use of terms may be involved in such cases, but when that
    misunderstanding has been cleared up there remains a disagreement that goes beyond
    the meanings of the words. For example, should a film in which explicit sexual activity
    is depicted be considered "pornography"? J holds that its explicitness makes it porno-
    graphic and offensive; K holds that its beauty and sensitivity make it art and not pornog-
    raphy. Plainly they disagree about what "pornography" means—but after that ambiguity
    has been exposed, it is likely that the parties will still disagree in their judgment of that
    film. Whether the film is "pornographic" may be settled by a definition of that term,
    but a deeper disagreement is then likely to be exposed. The word "pornographic" plainly
    carries pejorative associations. J, who finds the film objectionable, understands the word
    "pornographic" in one way, while K, who approves of the film, uses the word "porno-
    graphic" differently. Does the sexually explicit content of the film make it objectionable
    and thus "pornographic"? J and K differ in their uses of the word, but for both of them
    the emotional meaning of the word is very negative; and they also differ about the cri-
    teria for the application of that negative word, "pornography."
    
    In summary, when confronting a dispute that arises in discourse, we must first ask
    whether there is some ambiguity that can be eliminated by clarifying the alternative
    meanings in play. If there is, then we must ask whether clearing up that linguistic issue
    will resolve the matter. If it does, the dispute was indeed merely verbal. If it does not, the
    dispute was genuine, although it may have appeared to be merely verbal.

    3.4 | Definitions and Their Uses
    
    Good definitions are plainly very helpful in eliminating verbal disputes, but there are other
    uses of definition that are important in logic. Before distinguishing these uses, one feature
    of all definitions must be emphasized: Definitions are definitions of symbols (not of objects),
    because only symbols have the meanings that definitions may explain. To illustrate, we
    can define the word "chair" because it has meaning; but a chair itself we cannot define.
    We can sit on a chair, or paint it, or burn it, or describe it—but we cannot define it because
    an actual chair is not a symbol that has a meaning to be explained. Sometimes we say,
    misleadingly, that the thing is being defined; in fact, what we define are always symbols.
    
    Two commonly used technical terms are useful in discussing definitions. The
    definiendum is the symbol being defined. The definiens is the symbol (or group of
    symbols) used to explain the meaning of the definiendum. Put otherwise, the definiendum
    is the term to be defined and the definiens is the definition of it. However, it would be a
    mistake to say that the definiens is the meaning of the definiendum—rather, it is another
    symbol (or group of symbols) that has the same meaning as the definiendum.
    
    With this preface, we may say that definitions, depending on how they are used, are
    of five kinds: (A) stipulative, (B) lexical, (C) precising, (D) theoretical, and (E) persuasive.
    We shall consider each in turn:
    
    A. Stipulative Definitions
  - |-
    A definition that has a meaning that is deliberately assigned to some symbol is called a Stipulative definition. One who introduces a new symbol is free to assign to it, or stipulate, whatever meaning she cares to. Even an old term put into a new context may have its meaning stipulated. Definitions of this sort are sometimes called nominal.
    
    Why introduce a term by stipulation? Many reasons can justify doing so. It may simply be convenient; one word may stand for many words in a message. It may protect
    
    Definiendum
    
    In any definition, the word or symbol being defined.
    
    Definiens
    
    In any definition, a symbol or group of symbols that is said to have the same meaning as the definiendum.
    
    Stipulative definition
    
    A definition in which a new symbol is introduced to which some meaning is arbitrarily assigned; as opposed to a lexical definition, a stipulative definition cannot be correct or incorrect.
    
    Chapter 3. Language and Definitions
  - |-
    Secrecy, if the sender and the receiver are the only persons who understand the stipulation. It may advance economy of expression. In the sciences, new symbols are often defined by stipulation to mean what has been meant by a long sequence of familiar words, thus saving time and increasing clarity. Many numbers that would be cumbersome to write out, for example, have been given names by stipulation: The prefix "zetta-" has been stipulatively defined as the number equal to a billion trillions (10^21), and the prefix "yotta-" as the number equal to a trillion trillions (10^24). These were defined stipulatively in 1991 by the Conférence générale des poids et mesures (General Committee on Weights and Measures), the international body that governs in the realm of scientific units. At the other extreme, "zepto-" has been stipulatively defined as "a billionth of a trillionth," and "yocto-" as a trillionth of a trillionth. Perhaps the most famous of all stipulations was the arbitrary naming of the number 10^100 (represented by the digit 1 followed by 100 zeros) as a "googol"—a name suggested by the 9-year-old nephew of the mathematician, Edward Kasner, when he was asked for a word that might appropriately represent a very large number. The name of the now-famous Internet search firm, Google, is a deliberate misspelling of this term.
  - |-
    Some stipulative definitions are introduced in science to free the investigator from the distractions of the emotive associations of more familiar terms. In modern psychology, for example, the word "intelligence" is widely replaced by Spearman's "g factor"—a term intended to convey the same descriptive meaning without any emotional baggage. Excitement and interest may also be provided by introducing a catchy new term, as when "black hole" was introduced to replace "gravitationally completely collapsed star." The term was introduced by Dr. John Archibald Wheeler at a 1967 meeting of the Institute for Space Studies in New York City. The word "quark," now widely used in physics, was introduced by the physicist Murray Gell-Mann in 1963 to name a type of subatomic particle about which he had been theorizing. In James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake, the word "quark" appears in the line, "Three quarks for Muster Mark," but Dr. Gell-Mann reported that he had chosen this name for the particle before he had encountered it in that novel. In philosophy, Charles Sanders Peirce had long referred to his philosophy as "pragmatism," but when that word came to be used carelessly he stipulated that his views would henceforth be known as "pragmaticism"—a word that is ugly enough, he said, that no one would want to steal it!
    
    A stipulative definition is neither true nor false; it is neither accurate nor inaccurate. A symbol defined by a stipulative definition did not have that meaning before it was given that meaning by the definition, so the definition cannot be a report of the term's meaning. For anyone who accepts the stipulative definition, the definiendum and the definiens have the same meaning; that is a consequence of the definition, not a fact asserted by it. A stipulative definition is a proposal (or a resolution or a request or an instruction) to use the definiendum to mean what is meant by the definiens. Such a definition is therefore directive rather than informative. Proposals may be rejected, requests refused, instructions disobeyed—but they can be neither true nor false.
  - |-
    Stipulative definitions may be evaluated as useful in advancing some purpose, or as useless because they are too complex or unclear, but they cannot resolve genuine disagreements. By reducing the emotive role of language, however, and by simplifying discourse, they can help to prevent fruitless conflict.
    
    B. Lexical Definitions
    
    Most often the term being defined has some established use. When the purpose of the definition is to explain that use, or to eliminate ambiguity, the definition is called lexical.
    
    3.4 Definitions and Their Uses
    
    A lexical definition reports a meaning the definiendum already has. That report may be correct or incorrect—and therefore it is clear that a lexical definition may be either true or false. Thus the definition "the word 'bird' means any warm-blooded vertebrate with feathers" is true; that is a correct report of how the word "bird" is generally used by speakers of English. On the other hand, the definition "the word 'bird' means any two-footed mammal" is obviously false.
    
    Mistakes in word usage are usually not so obvious. We may call muddy water "turgid" when we mean to say that it is "turbid"; the lexical definition of "turgid" is "swollen" or "pompous." Some mistakes are downright funny, as when Mrs. Malaprop, a comically misspeaking character of the Restoration dramatist Richard Sheridan, gives the order to "illiterate him ... from your memory" or uses the phrase "as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile." Nor are such confusions always fictional. At a U.S. university in 1993, students defined "actuary" as "a home for birds," and the definition of "duode-cnum" was given as "a number system in base 2."° Whether they are funny or sad, these are mistakes—incorrect reports of how English-speaking people use these words.
  - |-
    Here lies the central difference between lexical and stipulative definitions: Truth or falsity may apply to the former but not the latter. In a stipulative definition the definiendum has no meaning apart from (or before) the definition that introduces it, so that the definition cannot be true or false. But the definiendum of a lexical definition does have a prior and independent meaning, and therefore its definition may be true, or false, depending on whether that meaning is reported correctly or incorrectly.
    
    What we here call a lexical definition has been referred to by some as a "real" definition—to indicate that the definiendum really does have the meaning identified. However, the question of whether the definiendum names any real or actually existing thing has nothing to do with whether the definition is lexical or stipulative. The definition "the word ‘unicorn' means an animal like a horse but having a single straight horn projecting from its forehead" surely is a lexical definition, and a correct one; its definiendum means exactly what is meant by the definiens—but the definiendum in this case does not name or denote any existing thing, because there are no unicorns.
    
    A qualification must be made at this point. Some definitions are indeed simply mistaken, but some uses that depart from what is normal may be better described as unusual or unorthodox. Word usage is a statistical matter, subject to variation over time—and therefore we cannot always specify "the" correct meaning of a term, but must give an account of its various meanings, as determined by the uses it has in actual speech and writing.

    Some lexicographers try to overcome this variability by referring to "best" usage or
    "correct" usage. This effort cannot fully succeed, however, because "best" usage is also an
    inexact matter, measured by the number of prominent authors and speakers whose uses
    of the given term are in accord with that definition. Literary and academic uses of words
    lag behind changes in a living language, so definitions that report meanings accepted by
    some intellectual aristocracy are likely to be out of date. What is unorthodox at a given
    time may soon become commonplace. So lexical definitions must not ignore the ways in
    which a term is used by great numbers of those who speak that language, because if lexical
    definitions are not true to actual usage, the reports they give will not be entirely correct.
    To take account of language growth, good dictionaries often indicate which meanings of
    words are "archaic" or "obsolete," and which meanings are "colloquial" or "slang."
    
    With this qualification understood—that is, bearing in mind the variability of a liv-
    ing language—lexical definitions are in essence true or false, in the sense that they may
    be true to actual usage, or may fail to be true to it.
    
    Lexical
    
    definition
    
    A definition that reports
    the meaning that the
    definiendum already
    has. A lexical definition
    can be true or false.

    C. Precising Definitions
    
    Some terms are ambiguous; some terms are vague. A term is ambiguous in a given con-
    text when it has more than one distinct meaning and the context does not make clear
    which meaning is intended. A term is vague when there are borderline cases to which the
    term might or might not apply. A word or a phrase—for example, "libel" or "freedom of
    speech"—may be both ambiguous and vague. Precising definitions are those used to
    eliminate ambiguity or vagueness.
  - |-
    Every term is vague to some degree, but excessive vagueness causes serious practical problems. This is particularly true in the law, where acts that are forbidden by some statute need to be sharply defined. For example, as this is being written the precise meaning of the phrase "unreasonable searches," which lies at the heart of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, is becoming the focus of a sharp debate within, and among, appellate courts. Global Positioning Devices surreptitiously placed by police now make possible the tracking of all the movements of persons suspected of a crime. Such tracking yields evidence that sometimes results in criminal conviction. Is evidence gathered in this way permissible? Simply trailing a suspect is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because people have no expectation of privacy for actions exposed to public view. But GPS technology permits prolonged surveillance; it reveals business practices, church-going habits, recreational interests, the identity of associates, and even sexual escapades. Is this a search that requires a judicial warrant? In 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that it is, overturning a conviction that had been obtained using such evidence without a warrant.® The supreme courts of Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, and Washington agree, recently ruling that their state constitutions require police to obtain a warrant for the use of such devices. But decisions in three similar GPS-related cases (in Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco) have been criticized by the U.S. Supreme Court. Some judges have argued that tracing the movements of a car is not a search at all. In 2012, in United States v. Jones,' the Supreme Court ruled that placing a GPS device on a vehicle to monitor the vehicle's movements is indeed a search under the Fourth Amendment, and, as such, requires a warrant. Since 2012, a number of Supreme Court decisions (e.g., Grady v. North Carolina, 2015°) have further clarified what is and is not a search, and thereby, the realm of applicability of the Fourth Amendment. As of November 28, 2017, the Supreme Court was addressing the issue (Carpenter v. United States?) of whether the police need a warrant to access a record

    of a person's historical cell phone locations. These cases clearly show that technological
    advances often necessitate Supreme Court decisions, which in turn make progress toward
    precising definitions of key legal terms.
    
    The vagueness of units of measurement in science is a serious problem. "Horsepower,"
    for example, is commonly used in reporting the power of motors, but its vagueness invited
    commercial deception. To overcome that, a precise definition was needed. "One horse-
    power" is now defined precisely as "the power needed to raise a weight of 550 pounds
    by one foot in one second"—calculated to be equal to 745.7 watts. (The power of one real
    horse is much greater, estimated to be about equal to 18,000 watts! A 200-horsepower
    automobile, therefore, has approximately the power of ten real horses.)
    
    A meter is the internationally accepted unit of measure for distance. Originally it
    was defined, by stipulation, as one ten-millionth of the distance from one of the Earth's
    poles to the equator, and this was represented by a pair of carefully inscribed scratches
    on a metal bar made of platinum-iridium, kept in a vault near Paris, France. However,
    scientific research required more precision. A "meter" is now defined, precisely, as "the
    distance light travels in vacuum in one 299,792,458th of a second." Building on this, a
    "liter" is defined precisely as the volume of a cube having edges of 0.1 meter.
    
    The vagueness of terms such as "horsepower" and "meter" cannot be eliminated by
    appealing to ordinary usage, because ordinary usage is not sufficiently exact. If it were,
    the terms would not have been vague. Therefore, borderline cases can be resolved only
    by going beyond the report of normal usage with the definition given. Such definitions
    are called precising definitions.
  - |-
    A precising definition differs from both lexical and stipulative definitions. It dif-
    fers from stipulative definitions in that its definiendum is not a new term, but one
    whose usage is known, although unhappily vague. In constructing a precising defini-
    tion, therefore, we are not free to assign to the definiendum any meaning we please.
    Established usage must be respected as far as possible, while making the known term
    more precise. Neither can a precising definition be a simple report, because it must go
    beyond established usage if the vagueness of the definiendum is to be reduced. How that
    is done—how the gaps in ordinary language are filled in—may indeed be a matter of
    outright stipulation.
    
    Appellate court judges are often obliged to define some common terms more pre-
    cisely. The definitions they provide are not mere stipulations, because even when the
    judges go beyond established usage, they will explain their reasons for the refinements
    being introduced. For example, unreasonable searches and seizures are forbidden by the
    Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and evidence obtained through an unrea-
    sonable seizure is generally held to be inadmissible in court. But what is a "seizure"?
    Suppose a suspect, running from the police, throws away a packet of drugs, which is
    then confiscated. Have those drugs been seized? A precising definition was formulated
    by the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve this matter. A seizure, the Court concluded, must
    involve either the use of some physical force that restrains movement, or the assertion
    of authority (such as an order to stop) to which a subject yields. If the subject keeps
    running, no seizure has occurred; the packet of drugs he throws while running from the
    police therefore cannot be the product of an unreasonable seizure, and will be admis-
    sible as evidence.'°
    
    The precise definitions of terms can be very important in the world of commerce. For
    example, is a sport utility vehicle (SUV) a car or a light truck? The fuel economy standards
    applied to "light trucks" are more lenient than those applied to "cars," and therefore
    auto manufacturers must know the criteria that will be used by the U.S. Department of
    Transportation to define these categories precisely.'!

    If a law is so vague that a citizen cannot be expected to be sure when he is disobey-
    ing it, it may be struck down by a court. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall
    long ago explained the need for precising definitions in law:
    
    It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly
    defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First... we insist that laws give the person of ordinary
    intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws
    may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is
    to be prevented, law must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly
    delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective
    basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third... where a vague statute
    abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those
    freedoms. Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to "steer far wider of the unlawful zone" than if the
    boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked. '?

    Theoretical
    Definition
      
    A definition that
    encapsulates an
    understanding of the
    theory in which that
    
    term is a key element.
      
    This principle was applied in 1996 when a federal law making it illegal to transmit
    "indecent" or "patently offensive" materials on the Internet was struck down as imper-
    missibly vague.'® To avoid such uncertainties, legislatures often preface the operative por-
    tions of a statute with a section called "definitions," in which the precise meanings of
    key terms in that statute are spelled out. Similarly, in labor-management contracts, the
    terms setting forth the agreed-upon rules of the workplace will be very carefully defined.
    Precising definitions are conceptual instruments of wide importance.
      
    D. Theoretical Definitions
      
    In science, and in philosophy, definitions often serve as a compressed summary, or reca-
    pitulation, of some theory. Such definitions, when they are faulty, are criticized not so
    much because they are not precise as because they are not adequate—they do not cor-
    rectly encapsulate the theory in question.
  - |-
    How, for example, should we define the word "planet"? For many years it was believed
    with little controversy, and all children were taught, that planets are simply bodies in
    orbit around the sun and that there are nine planets in the solar system—of which the
    smallest is Pluto, made of unusual stuff, with an unusual orbit, and most distant from the
    sun. But other bodies, larger than Pluto and oddly shaped, have been discovered orbiting
    the sun. Are they also planets? Why not? Older definitions had become conceptually
    inadequate. An intense controversy within the International Astronomical Union (IAUV),
    still not fully resolved, has resulted in a new definition of "planet," according to which
    there are only eight planets in our solar system. And now a new category, "dwarf planet"
    (for bodies such as Pluto, Ceres, and Eris), has been defined. Needed were definitions
    that would accommodate new discoveries as well as old, while maintaining a consistent
    and fully intelligible account of the entire system. Such definitions (not as simple as we
    might like) were adopted by the IAU in 2006. A planet is "a celestial body that, within
    the Solar System, (1) is in orbit around the Sun; and (2) has sufficient mass for its self-
    gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly
    round) shape; and (3) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit." In a system other
    than our solar system, the new definition requires that the body (1) be in orbit around a
    star or stellar remnant; and (2) have a mass below the limiting mass for thermonuclear
    fusion of deuterium; and (3) be above the minimum mass/size requirement for planetary
    status in the solar system.
    
    In such controversies it is not simply the use of some word, such as "planet," that
    is at issue. What is wanted is a comprehensive grasp of the theory in which that term is
    a key element. A definition that encapsulates this larger understanding we rightly call a
    theoretical definition.

    In philosophy also, theoretical definitions are sought. When Socrates struggles to find the correct definition of "justice" in Plato's Republic, he is not simply seeking a set of words that can serve as a synonym for "justice." When Spinoza, in the Ethics, seeks to define "bondage" and "freedom," he is not examining how people use those words, nor is he merely hoping to eliminate borderline cases. Neither lexical nor precising (and certainly not stipulative) definitions are the philosophical objectives. More deeply, philosophers commonly seek to develop an account of human virtues that will help us to understand these and other forms of right conduct.
    
    The quest for theoretical definitions remains compelling. What is a "right"? Is healthcare a right? Do nonhuman animals have rights? How might we best define the term?
    
    3.4 Definitions and Their Uses
    
    Which nations truly manifest "democracy"? Is the fact that leaders are elected by popular vote sufficient to make a government democratic? If not, what other political institutions or patterns of citizen conduct characterize democratic communities? What is the most appropriate application of that term? Theoretical definitions are the products of our comprehensive understanding in some sphere.
    
    E. Persuasive Definitions
    
    The four categories we have discussed so far are concerned chiefly with the informative use of language. But definitions are also used at times to express feelings as well, so as to influence the conduct of others. A definition put forward to resolve a dispute by influencing attitudes or stirring emotions may be called a persuasive definition.
    
    Persuasive definitions are common in political argument. From the left we hear socialism defined as "democracy extended to the economic sphere." From the right we hear capitalism defined as "freedom in the economic sphere." The directive intent of the emotive language in these definitions is obvious—but emotive coloration may also be injected subtly into wording that purports to be a correct lexical definition, and that appears on the surface to be that. As we seek to distinguish good reasoning from bad, we must be on guard against persuasive definitions.
    
    In summary, we have distinguished five ways in which definitions are used. Thus any definition may be categorized in accordance with its principal function:
    
    Stipulative  
    Lexical  
    Precising  
    Theoretical  
    Persuasive.
  - |-
    Of course, some definitions may serve more than one of these functions. A stipulative definition may be intended to influence hearers manipulatively. A lexical definition may be used objectively to make discussion of some matter more precise, and so on. Here, as everywhere in language, context is critical.
    
    Persuasive
    definition
    
    A definition formulated
    and used to resolve a
    dispute by influencing
    attitudes or stirring
    emotions, often relying
    upon the use of emotive
    language.

    Federal law imposes a five-year mandatory prison sentence on anyone who "uses or carries a firearm" in
    connection with a narcotics crime. In 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court faced this question: Does traveling in a
    car with a gun in a locked glove compartment or trunk—as opposed to carrying a gun on one's person—
    satisfy the meaning of "carry" in that law? Justice Stephen Breyer argued that Congress intended the word
    in its ordinary, everyday meaning, without the artificial limitation that it be immediately accessible. Quoting
    Robinson Crusoe and Moby Dick, he pointed to the common use of "carry" to mean "convey in a vehicle."

    The mandatory sentence, he concluded, is thus properly imposed. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg found Breyer's
    literary evidence selective and unpersuasive; in response, she offered quotations from Rudyard Kipling, the
    TV series M*A *S*H., and President Theodore Roosevelt's "Speak softly and carry a big stick" to show that
    "carry" is properly understood in the federal statute to mean "the gun at hand, ready for use as a weapon"
    
    [Muscarello v. U.S., U.S. 96-1654 (1998)].
    
    In this controversy, which side puts forward the better precising definition?
    
    The Structure of Definitions:
    Extension and Intension
  - |-
    A definition states the meaning of a term. When we look closely at the literal (or descriptive) meaning of a term, however, we see that there are different senses in which that term has meaning. With those different senses distinguished (our object just below), we will also see that definitions may be grouped and understood not only on the basis of their functions (as in the preceding section), but in view of the way those definitions are built: their structure.
    
    We focus on general terms—terms that are applicable to more than one object—which are of critical importance in reasoning. The word "planet" is a typical general term; it is applicable to a number of objects, and it applies in the same sense equally to Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. (But not to Pluto! As explained in the preceding section, Pluto is now classified by the International Astronomical Union as a "dwarf planet.") What is meant by the word "planet" is (in one sense) that set of objects. The collection of planets constitutes the meaning of the term, its extensional meaning. If I say that all planets have elliptical orbits, part of what I assert is that Mars has an elliptical orbit, and another part is that Venus has an elliptical orbit, and so on. The extension of the general term "planet" consists of the objects to which the term may be correctly applied. The extensional meaning (also called the denotative meaning) of a general term is the collection of the objects that constitutes the extension (or denotation) of the term.
  - |-
    To understand the meaning of a general term is to know how to apply it correctly;
    however, it is not necessary to know all the objects to which it may be applied correctly in
    order to apply it correctly. All the objects within the extension of a given term have some
    common attributes or characteristics that lead us to use the same term to denote them.
    If we know these attributes, we may know the meaning of a term in a different sense,
    without knowing its extension. In this second sense, meaning supposes some criterion for
    deciding, with respect to any given object, whether it falls within the extension of that
    term. This sense of meaning is called the intensional meaning (or, sometimes, connotative
    meaning) of the term. The set of attributes shared by all and only those objects to which
    a general term refers is called the intension (or connotation) of that term.
    
    Every general term has both an intensional (or connotative) meaning and an extensional
    (or denotative) meaning. Consider the general term "skyscraper." It applies correctly to all
    buildings over a certain height; that is its intension. The extension of the term "skyscraper"
    is the class of buildings that contains the Empire State Building in New York, the Willis
    Tower in Chicago, the Shanghai World Financial Center, the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala
    Lumpur, and others also—that is, the collection of the objects to which the term applies.
    
    3.5 The Structure of Definitions: Extension and Intension
    
    The extension of a term (its membership) is determined by its intension. The inten-
    sion of the term "equilateral triangle" is the attribute of being a plane figure enclosed by
    three straight lines of equal length. The extension of "equilateral triangle" is the class
    of all those objects, and only those objects, that have this attribute. Because any object
    that has this attribute must be a member of that class, we say that the term's intension
    determines its extension.
  - |-
    However, the reverse is not true: The extension of a term does not determine its  
    intension. Consider "equiangular triangle," which has an intension different from that  
    of "equilateral triangle." The intension of "equiangular triangle" is the attribute of being  
    a plane figure enclosed by three straight lines that intersect each other to form equal  
    angles. It is true, of course, that the extension of the term "equiangular triangle" is  
    exactly the same as the extension of the term "equilateral triangle." So if we were to  
    identify the extension of one of these terms, that would leave the intension of the class  
    uncertain; intension is not determined by extension. Terms may have different inten-  
    sions and the same extension; but terms with different extensions cannot possibly have  
    the same intension.
    
    When attributes are added to the intension of a term, we say that the intension  
    increases. Begin with a general term such as "person." Add "living." Add "over 20 years  
    old." Add "born in Mexico." With each such addition the intension increases; the inten-  
    sion of the term, "Living person over 20 years old born in Mexico," is far greater than  
    that of "person." So these terms are given here in order of increasing intension. However,  
    increasing their intention decreases their extension. The number of living persons is  
    much lower than that of persons, and the number of living persons over 20 years old is  
    lower still, and so on.

    One may be tempted to say that extension and intension always vary inversely,  
    but in fact that is not the case. This is because there comes a point when increasing the  
    intension of the term has no effect on its extension. Consider this series: "living person,"  
    "living person with a spinal column," "living person with a spinal column less than one  
    thousand years old," "living person with a spinal column less than one thousand years  
    old who has not read all the books in the Library of Congress." These terms are clearly in  
    order of increasing intension, but the extension of each of them is exactly the same, not  
    decreasing at all. So we can say that, if terms are arranged in order of increasing inten-  
    sion, their extensions will be in nonincreasing order. That is, if extensions vary, they will  
    vary inversely with the intensions.
    
    Note that the extensions of some terms are empty; there simply are no objects hav-  
    ing the indicated attributes. In Greek mythology, Bellerophon killed the fire-breathing  
    Chimera, a monster with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail. We fully under-  
    stand the intension of the term Chimera, but it has no extension.
    
    Some bad arguments play on the fact that meaning can refer to extension or to inten-  
    sion, while extension may be empty. For example:
    
    The word "God" is not meaningless; therefore it has a meaning. But by definition, the word "God" means a  
    being who is all-powerful and supremely good. Therefore that all-powerful and supremely good being, God,  
    must exist.
    
    The word "God" is certainly not meaningless, and so there is an intension that is its  
    meaning. However, it does not follow from the fact that a term has an intension that  
    it denotes any existent thing. The useful distinction between intension and extension

    was introduced and emphasized by St. Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109), who is best
    known for his "ontological argument"—to which the preceding fallacious argument has
    little resemblance.
    
    A contemporary critic has argued in similar fashion:
    
    Kitsch is the sign of vulgarity, sleaze, schlock, sentimentality, and bad faith that mark and mar our human
    condition. That is why utopia can be defined as a state of affairs in which the term has disappeared because
    it no longer has a referent.'4
    
    Here the writer has failed to distinguish between meaning and referent. Many valuable
    terms—those naming mythological creatures, for example—have no existing referent, no
    extension, but we do not want or expect such terms to disappear. Terms with intension
    but no extension are very useful. If utopia someday comes, we may wish to express our
    good fortune in having eliminated "kitsch" and "sleaze," but to do that we will need to
    be able to use those very words meaningfully.
    
    We now use the distinction between intension and extension to explain some tech-
    niques for constructing definitions. Some definitions approach a general term by focus-
    ing on the class of objects to which the term refers. Some definitions approach a general
    term by focusing on the attributes that determine the class. Each approach, as we shall
    see, has advantages and disadvantages.
    
    EXERCISES
    
    A. Arrange each of the following groups of terms in order of increasing intension:
    
    1. Animal, feline, lynx, mammal, vertebrate, wildcat.
    
    2. Alcoholic beverage, beverage, champagne, fine white wine, white wine, wine.
    3. Athlete, ball player, baseball player, fielder, infielder, shortstop.
    
    4. Cheese, dairy product, Limburger, milk derivative, soft cheese, strong soft cheese.
    5. Integer, number, positive integer, prime number, rational number, real number.
    
    B. Divide the following list of terms into five groups of five terms each, arranged in
    order of increasing intension:
  - |-
    Aquatic animal, beast of burden, beverage, brandy, cognac, domestic animal, filly, fish, foal, game fish, horse,
    instrument, liquid, liquor, musical instrument, muskellunge, parallelogram, pike, polygon, quadrilateral, rec-
    tangle, square, Stradivarius, string instrument, violin.
    
    A. Extension and Denotative Definitions
    
    Denotative definitions employ techniques that identify the extension of the term
    being defined. The most obvious way to explain the extension of a term is to iden-
    tify the objects denoted by it. This is one very effective technique, but it has serious
    limitations.
    
    We saw in the preceding section that two terms with different intensions (e.g., "equi-
    lateral triangle" and "equiangular triangle") may have the same extension. Therefore,
    
    3.5 The Structure of Definitions: Extension and Intension
    
    even if we could enumerate all the objects denoted by a general term, that would not
    distinguish it from another term that has the very same extension.
    
    Of course it is usually impossible to enumerate all the objects in a class. The objects
    denoted by the term "star" are literally astronomical in number; the objects denoted by
    the term "number" are infinitely many. For most general terms, complete enumeration
    is practically out of the question. Therefore denotative definitions are restricted to partial
    enumerations of the objects denoted—and this limitation gives rise to serious difficulties.
    The core of the problem is this: Partial enumeration of a class leaves the meaning of the
    general term very uncertain.

    Any given object has many attributes, and thus may be included in the extensions of many different general terms. Therefore, any object given as an example of a general term is likely to be an example of many general terms with very different intensions. If I give the example of the Empire State Building to explain the term "skyscraper," there are many other classes of things to which I could be referring. Even if we give two examples, or three, or four, the same problem arises. Suppose I list, along with the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and the Trump Tower. What is the class I have in mind? It could be skyscrapers, but all these are also "great structures of the twentieth century," or "expensive pieces of real estate in Manhattan," or "landmarks in New York City." In addition, each of these general terms denotes objects not denoted by the others. Hence, partial enumeration cannot distinguish among terms that have different extensions.
    
    We may seek to overcome this problem by naming groups of members of the class as examples. This technique, definition by subclass, does sometimes make complete enumeration possible. Thus we might define "vertebrate" to mean "amphibians and birds and fishes and reptiles and mammals." The completeness of the list gives some psychological satisfaction—but the meaning of the term "vertebrate" has not been adequately specified by such a definition.
    
    Instead of naming or describing the objects denoted by the term being defined, as ordinary denotative definitions do, we might try pointing at them. Such definitions are called ostensive definitions or demonstrative definitions. An example of an ostensive definition is "the word 'desk' means this," accompanied by a gesture such as pointing a finger in the direction of a desk.
  - |-
    Ostensive definitions have all the limitations mentioned earlier, as well as some limitations peculiar to themselves. Gestures have a geographic limitation; one can only indicate what is visible. We cannot ostensively define the word "ocean" in an inland valley. More seriously, gestures are invariably ambiguous. To point to a desk is also to point to a part of it, as well as to its color and its size and its shape and material, and so on—in fact, one points to everything that lies in the general direction of the desk, including the lamp or the wall behind it.
    
    This ambiguity might sometimes be resolved by adding a descriptive phrase to the definiens, thus producing a quasi-ostensive definition—for example, "the word 'desk' means this article of furniture" accompanied by the appropriate gesture. However, such an addition supposes the prior understanding of the phrase "article of furniture," which defeats the purpose that ostensive definitions have been claimed to serve, having been alleged by some to be the "primary" (or primitive) definitions—the way we first learn the meanings of words. In reality, we first learn language by observing and imitating, not by relying on definitions.
    
    Beyond such difficulties, all denotative definitions have this further inadequacy: They cannot define words that, although perfectly meaningful, do not denote anything at

    All. When we say that there are no unicorns, we are asserting, meaningfully, that the term
    "unicorn" does not denote, that its extension is empty. Terms with no extension are very
    important, and this shows that techniques of definition that rely on extension cannot
    reach the heart of the matter. "Unicorn" has no extension, but the term is certainly not
    meaningless. If it were meaningless, it would also be meaningless to say, "There are no
    unicorns." This statement we fully understand, and it is true. Meaning pertains more to
    intension than to extension; the real key to definition is intension.

    B. Intension and Intensional Definitions
    
    A term that is sometimes used instead of "intension" is "connotation"; intensional defi-
    nitions are connotative definitions. We avoid the use of the word "connotation" here
    because, in everyday English, the connotation of a term is its total significance, including
    especially its emotive as well as its descriptive meaning. Because we are concerned here
    only with informative significance, we put the term "connotation" aside; this section
    therefore uses the terms "intension" and "intensional."
    
    The intension of a term, we have said, consists of the attributes shared by all the objects
    denoted by the term, and shared only by those objects. If the attributes that define the
    term "chair" are "being a single raised seat" and "having a back," then every chair is a
    single raised seat with a back, and only chairs are single raised seats with a back.
  - |-
    Even within this restriction, three different senses of intension must be distinguished:
    the subjective, the objective, and the conventional. The subjective intension of a
    word for a speaker is the set of all the attributes the speaker believes to be possessed by
    objects denoted by that word. This set varies from individual to individual, and even
    from time to time for the same individual, and thus cannot serve the purposes of defini-
    tion. The public meanings of words, not their private interpretations, are the logician's
    concern. The objective intension of a word is the total set of characteristics shared
    by all the objects in the word's extension. Within the objective intension of the term
    "circle," therefore, is the attribute that a circle encloses a greater area than any other
    plane figure having an equal perimeter. However, this attribute of circles is one that
    many who use the word are completely unaware of. No one possesses the omniscience
    required to understand all the attributes shared by the objects denoted by general terms,
    and therefore objective intension cannot be the public meaning whose explanation we
    seek to give.
    
    People do communicate with one another and therefore do understand the terms
    they use; hence there must be publicly available intensions that are neither subjective
    nor objective in the senses just explained. Terms have stable meanings because there is
    an implicit agreement to use the same criterion for deciding about any object whether
    it is part of a given term's extension. What makes a thing a circle, in common discourse,
    is its being a closed plane curve, all points of which are equidistant from a point within
    called the center. It is by convention that this criterion is established, and this mean-
    ing is the conventional intension of the term "circle." This is the important sense
    of intension for purposes of definition: It is public but does not require omniscience to
    use. The word "intension" is normally taken to mean conventional intension, and that is
    our usage here.
  - |-
    What are the techniques, using intension, for defining terms? Several methods are common. The simplest and most frequently used is that of providing another word, whose meaning is already understood, that has the same meaning as the word being defined. Two words with the same meaning are called synonyms, so a definition given in this way is called a synonymous definition. Dictionaries, especially smaller ones, rely heavily on this method of defining terms. Thus a dictionary may define adage as meaning "proverb"; bashful may be defined as "shy"; and so on. Synonymous definitions are particularly useful when it is the meanings of words in another language that call for explanation. The word chat means "cat" in French; amigo means "friend" in Spanish; and so on. One learns the vocabulary of a foreign language by studying definitions using synonyms.
    
    This is a good method of defining terms; it is easy, efficient, and helpful; but it has very serious limitations. Many words have no exact synonym, and therefore synonymous definitions are often not fully accurate and may mislead. Translation from one language to another can never be perfectly faithful to the original, and often fails to catch its spirit or convey its depth. From this realization comes the Italian proverb, "Traduttore, traditore" ("Translator, traitor").
    
    A more serious limitation of synonymous definitions is this: When the concept the word aims to convey is simply not understood, every synonym may be as puzzling to the reader or hearer as the definiendum itself. Synonyms are virtually useless, therefore, when the aim is to construct a precising or a theoretical definition.
    
    One may seek to explain the intension of a term by tying the definiendum to some clearly describable set of actions or operations; doing that is giving the term what is called an operational definition.
    
    The term operational definition was first used by the Nobel Prize-winning physicist P. W. Bridgeman in his 1927 book, The Logic of Modern Physics.

    For example, in the wake of the success of Einstein's theory of relativity, space and
    time could no longer be defined in the abstract way that Newton had used. It was there-
    fore proposed to define such terms "operationally"—that is, by means of the operations
    actually undertaken when we measure distances and durations. An operational defini-
    tion of a term states that the term is applied correctly to a given case if and only if the

    Definition by genus
    and difference
    
    A type of connotative
    definition of a term
    that first identifies the
    larger class ("genus") of
    which the definiendum
    is a species or subclass,
    and then identifies the
    attribute ("difference")
    that distinguishes the
    members of that species
    from members of all
    other species in that
    genus.
    
    The performance of specified operations in that case yields a specified result. The numerical value given for length can be defined operationally by referring to the results of a specified measuring procedure, and so on. Only public and repeatable operations are accepted in the definiens of an operational definition. Social scientists have also applied this technique. Some psychologists, for example, have sought to replace abstract definitions of "mind" and "sensation" by operational definitions that refer only to behavior or to physiological observations.
  - |-
    Of all the kinds of definition, the one that is most widely applicable is definition
    by genus and difference. This is the most important of all uses of the intension
    of general terms, and it is by far the technique that is most commonly relied upon
    in defining terms. We therefore devote the next and final section of this chapter to a
    detailed examination of definition by genus and difference, and the rules that properly
    guide its use.

    there are five), and the six techniques that depend on extension (three) and intension

    3.6 Definition by Genus and Difference
    
    3.6 | Definition by Genus and Difference
    
    Definition by genus and difference relies directly on the intension of the terms defined,
    and it does so in the most helpful way. In view of their exceedingly common use, we
    look very closely at definitions of this type. Definitions by genus and difference are also
    called analytical definitions, or by their Latin name, definitions per genus et differentia.
  - |-
    Earlier we referred to the attributes that define a class. Normally these attributes are  
    complex—that is, they can be analyzed into two or more other attributes. This complexity  
    and analyzability can be understood in terms of classes. Any class of things having mem-  
    bers may have its membership divided into subclasses. For example, the class of all triangles  
    can be divided into three nonempty subclasses: equilateral triangles, isosceles triangles, and  
    scalene triangles. The class whose membership is thus divided into subclasses is called the  
    genus, and the various subclasses are its species. As used here, the terms "genus" and "spe-  
    cies" are relative terms, like "parent" and "offspring." The same persons may be parents in  
    relation to their children, but also offspring in relation to their parents. Likewise, a class  
    may be a genus with respect to its own subclasses, but also a species with respect to some  
    larger class of which it is a subclass. Thus the class of all triangles is a genus relative to the  
    species scalene triangle and a species relative to the genus polygon. The logician's use of the  
    words "genus" and "species" as relative terms is different from the biologist's use of them  
    as fixed or absolute terms, and the two uses should not be confused.
  - |-
    A class is a collection of entities having some common characteristic. Therefore all members of a given genus have some characteristic in common. All members of the genus polygon (for example) share the characteristic of being closed plane figures bounded by straight line segments. This genus may be divided into different species or subclasses, such that all the members of each subclass have some further attribute in common that is shared by no member of any other subclass. The genus polygon is divided into triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and so on. Each species of the genus polygon differs from all the rest. What differentiates members of the subclass hexagon from the members of all other subclasses is having precisely six sides. All members of all species of a given genus share some attribute that makes them members of the genus, but the members of any one species share some further attribute that differentiates them from the members of every other species of that genus. The characteristic that serves to distinguish them is called the specific difference. Having six sides is the specific difference between the species hexagon and all other species of the genus polygon.
    
    Thus, we may say that the attribute of being a hexagon is analyzable into the attributes of (1) being a polygon and (2) having six sides. To someone who did not know the meaning of the word "hexagon" or of any synonym of it, but who did know the meanings of the words "polygon," "sides," and "six," the meaning of the word "hexagon" can be readily explained by means of a definition by genus and difference: The word hexagon means "a polygon having six sides."
    
    Using the same technique, we can readily define "prime number": A prime number is any natural number greater than one that can be divided exactly, without remainder, only by itself or by one.
    
    Two steps are required to define a term by genus and difference. First, a genus must be named—the genus of which the species designated by the definiendum is the subclass. Second, the specific difference must be named—the attribute that distinguishes the members of that species from members of all other species in that genus. In the definition of prime number just given, the genus is the class of natural numbers greater than one that can be divided exactly, without remainder, only by itself or by one.
  - |-
    one: 2, 3, 4,...and so on; the specific difference is the quality of being divisible without
    remainder only by itself or by one: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,...and so on. Definitions by genus and
    difference can be very precise.
    
    Two limitations of definitions by genus and difference deserve notice, although such
    definitions remain, nevertheless, exceedingly useful. First, the method is applicable only
    to terms whose attributes are complex in the sense indicated above. If there are any
    attributes that are absolutely unanalyzable, then the words with those intensions can-
    not be defined by genus and difference. The sensed qualities of the specific shades of a
    color have been thought by some to be simple and unanalyzable in this sense. Whether
    there really are such unanalyzable attributes remains an open question, but if there are,
    they limit the applicability of definition by genus and difference. Second, the technique
    is not applicable when the attributes of the term are universal. Words such as "being,"
    "entity," "existent," and "object" cannot be defined by the method of genus and differ-
    ence because the class of all entities (for example) is not a species of some broader genus.
    A universal class (if there is one) constitutes the very highest class, or summum genus,
    as it is called. The same limitation applies to words referring to ultimate metaphysical
    categories, such as "substance" or "attribute." Neither of these limitations, however, is a
    serious handicap in most contexts in which definitions are needed.
    
    Constructing good definitions by genus and difference is by no means a simple task;
    it requires thoughtful selection of the most appropriate genus for the term in question,
    as well as identification of the most helpful specific difference for that term. In apprais-
    ing proposed definitions by genus and difference, especially when they are intended as
    lexical, there are five good rules that have been traditionally laid down.
    
    Rule 1: A definition should state the essential attributes of the species.

    Earlier we distinguished the conventional intension of a term from the subjective intension and the objective intension. To define a term using, as its specific difference, some attribute that is not normally recognized as its attribute, even though it may be a part of that term's objective intension, would be a violation of the spirit of this rule. The rule itself might best be expressed, using our terminology, by saying that a definition should state the conventional intension of the term being defined.
    
    The conventional intension of a term is not always an intrinsic characteristic of the things denoted by that term. It may concern the origin of those things, or relations of the members of the class defined to other things, or the uses to which the members of that class are normally put. Thus the term "Stradivarius violin," which denotes a number of violins, has as its conventional intension no actual physical characteristic but rather the attribute of being a violin made in the Cremona workshop of Antonio Stradivari. The essential attributes of "governors" or "senators" would not be any specific mental or physical features that differentiate them from other persons, but the special relations they have to other citizens. The use of shape, or material, as the specific difference of a class is usually an inferior way to construct a definition. It is not an essential attribute of a "shoe," for example, that it is made of leather; what is critical in its definition is the use to which it is put, as an outer covering for the foot.
    
    Rule 2: A definition must not be circular.
    
    If the definiendum itself appears in the definiens, the definition can explain the meaning of the term being defined only to those who already understand it. So if a definition is circular it must fail in its purpose, which is to explain the meaning of the definiendum.

    A book on gambling contains this blatant violation of the rule: "A compulsive gambler is a person who gambles compulsively."''As another example, a sophisticated scientist, writing in a medical journal, lapses into definitional circularity in this passage: "This review defines stress as a specific morphological, biochemical, physiological, and/or behavioral change experienced by an organism in response to a stressful event or stressor."'®
    
    As applied to definitions by genus and difference, avoiding circularity rules out the use,
    in the definiens, of any synonym of the definiendum. For example, there is no point in defin-
    ing lexicon as "a compilation of words in the form of a dictionary." If the synonym "dictionary" is assumed to be understood, one could as well give a straightforward synonymous
    definition of "lexicon" instead of resorting to the more powerful but more complicated
    technique of genus and difference. Similarly, antonyms of the definiendum are also ruled out.
    
    Rule 3: A definition must be neither too broad nor too narrow.
    
    This is an easy rule to understand, but it is often difficult to respect. We don't want the
    definiens to denote more things than are denoted by the definiendum, or fewer things
    either, of course, but mistakes are often made. When Plato's successors in the Academy
    at Athens settled on the definition of "man" as "featherless biped," their critic, Diogenes,
    plucked a chicken and threw it over the wall into the Academy. There was a featherless
    biped—but no man! The definiens was too broad. Legend has it that to narrow the definition of "man," the attribute "having broad nails" was added to the definiens.
    
    Finding or constructing the definiens that has precisely the correct breadth is the task
    faced by the lexicographer, and it is often very challenging, but if Rule 1 has been fully
    observed, the essence of the definiendum stated in the definiens, this rule will have been
    obeyed, because the conventional intension of the term cannot be too broad or too narrow.
    
    Rule 4: Ambiguous, obscure, or figurative language must not be used in a definition.
  - |-
    Ambiguous terms in the definiens obviously prevent the definition from performing its function of explaining the definiendum. Obscure terms also defeat that purpose, but obscurity is a relative matter. What is obscure to amateurs may be perfectly familiar to professionals. A "dynatron oscillator" does truly mean "a circuit that employs a negative-resistance volt-ampere curve to produce an alternating current." Although it may be obscure to the ordinary person, the language of this definiens is wholly intelligible to the students of electrical engineering for whom the definition was written; its technical nature is unavoidable. Obscure language in nontechnical definitions may result in an effort to explain the unknown using what is even more unknown. Dr. Samuel Johnson, in his great Dictionary of the English Language (1755), defined net as meaning "anything reticulated or decussated at equal distances with interstices between the intersections"—a good example of obscurity in definition.
    
    Another sort of obscurity arises when the language of the definiens is metaphorical. Figurative language may convey a "feel" for the term being defined, but it cannot give a clear explanation of the term. We do not learn the meaning of the word "bread" if we are told only that it is "the staff of life." The Devil's Dictionary (1911), by Ambrose Bierce, is a collection of witty definitions, many of which have a cynical bite. Bierce defined "fib" as "a lie that has not cut its teeth," and "oratory" as "a conspiracy between speech and action to cheat the understanding." Entertaining and insightful such definitions may be, but serious explanations of the definienda they are not.
    
    Rule 5: A definition should not be negative when it can be affirmative.
  - |-
    What a term does mean, rather than what it does not mean, is what the definition seeks
    to provide. There are far too many things that the vast majority of terms do not mean;
    we are unlikely to cover them all in a definition. "A piece of furniture that is not a bed or
    a chair or a stool or a bench" does not define a couch; neither does it define a dresser. We
    need to identify the attributes that the definiendum has, rather than those it does not have.
    
    Of course there are some terms that are essentially negative and therefore require
    negative definitions. The word baldness means "the state of not having hair on one's
    head," and the word orphan means "a child who does not have parents." Sometimes
    affirmative and negative definitions are about equally useful; we may define a "drunkard"
    as "one who drinks excessively," but also as "one who is not temperate in drinking." In
    those cases in which negatives are used appropriately in specifying the essential attrib-
    utes, the genus must first be mentioned affirmatively. Then, sometimes, the species can
    be characterized accurately by rejecting all other species of that genus. Only rarely are
    the species few enough to make this possible. If, for example, we define "scalene" trian-
    gle as "a triangle that is neither equilateral nor isosceles," we respect poorly the spirit of
    Rule 1—because it is the essential attribute that the class does possess, "having sides of
    unequal length," that best defines it. In general, affirmative definitions are much pre-
    ferred over negative ones.
    
    In summary, intensional definitions, and among them definitions by genus and dif-
    ference especially, can serve any of the purposes for which definitions are sought. They
    may help to eliminate ambiguity, to reduce vagueness, to give theoretical explanation,
    and even to influence attitudes. They are also commonly used to increase and enrich the
    vocabulary of those to whom they are provided. For most purposes, intensional definitions
    are much superior to extensional definitions, and of all definitions that rely on intensions,
    those constructed by genus and difference are usually the most effective and most helpful.

    Summary
    
    In this chapter we have been concerned with the uses of language and with definitions.
    
    In Section 3.1 we identified the three chief uses of language—the informative, the expressive, and the directive—and two less common uses—the ceremonial and the performative.
    
    In Section 3.2 we discussed the emotive and the neutral meanings of words. Disputes, we explained, may arise from conflicting beliefs about facts, or from conflicting attitudes about facts whose truth may (or may not) be agreed on, and we emphasized the importance of the neutral uses of language in logical discourse.
  - |-
    In Section 3.3 we explained that ambiguous terms are those that have more than one distinct meaning in a given context. We distinguished three different kinds of disputes: those that are genuine, whether the conflict be about beliefs or attitudes; those that are merely verbal, arising from the unrecognized use of ambiguous terms; and those that are genuine but appear on the surface to be verbal, in which a real difference remains even after apparent ambiguity has been eliminated.
    
    In Section 3.4 we began the discussion of definitions, distinguishing the definiendum (the symbol that is to be defined) from the definiens (the symbol or group of symbols used to explain the meaning of the definiendum). We distinguished five different kinds of definition based on their functions: (A) stipulative definitions, with which a meaning is assigned to a term (and hence which cannot be true or false); (B) lexical definitions, which report the meaning that the term already has (and hence can be true or false); (C) precising definitions, which aim to eliminate vagueness or ambiguity; (D) theoretical definitions, which aim to encapsulate our understanding of some intellectual sphere; and (E) persuasive definitions, which aim to influence conduct.
    
    In Section 3.5 we explained the structure of definitions, first distinguishing the extension of a general term, the objects denoted by it, from its intension, the attributes shared by all and only the members of the class designated by that term. We explained three varieties of extensional definition: definitions by example, in which we list or give examples of the objects denoted by the term; ostensive definitions, in which we point to, or indicate by gesture, the extension of the term being defined; and semi-ostensive definitions, in which the pointing or gesture is accompanied by a descriptive phrase whose meaning is assumed known.
    
    We also distinguished three varieties of intensional definition: synonymous definitions, in which we provide another word whose meaning is already understood that has the same meaning as the word being defined; operational definitions, which state that a term is applied correctly to a given case if and only if the performance of specified operations in that case yields a specified result; and definitions by genus and difference, of which a full account was given in Section 3.6.
  - |-
    In Section 3.6 we closely examined definitions by genus and difference, in which we first name the
    genus of which the species designated by the definiendum is a subclass, and then name the attribute
    (or specific difference) that distinguishes the members of that species from members of all other species
    of that genus. We formulated and explained five rules for the construction of good definitions by genus
    and difference: (1) A definition should state essential attributes; (2) a definition must not be circular;
    (3) a definition must not be too broad or too narrow; (4) definitions should not rely on ambiguous,
    obscure, or figurative language; and (5) when possible, definitions should not be negative.

    4.1 | What Is a Fallacy?
    
    When we reason, we (presumably) strive to reason correctly, so one of the central tasks of
    logic is to identify the ways in which we are tempted to reason incorrectly. One reasons
    incorrectly when the premises of an argument fail to support its conclusion, and arguments
    of that sort may be called fallacious. So, in a very general sense, any error in reasoning is a
    fallacy. Similarly, any mistaken idea or false belief may sometimes be labeled "fallacious."
    
    Logicians, however, commonly use the term "fallacy" more narrowly, to designate
    not just any error in reasoning, but typical errors—mistakes in reasoning that exhibit a
    pattern that can be identified and named. The great logician Gottlob Frege observed that
    it is one of the logician's tasks to "indicate the pitfalls laid by language in the way of the
    thinker." In this book we will use the term in this way.
    
    In this narrower sense, each fallacy is a type of incorrect argument. Of course, many
    different arguments may make an error of some given type; that is, they may exhibit the
    same kind of mistake in reasoning. Any argument that does exhibit that kind of mistake is
    said to commit that fallacy. The particular argument that commits some known fallacy is
    commonly said to be a fallacy, because it is an individual example of that typical mistake.
  - |-
    To illustrate: If one accepts the premise that all science is essentially materialistic and then goes on to argue that Karl Marx, a very influential philosopher of the nineteenth century who was certainly a materialist, must therefore have been scientific, one reasons badly. It may indeed be true that Marx was scientific (as he claimed to be), but it does not follow from the fact that he was a materialist (which he certainly was) that he was scientific. The bad reasoning here is fallacious. If every P is a Q, it does not follow from the fact that one is a Q that one is a P. All dogs are mammals, but not every mammal is a dog. What is identified here is a pattern of mistake; it is a very common mistake that we will explore in detail in Chapter 8. Because that pattern of error, or fallacy, appears in many different contexts, it is flagged, and labeled: "the fallacy of affirming the consequent." The argument concerning Karl Marx is a fallacy because it commits that fallacy,
    
    chapter 4
    
    Fallacy

    seems to be correct, but
    contains a mistake in
    reasoning.
    
    chapter 4 Fallacies
    
    and the fallacy it commits is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. This is independent
    of the equivocation in the use of the term "materialist," which means different things
    in science and in Marxism.
  - |-
    In this illustration the mistake that has been made is called a formal fallacy; it is a
    pattern of mistake that appears in deductive arguments of a certain specifiable form.
    There are other formal fallacies, and we shall examine them in Chapter 8. Most fallacies,
    however, are not formal but informal: They are patterns of mistake that are made in the
    everyday uses of language. Informal fallacies, which we examine very closely in this
    chapter, arise from confusions concerning the content of the language used. There is no
    limit to the variety of forms in which that content may appear, and thus informal fal-
    lacies are often more difficult to detect than formal ones. It is language that deceives us
    here; we may be tricked by inferences that seem plausible on the surface but that are in
    reality not warranted. Such traps, the "pitfalls" that language sets, can be avoided if the
    patterns of those mistakes are well understood. Considerable attention will be devoted to
    these informal fallacies—the kinds of mistakes made in everyday speaking and writing,
    and commonly encountered, for example, in the "letters to the editor" in daily newspa-
    pers. These are the logical mistakes that we will name and explain.
    
    Because language is slippery and imprecise, we must be cautious in this enterprise.
    Of course we must be careful not to make the mistakes in question, but we must also
    be careful to refrain from accusing others of making mistakes when they do not really
    do so. If we encounter an argument that appears to be fallacious, we must ask ourselves
    what really was meant by the terms being used. The accusation of fallacy is sometimes
    unjustly leveled at a passage intended by its author to make a point that the critic has
    missed—perhaps even to make a joke. As patterns of mistakes in spoken and written
    language are identified, the type of language used needs to be understood. Our logical
    standards should be high, but our application of those standards to arguments in ordi-
    nary life should also be generous and fair.
    
    4.2 | Classification of Fallacies

    Informal fallacies are numerous and can therefore be best understood if they are grouped
    into categories, each with clearly identifiable features. This classification of fallacies is
    a controversial matter in logic. There is no one correct taxonomy of fallacies. Logicians
    have proposed lists of fallacies that vary greatly in length; different sets have been speci-
    fied, and different names have been given to both the sets and the individual fallacies.
    Any Classification of the kind that will follow here is bound to be arbitrary in some
    degree. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive scheme within which the most common
    informal fallacies can be helpfully identified—and avoided.
    
    The outline of this classification appears immediately below. After presenting it, we
    will examine each group, and each individual fallacy, in detail.
    
    ° Fallacies of relevance. Fallacies of relevance are the most numerous and the most
    frequently encountered. In these fallacies, the premises of the argument are simply not
    relevant to the conclusion. However, because they are made to appear to be relevant,
    they may deceive. We will distinguish and discuss:
    
    e R11: The appeal to the populace
    e R2: The appeal to emotion
    ° R3: The red herring
    ° R4: The straw man
    ° RS: The attack on the person
    ° R6: The appeal to force
    e _R7: Missing the point (irrelevant conclusion).
    
    e Fallacies of defective induction. In fallacies of defective induction, which are
    also common, the mistake arises from the fact that the premises of the argument,
    although relevant to the conclusion, are so weak and ineffective that relying on them
    is a blunder. We will distinguish and discuss:
    
    ° D1: The argument from ignorance
    ° D2: The appeal to inappropriate authority
    ° D3: False cause
    e D4: Hasty generalization.
    
    ° Fallacies of presumption. In fallacies of presumption, too much is assumed in
    the premises. The inference to the conclusion depends mistakenly on these unwar-
    ranted assumptions. We will distinguish and discuss:
    
    e P1: Accident
    ° P2: Complex question
    e P3: Begging the question.
  - |-
    Chapter 4 Fallacies
    
    Fallacies of Ambiguity
    
    The incorrect reasoning in fallacies of ambiguity arises from the equivocal use of words or phrases. Some word or phrase in one part of the argument has a meaning different from that of the same word or phrase in another part of the argument. We will distinguish and discuss:
    
    ° A1: Equivocation
    ° A2: Amphiboly
    ° A3: Accent
    ° A4: Composition
    ° A5: Division.
    
    Which of all these fallacies is actually committed by a specific passage is often disputable. The mistake that is made in a given argument might be construed in different ways and thus might reasonably be viewed as an instance of more than one fallacy. Once again, in the realm of natural language, context is critical, and much depends on reasonable interpretation.
    
    4.3 | Fallacies of Relevance
    
    Fallacies of relevance are bald mistakes; they might better be called fallacies of irrelevance, because they arise when there is no real connection between the premises and the conclusion of an argument. Because that connection is missing, the premises offered cannot possibly establish the truth of the conclusion drawn. Of course, the premises may still be psychologically relevant, in that they may evoke attitudes likely to cause the acceptance of the conclusion. The mistake arises when some emotive features of language are used to support the truth of a claim for which no objective reasons have been given. The modern names of these fallacies are used here, but many of them have traditional names as well (usually in Latin), which will also be included. Seven fallacies of relevance are of principal interest.
    
    R1. The Appeal to the Populace (Argumentum ad Populum)  
    An informal fallacy in which the support given for some conclusion is an appeal to popular belief. Also known as argument ad populum.
  - |-
    This fallacy is sometimes defined as the fallacy committed in making an emotional appeal; but this definition is so broad as to include most of the fallacies of relevance. It is defined more narrowly as the attempt to win popular assent to a conclusion by arousing the feelings of the multitude. The argument ad populum ("to the populace") is the baldest of all fallacies, and yet it is one of the most common. It is the instrument on which every demagogue and propagandist relies when faced with the task of mobilizing public sentiment. It is a fallacy because, instead of evidence and rational argument, the speaker (or writer) relies on expressive language and other devices calculated to excite enthusiasm for or against some cause. Patriotism is one common cause about which it is easy to stir emotions, and we know that terrible abuses and injustices have been perpetuated in the name of patriotism. The oratory of Adolf Hitler, whipping up the racist enthusiasms of his German listeners, is a classic example. Love of country is an honorable emotion, but the appeal to that emotion in order to manipulate and mislead one's audience is intellectually disreputable. "Patriotism," Samuel Johnson observed, "is the last refuge of a scoundrel."
    
    The patriotic argument may be used when the national cause is good and the argument's author is no scoundrel. An emotional defense of belief lacks intellectual merit, but the conclusion of that bad argument may be supportable by other premises of a more rational sort. Still, offered as the premises of an argument, sheer emotion is fallacious. On 23 March 1775 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a resolution delivering Virginia's troops to the Revolutionary War. The House was spurred to adopt this resolution by an oration whose emotional content has rarely been exceeded. Patrick Henry concluded this famous speech with the following appeal:

    A qualification may be in order here. If the passions of the speaker are used to convince his listeners that some beliefs are true, the argument is indeed fallacious. However, if the speaker and his listener are in complete agreement in their beliefs, and the speaker aims only to spur his listeners to act in support of those mutual beliefs, the emotion he exhibits may serve a useful purpose. There is a distinction to be drawn between emotions used improperly as premises in argument and emotions used reasonably as triggers for appropriate conduct. However, this distinction will always be problematic because, when the speaker succeeds in spurring to action, it may be said that he has relied on emotion to convince his audience of the truth of some claim—the claim that now is

    the time to act, or the claim that the way to act in pursuit of the common goal is his
    way. In controversy, in deciding what conduct is appropriate, the appeal to emotion is
    unavoidably troubling.
  - |-
    The heaviest reliance on arguments ad populum is to be found in commercial advertising, where its use has been elevated almost to the status of a fine art. The products advertised are associated, explicitly or slyly, with things that we yearn for or that excite us favorably. Breakfast cereal is associated with trim youthfulness, athletic prowess, and vibrant good health; whiskey is associated with luxury and achievement, and beer with high adventure; the automobile is associated with romance, riches, and sex. The men depicted using the advertised product are generally handsome and distinguished, the women are sophisticated and charming, very well dressed or hardly dressed at all. So clever and persistent are the ballyhoo artists of our time that we are all influenced to some degree, in spite of our resolution to resist. Almost every imaginable device may be used to command our attention, even to penetrate our subconscious thoughts. We are manipulated by relentless appeals to emotion of every kind.
    
    Of course, the mere association of some product with an agreeable feeling or satisfying emotion is by itself no argument at all, but when such associations are systematically impressed on us, there usually is an argument ad populum lurking not far below the surface. It is suggested that the product—some beer perhaps, or some perfume, or some brand of jeans—is sexy, or is associated with wealth, or power, or some other admired characteristic, and therefore we, in purchasing it, will acquire some of that same merit.
    
    One variety of this bad argument is particularly crass because it suggests no more than that one is well advised to buy (or join, or support, etc.) simply because that is what everyone else is doing. Some call this the "bandwagon fallacy," from the known phenomenon that, in an exciting campaign, many will be anxious to "jump on the bandwagon"—to do what others do because so many others are doing it. Brazen examples of this bandwagon fallacy are common in the public media; here, for example, are the exact words of an advertisement on ABC TV:
    
    Why are so many people attracted to the Pontiac Grand Prix? It could be that so many people are attracted to the Grand Prix because—so many people are attracted to the Grand Prix!
  - |-
    This is the essence of an appeal to the populace.
    
    Playing on the emotions of the general population is pernicious in the context of
    public polling. Those who are conducting the poll, if they are unscrupulous, may frame
    questions in ways designed to get the responses they seek, by using words or phrases
    with known emotive impact. Alternatively, if used without design but carelessly, some
    words may have an impact that will vitiate the poll results. In serious survey research,
    therefore, questions will be worded with the very greatest care, avoiding terms that are
    emotionally loaded, to preserve the integrity of the poll results. It is sometimes difficult
    to avoid all emotional taint. Many Americans support "affirmative action," viewing it
    as a policy designed to treat minorities fairly. But many Americans also oppose "racial
    preferences" in college admissions or in employment. The outcome of any random poll
    on this topic will depend critically on which set of words—"affirmative action" or "racial
    preference"—is used in the questions asked.
    
    When results using different words conflict, it may be said that importantly differ-
    ent questions have been asked. Perhaps. This is a perennial problem in survey research.

    chapter 4 Fallacies
    
    Appeal to pity
    
    A fallacy in which the
    argument relies on
    generosity, altruism, or
    mercy, rather than on
    reason. Also known
    
    as argument ad
    misericordiam.
    
    In argument, however, the logical point remains very important: A conclusion defended
    with premises that are directed mainly at emotions is a fallacious argument ad populum.
    
    R2. Appeals to Emotion
    Appeal to Pity (ad Misericordiam)
    
    One variety of the appeal to emotion that appears with great frequency is the argument
    ad misericordiam. The Latin word misericordiam literally means "merciful heart"; this fal-
    lacy is the emotional appeal to pity.
  - |-
    Pity is often an admirable human response. Justice, it is wisely said, should be tempered with mercy. Surely there are many situations in which leniency in punishment is justified by the special circumstances of the offender. In such situations—in the sentencing phase of a trial, for example—the identification of those circumstances and the reasons they might apply to a criminal already convicted are appropriately put before the court. That is no fallacy. It would be a fallacy, however, if such considerations were registered in the effort to cause a jury to acquit a defendant who is indeed guilty of the acts with which he or she is charged. When the premises (or intimated premises) of an argument boil down to no more than an appeal to the merciful heart, the argument is plainly ad misericordiam, and fallacious. What is special about this variety is only that the emotions appealed to are of a particular kind: generosity and mercy.
    
    In civil suits, when attorneys are seeking compensatory damages for the injuries suffered by their clients, there is often an effort to rely implicitly on the appeal to pity. The cause of the injury may be described as a faceless and unfeeling corporate juggernaut; or the injured party may be presented as the helpless victim of an uncaring bureaucracy or an incompetent professional. The miseries of the client's continuing disability may be depicted in some heart-rending way. The injured plaintiff may make it a point to limp painfully into the courtroom. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health has demonstrated that the appeal to pity really works. When doctors are sued for malpractice, this study shows, the size of the monetary award to successful plaintiffs depends much more on the nature of the disability they suffered than on whether it could be shown that the doctor accused had in fact done anything wrong.
    
    In criminal trials, the sympathies of the jury plainly have no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the accused, but an appeal to those sympathies may nevertheless be made. Such an appeal may be made obliquely. At his trial in Athens, Socrates referred with disdain to other defendants who had appeared before their juries accompanied by their children and families, seeking acquittal by evoking pity. Socrates continued:
  - |-
    |, who am probably in danger of my life, will do none of these things. The contrast may occur to [each juror's]
    mind, and he may be set against me, and vote in anger because he is displeased at me on this account. Now
    if there be such a person among you—mind, | do not say that there is—to him | may fairly reply: My friend,
    | am aman, and like other men, a creature of flesh and blood, and not "of wood or stone" as Homer says;
    and | have a family, yes, and sons, O Athenians, three in number, one almost a man, and two others who are
    still young; and yet | will not bring any of them here to petition you for acquittal.
    
    There are many ways to pull heartstrings. Although it is often successful, the appeal
    to pity is an obvious fallacy, ridiculed in the story of the trial of a youth accused of the
    murder of his mother and father with an ax. Confronted with overwhelming proof of his
    guilt, his attorney pleads for leniency on the grounds that his client is now an orphan!
    
    4.3 Fallacies of Relevance
    
    Logicians give special names to other clusters of fallacious emotional appeals. Thus
    one might also distinguish the appeal to envy (ad invidiam), the appeal to fear (ad metum),
    the appeal to hatred (ad odium), and the appeal to pride (ad superbium). In all of these,
    the underlying mistake is the argument's reliance on feelings as premises.
    
    R3. The Red Herring
    
    The red herring is a fallacious argument whose effectiveness lies in distraction. Attention
    is deflected; readers or listeners are drawn to some aspect of the topic under discussion by
    which they are led away from the issue that had been the focus of the discussion. They
    are urged to attend to some observation or some claim that may be associated with the
    topic, but that is not relevant to the truth of what had originally been in dispute. A red
    herring has been drawn across the track.
  - |-
    This fallacy has a fascinating history. The phrase is believed to have been derived from the practice of those who tried to save a fox being hunted by leaving a misleading trail of scent (a smoked herring is very smelly and does become dark red) that would be likely to distract or confuse the dogs in hot pursuit. In many contexts, any deliberately misleading trail is commonly called a red herring. Especially in literature, and above all in suspense or detective stories, it is not rare for some character or event to be introduced deliberately to mislead the investigators (and the readers) and thus to add to the excitement and complexity of the plot. An ulterior political motivation may be suggested, a sexual scandal may be intimated—whatever can put the reader off the track may serve as a red herring. In the very popular novel and film, *The Da Vinci Code*, one of the characters, a Catholic bishop, enters the plot in ways that very cleverly mislead. His name is the author's joke: Bishop Aringarosa—meaning "red herring" in Italian. In the world of finance, a prospectus issued to attract investors in a company about to go public, which tells much about the company but not the price of its shares, is also called a red herring.
    
    Fallacious arguments use this technique in various ways. The opponents of an appropriate tax measure may call attention to a new and appealing way in which funds can be raised by state-sponsored gambling. A defense of the prosperity produced by an economic system may be deflected by vigorously condemning the economic inequality that system permits. Economic inequality may well be excessive or unfair, but if most of the members of a community are reasonably well off, that fact is not disproved by the reality of the enormous gap between the moderate wealth of most and the great wealth of some.
  - |-
    The distinguished political columnist David Broder has observed that in discussions of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, it has been the policy of some to urge that a show of military strength is a necessary element of our international posture. As Broder points out, however, it is a "rhetorical trick" to respond, whenever there is criticism of military expansion, that "its critics are soft on terror."° This is a classic red herring.
    
    Another example arose during debate in Congress over legislation originally designed to oblige corporations to protect the accumulated funds that had been set aside for the pensions of their employees. One legislator, apparently seeking to protect his corporate donors, entered the debate with the irrelevant point that there is a serious need for the provision of better advice to retired persons on the investment of their pensions. No doubt there is. But one commentator astutely observed, "What does this have to do with employers squandering their workers' retirement? It's a red herring. ... Mr. Smith's her- ring replaces a major national scandal with a minor scandal, in an attractive rhetorical wrapping."°

    Straw man
    
    A fallacy in which an opponent's position is depicted as being more extreme or unreasonable than is justified by what was actually asserted.
    
    Again: At Duke University in 2006, three student athletes were indicted for rape; the indictments were plainly unfounded and soon withdrawn. When the prosecutor was charged with misconduct in office, feelings at the university grew intense. One member of the Duke faculty, writing in the local newspaper, defended the prosecutor and some other faculty members who had supported him. In the course of this defense she argued that the real "social disaster" in the Duke rape case was that "18 percent of the American population lives below the poverty line," and that we do not have "national health care or affordable childcare." That herring was bright red.'
    
    R4. The Straw Man
  - |-
    It is very much easier to win a fight against a person made of straw than against one made of flesh and blood. If one argues against some view by presenting an opponent's position as one that is easily torn apart, the argument is fallacious, of course. Such an argument commits the fallacy of the straw man.
    
    One may view this fallacy as a variety of the red herring, because it also introduces a distraction from the real dispute. In this case, however, the distraction is of a particular kind: It is an effort to shift the conflict from its original complexity into a different conflict, between parties other than those originally in dispute. So common is this variety of distraction that the pattern of argument that relies on it has long carried its own name: the straw man argument.
    
    In controversies of a moral or a political nature, a successful argument almost invariably requires some reasonable and nuanced distinctions, and perhaps also some narrowly described exceptions. The extreme position in any dispute—the claim that conduct of a certain kind is always wrong, or always justified—is likely to be difficult if not impossible to defend. Therefore it is often a fallacious device to contend that what one aims to defeat is indefensible because it is categorical or absolute. Victory may be achieved over this fictitious opponent, but one will have destroyed only a straw man.
    
    One who urges the enlargement of the authority of some central administration may be fallaciously accused of seeking to transform the state into a "big brother" whose reach will extend into every corner of citizens' private lives. Such a "big brother" is likely to be no more than a straw man. One who urges the devolution of authority from central to more local governments may be portrayed, with similar fallacy, as the enemy of an efficient and effective administration—and that, too, is likely to be a straw man. Straw man arguments often take the form of supposing that the position under attack adopts the most extreme view possible—that every act or policy of a certain kind is to be rejected. The argument is easy to win, but its premises are not relevant to the conclusion that was originally proposed. The straw man argument often presents a genuine objection or criticism, and the objection may be sound, but it is aimed at a new and irrelevant target.

    Straw man arguments present a special risk to their proponents. If, in controversy, a
    critic depicts his or her opponents in a way that is clearly more extreme and more unrea-
    sonable than is justifiable given what they had written or said, readers or members of the
    audience are likely to recognize the exaggeration and to respond in a way quite opposite to
    what was hoped for. Readers (or listeners) may sense the unreasonableness of the portrayal
    and be offended by the unfairness. Even further, the readers or listeners, recognizing the
    distortion, may be caused by its unfairness to move intellectually to the side of the party
    that has been misrepresented, formulating in their own minds the response that may justly
    be made to the fallacious attack. Neutral persons who were to be persuaded may be thus
    107
    
    4.3 Fallacies of Relevance
    
    transformed, by unfair fallacious argument, into adversaries. Every fallacious argument
    presents some risk of this kind; the fallacy of the straw man invites it with special force.
    
    R5. Argument against the Person
    (Argumentum ad Hominem)
    
    Of all the fallacies of irrelevance, the argument against the person, or ad hominem, is
    among the most pernicious. Such arguments are common, as many fallacies are. These,
    in addition to being unfair to the adversary (as straw man arguments are also), are hurt-
    ful, often inflicting serious personal damage without any opportunity for the fallacy to
    be exposed or its author chastised.
    
    The phrase ad hominem translates as "against the person." An ad hominem argument is
    one in which the thrust is directed, not at a conclusion, but at some person who defends
    the conclusion in dispute. This personalized attack might be conducted in either of two
    different ways, for which reason we distinguish two major forms of the argument ad
    hominem: the abusive and the circumstantial.
    
    A. Argumentum ad hominem, Abusive
  - |-
    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    One is tempted, in heated argument, to disparage the character of one's opponents,
    to deny their intelligence or reasonableness, to question their understanding, or their
    seriousness, or even their integrity. However, the character of an adversary is logically
    irrelevant to the truth or falsity of what that person asserts, or to the correctness of the
    reasoning employed. A proposal may be attacked as unworthy because it is supported
    by "radicals," or by "reactionaries," but such allegations, even when plausible, are not
    relevant to the merit of the proposal itself.
    
    Personal abuse can be psychologically persuasive, however, because it may induce
    strong disapproval of some advocate, and by unjustifiable extension in the mind of the
    hearer, disapproval of what had been advocated. For example, Judge Constance Baker
    Motley, long active in the civil rights movement, defends affirmative action with an ad
    hominem attack on its critics. She writes:
    
    Those who resist [affirmative action programs] deny that they are racists, but the truth is that their real motiva-
    tion is racism, a belief in the inherent inferiority of African-Americans and people of mixed racial backgrounds.®
    
    However, the merits (or demerits) of arguments about affirmative action are not illu-
    minated by denigrating the character of those who take the side one rejects.
    
    Ad hominem abusive has many variations. The opponent may be reviled (and his
    claims held unworthy) because he is of a certain religious or political persuasion: a
    "Papist" or an "atheist," a member of the "radical right" or the "loony left," or the like.
    A conclusion may be condemned because it has been defended by persons believed to
    be of bad character, or because its advocate has been closely associated with those of bad
    character. Socrates was convicted of impiety partly because of his long association with
    persons known to have been disloyal to Athens and rapacious in conduct. More recently,
    when Clyde Collins Snow was called a racist because of the conclusions he reached as a
    forensic scientist, he replied as follows:
    
    My work devoted to the investigation of the disappearance, torture, and extrajudicial execution of human
    rights victims in many countries has often made me the target of public criticism and official outrage.
    
    Argument against the
    person
    
    A fallacy in which
  - |-
    The argument relies upon an attack against the person taking a position. This fallacy is also known as "argument ad hominem."
    
    Chapter 4 Fallacies
    
    To date, however, none of my critics has called me a racist. Among my detractors have been apologists for the brutal military junta in Argentina, representatives of General Pinochet's military in Chile, the Guatemalan Defense Minister, and Serbian government spokesmen. Thus Mr. Goodman [Snow's accuser] finds himself in interesting company.'
    
    The accusation of guilt by association is a common form of ad hominem abuse.
    
    B. Argumentum ad hominem, Circumstantial
    
    The circumstances of one who makes (or rejects) some claim have no more bearing on the truth of what is claimed than does his character. The mistake made in the circumstantial form of the ad hominem fallacy is to treat those personal circumstances as the premise of an opposing argument.
    
    Thus it may be argued fallaciously that an opponent should accept (or reject) some conclusion merely because of that person's employment, or nationality, or political affiliation, or other circumstances. It may be unfairly suggested that a member of the clergy must accept a given proposition because its denial would be incompatible with the Scriptures; or it may be claimed that political candidates must support a given policy because it is explicitly propounded in the platform of their party. Such argument is irrelevant to the truth of the proposition in question; it simply urges that some persons' circumstances require its acceptance. Hunters, accused of the needless slaughter of unoffending animals, sometimes reply by noting that their critics eat the flesh of harmless cattle. Such a reply is plainly ad hominem: The fact that the critic eats meat does not even begin to prove that it is right for the hunter to kill animals for amusement.
  - |-
    When the circumstances of the speaker are used not merely as grounds for attack—
    suggesting a foolish inconsistency or the like—but used rather in a plainly negative
    spirit, a special name is given to such ad hominem arguments. They are called by their
    traditional Latin name, tu quoque. This Latin expression does not translate simply, but
    it means, in essence, "You're another," or more loosely, "Look who's talking." The sub-
    stance of the fallacy is to contend that you (the first party) are just as bad as I am, just
    as guilty of whatever it is that you complained about. But of course, that response is not
    a refutation of the original complaint. It may be true that the first party is guilty of the
    conduct in question, but calling that guilt to attention does not support the innocence
    of the second party, which is the issue in the argument at hand.
    
    An illustration will be helpful. A correspondent for CNN interviewed Osama bin
    Laden, leader of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan. The exchange went
    like this:
    
    Cliff Arnett (CNN): The United States government says that you are still fund-
    ing military training camps here in Afghanistan for militant
    Islamic fighters and that you're a sponsor of international ter-
    rorism. ... Are these accusations true?
    
    Osama bin Laden: _... At the time that they condemn any Muslim leader who
    calls for his rights, they receive the highest official of the Irish
    Republican Army at the White House as a political leader.
    Wherever we look we find the U.S. as the leader of terror-
    ism and crime in the world. The U.S. does not consider it a
    terrorist act to throw atomic bombs at nations thousands of
    miles away. ... The U.S. does not consider it terrorism when
    hundreds of thousands of our sons and brothers in Iraq die
    for lack of food or medicine. So there is no basis for what the
    USS. says.'°
    
    How the United States conducts its international relations is rightly open to criticism—
    but whatever may be true about that behavior, attacking it is no response to the allega-
    tion of Al Qaeda terrorism. This is a classic tu quoque.
  - |-
    The circumstances of an opponent are not properly the issue in serious argument.
    It is the substance of what is claimed, or denied, that must be addressed. It is true that
    highlighting one's opponent's circumstances may prove rhetorically effective in winning
    assent, or in persuading others, but the effectiveness of this device does not make up for
    its error. Arguments of this kind are fallacious.
    
    Circumstantial ad hominem arguments are sometimes used to suggest that the opponent's conclusion should be rejected because their judgment is warped, dictated by their special situation rather than by reasoning or evidence. However, an argument that is favorable to some group deserves discussion on its merits; it is fallacious to attack it simply on the ground that it is presented by a member of that group and is therefore self-serving. The arguments in favor of a protective tariff (for example) may be bad, but they are not bad because they are presented by a manufacturer who benefits from such tariffs.
    
    One argument of this kind, called poisoning the well, is particularly perverse. The
    incident that gave rise to the name illustrates the argument forcefully. The British novelist and Protestant clergyman Charles Kingsley, attacking the famous Catholic intellectual John Henry Cardinal Newman, argued thus: Cardinal Newman's claims were not to be trusted because, as a Roman Catholic priest (Kingsley alleged), Newman's first loyalty was not to the truth. Newman countered that this ad hominem attack made it impossible for him, and indeed for all Catholics, to advance their arguments, because anything they might say to defend themselves would then be undermined by others' alleging that, after all, truth was not their first concern. Kingsley, said Cardinal Newman, had "poisoned the well of discourse."
  - |-
    Between the abusive and the circumstantial varieties of argument ad hominem there  
    is a clear connection: The circumstantial may be regarded as a special case of the abu-  
    sive. When a circumstantial ad hominem argument explicitly or implicitly charges the  
    opponents with inconsistency (among their beliefs, or between what they profess and  
    what they practice, not logical inconsistency), that is clearly one kind of abuse. When a  
    circumstantial ad hominem argument charges the opponents with a lack of trustworthi-  
    ness in virtue of membership in a group, that is an accusation of prejudice in defense of  
    self-interest and is clearly also an abuse.
    
    An important qualification is called for at this point. Ad hominem arguments are  
    fallacious (and often unfair to the adversary) because an attack against some person is  
    generally not relevant to the objective merits of the argument that person has put for-  
    ward. However, there are some circumstances in which it is indeed reasonable to raise  
    doubts about some conclusion by impeaching the testimony of one who makes a claim  
    that would (if true) support the conclusion in question. In courtroom proceedings, for  
    example, it is acceptable, and often effective, to call a jury's attention to the unreliability  
    of a witness, and by so doing to undermine the claims upheld by the testimony of that  
    witness. This may be done by exhibiting contradictions in the testimony given, showing  
    that at least some of what has been asserted must be false. It may be done by showing  
    (not merely asserting) that the witness lied—an abusive but in this context appropriate

    an open or veiled threat  
    of force. Also known  
    
    as "argument ad

    counterargument. Testimony may also be undermined by exhibiting the great benefits
    that would accrue to the witness from the acceptance of his testimony—impeaching by
    circumstance. These are, strictly speaking, ad hominem considerations, and yet they are
    not fallacious because of the special context in which those assertions are being put for-
    ward, and because of the agreed-upon rules for the evaluation of conflicting witnesses.
    
    Even in these special circumstances, an attack on the person of the witness does not
    establish the falsehood of what had been asserted. Revealing a pattern of past dishonesty
    or duplicity, or showing an inconsistency with testimony earlier given, may cast justifi-
    able doubt on the reliability of the speaker, but the truth or falsity of the factual claim
    made can be established only with evidence that bears directly on that claim, and not
    merely on some person who denies or asserts it. In each case we must ask: Is the attack
    on the person relevant to the truth of what is at issue? When, as commonly occurs, the
    attack is not relevant to the merits of the claim, the ad hominem argument is indeed
    fallacious.
    
    R6. The Appeal to Force (Argumentum ad Baculum)
    
    It seems odd to suppose that one could hope to establish some proposition as true,
    or persuade some other person of its truth, by resorting to force. Threats or strong-
    arm methods to coerce one's opponents can hardly be considered arguments at all.
    Traditionally, a category of fallacies of this kind has been identified as the appeal to
    force or the argument ad baculum (appeal ad baculum means literally "appeal to the
    stick"!), and it surely is clear that however expedient force may prove to be, it cannot
    replace rational methods of argument. "Might makes right" is not a subtle principle,
    and we all reject it.
    
    The force threatened need not be physical, of course. In 2000, two professors of law at
    Boise State University published (in a law journal of the University of Denver) an article
    that was harshly critical of the Boise Cascade Corporation, one of the world's largest pro-
    ducers of paper and wood products. Subsequently, the university issued a formal "errata"

    Why did the university retract the article? Did Boise Cascade threaten the university with a lawsuit? "Well," said the university's general counsel, "‘threaten' is an interesting word. Let's just say they pointed out that the objections they raised did rise to the level of being actionable." The university, it turns out, had received a highlighted copy of the article in question from the general counsel of Boise Cascade, together with a letter saying, "I have been advised to proceed with litigation against Denver University if any of these highlighted areas are republished by Denver University in any form." 
    
    There are some circumstances in which threats may be introduced with more subtlety, and in such circumstances we may say that something like an argument—a plainly fallacious argument, to be sure—has been presented. What is put forward may be a veiled threat, or a proposition that suggests some danger if the proposition in question is not given full assent. It may be that certain behaviors are of importance, whatever may be doubted or believed. To illustrate, when the U.S. attorney general in the administration of President Ronald Reagan was under strong attack in the press for misconduct, the White House chief of staff at the time, Howard Baker, opened one meeting of his staff by saying:
    
    The President continues to have confidence in the Attorney General and I have confidence in the Attorney General and you ought to have confidence in the Attorney General, because we work for the President and that's the way things are. And if anyone has a different view of that, or any different motive, ambition, or intention, he can tell me about it because we're going to have to discuss your status.
  - |-
    One might say that nobody is fooled by an argument of this sort; the threatened party may behave appropriately but need not, in the end, accept the truth of the conclusion being insisted on. To this it was answered, by representatives of twentieth-century Italian fascism, that real persuasion can come through many different instruments, of which reason is one and the blackjack is another. Once the opponent is truly persuaded, they held, the instrument of persuasion may be forgotten. That fascist view appears to guide many of the governments of the globe to this day; but the argument ad baculum—reliance on the club, or on the threat of force in any form—is by reason unacceptable. The appeal to force is the abandonment of reason.
    
    R7. Missing the Point (Ignoratio Elenchi)
    
    Among the fallacies of relevance, the final category to be identified is perhaps the most difficult to describe with precision. A variety of alternative names have been applied to this category, including irrelevant conclusion and mistaken refutation. It arises when the argument goes awry—when, on close examination, there is a "disconnect" between the premises and the conclusion. The twist may on occasion be an instrument of deliberate deception, but more often the fallacy is the product of sloppy thinking, a confusion in reasoning that the author of the argument herself does not fully recognize, or grasp.
    
    Aristotle, the first to give a systematic classification of the informal fallacies, explains the fallacy we call missing the point, or ignoratio elenchi, as a mistake that is made in seeking to refute another's argument. The Latin word elenchi is derived from a Greek word that means a "disproof," or a "refutation." An ignoratio elenchi is a mistaken refutation, one that goes haywire because the person presenting it does not fully understand the proposition in dispute. He refutes, or tries to refute, a claim other than that which was originally at issue. He misses the point.

    As an example, suppose that one person emphasizes how important it is to increase funding for the public schools. His opponent responds by insisting that a child's education involves much more than schooling and gets under way long before her formal schooling begins. That assertion is entirely reasonable, of course, but it misses the point of what was said earlier. One party presents an argument for P, to alleviate the need for funds; his interlocutor counters with an irrelevant Q, about the importance of pre-school education.
    
    Suppose that some very controversial amendment to the tax code is proposed—say, the elimination of inheritance taxes. Such taxes, it is argued, are not fair, because the money in the estate of a deceased person was already taxed at the time it was earned—and therefore to tax it again upon the person's death is to tax the same funds twice. But, responds the supporter of the tax, inheritance taxes are imposed only on large estates that can well afford the tax; and furthermore (the advocate of the tax continues), our government needs that money. This response is an ignoratio elenchi. The inheritance tax may certainly be defended, but the size of estates taxed and the need for the resulting funds misses the point of the argument that had been put forward: the claim of unfair double taxation. Similarly, in a controversy over a new and very expensive weapons system for the military, criticized (let us suppose) for its doubtful practicality and enormous expense, the premises of an argument offered in support of the new weapons will
    
    Missing the point
    A fallacy in which the

    miss the point if they do no more than underscore the pressing need for strong national
    defense. Objectives stated in general terms—national security, a balanced budget—are
    easy to endorse; the difficult questions in dispute are likely to be whether some particular
    proposed measure (a particular weapon system, a particular tax) will in fact promote the
    end sought, and whether it is likely to do so as effectively and efficiently as its alterna-
    tive. Bypassing the hard questions by emphasizing our agreement on easy generaliza-
    tions about larger objectives commits the ignoratio elenchi: It misses the point.
    
    There is a sense in which every fallacy of irrelevance is an ignoratio elenchi, because in
    all these fallacies there is a gap between the premises and the conclusion. Premises that
    are not relevant—red herrings, straw men, personal attacks—all miss the point; that is
    true. But we reserve this name for those fallacies of irrelevance that do not fit into other
    categories. The ignoratio elenchi is, we may say, a catchall class of fallacies: fallacies in
    which the premises simply fail to connect to the intended conclusion with the coherence
    that rational argument requires.
    
    There is another expression with similar breadth and flexibility, the widely used
    phrase non sequitur. Its meaning is "does not follow": A non sequitur is an argument in
    which the conclusion simply does not follow from the premises. Thus every fallacy is,
    in that general sense, also a non sequitur. As a candidate for the presidency of the United
    States in 2000, George W. Bush indicated that he was planning to grant a reprieve (under
    his authority as the governor of Texas) to a man who had been convicted of murder and
    was scheduled for execution. Why, he was asked, did he telegraph his intention before
    announcing his formal decision? He replied:
    
    "I believe this is a case where it's important for me to send a signal about what I may do because it's a case
    where we're dealing with a man's innocence or guilt."°
  - |-
    The term non sequitur is most commonly applied when the failure of the argument
    is obvious, when the gap between the premises and the conclusion is painfully wide.
    "A great, rough non sequitur," Abraham Lincoln observed in a speech in 1854, "was some-
    times twice as dangerous as a well polished fallacy." 
    
    Yet, there are times when what appears at first to be a non sequitur will be seen upon
    reflection not to be one. Consider this report of a historic "legal fiasco."
    
    The prisoner pleaded guilty. He then said he had made a mistake, and the judge allowed him to change his
    plea to not guilty. The case was tried. The jury acquitted. "Prisoner," said Mr. Justice Hawkins, "a few minutes
    ago you said you were a thief. Now the jury say you are a liar. Consequently you are discharged."

    different thesis that one mistakenly imputes to him or her.

    . I was seven years old when the first election campaign which I can remember took
    place in my district. At that time we still had no political parties, so the announce-
    ment of this campaign was received with very little interest. But popular feeling ran
    high when it was disclosed that one of the candidates was "the Prince." There was no
    need to add Christian and surname to realize which Prince was meant. He was the
    owner of the great estate formed by the arbitrary occupation of the vast tracts of land
    reclaimed in the previous century from the Lake of Fucino. About eight thousand
    families (that is, the majority of the local population) are still employed today in
    cultivating the estate's fourteen thousand hectares. The Prince was deigning to solicit
    "his" families for their vote so that he could become their deputy in parliament. The
    agents of the estate, who were working for the Prince, talked in impeccably liberal
    phrases: "Naturally," said they, "naturally, no one will be forced to vote for the Prince,
    that's understood; in the same way that no one, naturally, can force the Prince to
    allow people who don't vote for him to work on his land. This is the period of real
    liberty for everybody; you're free, and so is the Prince." The announcement of these
    "liberal" principles produced general and understandable consternation among the
    peasants. For, as may easily be guessed, the Prince was the most hated person in our
    part of the country.

    Bawer argues that "by appeasing a totalitarian [Muslim] ideology" Europe is "imperil-
    ing its liberty." Political correctness, he writes, is keeping Europeans from defending
    themselves, resulting in "its self-destructive passivity, softness toward tyranny, its
    reflexive inclination to appease." A review of the book in The Economist observes that
    Mr. Bawer "weakens his argument by casting too wide a net," and another reviewer,

The more women who reject the gender feminist perspective, the more this proves them in thrall to the androcentric system.

    interested in having as many teachers in the schools as possible. For example, in a

    would be approximately 100. But if class size were changed to 25 the total number of
    teachers would rise to 120. And in a time of shrinking enrollments, that is a way to
    Keep teachers on the public payroll. ...

    Argument from ignorance
    
    A fallacy in which a proposition is held to be true just because it has not been proven false, or false because it has not been proven true. Also known as "argument ad ignorantiam."

    4.4 | Fallacies of Defective Induction
    
    The premises of the fallacious arguments described in the preceding section are not
    relevant to the conclusions drawn. However, there are many fallacious arguments in
    which the premises are relevant and yet are wholly inadequate. These we call fallacies
    of defective induction. What are asserted as premises simply do not serve as good
    reasons to reach the conclusion drawn.
    
    D1. The Argument from Ignorance
    (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)
    
    Someone commits the fallacy argumentum ad ignorantiam if he or she argues that something
    is true because it has not been proved false, or false because it has not been proved true. Just
    because some proposition has not yet been proved false, we are not entitled to conclude
    that it is true. The same point can be made in reverse: If some proposition has not yet been
    proved true, we are not entitled to conclude that it is false. Many true propositions have not
    yet been proved true, of course, just as many false propositions have not yet been proved
    false. The fact that we cannot now be confident rarely serves as a good reason to assert
    knowledge of falsity, or of truth. Such an inference is defective; the fallacy is called the argu-
    ment from ignorance, or the argument ad ignorantiam. Ignorance sometimes obliges us
    to suspend judgment, assigning neither truth nor falsity to the proposition in doubt.

    As an illustration, there is a memorial to the great abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, at the northwest corner of Central Park in New York City. Beneath an 8-foot statue of Douglass himself is a quilt in granite, an array of squares that are supposed, in legend, to be part of a secret code used along the Underground Railroad to aid slaves escaping from their southern owners. However, prominent historians now agree that there never was such a code. There is no surviving example of such a quilt, and there is not a single mention of quilting codes in any diaries or memoirs from that period. The designer of the memorial, Algernon Miller, nevertheless insisted that the quilt remain part of the memorial project. "No matter what anyone has to say," argued Miller, "they [his scholarly critics] weren't there in that particular moment." Not knowing that the legend is false, he concludes that we are justified in presuming it true.
    
    The fallacious appeal to ignorance crops up in science when plausible claims are held to be false because evidence of their truth cannot be provided. There may be good reason for its absence: In archeology or in paleontology, for instance, that evidence may have been destroyed over time. In astronomy or in physics, the evidence desired may be so distant in space or in time that it is physically unobtainable. The fact that some desired evidence has not been gathered does not justify the conclusion that an otherwise plausible claim is false.
    
    The argument from ignorance is particularly attractive to those who defend propositions that are very doubtful, even far-fetched. Pseudo-scientists who make unverifiable claims about psychic phenomena (for example, about telepathy, or about contact with the dead) may insist that the truth of their claims is supported by the fact that their critics have been unable to prove their falsehood.
  - |-
    An argument from ignorance was confronted by Galileo, whose newly invented telescope, early in the seventeenth century, plainly revealed the mountains and valleys of the moon. In his day, the "truth" that the moon was a perfect crystalline sphere was unquestioned; it had to be perfect because that was what Aristotle had taught. Confronted by the evidence the telescope revealed, Galileo's Aristotelian opponents responded with an argument that seemed irrefutable: Any apparent irregularities on the moon's surface are filled in with a crystalline substance that is, of course, invisible! This hypothesis saved the moon's perfection, was in accord with what Aristotle had taught—and could not be proved false. This fallacy deserved ridicule. Galileo answered with an argumentum ad ignorantiam of his own, absurd enough to expose his critics: The moon is not a perfect sphere, he replied, because there are surely crystal mountains—invisible!—rising high from its surface. Because my theological critics cannot prove the claim false, we cannot conclude that such mountains are not there!
    
    Whenever some great change is proposed, within an institution, or in society at large, those threatened by it are likely to attack with an argument from ignorance. How do we know it will work? How do we know that it is safe? We do not know; and without the knowledge that it is workable and safe, we must not adopt the change proposed. To prove workability or safety in advance, however, is often impossible. The objection sometimes takes the form of questions that suggest (but do not assert) the most horrific outcomes.
    
    The fallacy can be a serious hindrance to progress. When the recombination of DNA, now an invaluable tool in medical science, first became possible in the 1970s, objections to further experimentation in that field were based largely on ignorance. All experiments with recombinant DNA should be stopped immediately, said one prominent scientist, who asked: "If Dr. Frankenstein must go on producing his little biological monsters . . . how can we be sure what would happen once the little beasts escaped from the laboratory?"'® Another fearful scientist who sought to block these investigations made the appeal to ignorance explicitly:
  - |-
    Can we predict the consequences? We are ignorant of the broad principles of evolution. ...We simply do not know. We are ignorant of the various factors we currently perceive to participate in the evolutionary process. We are ignorant of the depth of security of our own environmental niche. ...We do not know."
    
    What we do not know does not justify condemning the effort to learn. Fortunately, these appeals to ignorance were not successful in halting experimentation in a scientific realm whose value in saving and improving lives has proved, in the years since, to be incalculable.
    
    Policy changes may be supported, as well as opposed, by an appeal to ignorance. When the federal government issued a waiver allowing Wisconsin to reduce the additional benefits it had been giving to welfare mothers for having more than one child, the governor of Wisconsin was asked if there was any evidence that unwed mothers were having additional children simply to gain the added income. His reply, ad ignorantiam, was this: "No, there isn't. There really isn't, but there is no evidence to the contrary, either."'®

    Appeal to inappro-
    priate authority
    
    A fallacy in which a
    conclusion is accepted
    as true simply because
    an expert has said
    that it is true. This Is
    a fallacy whether or
    not the expert's area
    of expertise is relevant
    to the conclusion. Also
    known as "argument ad
    verecundiam."

    In some circumstances, of course, the fact that certain evidence or results have not
    been obtained, even after they have been actively sought in ways calculated to reveal
    them, may have substantial argumentative force. New drugs being tested for safety, for
    example, are commonly given to rodents or other animal subjects for prolonged periods;
    the absence of any toxic effect on the animals is taken to be evidence (although not
    conclusive evidence) that the drug is probably not toxic to humans. Consumer protec-
    tion often relies on evidence of this kind. In circumstances like these we rely, not on
    ignorance, but on our knowledge, or conviction, that if the result we are concerned about
    were likely to arise, it would have arisen in some of the test cases. This use of the inabil-
    ity to prove something true supposes that investigators are highly skilled, and that they
    very probably would have uncovered the evidence sought had that been possible. Tragic
    mistakes sometimes are made in this sphere, but if the standard is set too high—if what
    is required is a conclusive proof of harmlessness that cannot ever be given—consumers
    will be denied what may prove to be valuable, even lifesaving, medical therapies.
    
    Similarly, when a security investigation yields no evidence of improper conduct by
    the persons investigated, it would be wrong to conclude that the investigation has left
    us ignorant. A thorough investigation will properly result in the persons being "cleared."
    Not to draw a conclusion, in some cases, is as much a breach of correct reasoning as it
    would be to draw a mistaken conclusion.
    
    The appeal to ignorance is common and often appropriate in a criminal court, where
    an accused person, in U.S. jurisprudence and British common law, is presumed inno-
    cent until proved guilty. We adopt this principle because we recognize that the error of
    convicting the innocent is far more grave than that of acquitting the guilty—and thus
    the defense in a criminal case may legitimately claim that if the prosecution has not
    proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the only verdict possible is "not guilty." The
    U.S. Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed this standard of proof in these words:

    The reasonable-doubt standard ... is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual
    error. The standard provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence—that bedrock axiomatic
    and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.'?
    
    However, this appeal to ignorance succeeds only when innocence must be assumed
    in the absence of proof to the contrary; in other contexts, such an appeal is indeed an
    argument ad ignorantiam.
    
    D2. The Appeal to Inappropriate Authority
    (Argumentum ad Verecundiam)
    
    The argument ad verecundiam is committed when someone argues that a proposition is
    true because an expert in a given field has said that it is true. This fallacy is predicated
    upon the feeling of respect that people have for the famous. An expert's judgment con-
    stitutes no conclusive proof; experts disagree, and even when they are in agreement they
    may be wrong. However, reference to an authority in an area of competence may carry
    some weight, but it doesn't prove a conclusion. Ultimately, even experts need to rely
    upon empirical evidence and rational inference.
    
    The fallacy of the appeal to inappropriate authority arises when the appeal is
    made to parties who have no /egitimate claim to authority in the matter at hand. Thus, in
    an argument about morality, an appeal to the opinions of Darwin, a towering authority
    in biology, would be fallacious, as would be an appeal to the opinions of a great artist
    such as Picasso to settle an economic dispute. Care must be taken in determining whose
    authority it is reasonable to rely on, and whose to reject. Although Picasso was not an
    economist, his judgment might plausibly be given some weight in a dispute pertaining
    to the economic value of an artistic masterpiece; and if the role of biology in moral ques-
    tions were in dispute, Darwin might indeed be an appropriate authority. This is not to
    say that an authority in one field might not be correct when speaking outside his or her
    area of expertise—to allege that would constitute a species of argumentum ad hominem
    circumstantial. In every instance, an argument must be judged upon its own merits.
  - |-
    The most blatant examples of misplaced appeals to inappropriate authority appear  
    in advertising "testimonials." We are urged to drive an automobile of a particular make  
    because a famous golfer or tennis player affirms its superiority; we are urged to drink a  
    beverage of a certain brand because some movie star or football coach expresses enthusiasm about it. Whenever the truth of some proposition is asserted on the basis of the  
    authority of one who has no special competence in that sphere, the appeal to inappropriate authority is the fallacy committed.
    
    This appears to be a simple-minded mistake that is easy to avoid, but there are  
    circumstances in which the fallacious appeal is tempting, and therefore intellectually  
    dangerous. Here are two examples: In the sphere of international relations, in which  
    weapons and war unhappily play a major role, one opinion or another is commonly  
    supported by appealing to those whose special competence lies in the technical design  
    or construction of weapons. Physicists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller,  
    for example, may indeed have been competent to give authoritative judgments regarding how certain weapons can (or cannot) function, but their knowledge in this sphere  
    did not give them special wisdom in determining broad political goals. An appeal to the  
    strong judgment of a distinguished physicist as to the wisdom of ratifying some interna-  
    tional treaty would be an argument ad verecundiam. Similarly, we admire the depth and  
    insight of great fiction—say, in the novels of Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Saul Bellow—but  
    to resort to their judgment in determining the real culprit in some political dispute would  
    be an appeal ad verecundiam. The Latin name was originated by John Locke, whose criti-  
    cism was directed chiefly at those who think that citing learned authorities is enough  
    to win any argument, who think it "a breach of modesty for others to derogate any way  
    from it, and question authority," and who "style it impudence in anyone who shall stand  
    out against them." That argument Locke named ad verecundiam—literally, an appeal to  
    the modesty of those who might be so bold as to oppose authority."
  - |-
    This species of the argumentum ad verecundiam is an appeal to one who has no legitimate claim to authority. Even one who does have a legitimate claim to authority may well prove mistaken, of course, and we may later regret our choice of experts. However, if the experts we chose deserved their reputation for knowledge, it was no fallacy to consult them even if they erred. Our mistake becomes a fallacy when our conclusion is based exclusively upon the verdict of an authority.
    
    D3. False Cause (Argument non Causa pro Causa)
    
    It is obvious that any reasoning that relies on treating as the cause of some thing or event what is not really its cause must be seriously mistaken. Often we are tempted to suppose, or led to suppose, that we understand some specific cause-and-effect relation when in fact we do not. The nature of the connection between cause and effect, and how we determine whether such a connection is present, are central problems of inductive logic and [scientific method, discussed in detail in Part II] of this book. Presuming the reality of a causal connection that does not really exist is a common mistake; in Latin the mistake is called the fallacy of non causa pro causa; we call it simply the fallacy of false cause.
    
    Whether the causal connection alleged is indeed mistaken may sometimes be a matter for dispute. Some college faculty members, it has been argued, grade leniently because they fear that rigorous grading will cause lowered evaluations of them by their students and damage to their careers. Gradual "grade inflation" is said to be the result of this fear. One college professor wrote this:
  - |-
    Course evaluation forms [completed by students] are now required in many institutions, and salaries are influenced by the results. When I joined the University of Michigan 30 years ago, my salary was higher than that of any member of the anthropology department who is still active today. My standards for grading have not followed the trend toward inflation. Student complaints about grades have increased, and now my salary is at the bottom of the professorial list.
    
    Do you think the author of this passage commits the fallacy of false cause?
    
    We sometimes mistakenly presume that one event is caused by another because it follows that other closely in time. In primitive cultures such mistakes were common; the sun would invariably reappear after an eclipse if the drums had been beaten in the darkness, but we know that it is absurd to suppose that the beating of the drums was the cause of the sun's reappearance. Mere temporal succession does not establish a causal connection.
    
    This variety of false cause is called the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc—"after this, therefore because of this."
    
    Even very sophisticated people sometimes commit this fallacy. A few years ago, a critic ridiculed the reasoning of a U.S. congressman this way:
    
    "I'm getting tired of assertions like those of Rep. Ernest Istook: 'As prayer has gone out of the schools, guns, knives, drugs, and gangs have come in' —with the unsupported implication that there is some causal connection between these events. ...We could just as well say, 'After we threw God out of the schools, we put a man on the moon.' Students may or may not need more faith, but Congress could certainly use more reason."
    
    Some suggested that the 1954 insertion of the words "under God" into the Pledge of Allegiance was the cause of the host of social ills that followed.
    
    Mistakes of this kind are widespread. Unusual weather conditions are blamed on some unrelated celestial phenomenon that happened to precede them; an infection really caused by a virus is thought to be caused by a chill wind, or wet feet, and so on. Perhaps no sphere is more vulnerable to this sort of argument than that of crimes and punishments. Typical is this remark in a letter to The New York Times:

    "The death penalty in the United States has given us the highest crime rate and greatest number of prisoners
    per 100,000 population in the industrialized world."
    
    Post hoc ergo propter hoc is an easy fallacy to detect when it is blatant, but even the
    best of scientists and statesmen are occasionally misled by it.
    
    False cause is also the fallacy committed when one mistakenly argues against some
    proposal on the ground that any change in a given direction is sure to lead to further
    changes in the same direction—and thus to grave consequences. Taking this step, it may
    be said, will put us on a slippery slope to disaster—and such reasoning is therefore called
    4.4 Fallacies of Defective Induction
    
    the fallacy of the slippery slope. Whether the feared consequences will indeed arise is
    not determined by the first step in a given direction; the suggestion that a change in that
    direction will trigger a catastrophic chain reaction is not generally warranted, although
    such argument is commonly invoked in defense of the status quo. What needs to be
    determined is what, in fact, probably will (or will not) cause the results feared.
    
    Consider the following illustration: One common objection to the legalization of
    assisted suicide is that once formal permission has been given to medical doctors to act
    in a way that is of disputable morality, doctors will be led to engage in more and greater
    immorality of the same or similar type. The first leniency ought to be avoided, according
    to this argument, because it will leave us insecure on a slope so slippery that our first step
    down cannot be our last. To this argument one keen critic responded:
    
    The slippery slope argument, although influential, is hard to deal with rationally. It suggests that once we
    allow doctors to shorten the life of patients who request it, doctors could and would wantonly kill burden-
    some patients who do not want to die. This suggestion is not justified... .

    Physicians often prescribe drugs which, in doses greater than prescribed, would kill the patient. No one
    fears that the actual doses prescribed will lead to their use of lethal doses. No one objects to such prescrip-
    tions in fear of a "slippy slope." Authorizing physicians to assist in shortening the life of patients who
    request this assistance no more implies authority to shorten the life of patients who want to prolong it, than
    authority for surgery to remove the gall bladder implies authority to remove the patient's heart.*°
    
    The supposition that moving in a given direction, however prudently, is sure to
    produce the dreadful result of moving in the same direction to excess, is the fallacy of
    the slippery slope.
    
    There are circumstances, of course, in which the first step in a new direction does
    establish a precedent that makes additional movement in that direction easier to achieve.
    This may be good or bad. Opposing new legislation that would punish crimes more
    severely if they were motivated by racial hatred, one critic writes:
    
    There should not be a separate category for hate crimes. A murder is a murder; a beating is a beating. We
    should prosecute people for the crimes they commit, not why they commit them. If we start to categorize
    crimes by their motivation, we start down a very slippery slope."°
    
    Some arguments of this kind have merit, because precedent can affect subsequent
    decision making. The slippery slope is indeed a fallacy—but the mere allegation that that
    fallacy has been committed does not prove the argument in question faulty.
    
    D4. Hasty Generalization
  - |-
    Throughout our lives, we rely on statements about how things generally are and how people generally behave. Nonetheless, general claims, although critical in reasoning, must be carefully scrutinized: The universality of their application ought never be accepted or assumed without justification. Hasty generalization is the fallacy we commit when we draw conclusions about all the persons or things in a given class on the basis of our knowledge about only one (or only a very few) of the members of that class. We all know of persons who have generalized mistakenly about certain companies or governments because of a single experience. Stereotypes about people who come from certain countries, or cultures, are widespread and commonly mistaken; hasty generalizations about foreign cultures can be downright nasty, and are good illustrations of the fallacious leap to broad generalization on the basis of very little evidence.
    
    Slippery slope
    
    A fallacy in which a change in a particular direction is asserted to lead inevitably to further changes (usually undesirable) in the same direction.
    
    Hasty
    generalization
    
    A fallacy of defective induction in which one moves carelessly from a single case, or a very few cases, to a large-scale generalization about all or most cases. Also known as "converse accident."
    
    —
    
    chapter 4 Fallacies
    
    An anecdote or single instance may indeed be relevant support for a general rule or theory; but when it is treated as proof of that theory, the generalization is not well founded—the induction is defective. Here is an example: Eating deep-fried foods tends to raise one's cholesterol level. A single instance in which it does not do so is hardly sufficient to show that such foods are healthy. The owner of a "fish and chips" shop in England fallaciously defended the healthfulness of his deep-fried cookery with this argument:
    
    Take my son, Martyn. He's been eating fish and chips his whole life, and he just had a cholesterol test, and his level is below the national average. What better proof could there be than a fryer's son?

    Foods or drugs that are harmless in one context may be harmful in another. To move from a single case, or a very few cases, to a large-scale generalization about all or most cases, is fallacious reasoning, but it is common and often tempting. It is also called the fallacy of converse accident because it is the reverse of another common mistake, known as the fallacy of accident, in which generalizations are misused in another way. We turn to it next.
    
    Fallacies of Defective Induction
    
    D1. The Argument from Ignorance (ad Ignorantiam)
    An informal fallacy in which a conclusion is supported by an illegitimate appeal to ignorance, as when it
    is supposed that something is likely to be true because we cannot prove that it is false.
    
    D2. The Appeal to Inappropriate Authority (ad Verecundiam)
    
    An informal fallacy in which the appeal to authority is illegitimate, either because the authority appealed
    to has no special claim to expertise on the topic at issue, or, more generally, because no authority is
    assured to be reliable.
    
    D3. False Cause (non Causa pro Causa)
    An informal fallacy in which the mistake arises from accepting as the cause of an event what is not really
    its cause.
    
    D4. Hasty Generalization
    An informal fallacy in which a principle that is true of a particular case is applied, carelessly or deliber-
    ately, to the great run of cases.
    
    4.5 | Fallacies of Presumption
    
    Some mistakes in everyday reasoning are the consequence of an unjustified assumption,
    often suggested by the way in which the argument is formulated. That suggestion may
    be deliberate, or the assumption may be only an oversight. In either case, the upshot is
    that the reader, the listener, and even the author of the passage may be led to assume the
    truth of some unproved and unwarranted proposition. When such dubious propositions,
    the conclusion depends on, are crucial for the support of the conclusion, the argument is
    bad and can be very misleading. Arguments that depend on such unwarranted leaps are
    called fallacies of presumption.
    4.5 Fallacies of Presumption
  - |-

    In fallacious arguments of this kind the premises may indeed be relevant to the con-
    clusion drawn, but that relevance is likely to flow from the tacit supposition of what has
    not been given support and may even be unsupportable. The presumption often goes
    unnoticed. To expose such a fallacy it is therefore usually sufficient to call attention to
    the smuggled assumption, or supposition, and to its doubtfulness or its falsity. Three
    common fallacies are included in this category.
    
    P1. Accident
    
    Circumstances alter cases. A generalization that is largely true may not apply in a given
    case (or to some subcategory of cases) for good reasons. The reasons the generalization
    does not apply in those cases have to do with the special circumstances, also called the
    "accidental" circumstances, of that case or those cases. If these accidental circumstances
    are ignored, and we assume that the generalization applies universally, we commit the
    fallacy of accident.
    
    In the preceding section we explained the fallacy of converse accident, or hasty gen-
    eralization, the mistake of moving carelessly or too quickly to a generalization that the
    evidence does not support. Accident is the fallacy that arises when we move carelessly
    or unjustifiably from a generalization to some particulars that it does not in fact cover.
    
    Experience teaches us that even generalizations that are widely applicable and very
    useful are likely to have exceptions for which we must be on guard. For example, there
    is a general principle in law that hearsay evidence—statements made by a third party
    outside court—may not be accepted as evidence in court; this is the "hearsay rule," and
    it is a good rule. However, when the person whose oral communications are reported is
    dead, or when the party reporting the hearsay in court does so in conflict with his own
    best interest, that rule may not apply. Indeed, there is hardly any rule or general princi-
    ple that does not have plausible exceptions, and we are likely to argue fallaciously if we
    reason on the supposition that some rule applies universally.
    
    P2. Complex Question (Plurium Interrogationum)
  - |-
    One of the most common fallacies of presumption is to ask a question in such a way as  
    to presuppose the truth of some conclusion that is buried in the question. The question  
    itself is likely to be rhetorical, with no answer actually being sought. But putting the  
    question seriously, thereby introducing its presupposition surreptitiously, often achieves  
    the questioner's purpose—fallaciously.
    
    Thus an essayist asked:
    
    With all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science, could it be that man-made global warming  
    is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people ??°
    
    Such a statement assumes that much of the evidence supporting global warming is unre-  
    liable or "phony." Or a homeowner might ask, regarding a proposed increase in the  
    property tax, "How can you expect the majority of the voters, who rent but don't own  
    property and don't have to pay the tax, to care if the tax burden of others is made even  
    more unfair?"—assuming both that the burden of the proposed tax is unfair and that  
    those who rent rather than own their own homes are not affected by tax increases on  
    property. Because assumptions like these are not asserted openly, the questioners evade  
    the need to defend them forthrightly.
    
    Fallacy of accident  
    A fallacy in which  
    
    a generalization is  
    mistakenly applied to a  
    particular case to which  
    the generalization does  
    not apply.  
    
    chapter 4 Fallacies
    
    Complex question  
    An informal fallacy in  
    which a question is  
    asked in such a way as  
    to presuppose the truth  
    of some conclusion  
    buried in that question.
    
    The complex question is often a deceitful device. The speaker may pose some  
    question, then answer it or strongly suggest the answer with the truth of the premise  
    that had been buried in the question simply assumed. A letter writer asks, "If America's  
    booming economy depends on people's using consumer credit beyond their means, thus  
    creating poverty, do we really have a healthy economy?"" But the role and the results of  
    consumer credit remain to be addressed.

    One critic of research in genetics hides his assumptions in this question: "What are
    the consequences of reducing the world's gene pool to patented intellectual property,
    controlled by a handful of life-science corporations?"*® The "consequences" asked about
    are never actually discussed; they are only a device with which the reader may be frightened
    by the assumptions of the question—that the world's gene pool is soon likely to be
    reduced to patented intellectual property, and that a handful of corporations will soon
    control that gene pool. Establishing the plausibility of such threats requires much more
    than asking questions designed to presuppose them.
    
    The appearance of a question in an editorial or headline often has the purpose of
    suggesting the truth of the unstated assumptions on which it is built: "Judge Took Bribe?"
    This technique is a common mark of what is called "yellow journalism." In debate, when-
    ever a question is accompanied by the aggressive demand that it be answered "yes or no,"
    there is reason to suspect that the question is "loaded"—that it is unfairly complex.
    
    Does the distinguished senator believe that the American public is really so naive that they will endorse just
    any stopgap measure?
    
    This "question," of course, cannot be answered "Yes." It conceals several unchallenged
    assumptions: that what is proposed is a "stopgap" measure, that it is inadequate, and
    that the American public would reject it.
  - |-
    The mistake that underlies the fallacy of complex question also underlies a common
    problem in parliamentary procedure. Deliberative bodies sometimes confront a motion
    that, although not intended deceptively, is covertly complex. In such circumstances
    there is a need, before discussion, to simplify the issues confronting the body. This
    accounts for the privileged position, in parliamentary procedure governed by Robert's
    Rules of Order or similar manuals, of the motion to divide the question. For example, a
    motion that the body "postpone for one year" action on some controversial matter may
    wisely be divided into the questions of whether to postpone action, and if that is done,
    then to determine the length of the postponement. Some members may support the
    postponement itself yet find the one-year period intolerably long; if the opportunity
    to divide the question were not given priority, the body might be maneuvered into
    taking action on a motion that, because of its complexity, cannot be decided in a way
    that captures the true will of the body. A presiding officer, having the duty to promote
    a fully rational debate, may solicit the motion to divide the question before beginning
    the substantive discussion.
    
    Egregious examples of the fallacy of the complex question arise in dialogue or cross-
    examination in which one party poses a question that is complex, a second party answers
    the question, and the first party then draws a fallacious inference for which that answer
    was the ground. For example:
    
    Lawyer: The figures seem to indicate that your sales increased as a result of these
    misleading advertisements. Is that correct?
    127
    
    4.5 Fallacies of Presumption
    
    Witness: They did not!
    Lawyer: But you do admit, then, that your advertising was misleading. How long
    have you been engaging in practices like these?
    
    When a question is complex, and all of its presuppositions are to be denied, they
    must be denied individually. The denial of only one presupposition may lead to the
    assumption of the truth of the other. In law, this has been called "the negative pregnant."
    Here is an illustration from a notorious murder trial:
    
    Q: Lizzie, did you not take an axe and whack your mother forty times, and then
    whack your father forty-one times when faced with the prospect of cold mutton
    stew?
  - |-
    A: Not true. We were to eat Brussels sprouts fondue that day.
    
    P3. Begging the Question (Petitio Principii)
    
    The fallacy called begging the question is widely misunderstood, partly because its
    name is misleading. It is the mistake of assuming the truth of what one seeks to prove.
    The "question" in a formal debate is the issue that is in dispute; to "beg" the question is
    to ask, or to suppose, that the very matter in controversy be conceded. This is an argu-
    ment with no merit at all, of course, and one who makes such an assumption commits
    a gross fallacy.
    
    The Latin name of the fallacy, for which "begging the question" is the translation, is
    petitio principii, so each instance of it is called a petitio. One might think the fallacy would
    be so obvious that no one would ever commit it, but that is not the case. The logical
    mistake arises because it is obscured, even from its author, by the language used. Logician
    Richard Whately used this classic example of a deceptive petitio:
    
    To allow every man unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole, advantageous to the state;
    for it is highly conducive to the interests of the community that each individual should enjoy a liberty, perfectly
    unlimited, of expressing his sentiments.;!
    
    This statement says only that freedom of speech is a good thing because it is a good
    thing—which is not much of an argument.
    
    In the effort to establish the desired conclusion, an author may cast about, searching
    for premises that will do the trick. Of course, the conclusion itself, reformulated in other
    words, will do the trick very nicely. Another illustration, equally fallacious, is found in
    this claim by a sixteenth-century Chinese philosopher:
    
    There is no such thing as knowledge which cannot be carried into practice, for such knowledge is really no
    knowledge at all.°?
  - |-
    This fallacy, like the fallacy of missing the point, is often a mistake that is not recognized by the author of the passage. The presumption that is the heart of the fallacy is buried in the verbiage of the premises, sometimes obscured by confusing or unrecognized synonyms. The arguments are circular—every petitio is a circular argument—but the circle that has been constructed may be large and confusing, and thus the logical mistake goes unseen.
    
    Begging the question
    
    An informal fallacy in which the conclusion of an argument is stated or assumed in any one of the premises. Also known as "circular argument" and petitio principii.

    overview
    
    It would be wrong to suppose that only silly authors make this mistake. Even powerful minds are on occasion snared by this fallacy, as is illustrated by a highly controversial issue in the history of philosophy. Logicians have long sought to establish the reliability of inductive procedures by establishing the truth of what is called the principle of induction. This is the principle that the laws of nature will operate tomorrow as they operate today, that in basic ways nature is essentially uniform, and that therefore we may rely on past experience to guide our conduct in the future. "That the future will be essentially like the past" is the claim at issue, but this claim, never doubted in ordinary life, turns out to be very difficult to prove. Some thinkers have claimed that they could prove it by showing that, when we have in the past relied on the inductive principle, we have always found that this method has helped us to achieve our objectives. They ask, "Why conclude that the future will be like the past?" and answer, "Because it always has been like the past."
  - |-
    As David Hume pointed out, however, this common argument is a petitio—it begs the question. The point at issue is whether nature will continue to behave regularly. That it has done so in the past cannot serve as proof that it will do so in the future, unless one assumes the very principle that is here in question: that the future will be like the past. Hence Hume, granting that in the past the future has been like the past, asked the telling question with which philosophers still tussle: How can we know that future futures will be like past futures? They may be so, of course, but we cannot assume that they will be for the sake of proving that they will.*
    
    Because the name of this fallacy is widely misunderstood, that name is sometimes wrongly used to refer to a linguistic device that is not a fallacy, not even an argument of any kind, but merely a provocative observation. A claim "begs" the question (in this sense) when it raises some question or opens the door to some controversy. Thus a magazine headline may mistakenly read, "The President's decision to invade Iraq begs the question: What are the limits of the President's war-making authority?" This use of the phrase is simply a linguistic mistake. To "beg the question" is not to raise the issue, but to assume the truth of the conclusion sought.
    
    Circular arguments are certainly fallacious, but the premises are not irrelevant to the conclusions drawn. They are relevant; indeed, they prove the conclusion, but they do so trivially—they end where they began. A petitio principii is always technically valid, but always worthless.

She walked away from church that day. Mr. Suzuki regarded her religion as a silly waste of time—but he was fascinated by the recovery of her knee. "In gambling," he said, "you use dice. Dice are made from bone. If God could heal her bone, I figured he could probably assist my dice and make me the best dice thrower in all of Japan."

    4.6 | Fallacies of Ambiguity
    
    The meaning of words or phrases may shift as a result of inattention, or may be deliberately manipulated within the course of an argument. A term may have one sense in a premise but quite a different sense in the conclusion. When the inference drawn depends on such changes it is, of course, fallacious. Mistakes of this kind are called fallacies of ambiguity or sometimes "sophisms." The deliberate use of such devices is usually crude and readily detected—but at times the ambiguity may be obscure, the error accidental, the fallacy subtle. Five varieties are distinguished here.
    
    A1. Equivocation
  - |-
    Most words have more than one literal meaning, and most of the time we have no difficulty keeping those meanings separate by noting the context and using our good sense when reading and listening. Yet when we confuse the several meanings of a word or phrase—accidentally or deliberately—we are using the word equivocally. If we do that in the context of an argument, we commit the fallacy of equivocation.
    
    Sometimes the equivocation is obvious and absurd and is used in a joking line or passage. Lewis Carroll's account of the adventures of Alice in Through the Looking-Glass is replete with clever and amusing equivocations. One of them goes like this:
    
    "Who did you pass on the road?" the King went on, holding his hand out to the messenger for some hay.
    "Nobody," said the messenger.
    "Quite right," said the King; "this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you."
    
    The equivocation in this passage is rather subtle. As it is first used here, the word "nobody" simply means "no person." Reference is then made using a pronoun ("him"), as though that word ("nobody") had named a person. When subsequently the same word is capitalized and plainly used as a name ("Nobody"), it putatively names a person having a characteristic (being passed on the road) derived from the first use of the word. Equivocation is sometimes the tool of wit—and Lewis Carroll was a very witty logician.*
    
    Equivocal arguments are always fallacious, but they are not always silly or comical, as in the example discussed in the following excerpt:
  - |-
    There is an ambiguity in the phrase "have faith in" that helps to make faith look respectable. When a man  
    says that he has faith in the president he is assuming that it is obvious and known to everybody that there  
    is a president, that the president exists, and he is asserting his confidence that the president will do good  
    work on the whole. But, if a man says he has faith in telepathy, he does not mean that he is confident that  
    telepathy will do good work on the whole, but that he believes that telepathy really occurs sometimes, that  
    telepathy exists. Thus the phrase "to have faith in x" sometimes means to be confident that good work will  
    be done by x, who is assumed or known to exist, but at other times means to believe that x exists. Which  
    does it mean in the phrase "have faith in God"? It means ambiguously both; and the self-evidence of what  
    it means in the one sense recommends what it means in the other sense. If there is a perfectly powerful and  
    good god it is self-evidently reasonable to believe that he will do good. In this sense "have faith in God" is a  
    reasonable exhortation. But it insinuates the other sense, namely "believe that there is a perfectly powerful  
    and good god, no matter what the evidence." Thus the reasonableness of trusting God if he exists is used  
    to make it seem also reasonable to believe that he exists.**
    
    * This passage very probably inspired David Powers, who formally changed his name to Absolutely Nobody and ran as an  
    independent candidate for lieutenant governor of the state of Oregon. His campaign slogan was "Hi, I'm Absolutely  
    Nobody. Vote for me." In the general election of 1992, he drew 7 percent of the vote.

    Chapter 4 Fallacies
    
    Fallacy of  
    amphiboly
  - |-
    A fallacy in which a loose or awkward combination of words can be interpreted in more than one way; the argument contains a premise based upon one interpretation, while the conclusion relies on a different interpretation.
    
    Fallacy of Accent  
    A fallacy of ambiguity that occurs when an argument contains a premise that relies on one possible emphasis of certain words, but the conclusion relies on a different emphasis that gives those same words a different meaning.
    
    One kind of equivocation deserves special mention. This is the mistake that arises from the misuse of "relative" terms, which have different meanings in different contexts. For example, the word "tall" is a relative word; a tall man and a tall building are in quite different categories. A tall man is one who is taller than most men, a tall building is one that is taller than most buildings. Certain forms of argument that are valid for nonrelative terms break down when relative terms are substituted for them. The argument "an elephant is an animal; therefore a gray elephant is a gray animal" is perfectly valid. The word "gray" is a nonrelative term. In contrast, the argument "an elephant is an animal; therefore a small elephant is a small animal" is ridiculous. The point here is that "small" is a relative term: A small elephant is a very large animal. The fallacy is one of equivocation with respect to the relative term "small." Not all equivocation on relative terms is so obvious, however. The word "good" is a relative term and is frequently equivocated on when it is argued, for example, that so-and-so is a good general and would therefore be a good president, or that someone is a good scholar and is therefore likely to be a good teacher.
    
    A2. Amphiboly
  - |-
    The fallacy of amphiboly occurs when one is arguing from premises whose formulations are ambiguous because of their grammatical construction. The word "amphiboly" is derived from the Greek, its meaning in essence being "two in a lump," or the "doubleness" of a lump. A statement is amphibolous when its meaning is indeterminate because of the loose or awkward way in which its words are combined. An amphibolous statement may be true in one interpretation and false in another. When it is stated as premise with the interpretation that makes it true, and a conclusion is drawn from it on the interpretation that makes it false, then the fallacy of amphiboly has been committed.
    
    In guiding electoral politics, amphiboly can mislead as well as confuse. During the 1990s, while he sat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from California, Tony Coelho is reported to have said: "Women prefer Democrats to men." Amphibolous statements make dangerous premises—but they are seldom encountered in serious discourse.
    
    What grammarians call "dangling" participles and phrases often present amphiboly of a striking sort, as in "The farmer blew out his brains after taking affectionate farewell of his family with a shotgun." Some tidbits in The New Yorker make acid fun of writers and editors who overlook careless amphiboly:
    
    Dr. Salick donated, along with his wife, Gloria, $4.5 million to Queens College for the center. Gloria is tax-deductible?
    
    A3. Accent
    
    We have seen that shifting the meaning of some term in an argument may result in a fallacy of ambiguity. Most commonly that shift is an equivocation, as noted earlier. Sometimes, however, the shift is the result of a change in emphasis on a single word or phrase, whose meaning does not change. When the premise of an argument relies on one possible emphasis, but a conclusion drawn from it relies on the meaning of the same words emphasized differently, the fallacy of accent has been committed.
  - |-
    This fallacy can be very serious, and in argument it can be very damaging. Its name  
    seems innocuous. This is due, in part, to the origin of the name in the classification of  
    fallacies first presented by Aristotle.°** It happens that in the Greek language of Aristotle's  
    day, some words spelled identically had different meanings depending on the way in  
    which they were pronounced, or accented. Those different meanings could result in a  
    deceptive argument, appropriately called a fallacy of accent. In English today there are  
    not very many cases in which changing the accent in a word changes the meaning of  
    the word. Three of the most common are increase and increase, insult and insult, record  
    and record. These pairs of words accented differently mean different parts of speech—one  
    member of each pair is a noun, the other a verb—and thus it is unlikely that fallacious  
    argument would now arise from those differently accented words.
    
    Over the centuries, however, while the Aristotelian name has been retained, it has  
    come to be applied to a much wider category, which includes the misleading uses of  
    emphasis in various forms and the use of meanings deliberately taken out of context. We are greatly stretching the name "accent" that Aristotle used. If we could overcome  
    the weight of tradition, we might wisely rename the argument that misleads in this way  
    "the fallacy of emphasis."
    
    Consider, as an illustration, the different meanings that can be given to the statement
    
    We should not speak ill of our friends.
  - |-
    When the sentence is read without any special stress on one of its words, this injunction
    is surely one with which we would all agree. But, if the sentence is read with stress on the
    word "friends," we might understand it to suggest that speaking ill of those who are not our
    friends is not precluded. Such an injunction is no longer acceptable as a moral rule. Suppose
    we stress the word "speak" in this sentence. Then it might suggest that whereas nasty speech
    is to be avoided, one may work ill even on one's friends—a very troubling conclusion. If
    the word "we" is emphasized, the suggestion arises that the injunction applies to us but
    not to others, and so on. The various arguments that emerge are plainly the outcome of the
    deliberate manipulation of emphasis; the sentence can be used to achieve assorted fallacious
    ambiguities. How is the sentence to be rightly understood? That depends on its context,
    of course. Often, a phrase or a passage can be understood correctly only when its context is
    known, because that context makes clear the sense in which the words are intended.
    
    Therefore the fallacy of accent may be construed broadly to include the distortion
    produced by pulling a quoted passage out of its context, putting it in another con-
    text, and there drawing a conclusion that could never have been drawn in the original
    context. Quoting out of context is sometimes done with deliberate craftiness. In the
    presidential election campaign of 1996 the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Al
    Gore, was quoted by a Republican press aide as having said that "there is no proven link
    between smoking and lung cancer." Those were indeed Mr. Gore's exact words, uttered
    during a television interview in 1992. But they were only part of a sentence. In that
    interview, Mr. Gore's full statement was that some tobacco company scientists "will claim
    with a straight face that there is no proven link between smoking and lung cancer. ... But
    the weight of the evidence accepted by the overwhelming preponderance of scientists
    is, yes, smoking does cause lung cancer."*"
  - |-
    The omission of the words "will claim with a straight face"—and of Gore's express
    conviction that cancer is caused by smoking—unfairly reversed the sense of the passage
    from which the quotation was pulled. The argument suggested by the abbreviated quo-
    tation, having the apparent conclusion that Mr. Gore seriously doubts the causal link
    between smoking and cancer, is an egregious example of the fallacy of accent.
    
    Deliberate distortion of this kind is not rare. A biography by Thomas DiLorenzo,
    purporting to show that Abraham Lincoln was not the advocate of human equality he is
    widely thought to have been, quotes words of Lincoln that appear to mock the principle

    that "all men are created equal." Lincoln is quoted thus: "I am sorry to say that I have
    never seen two men of whom it is true. But I must admit I never saw the Siamese Twins,
    and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage apho-
    rism." DiLorenzo then remarks that such mockery contrasts sharply with the "seductive
    words of the Gettysburg Address, eleven years later, in which he purported to rededicate
    the nation to the notion that all men are created equal."** However, DiLorenzo fails to
    report that those quoted words were in fact Lincoln's account of the view of an unnamed
    Virginia clergyman, a view he goes on immediately to reject, saying that it "sounds
    strangely in republican America." DiLorenzo's failure to report the context of the words
    quoted renders his argument fallacious and disreputable.

    Advertising often relies on the same device. A theater critic who says of a new play that it is far from the funniest appearing on Broadway this year may find herself quoted in an ad for the play: "Funniest appearing on Broadway this year!" To avoid such distortions, and the fallacies of accent that are built on them, the responsible writer must be scrupulously accurate in quotation, always indicating whether italics were in the original, indicating (with dots) whether passages have been omitted, and so on.
    
    Physical manipulation of print or pictures is commonly used to mislead deliberately through accent. Sensational words appear in large letters in the headlines of newspaper reports, deliberately suggesting mistaken conclusions to those who glance hastily at them. Later in the report the headline is likely to be qualified by other words in much smaller letters. To avoid being tricked, by news reports or in contracts, one is well advised to give careful attention to "the small print." In political propaganda the misleading choice of a sensational heading or the use of a clipped photograph, in what purports to be a factual report, will use accent shrewdly to encourage the drawing of conclusions known by the propagandist to be false. An account that may not be an outright lie may yet distort by accent in ways that are deliberately manipulative or dishonest.
    
    Such practices are hardly rare in advertising. A remarkably low price often appears in very large letters, followed by "and up" in tiny print. Wonderful bargains in airplane fares are followed by an asterisk, with a distant footnote explaining that the price is available only three months in advance for flights on Thursdays following a full moon, or that there may be other "applicable restrictions." Costly items with well-known brand names are advertised at very low prices, with a small note elsewhere in the ad that "prices listed are for limited quantities in stock." Readers are drawn into the store but are likely to be unable to make the purchase at the advertised price. Accented passages, by themselves, are not strictly fallacies; they become embedded in fallacies when one interpretation of a phrase, flowing from its accent, is relied on to suggest a conclusion (for example, that the plane ticket or brand item can be purchased at the listed price) that is very doubtful when account is taken of the misleading accent.
  - |-
    Even the literal truth can be used, by manipulating its placement, so as to deceive with accent. Disgusted with his first mate, who was repeatedly inebriated while on duty, the captain of a ship noted in the ship's log, almost every day, "The mate was drunk today." The angry mate took his revenge. Keeping the log himself on a day when the captain was ill, the mate recorded, "The captain was sober today."
    
    4.6 Composition
    
    The term fallacy of composition is applied to both of two closely related types of mistaken argument. The first may be described as reasoning fallaciously from the attributes of the parts of a whole to the attributes of the whole itself. A flagrant example is to argue that, because every part of a certain machine is light in weight, the machine "as a whole" is light in weight. The error here is manifest when we recognize that a very heavy machine may consist of a very large number of lightweight parts. Not all examples of fallacious composition are so obvious, however. Some are misleading. One may hear it seriously argued that, because each scene of a certain play is a model of artistic perfection, the play as a whole is artistically perfect. This is as much a fallacy of composition as to argue that, because every ship is ready for battle, the whole fleet must be ready for battle.
  - |-
    The other type of composition fallacy is strictly parallel to that just described. Here, the fallacy is reasoning from attributes of the individual elements or members of a collection to attributes of the collection or totality of those elements. For example, it would be fallacious to argue that because a bus uses more gasoline than an automobile, all buses use more gasoline than all automobiles. This version of the fallacy of composition turns on a confusion between the "distributive" and the "collective" use of general terms. Thus, although college students may enroll in no more than six different classes each semester, it is also true that college students enroll in hundreds of different classes each semester. This verbal conflict is easily resolved. It may be true of college students, distributively, that each may enroll in no more than six classes each semester. We call this a distributive use of the term "college students," because we are speaking of college students taken singly. But it is true of college students, taken collectively, that they enroll in hundreds of different classes each semester. This is a collective use of the term "college students," in that we are speaking of college students all together, as a totality. Thus, buses, distributively, use more gasoline than automobiles, but collectively, automobiles use more gasoline than buses, because there are so many more of them.
    
    This second kind of composition fallacy may be defined as the invalid inference that what may truly be predicated of a term distributively may also be truly predicated of the term collectively. Thus, the nuclear bombs dropped during World War II did more damage than did the ordinary bombs dropped—but only distributively. The matter is exactly reversed when the two kinds of bombs are considered collectively, because so many more conventional bombs were dropped than nuclear ones. Ignoring this distinction in an argument permits the fallacy of composition.
  - |-
    These two varieties of composition, though parallel, are really distinct because of the difference between a mere collection of elements and a whole constructed out of those elements. Thus, a mere collection of parts is no machine; a mere collection of bricks is neither a house nor a wall. A whole, such as a machine, a house, or a wall, has its parts organized or arranged in certain definite ways. Because organized wholes and mere col-
    lections are distinct, so are the two versions of the composition fallacy, one proceeding invalidly to wholes from their parts, the other proceeding invalidly to collections from
    their members or elements.
    
    A5. Division
    
    The fallacy of division is simply the reverse of the fallacy of composition. In it the
    same confusion is present, but the inference proceeds in the opposite direction. As in
    the case of composition, two varieties of the fallacy of division may be distinguished.
    The first kind of division consists of arguing fallaciously that what is true of a whole must
    also be true of its parts. To argue that, because a certain corporation is very important
    and Mr. Doe is an official of that corporation, therefore Mr. Doe is very important, is to

    Fallacy of division
    
    A fallacy of ambiguity
    
    in which an argument
    erroneously assigns
    attributes to parts of a
    whole (or to members
    of a collection) based on
    the fact that the whole
    (or the collection) has
    those attributes.

    commit the fallacy of division. This first variety of the division fallacy is committed in
    any such argument, as in moving from the premise that a certain machine is heavy, or
    complicated, or valuable, to the conclusion that this or any other part of the machine
    must be heavy, or complicated, or valuable. To argue that a student must have a large
    room because the room is located in a large dormitory would be still another instance of
    the first kind of fallacy of division.

    4.6 Fallacies of Ambiguity 
    
    The second type of division fallacy is committed when one argues from the attributes of a collection of elements to the attributes of the elements themselves. To argue that, because university students study medicine, law, engineering, dentistry, and architecture, therefore each, or even any, university student studies medicine, law, engineering, dentistry, and architecture is to commit the second kind of division fallacy. It is true that university students, collectively, study all these various subjects, but it is false that university students, distributively, do so. Instances of this fallacy of division often look like valid arguments, for what is true of a class distributively is certainly true of each and every member. Thus the argument
    
    Dogs are carnivorous.
    Afghan hounds are dogs.
    Therefore Afghan hounds are carnivorous.
    
    is perfectly valid. Closely resembling this argument is another,
    
    Dogs are frequently encountered in the streets.
    Afghan hounds are dogs.
    Therefore Afghan hounds are frequently encountered in the streets.
    
    which is invalid, committing the fallacy of division. Some instances of division are obviously jokes, as when the classical example of valid argumentation,
    
    Humans are mortal.
    Socrates is a human.
    Therefore Socrates is mortal.
    
    is parodied by the fallacious
    
    American Indians are disappearing.
    That man is an American Indian.
    Therefore that man is disappearing.
    
    The old riddle, "Why do white sheep eat more than black ones?" turns on the confusion involved in the fallacy of division, for the answer ("Because there are more of them") treats collectively what seemed to be referred to distributively in the question.
    
    The fallacy of division, which springs from a kind of ambiguity, resembles the fallacy of accident (discussed in Section 4.5), which springs from unwarranted presumption. Likewise, the fallacy of composition, also flowing from ambiguity, resembles the hasty generalization we call "converse accident." These likenesses are superficial. An explanation of the differences between the two pairs of fallacies will be helpful in grasping the errors committed in all four.
  - |-
    If we infer, from looking at one or two parts of a large machine, that because they happen to be well designed, every one of the machine's many parts is well designed, we commit the fallacy of converse accident or hasty generalization, for what is true about one or two parts may not be true of all. If we examine every part and find that each is carefully made, and from that finding infer that the entire machine is carefully made, we also reason fallaciously, because however carefully the parts were produced, they may have been assembled awkwardly or carelessly. Here the fallacy is one of composition. In converse accident, one argues that some atypical members of a class have a specified attribute, and therefore that all members of the class, distributively, have that attribute; in composition, one argues that, because each and every member of the class has that attribute, the class itself (collectively) has that attribute. The difference is great. In converse accident, all predications are distributive, whereas in the composition fallacy, the mistaken inference is from distributive to collective predication.
    
    Similarly, division and accident are two distinct fallacies; their superficial resemblance hides the same kind of underlying difference. In division, we argue (mistakenly) that, because the class itself has a given attribute, each of its members also has it. Thus, it is the fallacy of division to conclude that, because an army as a whole is nearly invincible, each of its units is nearly invincible. In accident, we argue (also mistakenly) that, because some rule applies in general, there are no special circumstances in which it might not apply. Thus, we commit the fallacy of accident when we insist that a person should be fined for ignoring a "No Swimming" sign when jumping into the water to rescue someone from drowning.
    
    Fallacies of Ambiguity
    
    A1. Equivocation
    An informal fallacy in which two or more meanings of the same word or phrase have been confused.
    
    A2. Amphiboly
    An informal fallacy arising from the loose, awkward, or mistaken way in which words are combined, leading to alternative possible meanings of a statement.
    
    A3. Accent
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    An informal fallacy committed when a term or phrase has a meaning in the conclusion of an argument different from its meaning in one of the premises, the difference arising chiefly from a change in emphasis given to the words used.
    
    A4. Composition
    
    An informal fallacy in which an inference is mistakenly drawn from the attributes of the parts of a whole to the attributes of the whole itself.
    
    A5. Division
    
    An informal fallacy in which a mistaken inference is drawn from the attributes of a whole to the attributes of the parts of the whole.
    
    Unlike accident and converse accident, composition and division are fallacies of ambiguity, resulting from the multiple meanings of terms. Wherever the words or phrases used may mean one thing in one part of the argument and another thing in another part, and those different meanings are deliberately or accidentally confounded, we can expect the argument to be fallacious.

    **Chapter 4 Fallacies**
    
    **EXERCISES**
    
    **A. Identify and explain the fallacies of ambiguity that appear in the following passages:**
    
    1. "... the universe is spherical in form ... because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon, and the planets, appear in this form."
    —Nicolaus Copernicus, *The New Idea of the Universe*, 1514
    
    **Explanation:** This is an example of **division**, a fallacy in which an inference is mistakenly drawn from the attributes of a whole to the attributes of its parts. The argument assumes that because individual celestial bodies (sun, moon, planets) appear spherical, the entire universe must be spherical. However, this is a fallacy because the attributes of individual parts (spherical shape) do not necessarily apply to the whole (the universe).
    
    2. Robert Toombs is reputed to have said, just before the Civil War, "We could lick those Yankees with cornstalks." When he was asked after the war what had gone wrong, he is reputed to have said, "It's very simple. Those damn Yankees refused to fight with cornstalks."
    —E. J. Kahn, Jr., "Profiles (Georgia)," *The New Yorker*, 13 February 1978
    
    **Explanation:** This is an example of **ambiguity**, specifically a fallacy of equivocation. The word "cornstalks" is used in two different ways: initially, it refers to a weapon or method of warfare (a metaphorical term), and later, it is taken literally as the actual object (corn stalks). The change in meaning confuses the argument and leads to a false inference.
    
    3. To press forward with a properly ordered wage structure in each industry is the first condition for curbing competitive bargaining; but there is no reason why the process should stop there. What is good for each industry can hardly be bad for the economy as a whole.
    —Edmond Kelly, *Twentieth Century Socialism*, 1910
    
    **Explanation:** This is an example of **composition**, a fallacy in which an inference is mistakenly drawn from the attributes of the parts of a whole to the attributes of the whole itself. The argument assumes that what is beneficial for each individual industry must be beneficial for the economy as a whole. However, this is a fallacy because the attributes of individual parts (beneficial wage structures) do not necessarily apply to the whole (the economy).
    
    4. No man will take counsel, but every man will take money: therefore money is better than counsel.
    —Jonathan Swift
    
    **Explanation:** This is an example of **ambiguity**, specifically a fallacy of equivocation. The phrase "man" is used in two different ways: first, as a general statement about human behavior ("no man will take counsel"), and second, as a specific instance of a person ("every man will take money"). The change in meaning confuses the argument and leads to a false inference.

    10. The basis of logic is the syllogism, consisting of a major and a minor premise and a
    
    conclusion—thus:
    Major Premise: Sixty men can do a piece of work sixty times as quickly as one man;
    Minor Premise: One man can dig a post-hole in sixty seconds; therefore—
    Conclusion: Sixty men can dig a post-hole in one second.
    This may be called the syllogism arithmetical, in which, by combining logic and
    mathematics, we obtain a double certainty and are twice blessed.

    B. Each of the following passages may be plausibly criticized by some who conclude that
    it contains a fallacy, but each may be defended by some who deny that the argument
    is fallacious. Discuss the merits of the argument in each passage, and explain why you
    conclude that it does (or does not) contain a fallacy.

    Mr. Levy boasts many excellent bona fides for the job [of Chancellor of the New York City Public Schools].

I do not begrudge any parent the right to enroll a child in a private school. My wife and I considered several private schools before sending our children to a public school in Manhattan. Mr. Levy is essentially declaring the public schools unfit for his own children.

    **C. Identify and explain the fallacies of relevance or defective induction, or presumption, or ambiguity as they occur in the following passages. Explain why, in the case of some, it may be plausibly argued that what appears at first to be a fallacy is not, when the argument is interpreted correctly.**
    
    1. John Angus Smith, approaching an undercover agent, offered to trade his firearm, an automatic, for two ounces of cocaine that he planned to sell at a profit. Upon being asked whether he was willing to do so, he said yes.
    
    ---
    
    **Analysis:**
    
    This passage presents a situation where John Angus Smith is engaging in a transaction with an undercover agent. The key issue here is whether the statement "he said yes" constitutes a fallacy.
    
    At first glance, this might seem like an example of a **fallacy of relevance**, as the statement "he said yes" could be interpreted as a direct response to an implied question or request. However, in this context, the agent is not asking a direct question but rather making an offer. The fallacy might be a **presumption**, assuming that the agent's offer implies a question or request for which Smith is being asked to respond.
    
    However, when the argument is interpreted correctly, it becomes clear that there is no fallacy. Smith's statement "he said yes" is simply a factual account of his response to the agent's offer. There is no logical error in this statement, as it accurately reports what Smith did. Therefore, the apparent fallacy is not actually a fallacy when the context is properly understood.
    
    This example illustrates how **what appears at first to be a fallacy may not be one when the argument is interpreted correctly**, as the misunderstanding arises from assuming an implicit question where none exists.

    apprehended, Smith was charged with "using" a firearm "during and in relation to...  
    a drug trafficking crime." Ordinarily conviction under this statute would result in a  
    prison sentence of five years; however, if the firearm, as in this case, is "a machine gun  
    or other automatic weapon," the mandatory sentence is 30 years. Smith was convicted  
    and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
    
    Justice Antonin Scalia argued that, although Smith certainly did intend to trade his  
    gun for drugs, that was not the sense of "using" intended by the statute. "In the search  
    for statutory meaning we give nontechnical terms their ordinary meanings. . . to speak  
    of ‘using a firearm' is to speak of using it for its distinctive purpose, as a weapon." If asked  
    whether you use a cane, he pointed out, the question asks whether you walk with a cane,  
    not whether you display "your grandfather's silver-handled walking stick in the hall."
    
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retorted that we may do more than walk with a cane.  
    "The most infamous use of a cane in American history had nothing to do with walking  
    at all—the caning (in 1856) of Senator Charles Sumner in the United States Senate."
    
    Justice Scalia rejoined that the majority of the Court "does not appear to grasp the  
    distinction between how a word can be used and how it is ordinarily used. ... I think  
    it perfectly obvious, for example, that the falsity requirement for a perjury conviction  
    would not be satisfied if a witness answered ‘No' to a prosecutor's enquiry whether  
    he had ever ‘used a firearm' even though he had once sold his grandfather's Enfield  
    rifle to a collector."
    
    Justice O'Connor prevailed; Smith's conviction was affirmed.

    a number of speeches with a view to getting them into the press of the world. This
    is considered by some to be very clever politics. Others, among whom the present

    This reductio ad absurdum of the multiverse theory reveals what a very slippery
    slope it is indeed. Since Copernicus, our view of the universe has enlarged by a factor
    of a billion billion. The cosmic vista stretches one hundred billion trillion miles in

    When Copernicus argued that the Ptolemaic astronomy (holding that the celestial
    bodies all revolved around the Earth) should be replaced by a theory holding that the
    Earth (along with all the other planets) revolved around the sun, he was ridiculed by
    many of the scientists of his day, including one of the greatest astronomers of that
    time, Clavius, who wrote in 1581:
    
    Both [Copernicus and Ptolemy] are in agreement with the observed phenomena. But Copernicus's arguments
    contain a great many principles that are absurd. He assumed, for instance, that the earth is moving with a triple
    motion... [but] according to the philosophers a simple body like the earth can have only a simple motion....
    Therefore it seems to me that Ptolemy's geocentric doctrine must be preferred to Copernicus's doctrine.

    Summary
    
    A fallacy is a type of argument that may seem to be correct, but that proves on examination not to be
    so. In this chapter we have grouped the major informal fallacies under four headings: (1) fallacies of
    relevance, (2) fallacies of defective induction, (3) fallacies of presumption, and (4) fallacies of ambigu-
    ity. Within each group we have named, explained, and illustrated the most common kinds of reasoning
    mistakes.
    
    1. Fallacies of Relevance
  - |-
    Chapter 4: Fallacies
    
    R1. The appeal to the populace (ad populum): When correct reasoning is replaced by devices calculated
    to elicit emotional and nonrational support for the conclusion urged.
    
    R2. The appeal to emotion: When correct reasoning is replaced by appeals to specific emotions, such
    as pity, pride, or envy.
    
    R3. The red herring: When correct reasoning is manipulated by the introduction of some event or
    character that deliberately misleads the audience and thus hinders rational inference.
    
    R4. The straw man: When correct reasoning is undermined by the deliberate misrepresentation of the
    opponent's position.
    
    R5. The attack on the person (ad hominem): When correct reasoning about some issue is replaced by
    an attack upon the character or special circumstances of the opponent.
    
    R6. The appeal to force (ad baculum): When reasoning is replaced by threats in the effort to win sup-
    port or assent.
    
    R7. Missing the point (ignoratio elenchi): When correct reasoning is replaced by the mistaken refuta-
    tion of a position that was not really at issue.
    
    2. Fallacies of Defective Induction
    
    In fallacies of defective induction, the premises may be relevant to the conclusion, but they are far too
    weak to support the conclusion. Four major fallacies are as follows:
    
    D1. Appeal to ignorance (ad ignorantiam): When it is argued that a proposition is true on the ground
    that it has not been proved false, or when it is argued that a proposition is false because it has not
    been proved true.
    
    D2. Appeal to inappropriate authority (ad verecundiam): When the premises of an argument appeal
    to the judgment of some person or persons who have no legitimate claim to authority in the mat-
    ter at hand.
    
    D3. False cause (non causa pro causa): When one treats as the cause of a thing that which is not really
    the cause of that thing, often relying (as in the subtype post hoc ergo propter hoc) merely on the
    close temporal succession of two events.
    
    D4. Hasty generalization (converse accident): When one moves carelessly or too quickly from one or
    a very few instances to a broad or universal claim.

    In fallacies of presumption, the mistake in argument arises from relying on some proposition that is
    assumed to be true but is without warrant and is false or dubious. Three major fallacies are as follows:
    
    P1. Accident: When one mistakenly applies a generalization to an individual case that it does not
    properly govern.
    
    P2. Complex question (purium interrogationum): When one argues by asking a question in such a
    way as to presuppose the truth of some assumption buried in that question.
    
    P3. Begging the question (petitio principii): When one assumes in the premises of an argument the
    truth of what one seeks to establish in the conclusion of that same argument.
    
    4. Fallacies of Ambiguity
    
    In fallacies of ambiguity, the mistakes in argument arise as a result of the shift in the meaning of words
    or phrases, from the meanings that they have in the premises to different meanings that they have in
    the conclusion. Five major fallacies are as follows:
    
    A1. Equivocation: When the same word or phrase is used with two or more meanings, deliberately or
    accidentally, in formulating an argument.
    
    A2. Amphiboly: When one of the statements in an argument has more than one plausible meaning,
    because of the loose or awkward way in which the words in that statement have been combined.
    
    A3. Accent: When a shift of meaning arises within an argument as a consequence of changes in the
    emphasis given to its words or parts.
    
    A4. Composition: This fallacy is committed (a) when one reasons mistakenly from the attributes of a
    part to the attributes of the whole, or (b) when one reasons mistakenly from the attributes of an
    individual member of some collection to the attributes of the totality of that collection.
    
    A5. Division: This fallacy is committed (a) when one reasons mistakenly from the attributes of a whole to
    the attributes of one of its parts, or (b) when one reasons mistakenly from the attributes of a totality
    of some collection of entities to the attributes of the individual entities within that collection.

    How to Tell if He Likes You
  - |-
    Have you been wondering whether that special guy likes you back? Here are some ways to find out!
    
    . In a study, 90 percent of men said that they like most people. So, he probably likes you!
    
    . Ask your friends. If they think he likes you, he probably likes you!
    
    . Statistically speaking, women who purchase mixing bowls are more likely to be in committed relationships. So buy a mixing bowl right away!
    
    . Any boy who doesn't like you is obviously stupid.

    Capybara Controversy
    
    A hot new trend is capybara fur! Capybara vests and jackets have recently been seen on numerous C-list celebrities at events where free fur vests are given away.
    
    What is a capybara? Dr. M. Hoffenstephen of the University of Nova Scotia explains, "A capybara is an animal that has qualities particular to the species Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris (i.e., the capybara)."
    
    However, not everyone's hip to capybara fur. Martha Cupfeld, of People for the Moral Treatment of Mammals, commented, "If we accept the making of vests from capybaras, it's one small step on the path towards making vests from hirsute human beings."
    
    Reality star Whitney Hudson, winner of this season's Design It or Die!, commented,
    
    "Capybara fur is what everyone is wearing. If your clothes are made of regular fabric, you're totally being left behind. Gross."

    It's this!
    
    Baby for Jen?
    
    Jennifer Amberton was spotted wearing a big shirt! Superfashionality waited outside her house with a camera pointed at her front door for eighteen hours. When she came out, we shouted, "Jen, are you going to name your baby Beryl, after your mother?"
  - |-
    Before entering a chauffeur-driven
    black car and slamming the door behind
    her, she replied, "My mother's name is
    Susan, idiots."
    
    There you have it! If she didn't deny
    that there's a baby on board, she must be
    pregnant! Keep reading Superfashionality to

The question contained two presuppositions, that Jennifer is pregnant and that her mother's name is Beryl.

    C. This is the Fallacy of Composition:
    Just because we love leather and socks
    individually does not mean we will
    like them together. (The same could
    be said of ketchup and ice cream and
    other questionable combinations of
    individually popular items.)
    
    C. The argument "self-esteem will
    make people like you and you can
    get self-esteem by getting people to
    like you" is circular (see discussion of
    circular definitions on p. 127).
    
    D. Dr. M. Hoffenstephen essentially
    defines a capybara as that which has
    
    End Notes
    
    10.
    
    the characteristics of a capybara—
    that's not much of a definition at all.
    B. An ostensive definition is one
    which "points" at an example of the
    definiendum.
    
    A. This is also called the "Bandwagon"
    fallacy. As in, "Hop on this
    bandwagon—it's taking us to the fur
    store at the mall! Everybody's doing it!"
    B. Believe it or not, the name of that
    fallacy is "The Negative Pregnant." It
    was this fairly incredible name that
    inspired this entire fashion magazine-
    based exercise. Of course, the Negative
    Pregnant need not only be about preg-
    nancy; for instance, if someone asks,
    "Did you fail to do your homework
    because you were robbing a bank?"
    and you say, "I did my homework,"
    the (fallacious) implication is that
    you robbed a bank.
    
    C. Rather than arguing against those
    who say that a particular movie was
    too violent, Buck argues against a
    Straw Man: the simplistic argument
    that all violence is wrong.
    
    B. Donatella has moved from defining
    the items she makes as handbags to
    defining them in increasingly broad
    ways: finally, anything with an inside
    and an outside. This is decreasing in
    intension (see p. 82).
    
    A. Rather than tell us why Lady
    Cha-Cha's flag underpants must be
    outlawed, Colbare attempts to distract
    us by pointing out the terrible poverty
    of people who cannot afford to express
    their patriotism. Sad, but quite irrele-
    vant to a flag-underpants amendment.

    & The Theory of Deduction
    
    We turn now to the analysis of the structure of arguments. Preceding chapters have dealt
    mainly with the language in which arguments are formulated. In this and succeeding
    chapters we explore and explain the relations between the premises of an argument and
    its conclusion.
    
    All of Part II of this book is devoted to deductive arguments. A deductive argu-
    ment is one whose premises are claimed to provide conclusive grounds for the truth of
    its conclusion. If that claim is correct—that is, if the premises of the argument really
    do assure the truth of its conclusion with necessity—that deductive argument is valid.
    Every deductive argument either does what it claims, or it does not; therefore, every
    deductive argument is either valid or invalid. If it is valid, it is impossible for its premises
    to be true without its conclusion also being true.
    
    The theory of deduction aims to explain the relations of premises and conclusion
    in valid arguments. It also aims to provide techniques for the appraisal of deductive
    arguments—that is, for discriminating between valid and invalid arguments. To accom-
    plish this, two large bodies of theory have been developed. The first is called Aristotelian
    Syllogistic logic, after the Greek philosopher who initiated this study. The second is
    called modern symbolic logic, developed mainly during the nineteenth and twentieth
    centuries. Aristotelian Syllogistic logic is the topic of this and the following two chapters
    (Chapters 5, 6, and 7); modern symbolic logic is the topic of Chapters 8, 9, and 10.
  - |-
    Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was one of the towering intellects of the ancient world. After studying for twenty years in Plato's Academy, he became tutor to Alexander the Great; later he founded his own school, the Lyceum, where he contributed substantially to nearly every field of human knowledge. His great treatises on reasoning were collected after his death and came to be called the Organon, meaning literally the "instrument," the fundamental tool of knowledge.
    
    The word logic did not acquire its modern meaning until the second century CE, but the subject matter of logic was long understood to be the matters treated in Aristotle's seminal Organon. Aristotelian logic has been the foundation of rational analysis for thousands of years. Over the course of those centuries it has been very greatly refined: its notation has been much improved, its principles have been carefully formulated, its intricate structure has been completed. This great system of logic, set forth in this and the next two chapters, remains an intellectual tool of enormous power, as beautiful as it is penetrating.
    
    5.2 Classes and Categorical Propositions
    
    Aristotelian Syllogistic logic deals mainly with arguments based on the relations of classes of objects to one another. By a class we mean a collection of all objects that have some specified characteristic in common. (The concept of classes was introduced briefly in Chapter 3, in explaining definitions based on the intension of terms.) Everyone can see immediately that two classes can be related in at least the following three ways:
    
    1. All of one class may be included in all of another class. Thus the class of all dogs is wholly included (or wholly contained) in the class of all mammals.
    
    2. Some, but not all, of the members of one class may be included in another class. Thus the class of all athletes is partially included (or partially contained) in the class of all females.
    
    3. Two classes may have no members in common. Thus the class of all triangles and the class of all circles may be said to exclude one another.

    These three relations may be applied to classes, or categories, of every sort. In a
    deductive argument we present propositions that state the relations between one cat-
    egory and some other category. The propositions with which such arguments are for-
    mulated are therefore called categorical propositions. Categorical propositions are
    the fundamental elements, the building blocks of argument, in the classical account of
    deductive logic. Consider the argument
    
    No athletes are vegetarians.
    All football players are athletes.
    Therefore no football players are vegetarians.
    
    This argument contains three categorical propositions. We may dispute the truth of its
    premises, of course, but the relations of the classes expressed in these propositions yield
    an argument that is certainly valid: If those premises are true, that conclusion must be
    true. It is plain that each of the premises is indeed categorical; that is, each premise affirms,
    or denies, that some class S is included in some other class P, in whole or in part. In this illus-
    trative argument the three categorical propositions are about the class of all athletes, the
    class of all vegetarians, and the class of the class of all football players.
    
    The critical first step in developing a theory of deduction based on classes, therefore,
    is to identify the kinds of categorical propositions and to explore the relations among
    them.

    & The Four Kinds of Categorical Propositions
    
    There are four and only four kinds of standard-form categorical propositions. Here
    are examples of each of the four kinds:
    
    All politicians are liars.
    
    No politicians are liars.
    
    Some politicians are liars.
    Some politicians are not liars.
    
    We will examine each of these kinds in turn.
    
    Universal affirmative propositions. In these we assert that the whole of one
    class is included or contained in another class. "All politicians are liars" is an example;
    it asserts that every member of one class, the class of politicians, is a member of
    another class, the class of liars. Any universal affirmative proposition can be written
    schematically as
    
    All S is P.
    
    where the letters S and P represent the subject and predicate terms, respectively.
    Such a proposition affirms that the relation of class inclusion holds between the two
    classes and says that the inclusion is complete, or universal. All members of S are
    said to be also members of P. Propositions in this standard form are called universal
    affirmative propositions. They are also called A propositions.
    
    Categorical propositions are often represented with diagrams, using two interlock-
    ing circles to stand for the two classes involved. These are called Venn diagrams,
    named after the English logician and mathematician, John Venn (1834-1923), who
    invented them. Later we will explore these diagrams more fully, and we will find
    that such diagrams are exceedingly helpful in appraising the validity of deductive
    arguments. For the present we use these diagrams only to exhibit graphically the
    sense of each categorical proposition.
    
    We label one circle S, for "subject class," and the other circle P, for "predicate
    class." The diagram for the A proposition, which asserts that all S is P, shows that
    portion of S which is outside of P shaded out, indicating that there are no members
    of S that are not members of P. So the A proposition is diagrammed thus:
    
    P
    
    All S is P.
  - |-
    Universal negative propositions. The second example above, "No politicians are liars," is a proposition in which it is denied, universally, that any member of the class of politicians is a member of the class of liars. It asserts that the subject class, S, is wholly excluded from the predicate class, P. Schematically, categorical propositions of this kind can be written as
    
    No S is P.
    5.3. The Four Kinds of Categorical Propositions
    
    where again S and P represent the subject and predicate terms. This kind of proposition denies the relation of inclusion between the two terms, and denies it universally. It tells us that no members of S are members of P. Propositions in this standard form are called universal negative propositions. They are also called E propositions.
    
    The diagram for the E proposition will exhibit this mutual exclusion by having the overlapping portion of the two circles representing the classes S and P shaded out. So the E proposition is diagrammed thus:
    
    S P
    
    No S is P.
    
    Particular affirmative propositions. The third example above, "Some politicians are liars," affirms that some members of the class of all politicians are members of the class of all liars. But it does not affirm this of politicians universally. Only some particular politician or politicians are said to be liars. This proposition does not affirm or deny anything about the class of all politicians; it makes no pronouncements about that entire class. Nor does it say that some politicians are not liars, although in some contexts it may be taken to suggest that. The literal and exact interpretation of this proposition is the assertion that the class of politicians and the class of liars have some member or members in common. That is what we understand this standard-form proposition to mean.
    
    "Some" is an indefinite term. Does it mean "at least one," "at least two," or "at least several"? How many does it mean? Context might affect our understanding of the term as it is used in everyday speech, but logicians, for the sake of definiteness, interpret "some" to mean "at least one." A particular affirmative proposition may be written schematically as
    
    Some S is P.

    which says that at least one member of the class designated by the subject term S
    is also a member of the class designated by the predicate term P. The proposition
    affirms that the relation of class inclusion holds, but does not affirm it of the first
    class universally—it affirms it only partially; that is, it is affirmed of some particular
    member, or members, of the first class. Propositions in this standard form are called
    particular affirmative propositions. They are also called I propositions.
    
    The diagram for the I proposition indicates that there is at least one member of
    S that is also a member of P by placing an x in the region in which the two circles
    overlap. So the I proposition is diagrammed thus:
    
    S P
    
    Some S is P.
    
    chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
    
    4. Particular negative propositions. The fourth example above, "Some politicians
    are not liars," like the third, does not refer to politicians universally, but only to some
    member or members of that class; it is particular. Unlike the third example, however,
    it does not affirm the inclusion of some member or members of the first class in the
    second class; this is precisely what is denied. It is written schematically as
    
    Some S is not P.
    
    which says that at least one member of the class designated by the subject term
    S is excluded from the whole of the class designated by the predicate term P. The
    denial is not universal. Propositions in this standard form are called particular nega-
    tive propositions. They are also called O propositions.
    
    The diagram for the O proposition indicates that there is at least one member of
    S that is not a member of P by placing an x in the region of S that is outside of P.
    So the O proposition is diagrammed thus:
    
    S P
    
    Some Sis not P.
  - |-
    The examples we have used in this section employ classes that are simply named:
    politicians, liars, vegetarians, athletes, and so on. But subject and predicate terms in
    standard-form propositions can be more complicated. Thus, for example, the proposi-
    tion "All candidates for the position are persons of honor and integrity" has the phrase
    "candidates for the position" as its subject term and the phrase "persons of honor and
    integrity" as its predicate term. Subject and predicate terms can become more intricate
    still, but in each of the four standard forms a relation is expressed between a subject class
    and a predicate class. These four—A, E, I, and O propositions—are the building blocks
    of deductive arguments.
    
    This analysis of categorical propositions appears to be simple and straightforward,
    but the discovery of the fundamental role of these propositions, and the exhibition of
    their relations to one another, was a great step in the systematic development of logic.
    It was one of Aristotle's permanent contributions to human knowledge. Its apparent
    simplicity is deceptive. On this foundation—classes of objects and the relations among
    those classes—logicians have erected, over the course of centuries, a highly sophisticated
    system for the analysis of deductive argument. This system, whose subtlety and penetra-
    tion mark it as one of the greatest of intellectual achievements, we now explore in the
    following three steps:
    
    A. In the remainder of this chapter we will examine the features of standard-form cat-
    egorical propositions more deeply, explaining their relations to one another, and
    what inferences may be drawn directly from these categorical propositions. Much
    of deductive reasoning can be mastered with no more than a thorough grasp of
    A, E, I, and O propositions and their interconnections.
    
    B. The next chapter will examine syllogisms, the arguments that are commonly
    constructed using standard-form categorical propositions. We will there explore
    the nature of syllogisms, and show that every valid syllogistic form is uniquely
    characterized and is therefore given its own name. We will then develop powerful
    techniques for determining the validity (or invalidity) of syllogisms.

    class designated by its

    quantity.

    Any form of the verb

    & Quality, Quantity, and Distribution
    
    A. Quality
    
    Every standard-form categorical proposition either affirms, or denies, some class rela-
    tion, as we have seen. If the proposition affirms some class inclusion, whether complete
    or partial, its quality is affirmative. So the A proposition, "All S is P," and the I propo-
    sition, "Some S is P," are both affirmative in quality. Their letter names, A and I, are
    thought to come from the Latin word, "AffIrmo," meaning "I affirm." If the proposi-
    tion denies class inclusion, whether complete or partial, its quality is negative. So the E
    proposition, "No S is P," and the O proposition, "Some S is not P," are both negative in
    quality. Their letter names, E and O, are thought to come from the Latin word, "nEgO,"
    meaning "I deny." Every categorical proposition has one quality or the other, affirma-
    tive or negative.
    
    B. Quantity
    
    Every standard-form categorical proposition has some class as its subject. If the proposi-
    tion refers to all members of the class designated by its subject term, its quantity is
    universal. So the A proposition, "All S is P," and the E proposition, "No S is P," are both
    universal in quantity. If the proposition refers only to some members of the class desig-
    nated by its subject term, its quantity is particular. So the I proposition, "Some S is P,"
    and the O proposition, "Some S is not P," are both particular in quantity.
  - |-
    The quantity of a standard-form categorical proposition is revealed by the word with which it begins—"all," "no," or "some." "All" and "no" indicate that the proposition is universal; "some" indicates that the proposition is particular. The word "no" serves also, in the case of the E proposition, to indicate its negative quality, as we have seen.
    
    Because every standard-form categorical proposition must be either affirmative or negative, and must be either universal or particular, the four names uniquely describe each one of the four standard forms by indicating its quantity and its quality: universal affirmative (A), particular affirmative (I), universal negative (E), particular negative (O).
    
    C. General Schema of Standard-Form Categorical Propositions
    
    Between the subject and predicate terms of every standard-form categorical proposition occurs some form of the verb "to be." This verb (accompanied by "not" in the case of the O proposition) serves to connect the subject and predicate terms and is called the copula. Writing the four propositions schematically, as we did earlier (All S is P, Some S is P, etc.), only the words "is" and "is not" appear; but (depending on context) other forms of the verb "to be" may be appropriate. We may change the tense (for example, "Some Roman emperors were monsters" or "Some soldiers will not be heroes"), or change to the plural form of the verb (for example, "All squares are rectangles"). In these exam-
    ples, "were," "are," and "will not be" serve as copulas. However, the general skeleton of a standard-form categorical proposition always consists of just four parts: first the quanti-
    fier, then the subject term, next the copula, and finally the predicate term. The schema
    may be written as
    
    Quantifier (subject term) copula (predicate term).
    
    5.4 Quality, Quantity, and Distribution
    
    D. Distribution
  - |-
    Categorical propositions are regarded as being about classes, the classes of objects des-
    ignated by the subject and predicate terms. We have seen that a proposition may refer
    to classes in different ways; it may refer to all members of a class or refer to only some
    members of that class. Thus the proposition, "All senators are citizens," refers to, or is
    about, all senators, but it does not refer to all citizens. That proposition does not affirm
    that every citizen is a senator, but it does not deny it either. Every A proposition is thus
    seen to refer to all members of the class designated by its subject term, S, but does not
    refer to all members of the class designated by its predicate term, P.
    To characterize the ways in which terms can occur in categorical propositions, we
    introduce the technical term distribution. A proposition distributes a term if it refers to all members of the class designated by that term. In A, E, I, and O propositions, the terms that are distributed vary, as follows: 
    
    Relationship between a
    categorical proposition
    whether or not the
    proposition makes a
    statement about a given
    term.
    
    In the A proposition (e.g., "All senators are citizens"): In this proposition, "senators" is distributed, but "citizens" is not. In A propositions (universal affirma- tives) the subject term is distributed, but the predicate term is undistributed. 
    
    In the E proposition (e.g., "No athletes are vegetarians"): The subject term, "athletes," is distributed, because the whole class of athletes is said to be excluded from the class of vegetarians. However, in asserting that the whole class of athletes is excluded from the class of vegetarians, it is also asserted that the whole class of vegetarians is excluded from the class of athletes. Of each and every vegetarian, the proposition says that he or she is not an athlete. Unlike an A proposition, therefore, an E proposition refers to all members of the class designated by its predicate term, and therefore also distributes its predicate term. E propositions (universal negatives) distribute both their subject and their predicate terms.
    
    In the I proposition (e.g., "Some soldiers are cowards"): No assertion is made
  - |-

    about all soldiers in this proposition, and no assertion is made about all cowards
    either. It says nothing about each and every soldier, and nothing about each and
    every coward. Neither class is wholly included, or wholly excluded, from the other.
    In I propositions (particular affirmatives) both subject and predicate terms are
    undistributed.
    In the O proposition (e.g., "Some horses are not thoroughbreds"): Nothing
    is said about all horses. The proposition refers to some members of the class des-
    ignated by the subject term: it says, of this part of the class of horses, that it is
    excluded from the class of all thoroughbreds. But they are excluded from the whole
    of the latter class. Given the particular horses referred to, the proposition says that
    each and every member of the class of thoroughbreds is not one of those particular
    horses. When something is said to be excluded from a class, the whole of the class
    is referred to, just as, when a person is excluded from a country, all parts of that
    country are forbidden to that person. In O propositions (particular negatives) the
    subject term is not distributed, but the predicate term is distributed.
    
    We thus see that universal propositions, both affirmative and negative, distribute
    their subject terms, whereas particular propositions, whether affirmative or negative,
    do not distribute their subject terms. Thus the quantity of any standard-form categori-
    cal proposition determines whether its subject term is distributed or undistributed. We
     chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
    
    likewise see that affirmative propositions, whether universal or particular, do not distrib-
    ute their predicate terms, whereas negative propositions, both universal and particular,
    do distribute their predicate terms. Thus the quality of a standard-form categorical propo-
    sition determines whether its predicate term is distributed or undistributed.
    
    In summary: the A proposition distributes only its subject term; the E proposition
    distributes both its subject and predicate terms; the I proposition distributes neither its
    subject nor its predicate term; and the O proposition distributes only its predicate term.
    
    Which terms are distributed by which standard-form categorical propositions will
    become very important when we turn to the evaluation of syllogisms. The following
    diagram presents all these distributions graphically and may be useful in helping you to
    remember which propositions distribute which of their terms:

    The A proposition: All bananas are fruits  
    
    This A proposition asserts that every member of the class of bananas (the subject class) is also a member  
    of the class of fruits (the predicate class). When a term refers to every member of a class, we say that the  
    term is distributed. In an A proposition, the subject term is always distributed. But the A proposition does  
    not refer to every member of the predicate class; this example does not assert that all fruits are bananas; it  
    says nothing about every fruit. In an A proposition, the predicate term is not distributed.

    The E proposition: No bananas are fruits  
    
    This E proposition asserts that every member of the class of bananas is outside the class of fruits. The subject  
    term, "bananas," is plainly distributed. Because bananas are excluded from the entire class of fruits, this  
    proposition refers to every member of the predicate class as well, because it plainly says that no fruit is a  
    banana. In an E proposition, both the subject term and the predicate term are distributed.  
    
    Note that the concept of distribution has nothing to do with truth or falsity. This example proposi-  
    tion is certainly false—but, as in every E proposition, both of its terms are distributed.

    The word "some" in this I proposition tells us that at least one member of the class designated by the  
    subject term, "bananas," is also a member of the class designated by the predicate term, "fruits"—but this  
    proposition makes no claim about the subject class as a whole. Therefore, in this proposition, as in every  
    I proposition, the subject term is not distributed. Nor does this proposition say anything about every  
    member of the class of fruits (we are told only that there is at least one member of the class of bananas)

    The word "some" again tells us that this proposition is not about all members of the class of bananas;
    the subject term is therefore not distributed. Because we are told, in this proposition, that some bananas
    are not fruits, we are told something about the entire predicate class—namely, that the entire class of
    fruits does not have one of those subject bananas among them. In an O proposition, the predicate term is
    distributed but the subject term is not distributed.

    5.5 The Traditional Square of Opposition
    
    The preceding analysis of categorical propositions enables us to exhibit the relations
    among those propositions, which in turn provide solid grounds for a great deal of the
    reasoning we do in everyday life. We need one more technical term: opposition. Standard-
    form categorical propositions having the same subject terms and the same predicate
    terms may (obviously) differ from each other in quality, or in quantity, or in both. Any
    such kind of differing has been traditionally called opposition. This term is used even
    when there is no apparent disagreement between the propositions. The various kinds of
    opposition are correlated with some very important truth relations, as follows:
    
    A. Contradictories
    
    Two propositions are contradictories if one is the denial or negation of the other—that
    is, if they cannot both be true and cannot both be false. Two standard-form categorical
    propositions that have the same subject and predicate terms but differ from each other
    in both quantity and quality are contradictories.
    
    Thus the A proposition, "All judges are lawyers," and the O proposition, "Some
    judges are not lawyers," are clearly contradictories. They are opposed in both quality
    (one affirms, the other denies) and quantity (one refers to all, and the other to some).
    Of the pair, exactly one is true and exactly one is false. They cannot both be true; they
    cannot both be false.
    
    Similarly, the E proposition, "No politicians are idealists," and the I proposition,
    "Some politicians are idealists," are opposed in both quantity and quality, and they too
    are contradictories.
    
    In summary: A and O propositions are contradictories ("All S is P" is contradicted
    by "Some S is not P"). E and I propositions are also contradictories ("No S is P" is con-
    tradicted by "Some S is P").
    
    B. Contraries
  - |-
    Two propositions are said to be contraries if they cannot both be true—that is, if the truth of one entails the falsity of the other—but both can be false. Thus, "Texas will win the coming game with Oklahoma," and "Oklahoma will win the coming game with Texas," are contraries. If either of these propositions (referring to the same game, of course) is true, then the other must be false. But these two propositions are not contradictories, because the game could be a draw and then both would be false. Contraries cannot both be true, but, unlike contradictories, they can both be false.
    
    The traditional account of categorical propositions held that universal propositions (A and E) having the same subject and predicate terms but differing in quality (one affirming, the other denying) were contraries. Thus it was said that an A proposition, "All poets are dreamers," and its corresponding E proposition, "No poets are dreamers," cannot both be true—but they can both be false and may be regarded as contraries. This Aristotelian interpretation has some troubling consequences that will be discussed in Section 5.7.
    
    One difficulty with this Aristotelian account arises if either the A proposition or the E proposition is necessarily true—that is, if either is a logical or mathematical truth, such as "All squares are rectangles," or "No squares are circles." In such a case, the claim that the A proposition and the E proposition are contraries cannot be correct, because a necessarily true proposition cannot possibly be false and so cannot have a contrary, because two propositions can only be contraries if they can both be false. Propositions that are neither necessarily true nor necessarily false are said to be contingent. So the reply to this difficulty is that the present interpretation assumes (not unreasonably) that the propositions in question are contingent, in which case the claim that A and E propositions having the same subject and predicate terms are contraries may be correct.
    
    Opposition
    
    The logical relation
    that exists between
    two contradictories,
    between two contraries,
    or in general between
    any two categorical

    in quantity, quality, or
    other respects. These
    relations are displayed
    on the square of
    opposition.

    Contradictories  
    Two propositions so related that one is the denial or negation of the other. On the traditional square of opposition, the two pairs of contradictories are indicated by the diagonals of the square: A and E propositions are the contradictories of O and I, respectively.

In this relation, the particular proposition (I or O) is called the "subaltern," and the universal proposition (A or E) is called the "superaltern."
    
    Square of opposition  
    A diagram in the form of a square in which the four types of categorical propositions (A, E, I, and O) are situated at the corners, exhibiting the logical relations (called "oppositions") among these propositions.
    
    For the remainder of this chapter, we therefore make the assumption that the propositions involved are contingent.
    
    C. Subcontraries  
    Two propositions are said to be subcontraries if they cannot both be false, although they may both be true.
    
    The traditional account held that particular propositions (I and O) having the same subject and predicate terms but differing in quality (one affirming, the other denying) are subcontraries. It was said that the I proposition, "Some diamonds are precious stones," and the O proposition, "Some diamonds are not precious stones," could both be true—but they could not both be false and therefore must be regarded as subcontraries.
  - |-
    A difficulty similar to the one noted above arises here too. If either the I or the O proposition is necessarily false (for example, "Some squares are circles" or "Some squares are not rectangles"), it cannot have a subcontrary, because two propositions that are subcontraries can both be true. But if both the I and the O are contingent propositions, they can both be true, and as we noted in connection with contraries just above, we shall assume for the remainder of this chapter that they are contingent.
    
    D. Subalternation
    
    When two propositions have the same subject and the same predicate terms, and agree in quality (both affirming or both denying) but differ in quantity (one universal, the other particular), they are called corresponding propositions. This is also a form of "oppo-
    sition" as that term has traditionally been used. Thus the A proposition, "All spiders are eight-legged animals," has a corresponding I proposition, "Some spiders are eight-
    legged animals." Likewise, the E proposition, "No whales are fishes," has a corresponding
    O proposition, "Some whales are not fishes." This opposition between a universal propo-
    sition and its corresponding particular proposition is known as subalternation. In any
    such pair of corresponding propositions, the universal proposition is called the super-
    altern, and the particular is called the subaltern.
    
    In subalternation (in the classical analysis), the superaltern implies the truth of the
    subaltern. Thus, from the universal affirmative, "All birds have feathers," the correspond-
    ing particular affirmative, "Some birds have feathers," was held to follow. From the
    universal negative, "No whales are fishes," the corresponding particular, "Some whales
    are not fishes," was likewise held to follow. But of course the implication does not hold
    from the particular to the universal, from the subaltern to the superaltern. From the
    proposition, "Some animals are cats," it is obvious that we cannot infer that "All animals
    are cats." And it would be absurd to infer from "Some animals are not cats" that "No
    animals are cats."

    There are thus four ways in which propositions may be "opposed"—as contradictories, con-
    traries, subcontraries, and as sub- and superalterns. These are represented using an impor-
    tant and widely used diagram called the square of opposition, which is reproduced
    as Figure 5-1.

    Relations exhibited by this square of opposition were believed to provide the logical
    basis for validating certain elementary forms of argument. To explain these, we must first
    distinguish between immediate inferences and mediate inferences.
    
    When we draw a conclusion from one or more premises, some inference must be
    involved. That inference is said to be mediate when more than one premise is relied
    on—as is the case with syllogisms, where the conclusion is drawn from the first premise
    through the mediation of the second. However, when a conclusion is drawn from only
    one premise there is no such mediation, and the inference is said to be immediate.
    
    A number of very useful immediate inferences may be readily drawn from the infor-
    mation embedded in the traditional square of opposition. Here are some examples:
    
    ° If an A proposition is the premise, then (according to the square of opposition) one
    can validly infer that the corresponding O proposition (that is, the O proposition
    with the same subject and predicate terms) is false.
    
    ° If an A proposition is the premise, then the corresponding I proposition is true.
    
    ° If an I proposition is the premise, its corresponding E proposition, which contra-
    dicts it, must be false.

    Given the truth, or the falsehood, of any one of the four standard-form categorical
    propositions, the truth or falsehood of some or all of the others can be inferred immedi-
    ately. A considerable number of immediate inferences are based on the traditional square
    of opposition; we list them here:
    
    E is false; I is true; O is false.
    
    A is false; I is false; O is true.
    
    E is false; A and O are undetermined.
    A is false; E and I are undetermined.
    
    O is true; E and I are undetermined.
    
    I is true; A and O are undetermined.
    
    A is given as true:
    E is given as true:
    I is given as true:
    O is given as true:
    A is given as false:
    E is given as false:
    I is given as false:
    O is given as false:
    
    * A proposition is undetermined if its truth or falsity is not determined—fixed—by the truth or falsity of any other
    proposition. In another sense, a proposition is undetermined if one does not know that it is true and one also does
    not know that it is false. If it is given that an A proposition is undetermined, in either sense, we may infer that its
    contradictory O proposition must be undetermined in that same sense. For if that O proposition were known to be
    true, the A proposition contradicting it would be known to be false; and if that O proposition were known to be false,
    the A proposition contradicting it would be known to be true. The same reasoning applies to the other standard-form
    propositions. If any of the four categorical propositions is given as undetermined in either sense, its contradictory must
    be undetermined in the same sense.

    types of propositions. To
    form the converse of a
    proposition the subject
    and predicate terms are
    simply interchanged.
    Thus, applied to the
    proposition "No circles
    are squares," conversion
    yields "No squares
    
    are circles," which is
    called the "converse"
    of the original
    proposition. The original
    proposition is called the
    "convertend."

    5.6 | Further Immediate Inferences
    
    There are three other important kinds of immediate inference: conversion, obversion, and
    contraposition. These are not associated directly with the square of opposition. Each is
    explained below:
    
    A. Conversion
  - |-

    Conversion is an inference that proceeds by interchanging the subject and predicate terms of a proposition. "No men are angels" converts to "No angels are men," and these propositions may be validly inferred from one another. Similarly, "Some women are writers" and "Some writers are women" are logically equivalent, and by conversion either can be validly inferred from the other. Conversion is perfectly valid for all E propositions and for all I propositions. One standard-form categorical proposition is said to be the converse of another when we derive it by simply interchanging the subject and predicate terms of that other proposition. The proposition from which it is derived is called the convertend. Thus, "No idealists are politicians" is the converse of "No politicians are idealists," which is its convertend.
    
    The conversion of an O proposition is not valid. The O proposition, "Some animals are not dogs," is plainly true; its converse is the proposition, "Some dogs are not animals," which is plainly false. An O proposition and its converse are not logically equivalent.
    
    5.6 Further Immediate Inferences
    
    The A proposition presents a special problem here. Of course, the converse of an A proposition does not follow from its convertend. From "All dogs are animals" we certainly may not infer that "All animals are dogs." Traditional logic recognized this, of course, but asserted, nevertheless, that something like conversion was valid for A propositions. On the traditional square of opposition, one could validly infer from the A proposition, "All dogs are animals," its subaltern I proposition, "Some dogs are animals." The A proposition says something about all members of the subject class (dogs); the I proposition makes a more limited claim, about only some of the members of that class. It was held that one could infer "Some S is P" from "All S is P." And, as we saw earlier, an I proposition may be converted validly; if some dogs are animals, then some animals are dogs.
  - |-
    So, if we are given the A proposition, "All dogs are animals," we first infer that "Some
    dogs are animals" by subalternation, and from that subaltern we can by conversion val-
    idly infer that "Some animals are dogs." Hence, by a combination of subalternation and
    conversion, we advance validly from "All S is P" to "Some P is S." This pattern of infer-
    ence, called conversion by limitation (or conversion per accidens), proceeds by interchanging
    subject and predicate terms and changing the quantity of the proposition from universal
    to particular. This type of conversion will be considered further in the next section.
    
    In all conversions, the converse of a given proposition contains exactly the same
    subject and predicate terms as the convertend, their order being reversed, and always
    has the same quality (of affirmation or denial). A complete picture of this immediate
    inference as traditionally understood is given by the following table:
    
    Valid Conversions
    
    Convertend Converse
    
    A: All S is P. I: Some P is S. (by limitation)
    E: No S is P. E: No Pis S.
    
    I: Some S is P. I: Some Pis S.
    
    O: Some S is not P. (conversion not valid)
    
    B. Classes and Class Complements
    
    To explain other types of immediate inference we must examine more closely the con-
    cept of a "class" and explain what is meant by the complement of a class. Any class, we
    have said, is the collection of all objects that have a certain common attribute, which we
    may refer to as the "class-defining characteristic." The class of all humans is the collection
    of all things that have the characteristic of being human; its class-defining characteristic
    is the attribute of being human. The class-defining characteristic need not be a "simple"
    attribute; any attribute may determine a class. For example, the complex attribute of
    being left-handed and red-headed and a student determines a class—the class of all left-
    handed, red-headed students. Complement, or
    Every class has, associated with it, a complementary class, or complement, complementary
    which is the collection of all things that do not belong to the original class. The com-
    plement of the class of all people is the class of all things that are not people. The class- The collection of al

    things that do not
    defining characteristic of that complementary class is the (negative) attribute of not _ belong toa given class.
    
    chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
    
    Obversion
    
    A valid form of
    immediate inference
    for every standard-
    form categorical
    proposition. To obvert
    a proposition we
    change its quality (from
    affirmative to negative,
    or from negative to
    affirmative) and replace
    the predicate term
    with its complement.
    Thus, applied to
    
    the proposition "All
    dogs are mammals,"
    obversion yields "No
    
    dogs are nonmammals,"
    
    which is called the
    "obverse" of the
    original proposition. The
    original proposition is
    called the "obvertend."
    
    being a person. The complement of the class of all people contains no people, but it
    contains everything else: shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages—but no kings,
    because kings are people. It is often convenient to speak of the complement of the class
    of all persons as the "class of all nonpersons." The complement of the class designated
    by the term S is then designated by the term non-S; we may speak of the term non-S as
    being the complement of the term S. Sometimes in reasoning one uses what is called
    the relative complement of a class, its complement within some other class. For example,
    within the class of "children of mine," there is a subclass, "daughters of mine," whose
    relative complement is another subclass, "children of mine who are not daughters," or
    "sons of mine." But obversions, and other immediate inferences, rely on the absolute
    complement of classes, as defined above.
    
    The word complement is thus used in two senses. In one sense it is the complement of
    a class; in the other it is the complement of a term. These are different but very closely
    connected. One term is the (term) complement of another just in case the first term des-
    ignates the (class) complement of the class designated by the second term.
  - |-
    Note that a class is the (class) complement of its own complement. Likewise, a term  
    is the (term) complement of its own complement. A sort of "double negative" rule is  
    involved here, to avoid strings of "non's" prefixed to a term. Thus, the complement of  
    the term "voter" is "nonvoter," but the complement of "nonvoter" should be written  
    simply as "voter" rather than as "nonnonvoter."
    
    One must be careful not to mistake contrary terms for complementary terms.  
    "Coward" and "hero" are contraries, because no person can be both a coward and a hero.  
    We must not identify "cowards" with "nonheroes" because not everyone, and certainly  
    not everything, need be one or the other. Likewise, the complement of the term "winner"  
    is not "loser" but "nonwinner," for although not everything, or even everyone, is either  
    a winner or a loser, absolutely everything is either a winner or a nonwinner.
    
    C. Obversion
    
    Obversion is an immediate inference that is easy to explain once the concept of a term  
    complement is understood. To obvert a proposition, we change its quality (affirmative  
    to negative or negative to affirmative) and replace the predicate term with its comple-  
    ment. However, the subject term remains unchanged, and so does the quantity of the  
    proposition being obverted. For example, the A proposition, "All residents are voters,"  
    has as its obverse the E proposition, "No residents are nonvoters." These two are logically  
    equivalent propositions, and either may be validly inferred from the other.
    
    Obversion is a valid immediate inference when applied to any standard-form cat-  
    egorical proposition:
    
    e The E proposition, "No umpires are partisans," has as its obverse the logically equiv-  
    alent A proposition, "All umpires are nonpartisans."
    
    e The I proposition, "Some metals are conductors," has as its obverse the O proposi-  
    tion, "Some metals are not nonconductors."
    The O proposition, "Some nations were not belligerents," has as its obverse the  
    I proposition, "Some nations were nonbelligerents."
  - |-
    The proposition serving as premise for the obversion is called the obvertend; the conclusion of the inference is called the obverse. Every standard-form categorical proposition  
    5.6 Further Immediate Inferences  
    
    is logically equivalent to its obverse, so obversion is a valid form of immediate inference for all standard-form categorical propositions. To obtain the obverse of any proposition, we leave the quantity (universal or particular) and the subject term unchanged; we change the quality of the proposition and replace the predicate term with its complement. The following table gives a complete picture of all valid obversions:  
    
    Obversions  
    Obvertend Obverse  
    A: All S is P. E: No S is non-P.  
    E: No S is P. A: All S is non-P.  
    I: Some S is P. O: Some S is not non-P.  
    
    O: Some S is not P. I: Some S is non-P.  
    
    D. Contraposition  
    
    Another type of immediate inference, contraposition, can be reduced to the first two, conversion and obversion. To form the contrapositive of a given proposition, we replace its subject term with the complement of its predicate term, and we replace its predicate term with the complement of its subject term. Neither the quality nor the quantity of the original proposition is changed, so the contrapositive of an A proposition is an A proposition, the contrapositive of an O proposition is an O proposition, and so forth.  
    
    For example, the contrapositive of the A proposition, "All members are voters," is the A proposition, "All nonvoters are nonmembers." These are logically equivalent propositions, as will be evident on reflection. Contraposition is plainly a valid form of immediate inference when applied to A propositions. It really introduces nothing new, because we can get from any A proposition to its contrapositive by first obverting it, next applying conversion, and then applying obversion again. Beginning with "All S is P," we obvert it to obtain "No S is non-P," which converts validly to "No non-P is S," whose obverse is "All non-P is non-S." The contrapositive of any A proposition is the obverse of the converse of the obverse of that proposition.
  - |-
    Contraposition is a valid form of immediate inference when applied to O propositions also, although its conclusion may be awkward to express. The contrapositive of the O proposition, "Some students are not idealists," is the somewhat cumbersome O proposition, "Some nonidealists are not nonstudents," which is logically equivalent to its premise. This also can be shown to be the outcome of first obverting, then converting, then obverting again. "Some S is not P" obverts to "Some S is non-P," which converts to "Some non-P is S," which obverts to "Some non-P is not non-S."
    
    For I propositions, however, contraposition is not a valid form of inference. The true I proposition, "Some citizens are nonlegislators," has as its contrapositive the false proposition, "Some legislators are noncitizens." The reason for this invalidity becomes evident when we try to derive the contrapositive of the I proposition by successively obverting, converting, and obverting. The obverse of the original I proposition, "Some S is P," is the O proposition, "Some S is not non-P," but (as we saw earlier) the converse of an O proposition does not follow validly from it.
    
    Contraposition
    
    A valid form of
    immediate inference
    for some, but not
    
    for all types of
    propositions. To form
    the contrapositive of a
    given proposition, its
    subject term is replaced
    by the complement
    
    of its predicate term,
    and its predicate
    
    term is replaced by
    the complement of
    
    its subject term. Thus
    the contrapositive of
    the proposition "All
    humans are mammals"
    is the proposition
    
    "All nonmammals are
    nonhumans."
    
    Chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
  - |-
    In the case of E propositions, the contrapositive does not follow validly from the
    original, as can be seen when, if we begin with the true proposition, "No wrestlers are
    weaklings," we get, as its contrapositive, the obviously false proposition, "No nonweak-
    lings are nonwrestlers." The reason for this invalidity we will see, again, if we attempt
    to derive it by successive obversion, conversion, and obversion. If we begin with the
    E proposition, "No S is P," and obvert it, we obtain the A proposition, "All S is non-P"—
    which in general cannot be validly converted except by limitation. If we do then convert
    it by limitation to obtain "Some non-P is S," we can obvert this to obtain "Some non-P
    is not non-S." This outcome we may call the contrapositive by limitation—and this too we
    will consider further in the next section.
    
    Contraposition by limitation, in which we infer an O proposition from an E propo-
    sition (for example, we infer "Some non-P is not non-S" from "No S is P"), has the
    same peculiarity as conversion by limitation, on which it depends. Because a particular
    proposition is inferred from a universal proposition, the resulting contrapositive cannot
    have the same meaning and cannot be logically equivalent to the proposition that was
    the original premise. On the other hand, the contrapositive of an A proposition is an
    A proposition, and the contrapositive of an O proposition is an O proposition, and in each
    of these cases the contrapositive and the premise from which it is derived are equivalent.
    
    Contraposition is thus seen to be valid only when applied to A and O propositions. It
    is not valid at all for I propositions, and it is valid for E propositions only by limitation.
    The complete picture is exhibited in the following table:
    
    Contraposition
    Premise Contrapositive
    A: All S is P. A: All non-P is non-S.
    E: No S is P. O: Some non-P is not non-S. (by limitation)
    I: Some S is P. (contraposition not valid)
    O: Some S is not P. O: Some non-P is not non-S.

    Questions about the relations between propositions can often be answered by explor-
    ing the various immediate inferences that can be drawn from one or the other of them.
    For example, given that the proposition, "All surgeons are physicians," is true, what can
    we know about the truth or falsehood of the proposition, "No nonsurgeons are nonphy-
    sicians"? Does this problematic proposition—or its contradictory or contrary—follow
    validly from the one given as true? To answer we may proceed as follows: From what we
    are given, "All surgeons are physicians," we can validly infer its contrapositive, "All non-
    physicians are nonsurgeons." From this, using conversion by limitation (valid according
    to the traditional view), we can derive "Some nonsurgeons are nonphysicians." But this is
    the contradictory of the proposition in question ("No nonsurgeons are nonphysicians"),
    which is thus no longer problematic but known to be false.
    
    In the very first chapter of this book we noted that a valid argument whose premises
    are true must have a true conclusion, but also that a valid argument whose premises are
    false can have a true conclusion. Thus, from the false premise, "All animals are cats,"
    the true proposition, "Some animals are cats," follows by subalternation. Then from the
    false proposition, "All parents are students," conversion by limitation yields the true
    proposition, "Some students are parents." Therefore, if a proposition is given to be false,
    and the question is raised about the truth or falsehood of some other, related proposi-
    tion, the recommended procedure is to begin drawing immediate inferences from either
    (1) the contradictory of the proposition known to be false, or (2) the problematic proposi-
    tion itself. The contradictory of a false proposition must be true, and all valid inferences
    from that will also be true propositions. If we follow the other course and are able to
    show that the problematic proposition implies the proposition that is given as false, we
    know that it must itself be false.
    
    Here follows a table in which the forms of immediate inference—conversion, obver-
    sion, and contraposition—are fully displayed:

    Existential Import and the Interpretation of
    Categorical Propositions
    
    Categorical propositions are the building blocks of arguments, and our aim throughout is
    to analyze and evaluate arguments. To do this we must be able to diagram and symbolize
    the A, E, I, and O propositions. But before we can do that we must confront and resolve
    a deep logical problem—one that has been a source of controversy for literally thousands
    of years. In this section we explain this problem, and we provide a resolution on which
    a coherent analysis of syllogisms may be developed.
    
    The issues here, as we shall see, are far from simple, but the analysis of syllogisms
    in succeeding chapters does not require that the complications of this controversy
    be mastered. It does require that the interpretation of categorical propositions that
    emerges from the resolution of the controversy be understood. This is commonly
    called the Boolean interpretation of categorical propositions—named after

    George Boole (1815-1864), an English mathematician whose contributions to logical  
    theory played a key role in the later development of the modern computer. So if the  
    outcome of the following discussion—summarized in the final paragraph of this sec-  
    tion, on pp. 177-8—is fully grasped, the intervening pages of this section may be safely  
    bypassed.
    
    To understand the problem, and the Boolean outcome with which we emerge, it must  
    be seen that some propositions have existential import, and some do not. A proposi-  
    tion is said to have existential import if it typically is uttered to assert the existence  
    of objects of some kind. Why should this seemingly abstruse matter be of concern to  
    the student of logic? Because the correctness of the reasoning in many arguments is  
    directly affected by whether the propositions of which those arguments are built do, or  
    do not, have existential import. We must arrive at a clear and consistent interpretation  
    of categorical propositions in order to determine with confidence what may be rightly  
    inferred from them, and to guard against incorrect inferences that are sometimes drawn  
    from them.
    
    George Boole
  - |-
    George Boole was born in Lincolnshire, England, in 1815, becoming by mid-century one
    of the great mathematicians of his time. His family was very poor; he was self-taught in
    the classical languages and in mathematics. When his father, a shoemaker, was unable
    to support the family, George became an assistant teacher at the age of 16—and then
    eventually the director of a boarding school. A gold medal from the Royal Society for his
    mathematical research, and then a paper entitled "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,"
    led to his appointment, in 1849, as Professor of Mathematics at Queen's College in Cork,
    Ireland.
    
    George Boole was a penetrating thinker with a great talent for synthesis. The later
    development of his work by others came to be called "Boolean algebra," which, combined
    with the properties of electrical switches with which logic can be
    processed, was critical in the development of modern electronic
    digital computers. In his great book, An Investigation into the Laws of
    Thought, on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and
    Probabilities (1854), Boole presented a fully developed system for the
    symbolic representation of propositions, and also for the general
    method of logical inference. He showed that with the correct repre-
    sentation of premises, however many terms they may include, it is
    possible with purely symbolic manipulation to draw any conclusion
    that is already embedded in those propositions. A modest man and
    creative scholar, Boole died in 1864 at the age of 49. We continue
    to rely upon his analyses, seminal in the development of modern
    symbolic logic.

    5.7 Existential Import and the Interpretation of Categorical Propositions
    
    Visual Logic
    
    Aristotle v. Boole on Interpreting Categorical Propositions
    
    There are two rival interpretations of categorical propositions: the Aristotelian, which is traditional, and
    the Boolean, which is modern.
    
    In the interpretation of the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle,
    the truth of a universal proposition ("All leprechauns wear little green
    hats," or "No frogs are poisonous") implies the truth of its correspond-
    ing particular proposition ("Some leprechauns wear little green hats"
    or "Some frogs are not poisonous").
  - |-
    In contrast, George Boole, a nineteenth-century English mathematician, argued that we cannot infer the truth of the particular proposition from the truth of its corresponding universal proposition, because (as both sides agree) every particular proposition asserts the existence of its subject class; if some frogs are not poisonous, there must be at least one frog. But if the universal proposition permits us to infer the corresponding particular proposition, then "All leprechauns wear little green hats" would permit us to infer that some leprechauns do, and that would imply that there really are leprechauns!
    
    So, in the modern or Boolean interpretation, a universal proposition (an A or an E proposition) must be understood to assert only that "If there is such a thing as a leprechaun, it wears a little green hat," and "If there is such a thing as a frog, it is not poisonous."
    
    We begin with I and O propositions, which surely do have existential import. Thus the I proposition, "Some soldiers are heroes," says that there exists at least one soldier who is a hero. The O proposition, "Some dogs are not companions," says that there exists at least one dog that is not a companion. Particular propositions, I and O propositions, plainly do assert that the classes designated by their subject terms (for example, soldiers and dogs) are not empty—the class of soldiers, and the class of dogs (if the examples given here are true), each has at least one member.
  - |-
    * A few propositions appear to be exceptions: "Some ghosts appear in Shakespeare's plays" and "Some Greek gods are described in the /liad" are particular propositions that are certainly true even though there are (presumably) neither ghosts nor Greek gods. However, it is the formulation that misleads in such cases. These statements do not themselves affirm the existence of ghosts or Greek gods; they say only that there are certain other propositions that are affirmed or implied in Shakespeare's plays and in the /liad. The intended meaning is "Some passages in Shakespeare's plays are about ghosts" and "Some descriptions in the /iad are of Greek gods." The propositions of Shakespeare and Homer may not be true, but it is certainly true that their writings contain or imply those propositions. That is all that is affirmed by these apparent exceptions, which arise chiefly in literary or mythological contexts. I and O propositions do have existential import.
    
    Chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
    
    If this is so, however—if I and O propositions have existential import (as no one would wish to deny)—wherein lies the problem? The problem arises from the consequences of this fact, which are very awkward. Earlier we supposed that an I proposition follows validly from its corresponding A proposition by subalternation. That is, from "All spiders are eight-legged animals" we infer validly that "Some spiders are eight-legged animals." Similarly, we supposed that an O proposition follows validly from its corresponding E proposition. But if I and O propositions have existential import, and they follow validly from their corresponding A and E propositions, then A and E propositions must also have existential import, because a proposition with existential import cannot be derived validly from another that does not have such import.

    This consequence creates a very serious problem. We know that A and O propositions, on the traditional square of opposition, are contradictories. "All Danes speak English" is contradicted by "Some Danes do not speak English." Contradictories cannot both be true, because one of the pair must be false; nor can they both be false, because one of the pair must be true. But if corresponding A and O propositions do have existential import, as we concluded in the paragraph just above, then both contradictories could be false! To illustrate, the A proposition, "All inhabitants of Mars are blond," and its corresponding O proposition, "Some inhabitants of Mars are not blond," are contradictories; if they have existential import—that is, if we interpret them as asserting that there are inhabitants of Mars—then both these propositions are false if Mars has no inhabitants. Of course, we do know that Mars has no inhabitants; the class of its inhabitants is empty, so both of the propositions in the example are false. But if they are both false, they cannot be contradictories!
    
    Something seems to have gone wrong with the traditional square of opposition in cases of this kind. If the traditional square is correct when it tells us that A and E propositions validly imply their corresponding I and O propositions, then the square is not correct when it tells us that corresponding A and O propositions are contradictories. In that case, the square is also mistaken in holding that the corresponding I and O propositions are subcontraries.
    
    What is to be done? Can the traditional square of opposition be rescued? Yes, it can, but the price is high. We could rehabilitate the traditional square of opposition by introducing the notion of a presupposition. Much earlier (in Section 4.5), we observed that some complex questions are properly answered "yes" or "no" only if the answer to a prior question has been presupposed. "Did you spend the money you stole?" can be reasonably answered "yes" or "no" only if the presupposition that you stole some money is granted. Now, to rescue the square of opposition, we might insist that all propositions—that is, the four standard-form categorical propositions A, E, I, and O—have presuppositions. If a proposition has a presupposition, then the truth of the proposition depends on the truth of its presupposition. For example, the A proposition "All Danes speak English" presupposes that there are Danes. If there are no Danes, then the A proposition is false, and the O proposition "Some Danes do not speak English" is also false. In this case, both propositions are false, but they are not contradictories because their truth depends on the existence of Danes. Thus, the traditional square of opposition is only valid when there is existential import, and it fails when there is no existential import. Therefore, to save the traditional square of opposition, we must introduce the concept of presupposition and recognize that some propositions require the existence of their subject terms.
  - |-
    There is another way to show that the existential import of A and E propositions must follow from that of I and O propositions, on the traditional square of opposition. In the case of the A proposition, we could show it by relying on the (traditionally assumed) validity of conversion by limitation; in the case of the E proposition, we could show it by relying on the (traditionally assumed) validity of contraposition by limitation. The result is always the same as that reached above: On the traditional square of opposition, if I and O propositions have existential import, A and E propositions must also have existential import.
    
    5.7 Existential Import and the Interpretation of Categorical Propositions
    
    O—presuppose (in the sense indicated above) that the classes to which they refer do have members; they are not empty. That is, questions about the truth or falsehood of propositions, and about the logical relations holding among them, are admissible and may be reasonably answered (in this interpretation) only if we presuppose that they never refer to empty classes. In this way, we may save all of the relationships set forth in the traditional square of opposition: A and E will remain contraries, I and O will remain subcontraries, subalterns will follow validly from their superalterns, and A and O will remain contradictories, as will I and E. To achieve this result, however, we must pay by accepting the blanket presupposition that all classes designated by our terms do have members—are not empty.
  - |-
    Well, why not do just that? This existential presupposition is both necessary and  
    sufficient to rescue Aristotelian logic. It is, moreover, a presupposition in full accord  
    with the ordinary use of modern languages such as English in very many cases. If you  
    are told, "All the apples in the barrel are Delicious," and you find when you look into  
    the barrel that it is empty, what can you say? You would probably not say that the  
    claim is false, or true, but would instead point out that there are no apples in the barrel.  
    You would thus be explaining that the speaker had made a mistake, that in this case  
    the existential presupposition (that there exist apples in the barrel) was false. The fact  
    that we would respond in this corrective fashion shows that we do understand, and  
    do generally accept, the existential presupposition of propositions that are ordinarily  
    uttered.
    
    Unfortunately, this blanket existential presupposition, introduced to rescue the tra-  
    ditional square of opposition, imposes intellectual penalties that are too heavy to bear.  
    There are very good reasons not to do it. Here are three such reasons.
    
    First, this rescue preserves the traditional relations among A, E, I, and O proposi-  
    tions, but only at the cost of reducing their power to formulate assertions that we may  
    need to formulate. If we invariably presuppose that the class designated has members,  
    we will never be able to formulate the proposition that denies that the class has members!  
    Such denials may sometimes be very important and must surely be made intelligible.  
    We would never be able to formulate the proposition, "No unicorns are creatures that  
    exist."
    
    Second, even ordinary usage of language is not in complete accord with this blanket  
    presupposition. "All" may refer to possibly empty classes. If a property owner were to  
    say, "All trespassers will be prosecuted," far from presupposing that the class of tres-  
    passers has members, he would be intending to ensure that the class will become and  
    remain empty. This statement can be true even if no one is ever prosecuted and the  
    word "all" in that statement refers to an empty class. Consider, as another example, the  
    checklist on an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) return envelope. There is an item that
  - |-
    * Phillip H. Wiebe argues that Aristotelian logic does not require the assumption that the class designated by the complement of the subject term be nonempty. See "Existential Assumptions for Aristotelian Logic," Journal of Philosophical Research 16 (1990-1991): 321-328. But Aristotelian logic certainly does require the assumption that at least the classes designated by the other three terms (the subject term, the predicate term, and the complement of the predicate term) are not empty—and this existential assumption gives rise to all the difficulties noted in the remarks that follow.
    
    Chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
    
    reads, "All necessary schedules have been attached." A taxpayer who did not need to attach any schedules would certainly not hesitate to check the box next to this statement, essentially declaring it to be true even though the class of necessary schedules is, in his case, empty. On the other hand, consider the I proposition ("Some S is P"). Going back to the case of the property owner, suppose he had asserted that "Some trespassers will be prosecuted." If there were no trespassers, then we would call his statement false. This is because, unlike "all," the word "some" in an I proposition makes a clear commitment that is incompatible with an empty subject class. The word "some" is interpreted to mean "at least one"—never "zero"—and that concreteness commits particular propositions, if they are to be true, to a state of affairs in which the subject class is not empty.
    
    Third, in science, and in other theoretical spheres, we often wish to reason without making any presuppositions about existence. Newton's first law of motion, for example, asserts that certain things are true about bodies that are not acted on by any external forces: They remain at rest, or they continue their straight-line motion. The law may be true; a physicist may wish to express and defend it without wanting to presuppose that there actually are any bodies that are not acted on by external forces.
    
    Objections of this kind make the blanket existential presupposition unacceptabe for modern logicians. The Aristotelian interpretation of categorical propositions, long thought to be correct, must be abandoned, and a more modern interpretation employed.
  - |-
    In modern logic it is not assumed that the classes to which categorical propositions refer always have members. The modern interpretation that explicitly rejects this assumption is called, as we noted earlier, Boolean.*
    
    We adopt the Boolean interpretation of categorical propositions in all that follows. This has important logical consequences. Therefore we set forth now what this Boolean interpretation of categorical propositions entails.
    
    1. In some respects, the traditional interpretation is not upset. I and O propositions continue to have existential import in the Boolean interpretation, so the proposition "Some S is P" is false if the class S is empty, and the proposition "Some S is not P" is likewise false if the class S is empty.
    
    2. It also remains true in this interpretation that the universal propositions, A and E, are the contradictories of the particular propositions, O and I. That is, the proposition, "All men are mortal," does contradict the proposition, "Some men are not mortal," and the proposition "No gods are mortal," does contradict the proposition, "Some gods are mortal."
    
    3. All this is entirely coherent because, in the Boolean interpretation, universal propositions are interpreted as having no existential import. So even when the S class is empty, the proposition, "All S is P" can be true, as can the proposition, "No S is P."
    
    * Bertrand Russell, another of the founders of modern symbolic logic, also advanced this approach in a famous essay entitled "The Existential Import of Propositions," in Mind, July 1905, and referred to it there as "Peano's interpretation" of propositions, after Giuseppe Peano, a great Italian mathematician of the early twentieth century.
    
    5.7 Existential Import and the Interpretation of Categorical Propositions
    
    For example, the propositions, "All unicorns have horns" and "No unicorns have wings" may both be true, even if there are no unicorns. But if there are no unicorns, the I proposition, "Some unicorns have horns," is false, as is the O proposition, "Some unicorns do not have wings."
  - |-
    4. Sometimes, in ordinary discourse, we utter a universal proposition with which we do intend to assert existence. The Boolean interpretation permits this to be expressed, but doing so requires two propositions, one existential in force but particular, the other universal but not existential in force. For example, "All planets in our solar system revolve around the Sun." This is a universal proposition that has no existential import—it says only that if there is a planet in our solar system, then it revolves around the sun. However, if we express the proposition intending also to assert the existence of planets in our solar system that do so revolve, we would need to add: "Mars is a planet in our solar system." This proposition has that desired existential force, referring as it does to actually existing planets.
    
    5. Some very important changes result from our adoption of the Boolean interpretation. Corresponding A and E propositions can both be true and are therefore not contraries. This may seem paradoxical, but the force of this claim will be understood if we think carefully about the Boolean interpretation of the following two propositions: "All unicorns have wings" and "No unicorns have wings." The first of these asserts only that if there is a unicorn then it has wings, and the second asserts only that if there is a unicorn then it does not have wings—and both of these "if... then" propositions, which are corresponding A and E propositions, can indeed be true if there are no unicorns.
    
    6. In like manner, in the Boolean interpretation, corresponding I and O propositions, because they do have existential import, can both be false if the subject class is empty. So corresponding I and O propositions are not subcontraries. If there are no unicorns (that is, if the subject class is empty) it is simply false to assert that some unicorns have horns, and in that case it is also false to assert that some unicorns do not have horns. These corresponding I and O propositions, which have existential import, are plainly false if there are no unicorns. Since, in this case, they can both be false, they are not subcontraries.
  - |-
    7. In the Boolean interpretation, subalternation—inferring an I proposition from its
    corresponding A, and an O proposition from its corresponding E—is not valid. This
    is because, plainly, one may not validly infer a proposition that has existential
    import from one that does not.
    
    8. The Boolean interpretation preserves most immediate inferences: conversion for E and
    for I propositions is preserved; contraposition for A and for O propositions is preserved;
    obversion for any proposition is preserved. But conversion by limitation, and contra-
    position by limitation, are not valid.
    
    9. The traditional square of opposition, in the Boolean interpretation, is transformed
    in the following general way: Relations along the sides of the square are undone, but the
    diagonal, contradictory relations remain in force.
    
    In short, the blanket existential presupposition is rejected by modern logicians. It
    is a mistake, we hold, to assume that a class has members if it is not asserted explicitly
    that it does. Any argument that relies on this mistaken assumption is said to commit
    fallacy of existential assumption, or more briefly, the existential fallacy.* With
    this Boolean interpretation clearly in mind, we are now in a position to set forth a
    powerful system for the symbolizing and diagramming of standard-form categorical
    syllogisms.

    EXERCISES
    
    In the preceding discussion of existential import, it was shown why, in the Boolean inter-
    pretation of propositions adopted in this book, most of the inferences that traditionally
    were thought to be valid are not valid. These inferences mistakenly assume that certain
    classes have members, thereby committing the existential fallacy. This fallacy is commit-
    ted in each of the arguments presented below. Explain the point or points at which, in
    each argument, the mistaken existential assumption is made.

    Step (3) to step (4) is invalid. The inference at this point is conversion by limitation (that
    is, from "All S is P" to "Some P is S"), which was acceptable in the traditional interpreta-
    tion but is invalid in the Boolean interpretation. This step relies on an inference from a
    universal proposition to a particular proposition, but the preceding discussion has shown
    that the classes in a universal proposition cannot be assumed to have members, whereas
    the classes in a particular proposition do have members. Thus the invalid passage from
    (3) to (4) permits the inference that the predicate class in (4) is not empty, and therefore
    that there is someone who has squared the circle! In inferring (4) from (3), one commits
    the existential fallacy.

    *The following exchange from Alice in Wonderland might serve as an example of the existential fallacy. The confusion
    arises because Alice, but not the March Hare or the Mad Hatter, attaches existential import to the word "more":
    
    "Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
    "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."
    "You mean you can't take less," said the Hatter: "it's very easy to take more than nothing."
    
    All of this may seem strange at first; however, it must be borne in mind that logical formulations require greater
    precision than do natural languages, and sometimes meanings are assigned to words and symbols that are not in accord
    with ordinary usage.

    Symbolism and Diagrams for Categorical
    Propositions
    
    Because the Boolean interpretation of categorical propositions depends heavily on the
    notion of an empty class, it is convenient to have a special symbol to represent it. The
    zero symbol, O, is used for this purpose. To say that the class designated by the term S
    has no members, we write an equals sign between S and 0. Thus the equation S = 0 says
    that there are no S's, or that S has no members.
    
    To say that the class designated by S does have members is to deny that S is empty.
    To assert that there are S's is to deny the proposition symbolized by S = 0. We symbolize
    that denial by drawing a slanting line through the equals sign. Thus the inequality S ≠ 0
    says that there are S's, by denying that S is empty.
  - |-
    Standard-form categorical propositions refer to two classes, so the equations that  
    represent them are somewhat more complicated. Where each of two classes is already  
    designated by a symbol, the class of all things that belong to both of them can be repre-  
    sented by juxtaposing the symbols for the two original classes. For example, if the letter  
    S designates the class of all satires and the letter P designates the class of all poems, then  
    the class of all things that are both satires and poems is represented by the symbol SP, which thus designates the class of all satirical poems (or poetic satires). The common  
    part or common membership of two classes is called the product or intersection of the two  
    classes. The product of two classes is the class of all things that belong to both of them.  
    The product of the class of all Americans and the class of all composers is the class of all  
    American composers. (One must be on one's guard against certain oddities of the English  
    language here. For example, the product of the class of all Spaniards and the class of all  
    dancers is not the class of all Spanish dancers, for a Spanish dancer is not necessarily a  
    dancer who is Spanish, but any person who performs Spanish dances. Similarly, with  
    abstract painters, English majors, antique dealers, and so on.)
    
    This new notation permits us to symbolize E and I propositions as equations and  
    inequalities. The E proposition, "No S is P," says that no members of the class S are  
    members of the class P; that is, there are no things that belong to both classes. This can  
    be rephrased by saying that the product of the two classes is empty, which is symbolized  
    by the equation SP = 0. The I proposition, "Some S is P," says that at least one member of  
    S is also a member of P. This means that the product of the classes S and P is not empty  
    and is symbolized by the inequality SP + 0.
  - |-
    To symbolize A and O propositions, it is convenient to introduce a new method of
    representing class complements. The complement of a class is the collection or class of
    all things that do not belong to the original class, as explained in Section 5.6. The com-
    plement of the class of all soldiers is the class of all things that are not soldiers—the class
    of all nonsoldiers. Where the letter $ symbolizes the class of all soldiers, we symbolize
    the class of all nonsoldiers by S (read "S bar"), the symbol for the original class with a
    bar above it. The A proposition, "All S is P," says that all members of the class S are also
    members of the class P; that is, that there are no members of the class S$ that are not
    members of P or (by obversion) that "No S is non-P." This, like any other E proposition,
    says that the product of the classes designated by its subject and predicate terms is empty.
    It is symbolized by the equation SP = 0. The O proposition, "Some S is not P," obverts
    to the logically equivalent I proposition, "Some S is non-P," which is symbolized by the
    inequality SP # 0.
    
    In their symbolic formulations, the interrelations among the four standard-form cat-
    egorical propositions appear very clearly. It is obvious that the A and O propositions are
    contradictories when they are symbolized as SP = 0 and SP # 0, and it is equally obvious
    that the E and I propositions, SP = 0 and SP + 0, are contradictories. The Boolean square
    of opposition may be represented as shown in Figure 5-2.
    
    The notation shown in the table is useful, for example, in representing the relation-
    ship among contradictories in the Boolean square of opposition.

    Figure 5-2 The Boolean Square of Opposition
    
    When first explaining the four types of standard-form categorical propositions, in Section 5.3, we represented the relations of the classes in those propositions graphically with intersecting circles, labeled S and P. Now we carry that process of diagramming categorical propositions somewhat further, enriching our notation in ways that will facilitate the analysis to follow. We begin by representing any class with an unmarked circle, labeled with the term that designates that class. The class $ is diagrammed with a simple circle, as shown in Figure 5-3.
    
    Figure 5-3
    
    The diagram in Figure 5-3 is of a class, not a proposition. It represents the class S, but it says nothing about it. To diagram the proposition that S has no members, or that there are no S's, we shade all of the interior of the circle representing S, indicating in this way that it contains nothing and is empty. To diagram the proposition that there are S's, which we interpret as saying that there is at least one member of S, we place an x anywhere in the interior of the circle representing S, indicating in this way that there is something inside it, that it is not empty. Thus the two propositions, "There are no S's," and "There are S's," are represented by the two diagrams in Figure 5-4.
    
    S=0   S#0
    
    Figure 5-4
    
    chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
    
    Note that the circle that diagrams the class S will also, in effect, diagram the class S, for just as the interior of the circle represents all members of S, so the exterior of the circle represents all members of S.
  - |-
    To diagram a standard-form categorical proposition, as explained in Section 5.3, two circles are required. Figure 5-5 shows a pair of intersecting circles, which we may use as the skeleton, or framework, for diagramming any standard-form categorical proposition whose subject and predicate terms are symbolized by S and P.
    
    Figure 5-5
    
    Figure 5-5 diagrams the two classes, S and P, but diagrams no proposition concerning them. It does not affirm that either or both have members, nor does it deny that they have. In fact, there are more than two classes diagrammed by the two intersecting circles. The part of the circle labeled S that does not overlap the circle labeled P diagrams all S's that are not P's and can be thought of as representing the product of the classes S and P. We may label it SP. The overlapping part of the two circles represents the product of the classes S and P, and diagrams all things belonging to both of them. It is labeled SP. The part of the circle labeled P that does not overlap the circle labeled S diagrams all P's that are not S's, and represents the product of the class S$ and P. It is labeled SP. Finally, the part of the diagram external to both circles represents all things that are neither in S nor in P; it diagrams the fourth class SP so labeled.
    
    With these labels inserted, Figure 5-5 becomes Figure 5-6.
    
    S P

    Figure 5-6
  - |-
    Figure 5-6 can be interpreted in terms of the several different classes determined by
    the class of all Spaniards (S) and the class of all painters (P). SP is the product of these
    two classes, containing all those things and only those things that belong to both of
    them. Every member of SP must be a member of both S and P; every member must be
    both a Spaniard and a painter. This product class SP is the class of all Spanish painters,
    which contains, among others, Velazquez and Goya. SP is the product of the first class
    and the complement of the second, containing all those things and only those things
    that belong to the class S but not to the class P. It is the class of all Spaniards who are
    5.8 Symbolism and Diagrams for Categorical Propositions
    
    not painters, all Spanish nonpainters, and it will contain neither Velazquez nor Goya,
    but it will include both the novelist Cervantes and the dictator Franco, among many
    others. SP is the product of the second class and the complement of the first, and is
    the class of all painters who are not Spaniards. This class SP of all non-Spanish painters
    includes, among others, both the Dutch painter Rembrandt and the American painter
    Georgia O'Keeffe. Finally, SP is the product of the complements of the two original
    classes. It contains all those things and only those things that are neither Spaniards
    nor painters. It is a very large class indeed, containing not merely English admirals and
    Swiss mountain climbers, but such things as the Mississippi River and Mount Everest.
    All these classes are diagrammed in Figure 5-6, where the letters S and P are interpreted
    as in this paragraph.
    
    Diagrams of this kind, as noted earlier, are called Venn diagrams after John Venn,
    the English logician who introduced this notation. When, in such diagrams, the sev-
    eral areas are labeled, but not marked in any other way, they represent classes only.
    Figure 5-6 illustrates this. It does not represent any proposition. In such a diagram, if a
    circle or part of a circle is blank, that signifies nothing—neither that there are, nor that
    there are not, members of the class represented by that space.

    With certain additions, however, Venn diagrams can be used to represent propositions as well as classes. By shading out some spaces, or by inserting x's in various parts
    of the diagram, we can accurately diagram any one of the four standard-form categorical
    propositions. Because Venn diagrams (with appropriate markings) represent categorical
    propositions so fully and so graphically, these diagrams have become one of the most
    powerful and most widely used instruments for the appraisal of syllogistic arguments.
    Let us consider how each of the four basic categorical propositions can be represented
    using this technique.
    
    To diagram the A proposition, "All S is P," symbolized by SP = 0, we simply shade
    out the part of the diagram that represents the class SP, thus indicating that it has no
    members or is empty. To diagram the E proposition, "No S is P," symbolized by SP = 0,
    we shade out the part of the diagram that represents the class SP, to indicate that it is
    empty. To diagram the I proposition, "Some S is P," symbolized by SP # 0, we insert an
    x into the part of the diagram that represents the class SP. This insertion indicates that
    the class product is not empty but has at least one member. Finally, for the O proposi-
    tion, "Some S is not P," symbolized by SP # 0 we insert an x into the part of the diagram
    that represents the class SP, to indicate that it is not empty but has at least one member.
    Placed side by side, diagrams for the four standard-form categorical propositions display
    their different meanings very clearly, as shown in Figure 5-7.
    
    A: All S is P. E: No S is P. I: Some S is P. O: Some S is not P.
    
    SP=0 SP=0 SP #0 SP #0
    Figure 5-7
    
    Chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
  - |-
    We have constructed diagrammatic representations for "No S is P" and "Some S is
    P," and because these are logically equivalent to their converses, "No P is S" and "Some
    P is S," the diagrams for the latter have already been shown. To diagram the A propo-
    sition, "All P is S" (symbolized by PS = 0) within the same framework, we must shade
    out the part of the diagram that represents the class PS. It should be obvious that the
    class PS is the same as the class SP—if not immediately, then by recognizing that every
    object that belongs to the class of all painters and the class of all non-Spaniards must
    (also) belong to the class of all non-Spaniards and the class of all painters—all painting
    non-Spaniards are non-Spanish painters, and vice versa. To diagram the O proposition,
    "Some P is not S," symbolized by PS # 0 we insert an x into the part of the diagram that
    represents the class PS(= SP). Diagrams for these propositions then appear as shown in
    Figure 5-8.

    This further adequacy of the two-circle diagrams is mentioned because in the next
    chapter it will be important to be able to use a given pair of overlapping circles with given
    labels—say, S and M—to diagram any standard-form categorical proposition containing
    S and M as its terms, regardless of the order in which they occur in it.
    
    The Venn diagrams constitute an iconic representation of the standard-form categori-
    cal propositions, in which spatial inclusions and exclusions correspond to the nonspatial
    inclusions and exclusions of classes. They provide an exceptionally clear method of nota-
    tion. They also provide the basis for the simplest and most direct method of testing the
    validity of categorical syllogisms, as will be explained in Chapter 6.

    This chapter has introduced and explained the basic elements of classical, or Aristotelian, deductive logic,
    as distinguished from modern symbolic logic. (To review this distinction, see Section 5.1.)
    
    In Section 5.2 we introduced the concept of classes, on which traditional logic is built, and the cat-
    egorical propositions that express relations between classes.
    
    In Section 5.3 we explained the four basic standard-form categorical propositions:
    
    A: universal affirmative
    E: universal negative
    
    I: particular affirmative
    O: particular negative
    
    chapter 5 Categorical Propositions
    
    In Section 5.4 we discussed various features of these standard-form categorical propositions: their
    quality (affirmative or negative) and their quantity (universal or particular). We also explained why dif-
    ferent terms are distributed or undistributed, in each of the four basic kinds of propositions.

    In Section 5.5 we explored the kinds of opposition arising among the several standard-form categorical propositions: what it means for a proposition to have a contradictory, a contrary, a subcontrary, or a
    sub- or superaltern. We showed how these relations are exhibited on the traditional square of opposition,
    and explained the immediate inferences that can be drawn from them.
    
    In Section 5.6 we examined other kinds of immediate inferences that are based on categorical propo-
    sitions: conversion, obversion, and contraposition.
    
    In Section 5.7 we explored the controversial issue of existential import, showing that the traditional
    square of opposition can be retained only if we make a blanket assumption that the classes to which
    propositions refer always do have some members—an assumption that modern logicians are unwilling
    to make. We then explained the interpretation of propositions to be adopted throughout this book: the
    interpretation called Boolean, which retains much, but not all, of the traditional square of opposition
    while rejecting the blanket assumption of nonempty classes. In this Boolean interpretation, we explained
    that particular propositions (I and O propositions) are interpreted as having existential import, whereas
    universal propositions (A and E propositions) are interpreted as not having such import. We carefully
    detailed the consequences of adopting this interpretation of propositions.
    
    In Section 5.8 we returned to the use of Venn diagrams, using intersecting circles to represent classes.
    We showed how, with additional markings, Venn diagrams may also be used to represent categorical
    propositions.
    
    This chapter has provided the tools we will need to analyze categorical syllogisms, of which standard-
    form propositions are the essential building blocks.

    Categorical propositions can now be used in more extended reasoning. Arguments that
    rely on A, E, I, and O propositions commonly have two categorical propositions as
    premises and one categorical proposition as a conclusion. Such arguments are called
    syllogisms; a syllogism is a deductive argument in which a conclusion is inferred from
    two premises.
    
    The syllogisms with which we are concerned here are called categorical because they
    are arguments based on the relations of classes, or categories—relations that are expressed
    by the categorical propositions with which we are familiar. More formally, we define a
    categorical syllogism as a deductive argument consisting of three categorical proposi-
    tions that together contain exactly three terms, each of which occurs in exactly two of
    the constituent propositions.
    
    Syllogisms are very common, very clear, and readily testable. The system of cat-
    egorical syllogisms that we will explore is powerful and deep. The seventeenth-century
    philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz said, of the invention of the form
    of syllogisms, that it was "one of the most beautiful and also one of the most impor-
    tant made by the human mind." Syllogisms are the workhorse arguments with which
    deductive logic, as traditionally practiced, has been made effective in writing and in
    controversy.
    
    It will be convenient to have an example to use as we discuss the parts and features
    of the syllogism. Here is a valid standard-form categorical syllogism that we shall use as
    an illustration:
    
    No heroes are cowards.
    Some soldiers are cowards.
    Therefore some soldiers are not heroes.

    (A, E, I, or O) and are
    arranged in standard
    order (major premise,
    then minor premise,
    then conclusion).

    does not appear in the  
    conclusion.

    To analyze such an argument accurately, it needs to be in standard form. A categorical  
    syllogism is said to be in standard form (as the above example is) when two things are  
    true of it: (1) its premises and its conclusion are all standard-form categorical proposi-  
    tions (A, E, I, or O); and (2) those propositions are arranged in a specified standard order.  
    The importance of this standard form will become evident when we turn to the task of  
    testing the validity of syllogisms.
    
    To explain the order of the premises that is required to put any syllogism into stand-  
    ard form, we need the logical names of the premises of the syllogism, and the names of  
    the terms of the syllogism, and we must understand why those names—very useful and  
    very important—are assigned to them. This is the next essential step in our analysis of  
    categorical syllogisms. In this chapter, for the sake of brevity, we will refer to categorical  
    syllogisms simply as "syllogisms," even though there are other kinds of syllogisms that  
    will be discussed in later chapters.
    
    A. Terms of the Syllogism: Major, Minor, and Middle
  - |-
    The three categorical propositions in our example argument above contain exactly three terms: heroes, soldiers, and cowards. To identify the terms by name, we look to the conclusion of the syllogism, which of course contains exactly two terms. The conclusion in our sample is an O proposition, "Some soldiers are not heroes." The term that occurs as the predicate of the conclusion ("heroes," in this case) is called the major term of the syllogism. The term that occurs as the subject of the conclusion ("soldiers," in this case) is called the minor term of the syllogism. The third term of the syllogism ("cowards," in this case), which never occurs in the conclusion but always appears in both premises, is called the middle term.
    
    The premises of a syllogism also have names. Each premise is named after the term that appears both in it and in the conclusion. The major term and the minor term must each occur in a different premise. The premise containing the major term is called the major premise. In the example, "heroes" is the major term, so the premise containing "heroes"—"No heroes are cowards"—is the major premise. It is the major premise not because it appears first, but only because it is the premise that contains the major term; it would be the major premise no matter in what order the premises were written.
    
    The premise containing the minor term is called the minor premise. In the example, "soldiers" is the minor term, so the premise containing "soldiers"—"Some soldiers are cowards"—is the minor premise. It is the minor premise not because of its position, but because it is the premise that contains the minor term.
    
    A syllogism is in standard form, we said, when its premises are arranged in a specified standard order. Now we can state that order: In a standard-form syllogism, the major term appears as the predicate of the conclusion, the minor term appears as the subject of the conclusion, and the middle term appears in both premises but not in the conclusion. The major premise is the premise containing the major term, and the minor premise is the premise containing the minor term.
  - |-
    The premise is always stated first, the minor premise second, and the conclusion last. The reason for the importance of this order will soon become clear.
    
    B. The Mood of the Syllogism
    
    Every syllogism has a mood. The mood of a syllogism is determined by the types (A, E, I, or O) of standard-form categorical propositions it contains. The mood of the syllogism is therefore represented by three letters, and those three letters are always given in standard-form order. That is, the first letter names the type of the syllogism's major premise; the second letter names the type of the syllogism's minor premise; the third letter names the type of the syllogism's conclusion. In our example syllogism, the major premise ("No heroes are cowards") is an E proposition; the minor premise ("Some soldiers are cowards") is an I proposition; the conclusion ("Some soldiers are not heroes") is an O proposition. Therefore the mood of this syllogism is EIO.
    
    C. The Figure of the Syllogism
    
    The mood of a standard-form syllogism is not enough, by itself, to characterize its logical form. This can be shown by comparing two syllogisms, A and B, with the same mood, which are logically very different.
    
    Major Term Middle Term
    
    All great scientists are college graduates.
    
    A Minor Term Middle Term
    
    Some professional athletes are college graduates.
    
    Minor Term Major Term
    
    Therefore some professional athletes are great scientists.
    
    Middle Term Major Term
    
    All artists are egotists.
    
    Middle Term Minor Term
    
    Some artists are paupers.
    Minor Term Major Term
    
    Therefore some paupers are egotists.
    
    Both of these are of mood AII, but one of them is valid and the other is not. The difference in their forms can be shown most clearly if we display their logical "skeletons" by abbreviating the minor terms as S (subject of the conclusion), the major terms as P (predicate of the conclusion), and the middle terms as M. Using the three-dot symbol "." for "therefore," we get these skeletons:
  - |-
    A. All S is M.
    Some S is M.
    Therefore, Some S is P.
    
    B. All M is P.
    Some M is S.
    Therefore, Some S is P.
    
    Mood
    
    A characterization of
    categorical syllogisms,
    determined by the
    forms of the standard-
    form categorical
    propositions it contains.
    Since there are just four
    forms of propositions,
    A, E, I, and O, and
    each syllogism contains
    exactly three such
    propositions, there
    
    are exactly 64 moods,
    each mood identified
    by the three letters
    
    of its constituent
    propositions, AAA,
    AAI, AAE, and so on,
    to OOO.

    Figure
    The position of the
    middle term in the
    
    premises of a standard-
    form categorical
    syllogism.
    
    These are very different. In the one labeled A, the middle term, M, is the predicate term
    of both premises; but in the one labeled B, the middle term, M, is the subject term of
    both premises. Syllogism B will be seen to be a valid argument; syllogism A, on the other
    hand, is invalid.
    
    These examples show that although the form of a syllogism is partially described by
    its mood (AII in both of these cases), syllogisms that have the same mood may differ
    importantly in their forms, depending on the relative positions of their middle terms.
    To describe the form of a syllogism completely we must state its mood (the three letters
    of its three propositions) and its figure—where by figure we mean the position of the
    middle term in its premises.
    
    Syllogisms can have four—and only four—possible different figures:
    
    1. The middle term may be the subject term of the major premise and the predicate
    
    term of the minor premise; or
    
    2. The middle term may be the predicate term of both premises; or
    
    3. The middle term may be the subject term of both premises; or
    
    4. The middle term may be the predicate term of the major premise and the subject
    term of the minor premise.

    These different possible positions of the middle term constitute the first, second, third,
    and fourth figures, respectively. Every syllogism must have one or another of these four
    figures. The characters of these figures may be visualized more readily when the figures
    are schematized as in the following array, in which reference to mood is suppressed and
    the quantifiers and copulas are not shown—but the relative positions of the terms of the
    syllogism are brought out:
    
    M— P    P—A    M— P    P—M
    S—M    S—M    M—S    M—S
    "S—P "    S—P "    S—P "    S—P "
    First Figure Second Figure Third Figure Fourth Figure
    
    Any standard-form syllogism is completely described when we specify its
    mood and its figure. The syllogism we have been using as an example is in the second
    figure; "cowards," the middle term, is the predicate term of both premises. Its mood, as
    we pointed out, is EIO. So it is completely described as being a syllogism of the form
    EIO-2. It is a valid syllogism, as we noted; every valid syllogistic form, as we shall see,
    has it own name. The name of this form, EIO-2, is Festino. We say of this syllogism
    that it is "in Festino."
    
    Here is another example:
    
    No M is P.
    All S is M.
    "No S is P.
    
    This syllogism is in the first figure (its middle term is the subject of the major premise
    and the predicate of the minor premise); its mood is EAE. So we may characterize it
    completely as EAE-1, a form whose unique name is Celarent. Any syllogism of this form
    is "in Celarent," just as any syllogism of the earlier form is "in Festino." Because Celarent
    (EAE-1) and Festino (EIO-2) are known to be valid forms, we may conclude that when-
    ever we encounter an argument in one of these forms, it too is valid.
  - |-
    With these analytical tools we can identify every possible categorical syllogism by mood and figure. If we were to list all the possible moods, beginning with AAA, AAE, AAI, AAO, AEA, AEE, ..., and so on, continuing until every possibility had been named, we would eventually (upon reaching OOO) have enumerated sixty-four possible moods. Each mood can occur in each of the four figures; 4 x 64 = 256. It is cer-
    tain, therefore, that there are exactly 256 distinct forms that standard-form syllogisms
    may assume.
    
    Of these 256 possible forms, as we shall see, only a few are valid forms. Each of those
    valid forms has a unique name, as will be explained.

    EXERCISES
    
    Rewrite each of the following syllogisms in standard form, and name its mood and fig-
    ure. (Procedure: first, identify the conclusion; second, note its predicate term, which is
    the major term of the syllogism; third, identify the major premise, which is the premise
    containing the major term; fourth, verify that the other premise is the minor premise by
    checking to see that it contains the minor term, which is the subject term of the con-
    clusion; fifth, rewrite the argument in standard form—major premise first, minor premise
    second, conclusion last; sixth, name the mood and figure of the syllogism.)
    
    Example
    
    1. No nuclear-powered submarines are commercial vessels, so no warships are commer-
    cial vessels, because all nuclear-powered submarines are warships.
    
    Solution
    
    Step 1. The conclusion is "No warships are commercial vessels."
    
    Step 2. "Commercial vessels" is the predicate term of this conclusion and is therefore
    the major term of the syllogism.
    
    Step 3. The major premise, the premise that contains this term, is "No nuclear-powered
    submarines are commercial vessels."
    
    Step 4. The remaining premise, "All nuclear-powered submarines are warships," is
    indeed the minor premise, because it does contain the subject term of the con-
    clusion, "warships."
    
    Step 5. In standard form this syllogism is written thus:
  - |-
    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    No nuclear-powered submarines are commercial vessels.
    All nuclear-powered submarines are warships.
    Therefore no warships are commercial vessels.
    
    Step 6. The three propositions in this syllogism are, in order, E, A, and E. The middle
    term, "nuclear-powered submarines," is the subject term of both premises, so
    the syllogism is in the third figure. The mood and figure of the syllogism there-
    fore are EAE-3.

    quents are products of broken homes; hence some maladjusted individuals are
    products of broken homes.

    some well-informed people are stubborn individuals who never admit a mistake,
    some good teachers are not well-informed people.

    6.2] The Formal Nature of Syllogistic Argument
  - |-
    In all deductive logic we aim to discriminate valid arguments from invalid ones; in  
    Aristotelian Syllogistic logic this becomes the task of discriminating valid syllogisms  
    from invalid ones. It is reasonable to assume that the constituent propositions of a syl-  
    logism are all contingent—that is, that no one of those propositions is necessarily true,  
    or necessarily false. Under this assumption, the validity or invalidity of any syllogism  
    depends entirely on its form. Validity and invalidity are completely independent of  
    the specific content of the argument or its subject matter. Thus any syllogism of the  
    form AAA-1
    
    All M is P.  
    All S$ is M.  
    ". All S is P.
    
    is valid, regardless of its subject matter. The name of this syllogism's form is Barbara; no  
    matter what terms are substituted for the letters S, P, and M, the resulting argument, "in  
    Barbara," will always be valid. If we substitute "Athenians" and "humans" for S and P,  
    and "Greeks" for M, we obtain this valid argument:
    
    All Greeks are humans.  
    All Athenians are Greeks.  
    ". All Athenians are humans.
    
    6.2 The Formal Nature of Syllogistic Argument
    
    Mu
    
    If we substitute the terms "soaps," "water-soluble substances," and "sodium salts" for  
    the letters S, P, and M in the same form, we obtain
    
    All sodium salts are water-soluble substances.  
    All soaps are sodium salts.  
    Therefore all soaps are water-soluble substances.
    
    which also is valid.
  - |-
    A valid syllogism is valid in virtue of its form alone, and so we call it formally valid.
    
    We assume throughout that its constituent propositions are themselves contingent, that is, neither logically true (e.g., "All easy chairs are chairs") nor logically false (e.g., "Some easy chairs are not chairs"). The reason for the assumption is this: If it contained either a logically false premise or a logically true conclusion, then the argument would be valid regardless of its syllogistic form—valid in that it would be logically impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false. (We also assume that the only logical relations among the terms of the syllogism are those asserted or entailed by its premises. The point of these restrictions is to limit our considerations in this chapter and the next to syllogistic arguments alone and to exclude other kinds of arguments whose validity turns on more complex logical considerations that are not appropriate to introduce at this place.)
    
    If any syllogism is valid in virtue of its form alone, any other syllogism having that same form will also be valid; and if a syllogism is invalid, any other syllogism having that same form will also be invalid. The common recognition of this fact is attested to by the frequent use of logical analogies in argumentation. Suppose that we are presented with the argument
    
    All liberals are proponents of national health insurance.
    
    Some members of the administration are proponents of national health insurance.
    Therefore some members of the administration are liberals.
    
    and felt (justifiably) that, regardless of the truth or falsehood of its constituent propositions, the argument is invalid. The best way to expose its fallacious character is to construct another argument that has exactly the same form but whose invalidity is immediately apparent. We might seek to expose the given argument by replying: You might as well argue that
    
    All rabbits are very fast runners.
    Some horses are very fast runners.
    Therefore some horses are rabbits.
  - |-
    We might continue: You cannot seriously defend this argument, because here there is no
    question about the facts. The premises are known to be true and the conclusion is known
    to be false. Your argument is of the same pattern as this analogous one about horses and
    rabbits. This one is invalid—so your argument is invalid.
    
    This is an excellent method of arguing; the logical analogy is one of the most power-
    ful weapons that can be used in debate.
    
    Underlying the method of logical analogy is the fact that the validity or invalidity
    of such arguments as the categorical syllogism is a purely formal matter. Any fallacious
    argument can be proved to be invalid by finding a second argument that has exactly the
    same form and is known to be invalid by the fact that its premises are known to be true
    while its conclusion is known to be false. (It should be remembered that an invalid argu-
    ment may very well have a true conclusion—that an argument is invalid simply means
    that its conclusion is not logically implied or necessitated by its premises.)
    
    This method of testing the validity of arguments has serious limitations, however.
    Sometimes a logical analogy is difficult to "think up" on the spur of the moment. There
    are far too many invalid forms of syllogistic argument (well over two hundred!) for us
    to prepare and remember refuting analogies of each of them in advance. Moreover,
    although being able to think of a logical analogy with true premises and a false conclu-
    sion proves its form to be invalid, not being able to think of one does not prove the
    form valid, for it may merely reflect the limitations of our thinking. There may be an
    invalidating analogy even though we are not able to think of it. A more effective method
    of establishing the formal validity or invalidity of syllogisms is required. The explana-
    tion of effective methods of testing syllogisms is the object of the remaining sections
    of this chapter.

    6.3 | Venn Diagram Technique for Testing Syllogisms
  - |-
    In Chapter 5 we explained the use of two-circle Venn diagrams to represent standard-
    form categorical propositions. In order to test a categorical syllogism using Venn
    diagrams, one must first represent both of its premises in one diagram. That requires
    drawing three overlapping circles, for the two premises of a standard-form syllogism
    contain three different terms—minor term, major term, and middle term—which we
    abbreviate as S, P, and M, respectively. We first draw two circles, just as we did to diagram
    a single proposition, and then we draw a third circle beneath, overlapping both of the
    first two. We label the three circles S, P, and M, in that order. Just as one circle labeled
    S diagrammed both the class S and the class S, and as two overlapping circles labeled S$
    and P diagrammed four classes (SP, SP, SP, and SP), three overlapping circles, labeled S,
    P, and M, diagram eight classes: SPM, SPM, SPM, SPM, SPM, SPM, SPM, and SPM. These
    are represented by the eight parts into which the three circles divide the plane, as shown
    in Figure 6-1.
    
    Figure 6-1
    
    Figure 6-1 can be interpreted, for example, in terms of the various different classes
    determined by the class of all Swedes (5S), the class of all peasants (P), and the class of all
    musicians (M). SPM is the product of these three classes, which is the class of all Swedish
    peasant musicians. SPM is the product of the first two and the complement of the third,
    which is the class of all Swedish peasants who are not musicians. SPM is the product of
    the first and third and the complement of the second: the class of all Swedish musicians
    who are not peasants. SPM is the product of the first and the complements of the others:
    the class of all Swedes who are neither peasants nor musicians. Next, SPM is the product
    of the second and third and the complement of the first: the class of all peasants who are not
    Swedes and are musicians. SPM is the product of the second and the complements of the
    others: the class of all peasants who are neither Swedes nor musicians. SPM is the product
    of the third and first and the complement of the second: the class of all musicians who are not
    Swedes and are peasants. SPM is the product of the third and the complements of the
    others: the class of all musicians who are neither Swedes nor peasants. Finally, SPM is
    the product of the complements of all three: the class of all individuals who are neither
    Swedes, nor peasants, nor musicians.

    musicians who are not Swedes. SPM is the product of the second class with the comple-
    ments of the other two: the class of all peasants who are neither Swedes nor musicians.
    SPM is the product of the third class and the complements of the first two: the class of
    all musicians who are neither Swedes nor peasants. Finally, SPM is the product of the
    complements of the three original classes: the class of all things that are neither Swedes
    nor peasants nor musicians.
    
    If we focus our attention on just the two circles labeled P and M, it is clear that by
    shading out, or by inserting an x, we can diagram any standard-form categorical proposi-
    tion whose two terms are P and M, regardless of which is the subject term and which is
    the predicate. Thus, to diagram the proposition "All M is P" (MP = 0), we shade out all of
    M that is not contained in (or overlapped by) P. This area, it is seen, includes both the
    portions labeled SPM and SPM. The diagram then becomes Figure 6-2.
    
    Figure 6-2
    
    If we focus our attention on just the two circles S$ and M, by shading out, or by insert-
    ing an x, we can diagram any standard-form categorical proposition whose terms are S$
    and M, regardless of the order in which they appear in it. To diagram the proposition
    "All S is M" (SM = 0) we shade out all of S$ that is not contained in (or overlapped by) M.
    This area, it is seen, includes both the portions labeled SPM and SPM. The diagram for
    this proposition will appear as Figure 6-3.
    
    Figure 6-3
    
    The advantage of using three overlapping circles is that it allows us to diagram two
    propositions together—on the condition, of course, that only three different terms occur
    in them. Thus diagramming both "All M is P" and "All S is M" at the same time gives us
    Figure 6-4.

    6.3 Venn Diagram Technique for Testing Syllogisms
    
    Figure 6-4
    
    This is the diagram for both premises of the syllogism AAA-1:

    All M is P.
    All S$ is M.
    '. All Sis P.
    
    This syllogism is valid if and only if the two premises imply or entail the conclusion—
    that is, if together they say what is said by the conclusion. Consequently, diagramming the
    premises of a valid argument should suffice to diagram its conclusion also, with no
    further marking of the circles needed. To diagram the conclusion "All S is P" is to shade
    out both the portion labeled SPM and the portion labeled SPM. Inspecting the diagram
    that represents the two premises, we see that it also diagrams the conclusion (this is true
    even though the region SPM has been shaded, because the only region in class S$ that can
    still have members lies within class P—hence, "All S is P"). From this we can conclude
    that AAA-1 is a valid syllogism.
    
    Let us now apply the Venn diagram test to an obviously invalid syllogism, one con-
    taining three A propositions in the second figure:
    
    All dogs are mammals.
    All cats are mammals.
    Therefore all cats are dogs.
    
    Diagramming both premises gives us Figure 6-5.

    In this diagram, where the class of all cats corresponds to S, the class of all dogs
    corresponds to P, and the class of all mammals corresponds to M, the portions corre-
    spoding to SPM, SPM, and SPM, have been shaded out. But the conclusion has not
    been diagrammed, because the part SPM has been left unshaded, and to diagram the
    conclusion both SPM and SPM must be shaded. Thus we see that diagramming both the
    premises of a syllogism of form AAA-2 does not suffice to diagram its conclusion, which
    proves that the conclusion says something more than is said by the premises, which
    shows that the premises do not imply the conclusion. An argument whose premises do
    not imply its conclusion is invalid, so our diagram proves that the given syllogism is
    invalid. (It proves more: that any syllogism of the form AAA-2 is invalid.)

    When we use a Venn diagram to test a syllogism with one universal premise and one particular premise, it is important to diagram the universal premise first. Thus, in testing the AII-3 syllogism,
    
    All artists are egotists.
    Some artists are paupers.
    Therefore some paupers are egotists.
    
    we should diagram the universal premise, "All artists are egotists," before inserting an x to diagram the particular premise, "Some artists are paupers." Properly diagrammed, the syllogism looks like Figure 6-6.
    
    Paupers Egotists
    
    Artists
    
    Figure 6-6
    
    Had we tried to diagram the particular premise first, before the region SPM was shaded out along with SPM in diagramming the universal premise, we would not have known whether to insert an x in SPM or in SPM or in both. Had we put it in SPM or on the line separating it from SPM, the subsequent shading of SPM would have obscured the information the diagram was intended to exhibit. Now that the information contained in the premises has been inserted into the diagram, we can examine it to see whether the conclusion already has been diagrammed. If the conclusion, "Some paupers are egotists," has been diagrammed, there will be an x somewhere in the overlapping part of the circles labeled "Paupers" and "Egotists." This overlapping part consists of both of the regions SPM and SPM, which together constitute SP. There is an x in the region SPM, so there is an x in the overlapping part SP. What the conclusion of the syllogism says has already been diagrammed by the diagramming of its premises; therefore the syllogism is valid.
    
    Let us consider still another example, the discussion of which will bring out another important point about the use of Venn diagrams. Let's say we are testing the argument
    
    All great scientists are college graduates.
    Some professional athletes are college graduates.
    Therefore some professional athletes are great scientists.
    
    After diagramming the universal premise first (Figure 6-7) by shading out both regions SPM and SPM,

    We may still be puzzled about where to put the x needed in order to diagram the par-  
    ticular premise. That premise is "Some professional athletes are college graduates," so  
    an x must be inserted somewhere in the overlapping part of the two circles labeled  
    "Professional athletes" and "College graduates." That overlapping part, however, con-  
    tains two regions, SPM and SPM. In which of these should we put an x? The premises  
    do not tell us, and if we make an arbitrary decision to place it in one rather than the  
    other, we would be inserting more information into the diagram than the premises  
    warrant—which would spoil the diagram's use as a test for validity. Placing x's in each  
    of them would also go beyond what the premises assert. Yet by placing an x on the line  
    that divides the overlapping region SM into the two parts SPM and SPM, we can diagram  
    exactly what the second premise asserts without adding anything to it. Placing an x on  
    the line between two regions indicates that there is something that belongs in one of  
    them, but does not indicate which one. The completed diagram of both premises thus  
    looks like Figure 6-8.

    When we inspect this diagram of the premises to see whether the conclusion of the syllogism has already been diagrammed in it, we find that it has not. For the conclusion, "Some professional athletes are great scientists," to be diagrammed, an x must appear in the overlapping part of the two upper circles, either in SPM or in SPM. The first of these is shaded out and certainly contains no x. The diagram does not show an x in SPM either. True, there must be a member of either SPM or SPM, but the diagram does not tell us that it is in the former rather than the latter and so, for all the premises tell us, the conclusion may be false. We do not know that the conclusion is false, only that it is not asserted or implied by the premises. The latter is enough, however, to let us know that the argument is invalid. The diagram suffices to show not only that the given syllogism is invalid, but that all syllogisms of the form AII-2 are invalid.
    
    The general technique of using Venn diagrams to test the validity of any standard-form syllogism may be summarized as follows. First, label the circles of a three-circle Venn diagram with the syllogism's three terms. Next, diagram both premises, diagramming the universal one first if there is one universal and one particular, and being careful, in diagramming a particular proposition, to put an x on a line if the premises do not determine on which side of the line it should go. Finally, inspect the diagram to see whether the diagram of the premises contains a diagram of the conclusion: If it does, the syllogism is valid; if it does not, the syllogism is invalid.
  - |-
    What is the theoretical rationale for using Venn diagrams to distinguish valid from invalid syllogisms? The answer to this question divides into two parts. The first part has to do with the formal nature of syllogistic argument as explained in Section 6.2. It was shown there that one legitimate test of the validity or invalidity of a syllogism is to establish the validity or invalidity of a different syllogism that has exactly the same form. This technique is basic to the use of Venn diagrams.
    
    The explanation of how the diagrams serve this purpose constitutes the second part of the answer to our question. Ordinarily, a syllogism will be about classes of objects that are not all present, such as the class of all musicians, or great scientists, or sodium salts. The relations of inclusion or exclusion among such classes may be reasoned about and may be empirically discoverable in the course of scientific investigation. But they certainly are not open to direct inspection, because not all members of the classes involved are ever present at one time to be inspected. We can, however, examine situations of our own making, in which the only classes concerned contain by their very definitions only things that are present and open to direct inspection. We can argue syllogistically about such situations of our own making. Venn diagrams are devices for expressing standard-form categorical propositions, but they also are situations of our own making, patterns of graphite or ink on paper, or lines of chalk on blackboards. The propositions they express can be interpreted as referring to the diagrams themselves. An example can help to make this clear. Suppose we have a particular syllogism whose terms denote various kinds of people who are successful, interested in their work, and able to concentrate, and who may be scattered widely over all parts of the world:
    
    All successful people are people who are keenly interested in their work.
    
    No people who are keenly interested in their work are people whose attention is easily distracted when they are working.
    
    Therefore no people whose attention is easily distracted when they are working are successful people.
    
    Its form is AEE-4, and it may be schematized as
    
    All P is M.
    No M is S,
    Therefore No S is P.
  - |-
    We may test it by constructing the Venn diagram shown in Figure 6-9, in which regions
    SPM and SPM are shaded out to express the first premise, and SPM and SPM are shaded
    out to express the second premise.
    
    Examining Figure 6-9, we find that SP (which consists of the regions SPM and SPM)
    has been shaded out, so the syllogism's conclusion has already been diagrammed. How
    does this tell us that the given syllogism is valid? This syllogism concerns large classes of
    remote objects: There are many people whose attention is easily distracted when they are
    working, and they are scattered far and wide. However, we can construct a syllogism of
    the same form that involves objects that are immediately present and directly available
    for our inspection. These objects are the points within the unshaded portions of the
    circles labeled S, P, and M in our Venn diagram.
    
    6.3 Venn Diagram Technique for Testing Syllogisms
    
    Visual Logic
    
    Where do I place the x in a Venn diagram?
    
    In the Venn diagram representing a categorical syllogism, the three terms of the syllogism (minor, major,
    and middle) are represented by three interlocking circles labeled S, P, and M (the choice of S and P reflects
    the fact that the minor and major term of a syllogism correspond to the Subject and Predicate terms of
    its conclusion).
    
    M
    
    Diagram of three circles, S, P, and M, with nothing else showing
    
    When one of the premises of a syllogism calls for an x to be placed on a line in such a Venn diagram,
    we may ask: Which line? And why? Answer: The x is always placed on the line of the circle designating the
    class not mentioned in that premise.
    
    Example: Suppose you are given as premise, "Some S is M." You may not be able to determine
    whether the x representing that "some" is a P or is not a P—so the x goes on the line of the P circle, thus:
    
    S P
    
    M

    Another example: Suppose you are given as premise, "Some M is not P." You may not be able to deter-
    mine whether the M that is not P is an S or is not an S—so the x goes on the line of the S circle, thus:
    
    S P

    Figure 6-9
    
    Here is the new syllogism:
    
    All points within the unshaded part of the circle labeled P are points within the
    unshaded part of the circle labeled M.
    
    No points within the unshaded part of the circle labeled M are points within the
    unshaded part of the circle labeled S.
    
    Therefore no points within the unshaded part of the circle labeled S are points within
    the unshaded part of the circle labeled P.
    
    This new syllogism refers to nothing remote; it is about the parts of a situation we
    ourselves have created: the Venn diagram we have drawn. All the parts and all the pos-
    sibilities of inclusion and exclusion among these classes are immediately present to us
    and directly open to inspection. We can literally see all the possibilities here, and know
    that because all the points of P are also points of M, and because M and S have no points
    in common, S and P cannot possibly have any points in common. Because the new syl-
    logism refers only to classes of points in the diagram, it can be literally seen to be valid
    by looking at the things it talks about. The original syllogism about classes of people has
    exactly the same form as this second one, so we are assured by the formal nature of syl-
    logistic argument that the original syllogism is also valid. The explanation is exactly the
    same for Venn diagram proofs of the invalidity of invalid syllogisms; there, too, we test
    the original syllogism indirectly by testing directly a second syllogism that has exactly
    the same form and referring to the diagram that exhibits that form.
    
    John Venn
  - |-
    Born in Hull, Yorkshire, England, the son and grandson of Church of England evangelicals, John Venn (1834–1923) earned his degree in mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge University, in 1857—whereupon he became a Fellow of that College, remaining closely associated with it all his life. He was ordained a priest in 1859 but, coming to question his faith, he soon returned to Cambridge to teach logic and probability theory.
    
    It is the diagrams named after him that assure John Venn a special place in the history of logic. The idea that logical relations might be represented visually with diagrams had been pursued in some degree by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in the seventeenth century, and then again by the prolific Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the eighteenth century. But it was Venn who developed the system of visual representation so that it could be used readily and effectively in logic. His diagrams reinforce our understanding of the relations among propositions, and they provide a reliable and simple method for determining the validity or invalidity of syllogisms.
    
    Consider a circle as the visual representation of a set, or a class of things. Two intersecting circles represent the relations of two sets; three intersecting circles can thus represent the three categories (or terms) of the categorical syllogism. Venn had studied the work of George Boole, from which he advanced. With the Boolean interpretation of propositions, all of the 256 possible syllogistic forms—combinations of syllogistic moods and figures—can be represented on a simple, three-circle Venn diagram. It is a device as powerful as it is elegant. The "Venn diagram technique" for establishing the validity or invalidity of syllogisms is discussed in detail in Part II of this book.
  - |-
    Venn had some influence also on the development of statistics, and the theory of probability. He rejected the long-standing notion that the probability of an event is to be understood as the degree of "rational belief" in its occurrence. He insisted instead upon the objectivity of what came to be called the frequency theory of probability, thus making the determination of the probability of an event an empirical matter, as explained in the final chapter of this book. He remained active as teacher, inventor, and historian of his College until his death in 1923, but his great book was Symbolic Logic (1881), in which the analysis of categorical propositions was refined, and the force of categorical arguments made visually vivid. His drive for clarity and simplicity establishes John Venn as a great and permanent friend of the student of logic.
    
    EXERCISES
    
    A. Write out each of the following syllogistic forms, using S and P as the subject and predicate terms of the conclusion, and M as the middle term. (Refer to the chart of the four syllogistic figures, if necessary, on p. 214.) Then test the validity of each syllogistic form using a Venn diagram.
    
    Example
    
    1. AEE-1
    
    Solution
    
    We are told that this syllogism is in the first figure, and therefore the middle term, M, is the subject term of the major premise and the predicate term of the minor premise. (See chart on p. 214.) The conclusion of the syllogism is an E proposition and therefore reads: No S is P. The first (major) premise (which contains the predicate term of the conclusion) is an A proposition, and therefore reads: All M is P. The second (minor) premise (which contains the subject term of the conclusion) is an E proposition and therefore reads: No S is M. This syllogism therefore reads as follows:
    
    All M is P.
    No S is M.
    Therefore no S is P.
    
    Tested by means of a Venn diagram, as in Figure 6-10, this syllogism is shown to be invalid.

    6.4) Syllogistic Rules and Syllogistic Fallacies
  - |-
    A syllogism may fail to establish its conclusion in many different ways. To help
    avoid common errors we set forth rules—six of them—to guide the reasoner; any given
    standard-form syllogism can be evaluated by observing whether any one of these rules
    has been violated. Mastering the rules by which syllogisms may be evaluated also enriches
    our understanding of the syllogism itself; it helps us to see how syllogisms work and to
    see why they fail to work if the rules are broken.
    
    A violation of any one of these rules is a mistake, and it renders the syllogism invalid.
    Because it is a mistake of that special kind, we call it a fallacy; and because it is a mistake
    in the form of the argument, we call it a formal fallacy (to be contrasted with the informal
    fallacies described in Chapter 4). In reasoning with syllogisms, one must scrupulously
    avoid the fallacies that violations of the rules invariably yield. Each of these formal fal-
    lacies has a traditional name, explained below.
    
    Rule 1. Avoid four terms.
    
    A valid standard-form categorical syllogism must contain exactly three terms, each of which
    is used in the same sense throughout the argument.
    
    In every categorical syllogism, the conclusion asserts a relationship between two terms,
    the subject (minor term) and the predicate (major term). Such a conclusion can be justi-
    fied only if the premises assert the relationship of each of those two terms to the same
    third term (middle term). If the premises fail to do this consistently, the needed connec-
    tion of the two terms in the conclusion cannot be established, and the argument fails.
    So every valid categorical syllogism must involve three terms—no more and no less. If
    more than three terms are involved, the syllogism is invalid. The fallacy thus committed
    is called the fallacy of four terms.
  - |-
    The mistake that commonly underlies this fallacy is equivocation: using one word or phrase with two different meanings. Most often it is the middle term whose meaning is thus shifted, in one direction to connect it with the minor term, in a different direction to connect it with the major term. In doing this the two terms of the conclusion are connected with two different terms (rather than with the same middle term), and

    The formal fallacy
    that is committed
    when the middle term
    of a syllogism is not
    distributed in at least
    one premise.
    
    so the relationship asserted by the conclusion is not established. Because it is the mid-
    dle term that is most often manipulated, this fallacy is sometimes called "the fallacy of
    the ambiguous middle." However, this name is not generally applicable, because one
    (or more) of the other terms may have its meaning shifted as well. Ambiguities may
    result in as many as five or six different terms being involved, but the mistake retains
    its traditional name: the fallacy of four terms.
    
    When the expression categorical syllogism was defined at the beginning of this chap-
    ter, we noted that by its nature every syllogism must have three and only three terms.
    (The term syllogism is sometimes defined more broadly than it has been in this book. The
    informal fallacy of equivocation, explained and warned against in Chapter 4, may arise
    in many different argumentative contexts, of course.) So this rule ("Avoid four terms")
    may be regarded as a reminder to make sure that the argument being appraised really is
    a categorical syllogism.
    
    Rule 2. Distribute the middle term in at least one premise.
    
    A term is "distributed" in a proposition when (as was explained in Section 5.4) the proposition
    refers to all members of the class designated by that term. If the middle term is not distributed
    in at least one premise, the connection required by the conclusion cannot be made.
  - |-
    Historian Barbara Tuchman observed that many early critics of anarchism relied on the following "unconscious syllogism":
    
    All Russians were revolutionists.
    All anarchists were revolutionists.
    Therefore, all anarchists were Russians.
    
    This syllogism is plainly invalid. Its mistake is that it asserts a connection between anarchists and Russians by relying on the links between each of those classes and the class of revolutionists—but revolutionists is an undistributed term in both of the premises. The first premise does not refer to all revolutionists, and neither does the second.
    "Revolutionists" is the middle term in this argument, and if the middle term is not distributed in at least one premise of a syllogism, that syllogism cannot be valid. The fallacy this syllogism commits is called the fallacy of the undistributed middle.
    
    What underlies this rule is the need to link the minor and the major terms. If they are to be linked by the middle term, either the subject or the predicate of the conclusion must be related to the whole of the class designated by the middle term. If that is not so, it is possible that each of the terms in the conclusion may be connected to a different part of the middle term, and not necessarily connected with each other.
    
    This is precisely what happens in the syllogism given in the preceding example. The Russians are included in a part of the class of revolutionists (by the first premise), and the anarchists are included in a part of the class of revolutionists (by the second premise)—but different parts of this class (the middle term of the syllogism) may be involved, and so the middle term does not successfully link the minor and major terms of the syllogism. In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one premise.
    
    Rule 3. Any term distributed in the conclusion must be distributed in the premises.
    
    To refer to all members of a class is to say more about that class than is said when only some of its members are referred to. Therefore, when the conclusion of a syllogism distributes a term that was undistributed in the premises, it says more about that term than the
  - |-
    6.4 Syllogistic Rules and Syllogistic Fallacies
    
    premises did. But a valid argument is one whose premises logically entail its conclusion, and
    for that to be true the conclusion must not assert any more than is asserted in the premises.
    A term that is distributed in the conclusion but is not distributed in the premises is therefore
    a sure mark that the conclusion has gone beyond its premises and has reached too far. This
    is called the fallacy of illicit process.
    
    The conclusion may overreach with respect to either the minor term (its subject) or the
    major term (its predicate). So there are two different forms of illicit process, and different
    names have been given to the two formal fallacies involved. They are
    
    Illicit process of the major term (an illicit major).
    Illicit process of the minor term (an illicit minor).
    
    To illustrate an illicit process of the major term, consider this syllogism:
    All dogs are mammals.
    
    No cats are dogs.
    Therefore no cats are mammals.
    
    The reasoning is obviously bad, but where is the mistake? The mistake is in the conclu-
    sion's assertion about all mammals, saying that all of them fall outside the class of cats.
    Bear in mind that an A proposition distributes its subject term but does not distribute its
    predicate term. Hence the premises make no assertion about all mammals—so the con-
    clusion illicitly goes beyond what the premises assert. Because "mammals" is the major
    term in this syllogism, the fallacy here is that of an illicit major.
    
    To illustrate the illicit process of the minor term, consider this syllogism:
    
    All traditionally religious people are fundamentalists.
    All traditionally religious people are opponents of abortion.
    Therefore all opponents of abortion are fundamentalists.
    
    Again we sense quickly that something is wrong with this argument, and what is wrong
    is this: The conclusion makes an assertion about all opponents of abortion, but the
    premises make no such assertion; they say nothing about all abortion opponents. So the
    conclusion here goes illicitly beyond what the premises warrant. In this case "opponents
    of abortion" is the minor term, so the fallacy is that of an illicit minor.
    
    Rule 4. Avoid two negative premises.

    Any negative proposition (E or O) denies class inclusion; it asserts that some or all of one  
    class is excluded from the whole of the other class. Two premises asserting such exclusion  
    cannot yield the linkage that the conclusion asserts, and therefore cannot yield a valid argu-  
    ment. The mistake is named the fallacy of exclusive premises.
    
    Understanding the mistake identified here requires some reflection. Suppose we label  
    the minor, major, and middle terms of the syllogism S, P, and M, respectively. What can  
    two negative premises tell us about the relations of these three terms? They can tell us  
    that S (the subject of the conclusion) is wholly or partially excluded from all or part of  
    M (the middle term), and that P (the predicate of the conclusion) is wholly or partially  
    excluded from all or part of M. However, any one of these relations may very well be

    Existential fallacy  
    The formal fallacy that  
    is committed when,  
    
    in a standard-form  
    categorical syllogism,  
    a particular conclusion  
    is inferred from two  
    universal premises.
    
    established no matter how S and P are related. The negative premises cannot tell us  
    that S and P are related by inclusion or by exclusion, partial or complete. Two negative  
    premises (where M is a term in each) simply cannot justify the assertion of any relation-  
    ship whatever between S and P. Therefore, if both premises of a syllogism are negative,  
    the argument must be invalid.
    
    Rule 5. If either premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative.

    If the conclusion is affirmative—that is, if it asserts that one of the two classes, S or P, is wholly
    or partly contained in the other—it can only be inferred from premises that assert the existence of
    a third class that contains the first and is itself contained in the second. However, class inclusion
    can be stated only by affirmative propositions. Therefore, an affirmative conclusion can follow
    validly only from two affirmative premises. The mistake here is called the fallacy of drawing
    an affirmative conclusion from a negative premise.
    
    If an affirmative conclusion requires two affirmative premises, as has just been shown, we
    can know with certainty that if either of the premises is negative, the conclusion must
    also be negative, or the argument is not valid.
    
    Unlike some of the fallacies identified here, this fallacy is not common, because
    any argument that draws an affirmative conclusion from negative premises will be
    instantly recognized as highly implausible. Even an illustration of the mistake will
    appear strained:
    
    No poets are accountants.
    Some artists are poets.
    Therefore some artists are accountants.
    
    Immediately it will be seen that the exclusion of poets and accountants, asserted by the
    first premise of this syllogism, cannot justify any valid inference regarding the inclusion
    of artists and accountants.
    
    Rule 6. From two universal premises no particular conclusion may be drawn.
    
    In the Boolean interpretation of categorical propositions (explained in Section 5.7), universal
    propositions (A and E) have no existential import, but particular propositions (I and O) do
    have such import. Wherever the Boolean interpretation is supposed, as in this book, a rule is
    needed that precludes passage from premises that have no existential import to a conclusion
    that does have such import.
    
    This final rule is not needed in the traditional or Aristotelian account of the categorical
    syllogism, because that traditional account paid no attention to the problem of existen-
    tial import. However, when existential import is carefully considered, it will be clear that
    if the premises of an argument do not assert the existence of anything at all, the conclu-
    sion will be unwarranted when, from it, the existence of some thing may be inferred.
    The mistake is called the existential fallacy.
    
    Here is an example of a syllogism that commits this fallacy:
  - |-
    All household pets are domestic animals.
    No unicorns are domestic animals.
    Therefore some unicorns are not household pets.
    
    6.4 Syllogistic Rules and Syllogistic Fallacies
    
    If the conclusion of this argument were the universal proposition, "No unicorns are
    household pets," the syllogism would be perfectly valid for all. And because, under the
    traditional interpretation, existential import may be inferred from universal as well as
    from particular propositions, it would not be problematic (in that traditional view) to
    say that the conclusion in the example given here is simply a "weaker" version of the
    conclusion we all agree is validly drawn.
    
    In our Boolean view, however, the conclusion of the example ("Some unicorns
    are not household pets"), because it is a particular proposition, is not just "weaker,"
    it is very different. It is an O proposition, a particular proposition, and thus has an
    existential import that the E proposition ("No unicorns are household pets") cannot
    have. Reasoning that is acceptable under the traditional view is therefore unaccep-
    table under the Boolean view because, from the Boolean perspective, that reasoning
    commits the existential fallacy—a mistake that cannot be made under the traditional
    interpretation.
    
    Another interesting consequence of the difference between the traditional and the
    Boolean interpretation of categorical propositions is this: In the traditional view there
    is a need for a rule that states the converse of Rule 5 ("If either premise is negative, the
    conclusion must be negative"). The converse states simply that "If the conclusion of
    a valid syllogism is negative, at least one premise must be negative." That is indisput-
    able, because if the conclusion is negative, it denies inclusion. But affirmative premises
    assert inclusion; therefore affirmative premises cannot entail a negative conclusion. This
    corollary is unnecessary in the Boolean interpretation because the rule precluding the
    existential fallacy (Rule 6) will, in the presence of the other rules, suffice to invalidate
    any syllogism with affirmative premises and a negative conclusion.
  - |-
    The six rules given here are intended to apply only to standard-form categorical syllogisms. In this realm they provide an adequate test for the validity of any argument. If a standard-form categorical syllogism violates any one of these rules, it is invalid; if it conforms to all of these rules, it is valid.
    
    **Syllogistic Rules and Fallacies**

    2. Distribute the middle term in at least one premise. | Undistributed middle
    
    3. Any term distributed in the conclusion must be distributed in the premises. | Illicit process of the major term (illicit major); illicit process of the minor term (illicit minor)
    
    4. Avoid two negative premises. | Exclusive premises

    **EXERCISES**
    
    A. Identify the rule that is broken by invalid syllogisms of the following forms, and name
    the fallacy that each commits:
    
    Example
    
    1. AAA-2  
    
    --- 
    
    **Solution**
    
    Any syllogism in the second figure has the middle term as predicate of both the major
    and the minor premise. Thus any syllogism consisting of three A propositions, in the
    second figure, must read: All P is M; all S is M; therefore all S is P. Since M is not distributed
    in either of the premises in that form, it cannot validly be inferred from such premises
    that all S is P. Thus every syllogism of the form AAA-2 violates the rule that the middle
    term must be distributed in at least one premise, thereby committing the fallacy of the
    undistributed middle.

    B. Identify the rule that is broken by each invalid syllogism you can find in the following  
    exercises, and name the fallacy that is committed:  
    
    Example  
    
    1. All textbooks are books intended for careful study.  
    Some reference books are books intended for careful study.  
    Therefore some reference books are textbooks.  
    
    Solution  
    
    In this syllogism, "textbooks" is the major term (the predicate of the conclusion) and  
    "reference books" is the minor term (the subject of the conclusion). "Books intended  
    for careful study" is therefore the middle term, and it appears as the predicate of both  
    premises. In neither of the premises is this middle term distributed, so the syllogism vio-  
    lates the rule that the middle term must be distributed in at least one premise, thereby  
    committing the fallacy of the undistributed middle.  
    
    2. All criminal actions are wicked deeds.  
    All prosecutions for murder are criminal actions.  
    Therefore all prosecutions for murder are wicked deeds.

    1. All chocolate éclairs are fattening foods, because all chocolate éclairs are rich desserts,  
    and some fattening foods are not rich desserts.
    
    **Solution**
    
    In this syllogism the conclusion is affirmative ("all chocolate éclairs are fattening foods"),  
    while one of the premises is negative ("some fattening foods are not rich desserts"). The  
    syllogism therefore is invalid, violating the rule that if either premise is negative the con-  
    clusion must also be negative, thereby committing the fallacy of drawing an affirmative  
    conclusion from a negative premise.

    dangerous animals are not reptiles.
    
    4. Some foods that contain iron are toxic substances, for all fish containing mercury  
    are foods that contain iron, and all fish containing mercury are toxic substances.
    
    ***5. All opponents of basic economic and political changes are outspoken critics of the

    Exposition of the Fifteen Valid Forms of the
    Categorical Syllogism
    
    The mood of a syllogism is its character as determined by the forms (A, E, I, or O) of the three propositions it contains. There are sixty-four possible moods of the categorical syllogism—that is, sixty-four possible sets of three propositions: AAA, AAI, AAE, and so on, to... EOO, OOO.
    
    The figure of a syllogism is its logical shape, as determined by the position of the middle term in its premises. So there are four possible figures, which can be most clearly grasped if one has in mind a chart, or an iconic representation, of the four possibilities, as exhibited in the Overview table:

    6.5 Exposition of the Fifteen Valid Forms of the Categorical Syllogism
    
    It will be seen that:
    
    ° In the first figure the middle term is the subject of the major premise and the predicate of the minor premise;
    
    ° In the second figure the middle term is the predicate of both premises;
    
    ° In the third figure the middle term is the subject of both premises;
    
    ° In the fourth figure the middle term is the predicate of the major premise and the subject of the minor premise.
    
    Each of the sixty-four moods can appear in each of the four figures. The mood and figure of a given syllogism, taken together, uniquely determine the logical form of that syllogism. Therefore there are (as noted earlier) exactly 256 (that is, 64 x 4) possible forms of the standard-form categorical syllogism.
    
    The vast majority of these forms are not valid. We can eliminate every form that violates one or more of the syllogistic rules set forth in the preceding section. The forms that remain after this elimination are the only valid forms of the categorical syllogism. Of the 256 possible forms, there are exactly fifteen forms that cannot be eliminated and thus are valid. It should be borne in mind that we adopt here the Boolean interpretation of categorical propositions, according to which universal propositions (A and E propositions) do not have existential import. The classical interpretation of categorical propositions, according to which all the classes to which propositions refer do have members, makes acceptable some inferences that are found here to be invalid. Under that older interpretation, for example, it is plausible to infer the subaltern from its corresponding superaltern—to infer an I proposition from its corresponding A proposition, and an O proposition from its corresponding E proposition. This makes plausible the claim that there are other valid syllogisms (so-called "weakened syllogisms") that are not considered valid here. Compelling reasons for the rejection of that older interpretation (and hence the justification of our stricter standards for valid syllogisms) were given at some length in Section 5.7.
  - |-
    To advance the mastery of syllogistics, classical logicians gave a unique name to every  
    valid syllogism, each characterized completely by mood and figure. Understanding this  
    small set of valid forms, and knowing the name of each, is very useful when putting syl-  
    logistic reasoning to work. Each name, carefully devised, contained three vowels repre-  
    senting (in standard-form order: major premise, minor premise, conclusion) the mood of  
    the syllogism named. Where there are valid syllogisms of a given mood but in different  
    figures, a unique name was assigned to each. Thus, for example, a syllogism of the mood  
    EAE in the first figure was named Celarent, whereas a syllogism of the mood EAE in the  
    second figure, also valid, was named Cesare. The principles that governed the construc-  
    tion of those traditional names, the selection and placement of consonants as well as  
    vowels, were quite sophisticated. Some of these conventions relate to the place of the  
    weakened syllogisms noted just above and are therefore not acceptable in the Boolean  
    interpretation we adopt. Some other conventions remain acceptable. For example, the  
    letter s that follows the vowel e indicates that when that E proposition is converted  
    simpliciter, or simply (as all E propositions will convert), then that syllogism reduces to,  
    or is transformed into, another syllogism of the same mood in the first figure, which is  
    viewed as the most basic figure. To illustrate, Festino, in the second figure, reduces, when  
    its major premise is converted simply, to Ferio; and Cesare, in the second figure, reduces  
    to Celarent, and so on. The possibility of these and other reductions explains why the  
    names of groups of syllogisms begin with the same consonant. The intricate details of  
    the classical naming system need not be fully recounted here.
    
    chapter 6 Categorical Syllogisms
  - |-
    These names had (and still have) a very practical purpose: If one knows that only certain combinations of mood and figure are valid, and can recognize by name those valid arguments, the merit of any syllogism in a given figure, or of a given mood, can be determined almost immediately. For example, the mood AOQO is valid only in the second figure. That unique form (AOO-2) is known as Baroko. Here is an example of Baroko:
    
    All good mathematicians have creative intellects.
    Some scholars do not have creative intellects.
    Therefore some scholars are not good mathematicians.
    
    With practice one comes to recognize the cadence of the different valid forms. One who is familiar with Baroko and able to discern it readily may be confident that a syllogism of this mood presented in any other figure may be rejected as invalid.
    
    The standard form of the categorical syllogism is the key to the system. A neat and efficient method of identifying the few valid syllogisms from the many possible syllo-
    gisms is at hand, but it depends on the assumption that the propositions of the syllogism in question are in (or can be put into) standard order—major premise, minor premise, then conclusion. The unique identification of each valid syllogism relies on the specification of its mood, and its mood is determined by the letters characterizing its three constituent propositions in that standard order. If the premises of a valid syllogism were to be set forth in a different order, then that syllogism would remain valid, of course; the Venn diagram technique can prove this. However, much would be lost. Our ability to identify syllogisms uniquely, and with that identification our ability to comprehend the forms of those syllogisms fully and to test their validity crisply, all rely on their being in standard form.

    Classical logicians studied these forms closely, and they became fully familiar with
    their structure and their logical "feel." This elegant system, finely honed, enabled reason-
    ers confronting syllogisms in speech or in texts to recognize immediately those that were
    valid, and to detect with confidence those that were not. For centuries it was common
    practice to defend the solidity of reasoning in progress by giving the names of the forms
    of the valid syllogisms being relied on. The ability to provide these identifications even
    in the midst of heated oral disputes was considered a mark of learning and acumen,
    and it gave evidence that the chain of deductive reasoning being relied on was indeed
    unbroken. Once the theory of the syllogism has been fully mastered, this practical skill
    can be developed with profit and pleasure.
    
    Syllogistic reasoning was so very widely employed, and so highly regarded as the
    most essential tool of scholarly argument, that the logical treatises of its original and
    greatest master, Aristotle, were venerated for more than a thousand years. His analytical
    account of the syllogism still carries the simple name that conveys respect and awe: the
    Organon, the Instrument.
    
    Valid syllogisms are powerful weapons in controversy, but the effectiveness of those
    weapons depends, of course, on the truth of the premises. A great theologian, defiant
    in battling scholars who resisted his reform of the Catholic Church, wrote: "They may
    attack me with an army of six hundred syllogisms . . ."*
    
    * The burdensome consequences of ignoring standard form have been eloquently underscored by Keith Burgess-
    Jackson in his essay, "Why Standard Form Matters," October 2003.
    6.5 Exposition of the Fifteen Valid Forms of the Categorical Syllogism
  - |-
    As students of this remarkable logical system, our proficiency in syllogistics may be only moderate—but we will nevertheless find it useful to have before us a synoptic account of all the valid syllogisms. There are fifteen valid syllogisms under the Boolean interpretation. In the older tradition, in which reasoning from universal premises to particular conclusions was believed to be correct, the number of valid syllogisms (each uniquely named) was of course more than fifteen. To illustrate, if an I proposition may be inferred from its corresponding A proposition (as we think mistaken), the valid syllogism known as Barbara (AAA-1) will have a putatively valid "weakened" sister, Barbari (AAI-1); and if an O proposition may be inferred from its corresponding E proposition (as we think mistaken), the valid syllogism known as Camestres (AEE-2) will have a putatively valid "weakened" brother, Camestrop (AEO-2).
    These fifteen valid syllogisms may be divided by figure into four groups:
    
    The Fifteen Valid Forms of the Standard-Form
    Categorical Syllogism
    
    In the first figure (in which the middle term is the subject of the major premise and the predicate of the minor premise):

    6. EAE-2 Cesare
    7. AOO-2 Baroko
    8. ElO-2 Festino

    9. All-3 Datisi
    
    10. IAI-3 Disamis
    11. ElO-3 Ferison

    EXERCISES
  - |-
    At the conclusion of Section 6.3, in exercise group B (on pp. 204-5), ten syllogisms were
    to be tested using Venn diagrams. Of these ten syllogisms, numbers 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10 are
    valid. What is the name of each of these five valid syllogisms?
    
    Example
    
    Number 1 is IAI-3 (Disamis).
    
    Appendix: Deduction of the Fifteen Valid Forms of the
    Categorical Syllogism
    
    In Section 6.5 the fifteen valid forms of the categorical syllogism were identified and
    precisely characterized. The unique name of each syllogism is also given there—a name
    assigned in view of its unique combination of mood and figure. The summary account
    of these fifteen syllogisms appears in the Overview immediately preceding.
    
    It is possible to prove that these, and only these, are the valid forms of the categori-
    cal syllogism. This proof—the deduction of the valid forms of the categorical syllogism—is
    presented as an Appendix, rather than in the body of the chapter, because mastering it
    is not essential for the student of logic. However, understanding it can give one a deeper
    appreciation of the system of syllogistics. For those who derive satisfaction from the
    intricacies of analytical syllogistics, thinking through this deduction will be a pleasing,
    if somewhat arduous, challenge.
    
    We emphasize that if the chief aims of study are to recognize, understand, and
    apply the valid forms of the syllogism, as exhibited in Section 6.5, this Appendix may
    be bypassed.
    
    The deduction of the fifteen valid syllogisms is not easy to follow. Those who pursue
    it must keep two things very clearly in mind: (1) The rules of the syllogism, six basic rules
    set forth in Section 6.4, are the essential tools of the deduction; and (2) the four figures of
    the syllogism, as depicted in the Overview in Section 6.5 (p. 214) are referred to repeatedly
    as the rules are invoked.
  - |-
    We have seen that there are 256 possible forms of the syllogism, sixty-four moods (or combinations of the four categorical propositions) in each of the four figures. The deduction of the fifteen valid syllogisms proceeds by eliminating the syllogisms that violate one of the basic rules and that thus cannot be valid.
    
    The conclusion of every syllogism is a categorical proposition, either A, or E, or I, or O. We begin by dividing all the possible syllogistic forms into four groups, each group having a conclusion with a different form (A, E, I, or O). Every syllogism must of course fall into one of these four groups. Taking each of the four groups in turn, we ask what characteristics a valid syllogism with such a conclusion must possess. That is, we ask what forms are excluded by one or more of the syllogistic rules if the conclusion is an A proposition, and if the conclusion is an E proposition, and so on.
    
    Appendix: Deduction of the Fifteen Valid Forms of the Categorical Syllogism
    
    After excluding all those invalid syllogisms, only the valid syllogisms remain. To assist in visualization, we note in the margin as we proceed the moods and figures, and the names, of the fifteen valid categorical syllogisms.
    
    Case 1. If the conclusion of the syllogism is an A proposition
  - |-
    In this case, neither premise can be an E or an O proposition, because if either premise  
    is negative, the conclusion must be negative (Rule 5). Therefore the two premises must  
    be I or A propositions. The minor premise cannot be an I proposition because the minor  
    term (the subject of the conclusion, which is an A) is distributed in the conclusion, and  
    therefore if the minor premise were an I proposition, a term would be distributed in the  
    conclusion that is not distributed in the premises, violating Rule 3. The two premises,  
    major and minor, cannot be I and A, because if they were, the middle term of the syl-  
    logism would not be distributed in either premise, violating Rule 2. So the two premises  
    (if the conclusion is an A) must both be A as well, which means that the only possible  
    valid mood is AAA. But in the second figure AAA again results in the middle term being  
    distributed in neither premise; and in both the third figure and the fourth figure AAA  
    results in a term being distributed in the conclusion that is not distributed in the premise  
    in which it appears. Therefore, if the conclusion of the syllogism is an A proposition,  
    the only valid form it can take is AAA in the first figure. This valid form, AAA~1, is the  
    syllogism traditionally given the name Barbara.
    
    Summary of Case 1: If the syllogism has an A conclusion, there is only one pos-  
    sibly valid form: AAA-1—Barbara.
    
    Case 2. If the conclusion of the syllogism is an E proposition

    Both the subject and the predicate of an E proposition are distributed, and therefore all three terms in the premises of a syllogism having such a conclusion must be distributed, and this is possible only if one of the premises is also an E. Both premises cannot be E propositions, because two negative premises are never allowed (Rule 4), and the other premise cannot be an O proposition because then both premises would also be negative. Nor can the other premise be an I proposition, for if it were, a term distributed in the conclusion would then not be distributed in the premises, violating Rule 3. So the other premise must be an A, and the two premises must be either AE or EA. The only possible moods (if the conclusion of the syllogism is an E proposition) are therefore AEE and EAE.
    
    If the mood is AEE, it cannot be either in the first figure or in the third figure, because in either of those cases a term distributed in the conclusion would then not be distributed in the premises. Therefore, the mood AEE is possibly valid only in the second figure, AEE-2 (traditionally called Camestres), or in the fourth figure, AEE-4 (traditionally called Camenes). If the mood is EAE, it cannot be in the third figure or in the fourth figure, because again that would mean that a term distributed in the conclusion would not be distributed in the premises, which leaves as valid only the first figure, EAE-1 (traditionally called Celarent), and the second figure, EAE-2 (traditionally called Cesare.)
    
    Summary of Case 2: If the syllogism has an E conclusion, there are only four possibly valid forms: AEE-2, AEE-4, EAE-1, and EAE-2—Camestres, Camenes, Celarent, and Cesare, respectively.

    Case 3. If the conclusion is an I proposition
    
    In this case, neither premise can be an E or an O, because if either premise is negative,
    the conclusion must be negative (Rule 5). The two premises cannot both be A, because
    a syllogism with a particular conclusion cannot have two universal premises (Rule 6).
    Neither can both premises be I, because the middle term must be distributed in at least
    one premise (Rule 2). So the premises must be either AI or IA, and therefore the only
    possible moods with an I conclusion are AIT and IAI.
  - |-

    AII is not possibly valid in the second figure or in the fourth figure because the mid-
    dle term must be distributed in at least one premise. The only valid forms remaining for
    the mood AII, therefore, are AII-1 (traditionally called Darii) and AII-3 (traditionally
    called Datisi). If the mood is IAI, it cannot be IAI-1 or IAI-2, because they also would
    violate the rule that requires the middle term to be distributed in at least one premise.
    This leaves as valid only IAI-3 (traditionally called Disamis), and IAI-4 (traditionally
    called Dimaris).
    
    Summary of Case 3: If the syllogism has an I conclusion, there are only four pos-
    sibly valid forms: AII-1, AII-3, IAI-3, and IAI-4—Darii, Datisi, Disamis, and Dimaris,
    respectively.
    
    Case 4. If the conclusion is an O proposition
    
    In this case, the major premise cannot be an I proposition, because any term distributed
    in the conclusion must be distributed in the premises. So the major premise must be
    either an A or an E or an O proposition.
    
    Suppose the major premise is an A. In that case, the minor premise cannot be either
    an A or an E, because two universal premises are not permitted when the conclusion
    (an O) is particular. Neither can the minor premise then be an I, because if it were,
    either the middle term would not be distributed at all (a violation of Rule 2), or a term
    distributed in the conclusion would not be distributed in the premises. So, if the major
    premise is an A, the minor premise has to be an O, yielding the mood AOO. In the
    fourth figure, AOO cannot possibly be valid, because in that case the middle term would
    not be distributed, and in the first figure and the third figure AOO cannot possibly be
    valid either, because that would result in terms being distributed in the conclusion that
    were not distributed in the premises. For the mood AOO, the only possibly valid form
    remaining, if the major premise is an A, is therefore in the second figure, AOO-2 (tra-
    ditionally called Baroko).
  - |-
    Now suppose (if the conclusion is an O) that the major premise is an E. In that case,  
    the minor premise cannot be either an E or an O, because two negative premises are not  
    permitted. Nor can the minor premise be an A, because two universal premises are pre-  
    cluded if the conclusion is particular (Rule 6). This leaves only the mood ElO—and this  
    mood is valid in all four figures, traditionally known as Ferio (EIO-1), Festino (EIO-2),  
    Ferison (EIO-3), and Fresison (EIO-4).
    
    Finally, suppose (if the conclusion is an O) that the major premise is also an O propo-  
    sition. Then, again, the minor premise cannot be an E or an O, because two negative  
    premises are forbidden. The minor premise cannot be an I, because then the middle term  
    would not be distributed, or a term that is distributed in the conclusion would not be  
    distributed in the premises. Therefore, if the major premise is an O, the minor premise  
    must be an A, and the mood must be OAO. But OAO-1 is eliminated, because in that  
    case the middle term would not be distributed. OAO-2 and OAO-4 are also eliminated,  
    because in both a term distributed in the conclusion would then not be distributed in  
    the premises. This leaves as valid only OAO-3 (traditionally known as Bokardo).
    
    Summary of Case 4: If the syllogism has an O conclusion, there are only six pos-  
    sibly valid forms: AOO-2, EIO-1, EIO-2, EIO-3, EIO-4, and OAO-3—Baroko, Ferio,  
    Festino, Ferison, Fresison, and Bokardo.
  - |-
    This analysis has demonstrated, by elimination, that there are exactly fifteen valid forms of the categorical syllogism: one if the conclusion is an A proposition, four if the conclusion is an E proposition, four if the conclusion is an I proposition, and six if the conclusion is an O proposition. Of these fifteen valid forms, four are in the first figure, four are in the second figure, four are in the third figure, and three are in the fourth figure. This completes the deduction of the fifteen valid forms of the standard-form categorical syllogism.

    EXERCISES
    
    For students who enjoy the complexities of analytical syllogistics, here follow some theoretical questions whose answers can all be derived from the systematic application of the six rules of the syllogism set forth in Section 6.4. Answering these questions will be much easier if you have fully grasped the deduction of the fifteen valid syllogistic forms presented in this Appendix.
    
    Example
    
    1. Can any standard-form categorical syllogism be valid that contains exactly three terms, each of which is distributed in both of its occurrences?
    
    Solution
    
    No, such a syllogism cannot be valid. If each of the three terms were distributed in both of its occurrences, all three of the syllogism's propositions would have to be E propositions, and the mood of the syllogism would thus be EEE, which violates Rule 4, which forbids two negative premises.
    
    2. In what mood or moods, if any, can a first-figure standard-form categorical syllogism with a particular conclusion be valid?
    
    3. In what figure or figures, if any, can the premises of a valid standard-form categorical syllogism distribute both the major and minor terms?
    
    4. In what figure or figures, if any, can a valid standard-form categorical syllogism have two particular premises?
    
    *5. In what figure or figures, if any, can a valid standard-form categorical syllogism have only one term distributed, and that one only once?
  - |-
    6. In what mood or moods, if any, can a valid standard-form categorical syllogism have just two terms distributed, each one twice?
    
    7. In what mood or moods, if any, can a valid standard-form categorical syllogism have two affirmative premises and a negative conclusion?
    
    8. In what figure or figures, if any, can a valid standard-form categorical syllogism have a particular premise and a universal conclusion?
    
    9. In what mood or moods, if any, can a second-figure standard-form categorical syllogism with a universal conclusion be valid?
    
    *10. In what figure or figures, if any, can a valid standard-form categorical syllogism have its middle term distributed in both premises?
    
    11. Can a valid standard-form categorical syllogism have a term distributed in a premise that appears undistributed in the conclusion?
    
    Summary
    
    In this chapter we have examined the standard-form categorical syllogism: its elements, its forms, its validity, and the rules governing its proper use.
    In Section 6.1, the major, minor, and middle terms of a syllogism were identified:
    
    e Major term: the predicate of the conclusion  
    e Minor term: the subject of the conclusion  
    e Middle term: the third term appearing in both premises but not in the conclusion.
    
    We identified major and minor premises as those containing the major and minor terms, respectively.
    We specified that a categorical syllogism is in standard form when its propositions appear in precisely this order: major premise first, minor premise second, and conclusion last.
    
    We also explained in Section 6.1 how the mood and figure of a syllogism are determined.
    
    The mood of a syllogism is determined by the three letters identifying the forms of its three propositions, A, E, I, or O. There are sixty-four possible different moods.
    
    The figure of a syllogism is determined by the position of the middle term in its premises. The four possible figures are described and named thus:
    
    e First figure: The middle term is the subject term of the major premise and the predicate term of the minor premise.  
    Schematically: M-P, S—M, therefore S-P.
  - |-
    Here is the text with all formatting errors corrected and presented in a properly formatted manner:
    
    ---
    
    **Second figure**: The middle term is the predicate term of both premises.  
    Schematically: P-M, S—M, therefore S-P.
    
    **Third figure**: The middle term is the subject term of both premises.  
    Schematically: M-P, M-S, therefore S-P.
    
    **Fourth figure**: The middle term is the predicate term of the major premise and the subject term of the minor premise.  
    Schematically: P-M, M-S, therefore S-P.
    
    In Section 6.2, we explained how the mood and figure of a standard-form categorical syllogism jointly determine its logical form. Because each of the sixty-four moods may appear in all four figures, there are exactly 256 standard-form categorical syllogisms, of which only a few are valid.
    
    In Section 6.3, we explained the Venn diagram technique for testing the validity of syllogisms, using overlapping circles appropriately marked or shaded to exhibit the meaning of the premises.
    
    ---
    
    **Appendix: Deduction of the Fifteen Valid Forms of the Categorical Syllogism**
    
    In Section 6.4, we explained the six essential rules for standard-form syllogisms and named the fallacy that results when each of these rules is broken:
    
    - **Rule 1**: A standard-form categorical syllogism must contain exactly three terms, each of which is used in the same sense throughout the argument.  
      **Violation**: Fallacy of four terms.
    
    - **Rule 2**: In a valid standard-form categorical syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one premise.  
      **Violation**: Fallacy of undistributed middle.
    
    - **Rule 3**: In a valid standard-form categorical syllogism, if either term is distributed in the conclusion, then it must be distributed in the premises.  
      **Violation**: Fallacy of the illicit major, or fallacy of the illicit minor.
    
    - **Rule 4**: No standard-form categorical syllogism having two negative premises is valid.  
      **Violation**: Fallacy of exclusive premises.
    
    - **Rule 5**: If either premise of a valid standard-form categorical syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be negative.  
      **Violation**: Fallacy of drawing an affirmative conclusion from a negative premise.
    
    - **Rule 6**: No valid standard-form categorical syllogism with a particular conclusion can have two universal premises.  
      **Violation**: Existential fallacy.

    In Section 6.5, we presented an exposition of the fifteen valid forms of the categorical syllogism,
    identifying their moods and figures, and explaining their traditional Latin names:
    
    AAA-1 (Barbara); EAE-1 (Celarent); All-1 (Darii); ElO-1 (Ferio); AEE-2 (Camestres); EAE-2 (Cesare);
    AOO-2 (Baroko); ElO-2 (Festino); All-3 (Datisi); IAl-3 (Disamis); ElO-3 (Ferison); OAO-3 (Bokardo); AEE-4
    (Camenes); IAl-4 (Dimaris); El1O-4 (Fresison).
    
    In the Appendix to Chapter 6 (which may be bypassed), we presented the deduction of the fifteen
    valid forms of the categorical syllogism, demonstrating, through a process of elimination, that only those
    fifteen forms can avoid all violations of the six basic rules of the syllogism.

    In ordinary discourse the arguments we encounter rarely appear as neatly packaged,
    standard-form categorical syllogisms. So the syllogistic arguments that arise in everyday
    speech cannot always be readily tested. They can be tested, however, if we put them
    into standard form—and we can generally do that by reformulating their constituent
    propositions. The term syllogistic argument refers to any argument that either is a
    standard-form categorical syllogism or can be reformulated as a standard-form categorical
    syllogism without any loss or change of meaning.
    
    We want to be able to test the validity of syllogistic arguments. If they are falla-
    cious or misleading, that will be most easily detected, as Immanuel Kant pointed out,
    when they are set out in correct syllogistic form. The process of reformulation is there-
    fore important, because the effective tests discussed in Chapter 6—Venn diagrams and
    the rules for categorical syllogisms—cannot be applied directly until the syllogism is
    in standard form. Putting it into standard form is called reduction (or translation)
    to standard form. When we reformulate (or reduce) a loosely put argument that
    appears in ordinary language into a classical syllogism, the resulting argument is called a
    standard-form translation of the original argument. Effecting this reformulation can pre-
    sent some difficulties.
    
    We already know the tests for validity (Venn diagrams and the rules for syllogisms).
    What we need, to evaluate syllogistic arguments using these tests, are techniques for
    translating syllogistic arguments from their loose forms into standard form. With these
    techniques in hand, we can first translate the argument into standard form, and then test
    that argument using the Venn diagram method or the syllogistic rules.
    
    7.2. Reducing the Number of Terms to Three
    
    To describe the various techniques for reduction to standard form, we begin by
    noting the kinds of problems that create the need for them—that is, by noting dif-
    ferent ways in which a syllogistic argument in ordinary language may deviate from a
    standard-form categorical argument. Understanding those deviations, we can proceed
    to counteract them.
  - |-
    First deviation. The premises and conclusion of an argument in ordinary language  
    may appear in an order that is not the order of the standard-form syllogism. This  
    difficulty is easily remedied by reordering the premises: The major premise is put  
    first, the minor premise second, and the conclusion third. (Recall that the major  
    premise is the premise that contains the term that is the predicate term of the con-  
    clusion, whereas the minor premise contains the term that is the subject term of  
    the conclusion.)
    
    Second deviation. A standard-form categorical syllogism always has exactly three terms.  
    The premises of an argument in ordinary language may appear to involve more than  
    three terms—but that appearance may be deceptive. If the number of terms can be  
    reduced to three without loss of meaning, the reduction to standard form may be  
    successful.
    
    Third deviation. The component propositions of a syllogistic argument in ordinary lan-  
    guage may not all be standard-form propositions. This deviation is very common, but  
    if the components can be converted into standard-form propositions without loss  
    of meaning, the reduction to standard form may be successful.
    
    To cope with the second and third of these deviant patterns, there are known tech-  
    niques, which will now be explained.
    
    7.2) Reducing the Number of Terms to Three
    
    A valid syllogism must have exactly three terms. If more than three terms seem to be  
    involved in an argument of apparently syllogistic form, it may be possible to translate  
    the argument into a standard-form categorical syllogism that is equivalent to it but that  
    contains only three terms and is perfectly valid. How can that be done?
    
    One way is by eliminating synonyms. A synonym of one of the terms in the syllogism  
    is not really a fourth term, but only another way of referring to one of the three classes  
    involved. So we begin by eliminating synonyms, if any appear. For example, the follow-  
    ing syllogistic argument appears to contain six terms:

    Chapter 7 Syllogisms in Ordinary Language
    
    This argument in standard form, EAE-1 (Celarent), is plainly valid.
    
    A second way to reduce the number of terms to three is by eliminating class complements, a concept explained in Section 5.6. We illustrate this using the following syllogistic argument, whose propositions are standard-form categorical propositions:
    
    All mammals are warm-blooded animals.
    No lizards are warm-blooded animals.
    Therefore all lizards are nonmammals.
    
    On the surface, this argument appears to be invalid, because it seems to have four terms—and it also draws an affirmative conclusion from a negative premise, which breaks one of the rules of the syllogism.
    
    This argument, however, is perfectly valid when it is translated into standard form. We can reduce the number of terms to three, because two of the terms in it ("mammals" and "nonmammals") are complements of one another. So, by obverting the conclusion (to obvert a proposition, we change its quality and replace the predicate term by its complement), we get "No lizards are mammals." Using this valid immediate inference, we derive the following standard-form translation of the original argument:
    
    All mammals are warm-blooded animals.
    No lizards are warm-blooded animals.
    Therefore no lizards are mammals.
    
    which is logically equivalent to the original because it has identically the same premises and a logically equivalent conclusion. This standard-form translation conforms to all the syllogistic rules and thus is known to be valid. Its form is AEE-2 (Camestres).
    
    There may be more than one translation of a syllogistic argument into standard form, but if any one of those translations yields a valid syllogism, all the others must be valid as well. Thus, for example, the preceding illustrative argument can also be reduced to standard form in a different (but logically equivalent) way. This time we leave the conclusion unchanged and work with the premises. We take the contrapositive of the first premise, and we obvert the second premise. We then get:
    
    All non(warm-blooded animals) are nonmammals.

    All lizards are non(warm-blooded animals).
    
    Therefore all lizards are nonmammals.
    
    This is also a valid translation; its form is AAA-1 (Barbara), and it conforms to all the
    rules of the syllogism.
    
    Any syllogistic argument that appears to contain four terms can be reduced to stand-
    ard form (that is, can be translated into a logically equivalent standard-form categorical
    syllogism) if one of its terms is the complement of one of the other three. Likewise, reduc-
    tion from an argument with five terms is possible if two of its terms are complements
    of other terms in the argument; and even arguments with as many as six terms may be
    reduced to standard form if three of those terms are complements of other terms in the
    argument. The key to such reductions is to use the valid immediate inferences discussed
    in Chapter 5: conversion, obversion, and contraposition.
    227
    
    7.2. Reducing the Number of Terms to Three
    
    More than one immediate inference may be needed to reduce the argument to stand-
    ard form. Consider this example:
    
    No nonresidents are citizens.
    All noncitizens are nonvoters.
    Therefore all voters are residents.
    
    The argument has six terms, but it is valid, and that can be shown by reducing it to stand-
    ard form, which can be done in more than one way. Perhaps the most natural reduction
    is to convert and then obvert the first premise. This yields "All citizens are residents."
    Then take the contrapositive of the second premise, which yields "All voters are citizens."
    The argument is then in standard form:
    
    All citizens are residents.
    All voters are citizens.
    Therefore all voters are residents.
    
    The middle term ("citizens") is the subject term of the major premise and the predicate
    term of the minor premise, so the syllogism is in the first figure. Its three propositions
    are universal affirmatives. This is a syllogism in Barbara, AAA-1, and it is plainly valid.

    Translating Categorical Propositions

    It was noted in Section 7.1 that syllogistic arguments in ordinary language may deviate
    from standard-form categorical syllogisms not only because they may appear to contain
    more than three terms (as discussed in Section 7.2), but also because the component
    propositions of the syllogism in ordinary language may not all be standard-form propo-
    sitions. A, E, I, and O propositions are clearly somewhat stilted, and many syllogistic
    arguments in everyday life contain nonstandard-form propositions. To reduce these argu-
    ments to standard form requires that their constituent propositions be translated into
    standard form.
    
    It would be very convenient if there were some neat list of rules that we could use to
    effect such translations. Unfortunately, ordinary language is too rich and too multiform
    to permit the compilation of such a set of rules. Different sorts of transformation are
    called for in different settings, and to know what is called for we must, in every case,
    understand fully the given nonstandard-form proposition that needs to be reformulated.
    If we understand the proposition, we can reformulate it without losing or changing its
    meaning.
    
    Although no complete set of rules can be given, we can describe a number of
    well-tested methods for translating nonstandard propositions of different sorts. These
    methods—nine of them will be presented in this section—must be regarded as guides
    rather than rules; they are techniques with which nonstandard-form propositions of
    certain describable kinds can be reformulated into standard-form propositions that
    may serve as constituents of syllogistic arguments.
    7.3 Translating Categorical Propositions into Standard Form
    
    Singular Propositions. Some propositions affirm or deny that a specific indi-
    vidual or object belongs to a given class—for example, "Socrates is a philosopher,"
    and "This table is not an antique." These are called singular propositions.
    Such propositions do not affirm or deny the inclusion of one class in another (as
    standard-form propositions do), but we can nevertheless interpret a singular propo-
    sition as a proposition dealing with classes and their interrelations. We do this in
    the following way.
  - |-
    To every individual object there corresponds a unique unit class (one-membered  
    class) whose only member is that object itself. Then, to assert that an object s  
    belongs to a class P is logically equivalent to asserting that the unit class S contain-  
    ing just that object s is wholly included in the class P. And to assert that an object  
    s does not belong to a class P is logically equivalent to asserting that the unit class  
    S containing just that object s is wholly excluded from the class P.
    
    It is customary to make this interpretation automatically, without any notational  
    adjustment. Thus it is customary to take any affirmative singular proposition of the  
    form "s is P" as if it were already expressed as the logically equivalent A proposi-  
    tion, "All S is P," and we similarly understand any negative singular proposition,  
    "s is not P," as an alternative formulation of the logically equivalent E proposi-  
    tion, "No S is P"—in each case understanding S to designate the unit class whose  
    only member is the object s. Thus no explicit translations are provided for singular  
    propositions; traditionally they have been classified as A and E propositions as they  
    stand. As Kant remarked, "Logicians are justified in saying that, in the employment  
    of judgments in syllogisms, singular judgments can be treated like those that are  
    universal."!
    
    The situation, however, is not quite so simple. Bear in mind that particular  
    propositions have existential import, but universal propositions do not. Using this  
    Boolean interpretation (for reasons explained in Section 5.7), we find that if singular  
    propositions are treated mechanically as A and E propositions in syllogistic argu-  
    ments, and we check the validity of those arguments using Venn diagrams or the  
    rules set forth in Chapter 6, serious difficulties arise.
    
    In some cases, obviously valid two-premise arguments containing singular propo-  
    sitions translate into valid categorical syllogisms, such as when
    
    All His M. All His M.
    goes into the obviously valid
    
    sis an H. AAA-1 categorical syllogism in Barbar AML S is H.
    
    . Sisan M. Te EBON SYS mang ". AUS is M.
    
    In other cases, however, obviously valid two-premise arguments containing singu-  
    lar propositions translate into categorical syllogisms that are invalid, such as when

    All S is H.
    Some S is H.
    Some His M.
    Some His M.
    
    which commits the existential fallacy, violating Rule 6.
    
    On the other hand, if we translate singular propositions into particular propositions, there is the same kind of difficulty. In some cases, obviously valid two-premise arguments containing singular propositions translate into valid categorical syllogisms, such as when
    
    Singular proposition
    A proposition that asserts that a particular individual has (or does not have) some specified attribute.

    A class with only one member.

    All His M.
    Some S is M.
    All His M.

    ". Some S is H."
    
    In other cases, however, obviously valid two-premise arguments containing singular propositions translate into categorical syllogisms that are invalid, such as when
    
    Some S is M.
    Some S is H.
    Some His M.
    Some His M.
    
    which commits the fallacy of the undistributed middle, violating Rule 2.
    
    The difficulty arises from the fact that a singular proposition contains more information than is contained in any single one of the four standard-form categorical propositions. If "s is P" is construed as "All S is P," then what is lost is the existential import of the singular proposition, the fact that S is not empty. But if "s is P" is construed as "Some S is P," then what is lost is the universal aspect of the singular proposition, which distributes its subject term, the fact that all S is P.
  - |-
    The solution to the difficulty is to construe singular propositions as conjunctions of standard-form categorical propositions. An affirmative singular proposition is equivalent to the conjunction of the related A and I categorical propositions. Thus "sis P" is equivalent to "All Sis P" and "Some S is P." A negative singular proposition is equivalent to the conjunction of the related E and O categorical propositions. Thus "s is not P" is equivalent to "No S is P" and "Some S is not P." Venn diagrams for affirmative and negative singular propositions are shown in Figure 7-1.
    
    sis P sis not P
    
    Figure 7-1
    
    In applying the syllogistic rules to evaluate a syllogistic argument containing singular propositions, we must take account of all the information contained in those singular propositions, both distribution and existential import.
    
    If we keep in mind the existential import of singular propositions when we invoke the syllogistic rules or apply Venn diagrams to test the validity of syllogistic arguments, it is acceptable practice to regard singular propositions as universal (A or E) propositions.
    
    Categorical Propositions That Have Adjectives or Adjectival Phrases as Predicates, Rather Than Substantives or Class Terms. For example, "Some flowers are beautiful" and "No warships are available for active duty" are categorical propositions, yet they must be translated into standard-form categorical propositions; they deviate from standard form only in that their predicates, "beautiful" and "available for active duty," designate attributes rather than classes. However, every attribute determines a class, the class of things having that attribute, so every such proposition corresponds to a logically equivalent proposition that is in standard form. The two examples cited correspond to the I and E propositions "Some flowers are beautiful things" and "No warships are things available for active duty." When a categorical proposition is in standard form except that it has an adjectival predicate instead of a predicate term, the translation into standard form is made by replacing the adjectival predicate with a term designating the class of all objects of which the adjective may truly be predicated.
  - |-
    Categorical Propositions Whose Main Verbs Are Other than the Standard-Form Copula "To Be." Examples of this very common type are "All people seek recognition" and "Some people drink Greek wine." The usual method of translating such a statement into standard form is to regard all of it, except the subject term and the quantifier, as naming a class-defining characteristic. Those words can then be replaced by a term designating the class determined by that class-defining characteristic and may be linked to the subject with a standard copula. Thus the two examples given translate into the standard-form categorical propositions, "All people are seekers of recognition" and "Some people are Greek-wine drinkers."
    
    Statements in Which the Standard-Form Ingredients Are All Present But Not Arranged in Standard-Form Order. Two examples are "Racehorses are all thoroughbreds" and "All is well that ends well." In such cases, we first decide which is the subject term and then rearrange the words to express a standard-form categorical proposition. Such translations are usually quite straightforward. It is clear that the two preceding statements translate into the A propositions "All race-horses are thoroughbreds" and "All things that end well are things that are well."
    
    Categorical Propositions Whose Quantities Are Indicated by Words Other than the Standard-Form Quantifiers "All," "No," and "Some."
    Statements beginning with the words "every" and "any" are easily translated. The propositions "Every dog has its day" and "Any contribution will be appreciated" reduce to "All dogs are creatures that have their days" and "All contributions are things that are appreciated." Similar to "every" and "any" are "everything" and "anything." Paralleling these, but clearly restricted to classes of persons, are "every-one," "anyone," "whoever," "whosoever," "who," "one who," and the like. These should present no difficulty.
  - |-
    The grammatical particles "a" and "an" may also serve to indicate quantity, but whether they are being used to mean "all" or "some" depends largely on the context. Thus "A bat is a mammal" and "An elephant is a pachyderm" are reasonably interpreted as meaning "All bats are mammals" and "All elephants are pachyderms." But "A bat flew in the window" and "An elephant escaped" quite clearly do not refer to all bats or all elephants; they are properly reduced to "Some bats are creatures that flew in the window" and "Some elephants are creatures that escaped."
    
    The particle "the" may be used to refer either to a particular individual or to all the members of a class. There is little danger of ambiguity here, for such a statement as "The whale is a mammal" translates in almost any context into the A proposition "All whales are mammals," whereas the singular proposition "The first president was a military hero" is already in standard form as an A proposition (a singular proposition having existential import), as discussed in the first subparagraph of this section.

    In some contexts the article "the" is deliberately omitted to achieve desired

    return of "territory" captured by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, it was for-
    mally agreed that the English version of the Resolution would be authoritative,
    because the Resolution when expressed in French would require the definite article
    (le territoire), of which the English translation is "the territory," meaning all the
    territory captured, which is precisely what the agreed-upon English version care-
    fully refrains from saying. The omission of the definite article in English can be
    logically significant.

    lated into "All S is P," negative statements beginning with "not every" and "not
    any" are quite different. Their translations are much less obvious and require great
    care. Thus, for example, "Not every S is P" means that some S is not P, whereas
    "Not any S is P" means that no S is P.
    Exclusive Propositions. Categorical propositions involving the words "only"
    or "none but" are often called exclusive propositions, because in general they
    assert that the predicate applies exclusively to the subject named. Examples of
    such usages are "Only citizens can vote" and "None but the brave deserve the
    fair." The first translates into the standard-form categorical proposition, "All those
    who can vote are citizens," and the second into the standard-form categorical
    proposition, "All those who deserve the fair are those who are brave." Propositions
    beginning with "only" or "none but" usually translate into A propositions using
    this general rule: Reverse the subject and the predicate, and replace the "only"
    with "all." Thus "Only S is P" and "None but S's are P's" are usually understood
    to express "All P is S."
    
    There are some contexts in which "only" and "none but" are used to convey
    some further meaning. "Only S is P" or "None but S's are P's" may suggest either
    that "All S is P" or that "Some S is P." This is not always the case, however. Where
    context helps to determine meaning, attention must be paid to it, of course. But
    in the absence of such additional information, the translations first suggested are
    adequate.
  - |-
    Categorical Propositions That Contain No Words to Indicate Quantity.  
    Two examples are "Dogs are carnivorous" and "Children are present." Where there  
    is no quantifier, what the sentence is intended to express may be doubtful. We  
    may be able to determine its meaning only by examining the context in which it  
    occurs, and that examination usually will clear up our doubts. In the first exam-  
    ple it is very probable that "Dogs are carnivorous" refers to all dogs, and is to be  
    translated as "All dogs are carnivores." In the second example, on the other hand,  
    it is plain that only some children are referred to, and thus the standard-form trans-  
    lation of "Children are present" is "Some children are beings who are present."  
    Propositions That Do Not Resemble Standard-Form Categorical  
    Propositions But Can Be Translated into Standard Form. Some examples  
    are "Not all children believe in Santa Claus," "There are white elephants," "There  
    are no pink elephants," and "Nothing is both round and square." On reflection,  
    these propositions will be seen to be logically equivalent to, and therefore to  
    translate into, the following standard-form propositions: "Some children are not  
    believers in Santa Claus," "Some elephants are white things," "No elephants are  
    pink things," and "No round objects are square objects."

    IX. Exceptive Propositions. Some examples of exceptive propositions are "All Exceptive except employees are eligible," "All but employees are eligible," and "Employees Boe ton that alone are not eligible." Translating exceptive propositions into standard form is asserts that all members somewhat complicated, because propositions of this kind (much like singular of some class, with eas . . . the exception of the propositions) make two assertions rather than one.

Where "employees" is abbreviated ercontve prepositions to Sand "eligible persons" to P, these two propositions can be written as "All non-S are in reality compound, is P' and "No S is P." These are clearly independent and together assert that S and because they assert P are complementary classes. pon @ relation of class inclusion, and a relation of class exclusion. Each of these exceptive propositions is compound and therefore cannot be trans- _ translated into a single standard-form categorical proposition. Rather, each must be rcont employees sre translated into an explicit conjunction of two standard-form categoricals. Thus _ gligible" is an exceptive Proposition in which the three illustrative propositions about eligibility translate identically into "All — Proposition in which nonemployees are eligible persons, and no employees are eligible persons." i Allnonomployees are It should be noted that some arguments depend for their validity on numerical or quasi-numerical information that cannot be put into standard form. Such arguments may have constituent propositions that mention quantity more specifically than standard-form propositions do, usually by the use of quantifiers such as "one," "two," "three," "many," "a few," "most," and so on. When such specific quantitative information is critical to the validity of the argument in which it is mentioned, the argument itself is asyllogistic and therefore requires a more complicated analysis than that provided by the simple theory of the categorical syllogism. Yet some quasi-numerical quantifiers occur in arguments that do lend themselves

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:

    To syllogistic analysis. These include "almost all," "not quite all," "all but a few," and "almost everyone." Propositions in which these phrases appear as quantifiers may be treated like the explicitly exceptive propositions just described. Thus the following exceptive propositions with quasi-numerical quantifiers are also compound: "Almost all students were at the dance," "Not quite all students were at the dance," "All but a few students were at the dance," and "Only some students were at the dance." Each of these affirms that some students were at the dance and denies that all students were at the dance. The quasi-numerical information they present is irrelevant from the point of view of syllogistic inference, and all are translated as "Some students are persons who were at the dance, and some students are not persons who were at the dance."
    
    Because exceptive propositions are not categorical propositions but conjunctions, arguments containing them are not syllogistic arguments as we are using that term. But they may nevertheless be susceptible to syllogistic analysis and appraisal. How an argument containing an exceptive proposition should be tested depends on the exceptive proposition's position in the argument. If it is a premise, then the argument may have to be given two separate tests. For example, consider
    
    the argument:
    
    You  
    Everyone who saw the game was at the dance.  
    Not quite all the students were at the dance.  
    So some students didn't see the game.
    
    Its first premise and its conclusion are categorical propositions, which are easily translated into standard form. Its second premise, however, is an exceptive proposition, not simple but compound. To discover whether its premises imply its conclusion, first test the syllogism composed of the first premise of the given argument, the first half of its second premise, and its conclusion. In standard form, we have
    
    All persons who saw the game are persons who were at the dance.  
    Some students are persons who were at the dance.  
    Therefore some students are not persons who saw the game.
  - |-
    The standard-form categorical syllogism is of form AIO-2 and commits the fal-
    lacy of the undistributed middle, violating Rule 2. However, the original argument
    is not yet proved to be invalid, because the syllogism just tested contains only part
    of the premises of the original argument. We now have to test the categorical syl-
    logism composed of the first premise and the conclusion of the original argument
    together with the second half of the second premise. In standard form we then get
    a very different argument:
    
    All persons who saw the game are persons who were at the dance.
    Some students are not persons who were at the dance.
    Therefore some students are not persons who saw the game.
    
    This is a standard-form categorical syllogism in Baroko, AOO-2, and it is easily
    shown to be valid. Hence the original argument is valid, because the conclusion
    is the same, and the premises of the original argument include the premises of
    this valid standard-form syllogism. Thus, to test the validity of an argument, one
    of whose premises is an exceptive proposition, may require testing two different
    standard-form categorical syllogisms.
    
    If the premises of an argument are both categorical propositions, and its conclu-
    sion is exceptive, then we know it to be invalid, for although the two categorical
    premises may imply one or the other half of the compound conclusion, they can-
    not imply them both. Finally, if an argument contains exceptive propositions as
    both premises and conclusion, all possible syllogisms constructible out of the origi-
    nal argument may have to be tested to determine its validity. Enough has been
    explained to enable the student to cope with such situations.
    
    It is important to acquire facility in translating the many varieties of nonstandard-

    7.4 Uniform Translation
    
    For a syllogistic argument to be testable, it must be expressed in propositions that together
    contain exactly three terms. Sometimes this aim is difficult to accomplish and requires
    a more subtle approach than those suggested in the preceding sections. Consider the
    proposition, "The poor always you have with you." It clearly does not assert that all the
    poor are with you, or even that some (particular) poor are always with you. There are alter-
    native methods of reducing this proposition to standard form, but one perfectly natural
    route is by way of the key word "always." This word means "at all times" and suggests
    the standard-form categorical proposition, "All times are times when you have the poor
    with you." The word "times," which appears in both the subject and the predicate terms,
    may be regarded as a parameter, an auxiliary symbol that is helpful in expressing the
    original assertion in standard form.
  - |-
    Care should be taken not to introduce and use parameters in a mechanical, unthink-
    ing fashion. One must be guided always by an understanding of the proposition to be
    translated. Thus the proposition, "Smith always wins at billiards," pretty clearly does
    not assert that Smith is incessantly, at all times, winning at billiards! It is more reason-
    able to interpret it as meaning that Smith wins at billiards whenever he plays. And so

    understood, it translates directly into "All times when Smith plays billiards are times
    when Smith wins at billiards."
    
    Not all parameters need be temporal. To translate some propositions into standard
    form, the words "places" and "cases" can be introduced as parameters. Thus "Where
    there is no vision the people perish" and "Jones loses a sale whenever he is late" translate
    into "All places where there is no vision are places where the people perish" and "All
    cases in which Jones is late are cases in which Jones loses a sale."
    
    The introduction of parameters often is requisite for the uniform translation of
    all three constituent propositions of a syllogistic argument into standard form. Because a
    categorical syllogism contains exactly three terms, to test a syllogistic argument we must
    translate its constituent propositions into standard-form categorical propositions that
    contain just three terms. The elimination of synonyms and the applications of conver-
    sion, obversion, and contraposition have already been discussed in Section 7.2. However,
    for many syllogistic arguments, the number of terms cannot be reduced to three either
    by eliminating synonyms or by applying conversion, obversion, or contraposition. Here
    uniform translation requires the introduction of a parameter—the same parameter—into
    all three of the constituent propositions. Consider the following argument:

    Soiled paper plates are scattered only where careless people have picnicked.
    There are soiled paper plates scattered about here.
    Therefore careless people must have been picnicking here.
    
    This argument is perfectly valid, but before it can be proved valid by our diagrams or
    rules, its premises and conclusion must be translated into standard-form categorical
    propositions involving only three terms. The second premise and the conclusion may
    be translated most naturally into "Some soiled paper plates are things that are scattered
    about here" and "Some careless people are those who have been picnicking here," but
    these two statements contain four different terms. To reduce the argument to standard
    form, we begin with the first premise, which requires a parameter for its standard-form
    expression, and then we use the same parameter in translating the second premise and
    the conclusion into standard form. The word "where" in the first premise suggests that
    the parameter "places" can be used. If this parameter is used to obtain uniform standard-
    form translations of all three propositions, the argument translates into:
    
    All places where soiled paper plates are scattered are places where careless people have
    picnicked.
    
    This place is a place where soiled paper plates are scattered.
    
    Therefore this place is a place where careless people have picnicked.
    
    This standard-form categorical syllogism is in Barbara with mood and figure AAA-1 and
    has already been proved valid.
    
    The notion of standardizing expressions through the use of a parameter is not an
    altogether easy one to grasp, but some syllogistic arguments cannot be translated into
    standard-form categorical syllogisms by any other method. Another example may help
    to make clear the technique involved. Let us take the argument:
    
    The hounds bay wherever a fox has passed, so the fox must have taken another path, because the hounds
    are quiet.

    First, we must understand what is asserted in the given argument. We may take the
    statement that the hounds are quiet as asserting that the hounds are not baying here
    and now. This step is part of the necessary process of eliminating synonyms, because
    the first assertion makes explicit reference to the baying of hounds. And in the same
    manner we may understand the conclusion that the fox must have taken another path
    as asserting that the fox did not pass here. The word "wherever" in the first assertion
    should suggest that the parameter "places" can be used in its translation. The standard-
    form translation thus arrived at is
    
    All places where a fox has passed are places where the hounds bay.
    This place is not a place where the hounds bay.
    Therefore this place is not a place where a fox has passed.
    
    This standard-form categorical syllogism is in Camestres, with mood and figure AEE-2,

    Syllogistic arguments occur frequently, but their premises and conclusions are not always  
    stated explicitly. Often only part of the argument is expressed, the rest being "under-  
    stood." Thus one may justify the conclusion that "Jones is a citizen" by mentioning only  
    the one premise, "Jones is a native-born American." As stated, the argument is incom-  
    plete, but the missing premise is easily supplied from knowledge of the Constitution of  
    the United States. If the missing premise were stated, the completed argument would  
    appear as
    
    All native-born Americans are citizens.  
    Jones is a native-born American.  
    Therefore Jones is a citizen.

    Stated in full, the argument is a categorical syllogism of form AAA-1, Barbara, and is
    perfectly valid. An argument that is stated incompletely, part being "understood" or
    only "in the mind," is called an enthymeme. An incompletely stated argument is
    characterized as being enthymematic.
    
    In everyday discourse, and even in science, many inferences are expressed enthy-
    mematically. The reason is easy to understand. A large body of propositions can be
    presumed to be common knowledge, and many speakers and writers save themselves
    trouble by not repeating well-known and perhaps trivially true propositions that their
    hearers or readers can perfectly well be expected to supply for themselves. Moreover,
    it is not at all unusual for an argument to be rhetorically more powerful and per-
    suasive when stated enthymematically than when enunciated in complete detail. As
    Aristotle wrote in his Rhetoric, "Speeches that... rely on enthymemes excite the louder
    applause."
    
    Because an enthymeme is incomplete, its omitted parts must be taken into account
    when testing its validity. Without the missing premise, the inference is invalid. However,
    when the unexpressed premise is easily supplied, in all fairness it ought to be included
    as part of the argument when one is appraising it. In such a case, one assumes that the
    maker of the argument did have more in mind than was stated explicitly. In most cases
    there is no difficulty in supplying the tacit premise that the speaker (or writer) intended
    but did not express. Thus, for example, as he explains the solution to the mystery in
    "The Adventure of Silver Blaze," Sherlock Holmes formulates an argument of which one
    critical premise is left unstated yet is very plainly supposed:
    
    A dog was kept in the stalls, and yet, though someone had been in and fetched out a horse, the dog had not
    barked... . Obviously the visitor was someone whom the dog knew well.
    
    We all understand very well what is tacit here, that the dog would have barked had the
    visitor been a stranger. In fairness to the author, Arthur Conan Doyle, that premise must
    be seen as part of Holmes's argument.
  - |-
    In supplying a suppressed premise, a cardinal principle is that the proposition must be one that speakers can safely presume their hearers to accept as true. Thus it would be foolish to suggest taking the conclusion itself as a suppressed premise, for if the arguer could have expected the auditors to accept that proposition as a premise, without proof, it would have been idle to present it to them as the conclusion of an argument.
    
    7.5 Enthymemes
    
    Enthymeme
    
    An argument that is stated incompletely, the unstated part of it being taken for granted.
    An enthymeme may be of the first, second, or third order, depending upon whether the unstated proposition is the major premise, the minor premise, or the conclusion of the argument.

    Any kind of argument can be expressed enthymematically, but the kinds of enthy-
    memes that have been most extensively studied are incompletely expressed syllogis-
    tic arguments. We confine our attention to these in the remainder of this section.
    Enthymemes traditionally have been divided into different orders, according to which
    part of the syllogism is left unexpressed. A first-order enthymeme is one in which
    the syllogism's major premise is not stated. The preceding example is of the first order.
    A second-order enthymeme is one in which only the major premise and the conclu-
    sion are stated, the minor premise being suppressed. An example of this type is "All stu-
    dents are opposed to the new regulations, so all sophomores are opposed to them." Here
    the minor premise is easily supplied, being the obviously true proposition, "All sopho-
    mores are students." A third-order enthymeme is one in which both premises are
    stated, but the conclusion is left unexpressed. An example of this type is the following:
    
    Our ideas reach no farther than our experience: we have no experience of divine attributes and operations:
    | need not conclude my syllogism: you can draw the inference yourself.
    
    Two steps are involved in testing an enthymeme for validity: The first is to supply the
    missing part of the argument, the second is to test the resulting syllogism. Formulating
    the unstated proposition fairly may require sensitivity to the context and an understand-
    ing of the intentions of the speaker. Consider the following argument: "No true Christian
    is vain, but some churchgoers are vain." It is the conclusion that remains unstated, so
    this is plainly a third-order syllogism. What is the intended conclusion? If the speaker
    intends to imply only that "Some churchgoers are not true Christians," the argument is
    valid (EIO-2, Festino). However, if the speaker's intention is to establish that "Some true
    Christians are not churchgoers," the enthymeme is invalid (IEO-2), because in that case
    the fallacy of illicit process of the major term is committed.

    Usually, the context indicates unambiguously what the unstated proposition is. For
    example, in a U.S. Supreme Court opinion in which federal legislation regulating intra-
    state violence motivated by gender (the Violence Against Women Act) was held uncon-
    stitutional, the critical argument of the majority was expressed thus:
    
    Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity... . Thus far in
    our nation's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that
    activity is economic in nature?
    
    The proposition that is understood but not stated in this argument is assuredly its conclu-
    sion: that gender-motivated crimes of violence may not be regulated by Congress under
    the long-existing precedent of Supreme Court cases.
    
    To test this third-order enthymeme, we reformulate the argument so that its premises
    and (tacit) conclusion are in standard form. The major premise (the premise containing
    the predicate of the conclusion) is stated first; then mood and figure are identified:
    
    Major premise: All activities that may be regulated by Congress under the precedent of
    Supreme Court cases are economic activities.
    
    Minor premise: No intrastate gender-motivated crimes of violence are economic
    activities.
    
    Conclusion (unstated but clearly indicated by the context): No intrastate gender-
    motivated crimes of violence are activities that may be regulated by Congress under
    the precedent of Supreme Court cases.
    The mood of this syllogism is AEE; it is in the second figure because the middle term
    is the predicate of both premises. Its form is therefore Camestres, a valid syllogistic
    argument.
    
    In some cases a third-order enthymeme may seem to be invalid without regard to
    context—for example, when both premises are negative, or when both premises are
    particular propositions, or when their common term is undistributed. In such cases, no
    syllogistic conclusion could follow validly, and hence such enthymemes are invalid in
    any context.

    If it is one of the premises of the argument that is missing, it may be possible to make
    the argument valid only by adding a premise that is highly implausible—and pointing
    this out is certainly a legitimate criticism of an enthymematic argument. An even more
    crushing criticism, of course, would be to show that no additional premise, however
    implausible, can transform the enthymeme into a valid categorical syllogism.
    
    The difference between enthymemes and normal syllogisms is essentially rhetorical,
    not logical. No new logical principles need be introduced in dealing with enthymemes,
    and they must be tested, ultimately, by the same methods that apply to standard-form
    categorical syllogisms.

    EXERCISES
    
    For each of the following enthymematic arguments:
    
    a. Formulate the plausible premise or conclusion, if any, that is missing but understood.
    
    b. Write the argument in standard form, including the missing premise or conclusion
    needed to make the completed argument valid—if possible—using parameters if
    necessary.
    
    c. Name the order of the enthymeme.
    
    d. If the argument is not valid even with the understood premise included, name the
    fallacy that it commits.

    Solution
    
    a. The premise understood but not stated here is that whatever is manmade is patentable.
    b. Standard-form translation:
    
    All manmade things are patentable things.
    
    All transgenic animals are manmade things.
    Therefore, all transgenic animals are patentable things.
    
    c. The enthymeme is first-order, because the premise taken as understood is the major
    premise of the completed argument.
    d. This is a valid syllogism of the form AAA-1, Barbara.

    Sorites
    
    An argument whose
    conclusion is inferred
    from its premises by
    
    a chain of syllogistic
    inferences in which
    the conclusion of each
    inference serves as a
    premise for the next,
    and the conclusion of
    the last syllogism is the
    conclusion of the entire
    argument.
    
    7.6 | Sorites
    
    Sometimes a single categorical syllogism will not suffice to account for our ability to draw
    a desired conclusion from a group of premises. Thus, from the premises
    
    All diplomats are tactful.
    Some government officials are diplomats.
    All government officials are people in public life.
    
    one cannot draw the conclusion
    Some people in public life are tactful.
    
    using a single syllogistic inference. Yet the indicated conclusion is entailed by the stated
    premises. To derive it requires two syllogisms rather than one. A stepwise process of
    argumentation must be resorted to, in which each step is a separate categorical syllogism.
    When stated explicitly, the required argument is
    
    All diplomats are tactful individuals.
    Some government officials are diplomats.
    Therefore some government officials are tactful individuals.
    
    All government officials are people in public life.
    Therefore some people in public life are tactful individuals.
  - |-
    This argument is not a syllogism but a chain of categorical syllogisms, connected by the conclusion of the first, which is a premise of the second. This chain has only two links, but more extended arguments may consist of a greater number. Because a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, an argument of this type is valid if, and only if, all of its constituent syllogisms are valid.
    
    Where such an argument is expressed enthymematically, with only the premises and the final conclusion stated, it is called a sorites (pronounced so-r1-'-tez—from the Greek, soros, meaning "heap or pile"; a sorites is a pile of syllogisms). Sorites may have three, four, or any number of premises. Some are very lengthy indeed. The following example is drawn from the Monadology of the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz:
    
    The human soul is a thing whose activity is thinking. A thing whose activity is thinking is one whose activity is immediately apprehended, and without any representation of parts therein. A thing whose activity is immediately apprehended without any representation of parts therein is a thing whose activity does not contain parts. A thing whose activity does not contain parts is one whose activity is not motion. A thing whose activity is not motion is not a body. What is not a body is not in space. What is not in space is insusceptible of motion. What is insusceptible of motion is indissoluble (for dissolution is a movement of parts). What is indissoluble is incorruptible. What is incorruptible is immortal. Therefore the human soul is immortal.
    
    This sorites contains ten premises! Any sorites may be tested by making its intermediate conclusions or steps explicit, then testing separately the various categorical syllogisms
    thus obtained. If we ignore the possibility that an equivocation is present, then the validity of Leibniz's sorites is easily verified.
  - |-
    It is convenient to note here, in connection with the exercises at the end of this sec-
    tion, that a sorites is in standard form when all of its propositions are in standard form,
    when each term occurs exactly twice, and when every proposition (except the last) has
    a term in common with the proposition that immediately follows it. Thus one standard-

    7.7 | Disjunctive and Hypothetical Syllogisms
    
    Propositions are categorical when they affirm or deny the inclusion or exclusion of cat-
    egories or classes. Syllogisms, arguments consisting of two premises and a conclusion,
    are called categorical when the propositions they contain are categorical. Up to this
    point our analysis has been of categorical syllogisms only. However, a syllogism may
    contain propositions that are not categorical. Such cases are not called categorical syl-
    logisms but are instead named on the basis of the kind of propositions they contain.
    Here we look briefly at some other kinds of propositions and the syllogisms to which
    they give rise.
    
    The categorical propositions with which we are familiar are simple in the sense that
    they have a single component, which affirms or denies some class relation. In contrast,
    some propositions are compound, in that they contain more than one component, each
    of which is itself some other proposition.
    
    Consider first the disjunctive (or alternative) proposition. An example is "She was
    driven either by stupidity or by arrogance." Its two components are "she was driven by
    stupidity" and "she was driven by arrogance." The disjunctive proposition contains those
    two component propositions, which are called its disjuncts. The disjunctive proposition
    does not categorically affirm the truth of either one of its disjuncts, but says that at least
    one of them is true, allowing for the possibility that both may be true.
  - |-
    If we have a disjunction as one premise, and as another premise the denial or contradictory of one of its two disjuncts, then we can validly infer that the other disjunct in that disjunction is true.
    
    Chapter 7 Syllogisms in Ordinary Language
    
    Disjunctive
    Syllogism
    
    A syllogism in which one of the premises is a disjunction, the other premise is the denial or the contradictory of one of the two disjuncts in the first premise, and the conclusion is the statement that the other disjunct in that first premise is true.
    
    Pure hypothetical
    syllogism
    
    A syllogism that contains only hypothetical propositions.
    
    that disjunction is true. Any argument of this form is a valid Disjunctive Syllogism.
    A letter writer, critical of a woman nominated for high office by President George W.
    Bush, wrote:
    
    In trying to cover up her own illegal alien peccadillo or stonewall her way out of it, she was driven either by stupidity or arrogance. She's obviously not stupid; her plight must result, then, from her arrogance."
    
    As we use the term in this section, not every Disjunctive Syllogism is valid. The
    argument
    
    She was either arrogant or stupid.
    She was arrogant.
    Therefore she was not stupid.
    
    is an example of what may be called an invalid Disjunctive Syllogism. We readily see
    that, even if the premises were true, she may have been arrogant and stupid—we read-
    ily see that the premises can both be true and the conclusion false, and that, therefore,
    this Disjunctive Syllogism is invalid. The truth of one disjunct of a disjunction does not
    imply the falsehood of the other disjunct, because both disjuncts of a disjunction can be
    true. We have a valid Disjunctive Syllogism, therefore, only where the categorical premise
    contradicts one disjunct of the disjunctive premise and the conclusion affirms the other
    disjunct of the disjunctive premise.
    
    An objection might be raised at this point, based on such an argument as the
    following:
  - |-

    Either Smith is in New York or Smith is in Paris.
    Smith is in New York.
    Therefore Smith is not in Paris.
    
    Here the categorical premise affirms one disjunct of the stated disjunction, and the
    conclusion contradicts the other disjunct, yet the conclusion seems to follow validly.
    Closer analysis shows, however, that the stated disjunction plays no role in the argument. The conclusion follows enthymematically from the second, categorical premise,
    with the unexpressed additional premise being the obviously true proposition that
    "Smith cannot be both in New York and in Paris," which can be stated in disjunctive
    form as
    
    Either Smith is not in New York or Smith is not in Paris.
    
    When this tacit premise is supplied and the superfluous original disjunction is discarded,
    the resulting argument is easily seen to be a valid Disjunctive Syllogism. The apparent
    exception is not really an exception, and the objection is groundless.
    
    The second kind of compound proposition we consider is the conditional (or hypothetical)
    proposition, an example of which is "If the first native is a politician, then the first
    native lies." A conditional proposition contains two component propositions: The one
    following the "if" is the antecedent, and the one following the "then" is the consequent.
    A syllogism that contains conditional propositions exclusively is called a pure hypothetical
    syllogism; for example,
    
    7.7 Disjunctive and Hypothetical Syllogisms
    
    If the first native is a politician, then he lies.
    
    If he lies, then he denies being a politician.
    Therefore if the first native is a politician, then he denies being a politician.
    
    In this argument it can be observed that the first premise and the conclusion have the
    same antecedent, that the second premise and the conclusion have the same consequent,
    and that the consequent of the first premise is the same as the antecedent of the second
    premise. It should be clear that any pure hypothetical syllogism whose premises and
    conclusion have their component parts so related is a valid argument.
    
    A syllogism that has one conditional premise and one categorical premise is called a
    mixed hypothetical syllogism. Two valid forms of the mixed hypothetical syllogism
    have been given special names. The first is illustrated by
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    If the second native told the truth, then only one native is a politician.  
    The second native told the truth.  
    Therefore, only one native is a politician.
    
    Here, the categorical premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional premise, and the conclusion affirms its consequent. Any argument of this form is valid and is said to be in the affirmative mood or *modus ponens* (from the Latin *ponere*, meaning "to affirm"). One must not confuse the valid form *modus ponens* with the clearly invalid form displayed by the following argument:
    
    If Bacon wrote Hamlet, then Bacon was a great writer.  
    Bacon was a great writer.  
    Therefore, Bacon wrote Hamlet.
    
    This argument differs from *modus ponens* in that its categorical premise affirms the consequent, rather than the antecedent, of the conditional premise. Any argument of this form is said to commit the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
    
    The other valid form of mixed hypothetical syllogism is illustrated by:
    
    If the one-eyed prisoner saw two red hats, then he could tell the color of the hat on his own head.  
    The one-eyed prisoner could not tell the color of the hat on his own head.  
    Therefore, the one-eyed prisoner did not see two red hats.
    
    Here, the categorical premise denies the consequent of the conditional premise, and the conclusion denies its antecedent. Any argument of this form is valid and is said to be in the form *modus tollens* (from the Latin *tollere*, meaning "to deny"). One must not confuse the valid form *modus tollens* with the clearly invalid form displayed by the following argument:
    
    If Carl embezzled the college funds, then Carl is guilty of a felony.  
    Carl did not embezzle the college funds.  
    Therefore, Carl is not guilty of a felony.

    of that conditional, and  
    the conclusion is the denial of the antecedent  
    of that conditional.

    Fallacy of denying the antecedent  
    This argument differs from modus tollens in that its categorical premise denies the ante-  
    cedent, rather than the consequent, of the conditional premise. Any argument of this  
    fallacy in which, .
    
    from the negation of the antecedent of a  
    conditional proposition,  
    the conclusion is reached that the consequent of  
    that conditional is false.
    
    Principal Kinds of Syllogisms
    
    1. Categorical syllogisms, which contain only categorical propositions affirming or denying the inclusion  
    or exclusion of categories. Example:
    
    All M is P.  
    All S is M.  
    Therefore all S is P.
    
    2. Disjunctive syllogisms, which contain a compound, disjunctive (or alternative) premise asserting the  
    truth of at least one of two alternatives, and a premise that asserts the falsity of one of those alterna-  
    tives. Example:
    
    Either P is true or Q is true.  
    P is not true.  
    Therefore Q is true.
    
    3. Hypothetical syllogisms, which contain one or more compound, hypothetical (or conditional) propo-  
    sitions, each affirming that if one of its components (the antecedent) is true then the other of its  
    components (the consequent) is true. Two subtypes are distinguished:
    
    A. Pure hypothetical syllogisms contain conditional propositions only. Example:
    
    If P is true, then Q is true.  
    If Q is true, then R is true.  
    Therefore if P is true, then R is true.
    
    B. Mixed hypothetical syllogisms contain both a conditional premise and a categorical premise.

    If the categorical premise affirms the truth of the antecedent of the conditional premise, and the consequent of that conditional premise is the conclusion of the argument, the form is valid and is called modus ponens. Example:
    
    If P is true, then Q is true.
    P is true.
    Therefore Q is true.
    
    If the categorical premise affirms the falsity of the consequent of the conditional premise, and the falsity of the antecedent of that conditional premise is the conclusion of the argument, the form is valid and is called modus tollens. Example:
    
    If P is true, then Q is true.
    Q is false.
    Therefore P is false.

In being finite the world must have a limiting boundary, such as Aristotle's outermost sphere. That is impossible, because a boundary can only separate one part of space from another. This objection was put forward by the Greeks, reappeared in the scientific skepticism of the early Renaissance and probably occurs to any schoolchild who thinks about it today. If one accepts the objection, one must conclude that the universe is infinite.

    7.8 | The Dilemma
    
    The dilemma is a common form of argument in ordinary language. It is, in essence, an argumentative device in which syllogisms on the same topic are combined, sometimes with devastating effect. Each of the constituent syllogisms may be quite ordinary, and therefore the dilemma is not of special importance from a strictly logical point of view. The premises of the syllogisms so combined are formulated disjunctively, and devised in a way designed to trap the opponent by forcing him to accept one or the other of the disjuncts. Thus the opponent is forced to accept the truth of the conclusion of one or the other of the syllogisms combined. When this is done successfully, the dilemma can prove to be a powerful instrument of persuasion.
    
    People often say somewhat loosely that a person is "in" a dilemma (or "impaled on the horns of a dilemma") when that person must choose between two alternatives, both of which are bad or unpleasant. The dilemma is a form of argument intended to put one's opponent in just that kind of position. In debate, one uses a dilemma to offer alternative positions to one's adversary, from which a choice must be made, and then to prove that no matter which choice is made, the adversary is committed to an unacceptable conclusion.

    The distinguished physicist Richard Feynman, recounting his experiences in the 1986 investigation of the catastrophic explosion of the Challenger space shuttle, was caustic in his criticism of mismanagement by administrators in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

    Complex dilemma
    An argument consisting
    of (a) a disjunction,
    (b) two conditional
    premises linked by a
    conjunction, and (c) a
    conclusion that is not
    a single categorical
    proposition (as in a
    simple dilemma) but a
    disjunction, a pair of
    (usually undesirable)
    alternatives.
    
    Simple dilemma
    
    An argument designed
    to push the adversary
    to choose between two
    alternatives, the (usually
    undesirable) conclusion
    in either case being
    
    a single categorical
    proposition.
    
    the argument is a disjunction, but one of the disjuncts must obviously be true: Either
    they knew or they didn't know about the problems below them. And whichever disjunct
    is chosen, the result for the adversary is very bad. The conclusion of a dilemma can
    itself be a disjunction (for example, "Either the NASA administrators did not know what
    they should have known, or they lied") in which case we call the dilemma a complex
    dilemma. But the conclusion may also be a categorical proposition, in which case we
    call it a simple dilemma.
    
    A dilemma need not always have an unpleasant conclusion. An example of one with
    a happy conclusion is provided by the following simple dilemma:

    If the blest in heaven have no desires, they will be perfectly content; so they will be also if their desires are
    fully gratified; but either they will have no desires, or have them fully gratified; therefore they will be perfectly
    content.
    
    The premises of a dilemma need not be stated in any special order; the disjunc-
    tive premise that offers the alternatives may either precede or follow the other. The
    consequences of those alternatives may be stated in a conjunctive proposition or in
    two separate propositions. An argument in dilemma form is often expressed enthyme-
    matically; that is, its conclusion generally is thought to be so obvious that it scarcely
    needs to be spelled out. This is well illustrated in a passage from a letter of President
    Abraham Lincoln, defending the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves of
    the Confederacy:
    
    But the proclamation, as law, either is valid, or is not valid. If it is not valid, it needs no retraction, If it is valid,
    it cannot be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life.'
    
    Three ways of evading or refuting the conclusion of a dilemma have been given special
    names, two of them relating to the fact that a dilemma has two (or more) "horns." These
    three ways of defeating a dilemma are known as "going (or escaping) between the horns,"
    "taking (or grasping) it by the horns," and "rebutting it by means of a counterdilemma."
    Note that these are not ways to prove the dilemma invalid; rather, they are ways in which
    one seeks to avoid its conclusion without challenging the formal validity of the argument.
    
    One escapes between the horns of a dilemma by rejecting its disjunctive premise.
    This method is often the easiest way to evade the conclusion of a dilemma, for unless
    one half of the disjunction is the explicit contradictory of the other, the disjunction may
    very well be false. For example, one justification sometimes offered for giving grades
    to students is that recognizing good work will stimulate the students to study harder.
    Students may criticize this theory using the following dilemma:

    If students are fond of learning, they need no stimulus, and if they dislike learning, no stimulus will be of
    any avail. But any student either is fond of learning or dislikes it. Therefore a stimulus is either needless or
    of no avail.
    
    This argument is formally valid, but one can evade its conclusion by going between the
    horns. The disjunctive premise is false, for students have all kinds of attitudes toward
    learning: Some may be fond of it, many dislike it, and many are indifferent. For that
    third group a stimulus may be both needed and of some avail. Going between the horns
    does not prove the conclusion to be false but shows merely that the argument does not
    provide adequate grounds for accepting that conclusion.
    
    When the disjunctive premise is unassailable, as when the alternatives exhaust the
    possibilities, it is impossible to escape between the horns. Another method of evading
    the conclusion must be sought. One such method is to grasp the dilemma by the horns,
    which involves rejecting the premise that is a conjunction. To deny a conjunction, we
    need only deny one of its parts. When we grasp the dilemma by the horns, we attempt
    to show that at least one of the conditionals is false. The dilemma just above, attacking
    the use of grades in school, relies on the conditional "If students are fond of learning,
    they need no stimulus." The proponent of grading may grasp this dilemma by the horns
    and argue that even students who are fond of learning may sometimes need stimulus,
    and that the additional stimulus provided by grades promotes careful study by even the
    most diligent students. There may be good response to this, of course—but the original
    dilemma has been grasped firmly by the horns.
    
    Rebutting a dilemma by means of a counterdilemma is the most ingenious method
    of all, but it is seldom cogent, for reasons that will appear presently. To rebut a given
    dilemma in this way, one constructs another dilemma whose conclusion is opposed to
    the conclusion of the original. Any counterdilemma may be used in rebuttal, but ide-
    ally it should be built up out of the same ingredients (categorical propositions) that the
    original dilemma contained.
    
    A classical example of this elegant kind of rebuttal concerns the legendary argument
    of an Athenian mother attempting to persuade her son not to enter politics:

    If you say what is just, men will hate you; and if you say what is unjust, the gods will hate you; but you must
    either say the one or the other; therefore you will be hated.
    
    Her son rebutted that dilemma with the following one:
    
    If I say what is just, the gods will love me; and if I say what is unjust, men will love me. I must say either the
    one or the other. Therefore I shall be loved!
    
    In public discussion, where the dilemma is one of the strongest weapons of contro-
    versy, the use of a rebuttal of this kind, which derives an opposite conclusion from almost
    the same premises, is a mark of great rhetorical skill. If we examine the dilemma and
    rebutting counterdilemma more closely, we see that their conclusions are not as opposed
    as they might at first have seemed.
    
    The conclusion of the first dilemma is that the son will be hated (by men or by
    the gods), whereas that of the rebutting dilemma is that the son will be loved (by the
    gods or by men). However, these two conclusions are perfectly compatible. The rebut-
    ting counterdilemma serves merely to establish a conclusion different from that of the
    original. Both conclusions may very well be true together, so no refutation has been
    accomplished. But in the heat of controversy analysis is unwelcome, and if such a rebut-
    tal occurred in a public debate, the average audience might agree that the rebuttal was
    an effective reply to the original argument.
    
    That this sort of rebuttal does not refute the argument but only directs attention to
    a different aspect of the same situation is perhaps more clearly shown in the case of the
    following dilemma, advanced by an "optimist":
    
    If I work, I learn money, and if I am idle, I enjoy myself. Either I work or I am idle. Therefore either I earn money
    or I enjoy myself.
    
    7.8 The Dilemma

    A "pessimist" might offer the following counterdilemma:

    I don't earn money or I don't enjoy myself.

    These conclusions represent merely different ways of viewing the same facts; they do not
    constitute a disagreement over what the facts are.
    
    No discussion of dilemmas would be complete unless it mentioned the celebrated
    lawsuit between Protagoras and Euathlus. Protagoras, a teacher who lived in Greece
    during the fifth century B.C., specialized in teaching the art of pleading before juries.
    Euathlus wanted to become a lawyer, but not being able to pay the required tuition, he
    made an arrangement according to which Protagoras would teach him but not receive
    payment until Euathlus won his first case. When Euathlus finished his course of study,
    he delayed going into practice. Tired of waiting for his money, Protagoras brought suit
    against his former pupil for the tuition money that was owed. Unmindful of the adage
    that the lawyer who tries his own case has a fool for a client, Euathlus decided to plead
    his own case in court. When the trial began, Protagoras presented his side of the case in
    a crushing dilemma:
    
    If Euathlus loses this case, then he must pay me (by the judgment of the court); if he wins this case, then he
    must pay me (by the terms of the contract). He must either lose or win this case. Therefore Euathlus must
    pay me.
    
    The situation looked bad for Euathlus, but he had learned well the art of rhetoric. He
    offered the court the following counterdilemma in rebuttal:
    
    If I win this case, I shall not have to pay Protagoras (by the judgment of the court); if I lose this case, I shall
    not have to pay Protagoras (by the terms of the contract, for then I shall not yet have won my first case).
    I must either win or lose this case. Therefore I do not have to pay Protagoras!
    
    Had you been the judge, how would you have decided?
  - |-
    Note that the conclusion of Euathlus's rebutting dilemma is not compatible with the
    conclusion of Protagoras's original dilemma. One conclusion is the explicit denial of the
    other. However, it is rare that a counterdilemma stands in this relation to the dilemma
    against which it is directed. When it does, the premises involved are themselves incon-
    sistent, and it is this implicit contradiction that the two dilemmas make explicit.
    
    EXERCISES
    
    Discuss the various arguments that might be offered to refute each of the following:
    
    Example
    
    1. If we interfere with the publication of false and harmful doctrines, we shall be guilty
    of suppressing the liberties of others, whereas if we do not interfere with the publi-
    cation of such doctrines, we run the risk of losing our own liberties. We must either
    interfere or not interfere with the publication of false and harmful doctrines. Hence
    we must either be guilty of suppressing the liberties of others or else run the risk of
    losing our own liberties.
    
    Solution
    
    It is impossible to go between the horns. It is possible to grasp it by either horn, arguing
    either (a) that liberties do not properly include the right to publish false and harmful
    doctrines or (b) that we run no risk of losing our own liberties if we vigorously oppose
    false and harmful doctrines with true and helpful ones. It could plausibly be rebutted
    (but not refuted) by the use of its ingredients to prove that "we must either be guiltless
    of suppressing the liberties of others or else run no risk of losing our own liberties."
    
    2. If you tell me what I already understand, you do not enlarge my understanding,
    whereas if you tell me something that I do not understand, then your remarks are
    unintelligible to me. Whatever you tell me must be either something I already under-
    stand or something that I do not understand. Hence whatever you say either does
    not enlarge my understanding or else is unintelligible to me.

    3. If the conclusion of a deductive argument goes beyond the premises, then the
    argument is invalid, while if the conclusion of a deductive argument does not go
    beyond the premises, then the argument brings nothing new to light. The conclu-
    sion of a deductive argument must either go beyond the premises or not go beyond
    them. Therefore either deductive arguments are invalid or they bring nothing new
    to light.
    
    4. If a deductive argument is invalid, it is without value, whereas a deductive argument
    that brings nothing new to light is also without value. Either deductive arguments
    are invalid or they bring nothing new to light. Therefore deductive arguments are
    without value.
    
    *5. If the general had been loyal, he would have obeyed his orders, and if he had been
    intelligent, he would have understood them. The general either disobeyed his orders
    or else did not understand them. Therefore the general must have been either dis-
    loyal or unintelligent.
    
    6. If he was disloyal, then his dismissal was justified, and if he was unintelligent, then
    his dismissal was justified. He was either disloyal or unintelligent. Therefore his dis-
    missal was justified.
    
    7. If the several nations keep the peace, the United Nations is unnecessary, while if
    the several nations go to war, the United Nations will have been unsuccessful in its
    purpose of preventing war. Now, either the several nations keep the peace or they go
    to war. Hence the United Nations is unnecessary or unsuccessful.
    
    8. If people are good, laws are not needed to prevent wrongdoing, whereas if people are
    bad, laws will not succeed in preventing wrongdoing. People are either good or bad.
    Therefore either laws are not needed to prevent wrongdoing or laws will not succeed
    in preventing wrongdoing.

    extracting "contributions" to the king's purse. A person who lived extravagantly was
    forced to make a large contribution, because it was obvious that he could afford it.
    Someone who lived modestly was forced to make a large contribution because it was
    clear that he must have saved a lot of money on living expenses. Whichever way he
    turned he was said to be "caught on Morton's fork."

    did not die.

    when one of the partners conceals important information from the other? If the
    doctor tells the truth, he destroys the base on which the placebo rests. If he doesn't
    tell the truth, he jeopardizes a relationship built on trust.

    betting that He does exist. If He does but you end up living as an unbeliever, then
    you could be condemned to spend eternity in the flames of Hell. If, on the other

    Summary
    
    In this chapter we have examined syllogistic argument as it is used in ordinary language, exhibiting the
    different guises in which syllogisms appear and showing how they may be best understood, used, and
    evaluated.
    
    In Section 7.1, we explained the need for techniques to translate syllogistic arguments of any form
    into standard form, and we identified the ways in which syllogistic arguments may deviate from standard-
    form categorical syllogisms.
    
    In Section 7.2, we explained how syllogisms in ordinary language appearing to have more than three
    terms may sometimes have the number of terms in them appropriately reduced to three—by elimination
    of synonyms, and by elimination of complementary classes.
    
    In Section 7.3, we explained how the propositions of a syllogistic argument, when not in standard
    form, may be translated into standard form to allow the syllogism to be tested either by Venn diagrams
    or by use of the rules governing syllogisms. Nonstandard propositions of nine different kinds were exam-
    ined, and the methods for translating each kind were explained and illustrated:
    
    Singular propositions
    
    Propositions having adjectives as predicates
    
    Propositions having main verbs other than the copula "to be"
    
    Statements having standard-form ingredients, but not in standard-form order
    Propositions having quantifiers other than "all," "no," and "some"
    
    Exclusive propositions, using "only" or "none but"
    
    Propositions without words indicating quantity
    
    Propositions not resembling standard-form propositions at all
    
    Exceptive propositions, using "all except" or similar expressions

    Section 7.4, we explained how the uniform translation of propositions into standard form, essential for testing, may be assisted by the use of parameters.
    
    In Sections 7.5 and 7.6, we explained enthymemes (syllogistic arguments in which one of the constituent propositions has been suppressed), and sorites (in which a chain of syllogisms may be compressed into a cluster of linked propositions).
    
    In Section 7.7, we explained syllogisms other than categorical: disjunctive syllogisms and hypothetical syllogisms, so called because they contain disjunctive or hypothetical premises.
    
    In Section 7.8, we discussed the rhetorical use of dilemmas, disjunctive arguments that give to the adversary a choice of alternatives neither of which is acceptable. We explained and illustrated the three possible patterns of rhetorical response: going between the horns of the dilemma, grasping the dilemma by its horns, or devising a counterdilemma.

More than a century later, Bertrand Russell presented a very different interpretation of singular propositions and universal propositions, and he later argued (in My Philosophical Development, 1959) that logic "cannot get far" until the two forms are seen to be "completely different," because the one (the singular) attributes a predicate to a named subject, while the other (the universal) expresses a relation between two predicates. Russell's interpretation had by that time become central to the theory of quantification in modern symbolic logic, discussed at length in Chapter 10; Kant's observation pertained to the use of singular propositions in traditional syllogisms, which he knew to be very powerful logical instruments.

    8.11 | Modern Logic and Its Symbolic Language
    
    To have a full understanding of deductive reasoning we need a general theory of deduction. A general theory of deduction will have two objectives: (1) to explain the relations between premises and conclusions in deductive arguments, and (2) to provide techniques for discriminating between valid and invalid deductions. Two great bodies of logical theory have sought to achieve these ends. The first, called Aristotelian Syllogistic logic, was examined in Chapters 5 through 7. The second, called modern, symbolic, or mathematical logic, is the subject in this and the following two chapters.
  - |-

    Although these two great bodies of theory have similar aims, they proceed in very
    different ways. Modern logic does not build on the system of syllogisms discussed in
    preceding chapters. It does not begin with the analysis of categorical propositions. It does
    seek to discriminate valid from invalid arguments, although it does so using very differ-
    ent concepts and techniques. Therefore we must now begin afresh, developing a modern
    logical system that deals with some of the very same issues dealt with by Aristotelian
    Syllogistic logic—and does so even more effectively.
    
    chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    Modern logic begins by first identifying and distinguishing the simple and com-
    pound statements on which deductive arguments depend. On this basis, a general
    account of such arguments is given, and methods for testing the validity of arguments
    are developed.
    
    This analysis of deduction requires an artificial symbolic language. In a natural
    language—English or any other—there are peculiarities that make exact logical analysis difficult: Words may be vague or equivocal, the construction of arguments may be ambiguous,
    metaphors and idioms may confuse or mislead, emotional appeals may distract—problems
    discussed in Part I of this book. These difficulties can be largely overcome with an artificial
    language in which logical relations can be formulated with precision. The most fundamental elements of this modern symbolic language will be introduced in this chapter.
    
    Symbols greatly facilitate our thinking about arguments. They enable us to get to the
    heart of an argument, exhibiting its essential nature and putting aside what is not essen-
    tial. Moreover, with symbols we can perform, almost mechanically, with the eye, some
    logical operations which might otherwise demand great effort. It may seem paradoxical,
    but a symbolic language therefore helps us to accomplish some intellectual tasks without
    having to think too much. The Indo-Arabic numerals we use today (1, 2, 3, .. .) illustrate
    the advantages of an improved symbolic language. They replaced cumbersome Roman
    numerals (I, II, III, .. .), which are very difficult to manipulate. To multiply 113 by 9 is
    easy; to multiply CXIII by IX is not so easy. Even the Romans, some scholars contend,
    were obliged to find ways to symbolize numbers more efficiently.
  - |-
    Classical logicians did understand the enormous value of symbols in analysis. Aristotle used symbols as variables in his own analyses, and the refined system of Aristotelian syllogistics uses symbols in very sophisticated ways, as the preceding chapters have shown. However, much real progress has been made, especially during the period 1879 through 1922, in devising and using logical symbols more effectively.
    
    The modern symbolism with which deduction is analyzed differs greatly from Aristotelian Syllogistic logic. The relations of classes of things are not central for modern logicians as they were for Aristotle and his followers. Instead—thanks to the pioneering work of Gottlob Frege, C. S. Peirce, Bertrand Russell, A. N. Whitehead, and Ludwig Wittgenstein—logicians look now to the internal structure of propositions and arguments, and to the logical links—very few in number—that are critical in all deductive argument. Modern symbolic logic is therefore not encumbered, as Aristotelian logic was, by the need to transform deductive arguments into syllogistic form, an often laborious task explained in the immediately preceding chapter.
    
    The system of modern logic we now begin to explore is more powerful than analytical syllogistics. There are forms of deductive argument that syllogistics cannot adequately address. Using the approach taken by modern logic, with its more versatile symbolic language, we can pursue the aims of deductive analysis directly and we can penetrate more deeply. The logical symbols we shall now explore permit a more complete and more efficient achievement of the central aim of deductive logic: discriminating between valid and invalid arguments.
    
    Truth-Functionality: Simple Statements and Compound Statements
    
    In this chapter we shall be concerned with relatively simple arguments of Propositional Logic, such as:
    
    8.2. Truth-Functionality: Simple Statements and Compound Statements
    
    The blind prisoner has a red hat or the blind prisoner has a white hat.
    The blind prisoner does not have a red hat.
    Therefore the blind prisoner has a white hat.

    Mr. Robinson does not live halfway between Detroit and Chicago.
    
    Therefore Mr. Robinson is not the brakeman's next-door neighbor.
  - |-
    Most arguments of this general type contain at least one compound statement. In studying such arguments we divide all statements into two general categories: simple and compound. To understand this important distinction, we must first understand that every statement is either true or false. In logic, we capture this by saying that every statement has a truth value, where the truth value of a true statement is true, and the truth value of a false statement is false. Additionally, every statement is a truth function or truth-functional statement in the specific sense that its truth value is a function of—is exclusively determined by—the truth value of one or more constituent statements. A simple statement is not a truth function of another statement. For example, "Charlie is neat" is a simple statement. A compound statement is a truth function of at least one other statement. For example, "Charlie is neat and Charlie is sweet" is a compound statement, because it is a truth function of two other statements, namely "Charlie is neat" and "Charlie is sweet."
    
    In formulating definitions and principles in logic, one must be very precise. What appears simple often proves more complicated than had been supposed. The statement "Charlie is neat" is a statement, and as such, it is a truth function of a constituent statement, namely "Charlie is neat." It is a truth function of itself: its truth value is a function of its own truth value, and nothing else. This is the nature of a simple statement. It is the limit case of truth functions. The fact that a simple statement is a truth function of itself and only itself means that a simple statement is not a truth function of another statement (as the above definition states).
  - |-
    A compound statement, on the other hand, is not a simple statement, which means that it is a truth function of at least one other constituent statement. Thus, the compound statement "Charlie is neat and Charlie is sweet" is a truth function of at least one other constituent statement; it is, in fact, a truth function of two other constituent statements, namely "Charlie is neat" and "Charlie is sweet." The truth value of "Charlie is neat and Charlie is sweet" is a (truth) function of the truth values of "Charlie is neat" and "Charlie is sweet." Similarly, the truth value of the compound statement "The blind prisoner has a red hat or the blind prisoner has a white hat" is a (truth) function of two other statements, "The blind prisoner has a red hat" and "The blind prisoner has a white hat."
    
    The statement "Charlie is not neat," often stated in logic as "It is not the case that Charlie is neat," is a compound statement because it is a truth function of another constituent statement, namely "Charlie is neat." "Charlie is not neat" is true if and only if "Charlie is neat" is false. And "Charlie is not neat" is false if and only if "Charlie is neat" is true.
    
    These examples illustrate an important fact about simple statements and an important fact about compound statements. Since a simple statement is not a truth function of another statement, a simple statement does not contain words acting as logical words, such as "and," "or," "if... then," "if and only if," or "not." A compound statement, on the other hand, is a truth function of at least one other statement and, as such, does contain at least one word acting as a logical word (e.g., "not," or "and").
    
    Truth value
    
    The status of any statement as true or false (T or F).
    
    Simple statement
    A statement that is not a truth function of another statement.
    
    Compound
    statement
    
    A statement that is a truth function of at least one other statement. Its truth value is a function of—is exclusively determined by—the truth value of one or more other constituent statements.

    component

    Any component of a compound statement whose replacement there by any other statement having the same truth value leaves the truth value of the compound statement unchanged.
    
    Logical operator
    
    A symbol used to form a truth-functional compound statement from one or more other statements. There are five logical operators in Propositional Logic: "·" (the dot, standing for "and"), "∨" (vel or wedge, standing for the inclusive "or"), "→" (the horseshoe, standing for "if, then"), "=" (the tribar standing for "if and only if"), and "¬" (tilde or curl, standing for "not" or "it is not the case that"). The first four of these are logical connectives; the fifth is the negation operator.
    
    Logical connective
    Four of the five logical operators are logical connectives because they are used to form truth-functional compound statements from other statements by connecting those other statements.
    
    Conjunction (Conj.)
    A truth-functional statement consisting of two component statements called conjuncts, connected by the logical connective dot, "·", meaning "and." A conjunction is of the form p · q and is true if and only if p is true and q is true. "Conjunction" ("Conj.") is also the name of a rule of inference, one of nine elementary valid argument forms; it permits statements assumed to be true to be combined in one compound statement.
    Symbolized as: p, q, therefore p · q.
  - |-
    We have, therefore, two related criteria for determining whether a given statement in English is simple or compound. First, we can ask whether a statement, such as "Abigail believes that Barack Obama is the forty-second President of the United States," is a truth function of another statement, such as "Barack Obama is the forty-second President of the United States." The answer in this case is "no": the truth value of the statement in question is not a truth function of the truth value of the (false) statement "Barack Obama is the forty-second President of the United States." Thus, this statement is a simple statement. Second, we can ask whether a statement, such as "Barack Obama is the forty-second President of the United States," contains a logical word. This statement does not contain a logical word, which means it is a simple statement.
    
    The foregoing example shows that a statement can be a component part of another statement without being a truth-functional component of that other statement. For our present purposes we define a component statement of a statement as a truth-functional component if, when the component statement is replaced in the statement by any other statement having the same truth value, the different statement produced by that replacement has the same truth value as the original statement. For example, "Barack Obama is the forty-second President of the United States" is not a truth-functional component of "Abigail believes that Barack Obama is the forty-second President of the United States," for if we replace the former with a different false statement, such as "London is the capital of France," the resultant statement "Abigail believes that London is the capital of France" may be false, while the original statement may be true. On the contrary, "Charlie is neat" is a truth-functional component of "Charlie is neat and Charlie is sweet." If this conjunction is true, "Charlie is neat" is true; and if we replace "Charlie is neat" with any other true statement, such as "Paris is the capital of France," the resultant conjunction will have the same truth value (i.e., true) as the original conjunction. Given this definition, a compound statement consists of at least one truth-functional component.

    Compound truth-functional statements contain one or more logical words acting as
    logical operators. In the symbolic language of Propositional Logic, which we shall now
    present, there are five logical operators: the symbols "." (the dot, standing for "and"),
    "\/" (vel or wedge, standing for the inclusive "or"), "D" (the horseshoe, standing for "if,
    then"), "=" (the tribar standing for "if and only if"), and "~" (tilde or curl, standing for
    "not" or "it is not the case that"). The first four of these logical operators connect two
    statements and, for that reason, are often called "connectives" or "logical connec-
    tives." The fifth logical operator does not connect two statements, but rather is placed in
    front of (to the left of) a statement. We will now present the five types of truth-functional
    compound statements and show how the unique truth-functionality of each type is
    defined by its truth table.
    
    A. Conjunction
    
    The first type of truth-functional compound statement we consider is the conjunction.
    We can form the conjunction of two statements by placing the word "and" between
    them; the two statements so combined are called conjuncts. Thus the compound state-
    ment, "Charlie is neat and Charlie is sweet," is a conjunction whose first conjunct is
    "Charlie is neat" and whose second conjunct is "Charlie is sweet."
    
    The word "and" is a short and convenient word, but it has other uses besides con-
    necting statements. For example, the statement, "Lincoln and Grant were contempo-
    raries," is not a conjunction, but a simple statement expressing a relationship. The
    statement "Lincoln and Grant were contemporaries" is not a truth function of another
    constituent statement. To have a unique symbol whose only function is to connect
    statements conjunctively, we introduce the dot "." as our symbol for conjunction.
    Thus the previous conjunction can be written as "Charlie is neat . Charlie is sweet."
    More generally, where p and q are any two statements whatever, their conjunction is
    written p . q. In some books, other symbols are used to express conjunction, such as
    "·" or "&".
  - |-
    Recall that a compound statement is defined as a truth function of at least one other
    statement—of at least one truth-functional component. A conjunction is a truth-functional
    compound statement consisting of two other statements (two truth-functional components),
    called "conjuncts," which are connected by the logical or truth-functional connective
    for "and," the dot symbol ".". The truth value of a conjunction is a truth function of—is
    exclusively determined by—the truth values of its two conjuncts. A conjunction is true if and
    only if both of its conjuncts are true; otherwise it is false. Given any two statements, p and q,
    there are exactly four possible combinations of truth values for p and q. These four possible
    cases, and the truth value of the conjunction in each case, can be displayed as follows:
    
    Where p is true and q is true, p • q is true.
    
    Where p is true and q is false, p • q is false.
    Where p is false and q is true, p • q is false.
    Where p is false and q is false, p • q is false.
    
    If we represent the truth values "true" and "false" by the capital letters T and F, the
    truth value of a conjunction for each combination of truth values for its two conjuncts
    can be represented more compactly and more clearly by means of a truth table:
    
    T T T
    T F F
    F T F
    F F F
    
    This truth table can be taken as defining conjunction (and the dot symbol), because it
    stipulates the truth value of p • q for every possible combination of truth values for the
    statement variables p and q.
    
    We abbreviate simple statements by capital letters, generally using for this pur-
    pose a letter that will help us remember which statement it abbreviates. Thus we may
    abbreviate "Charlie is neat and Charlie is sweet" as N • S. Some conjunctions, both of
    whose conjuncts have the same subject term—for example, "Byron was a great poet
    and Byron was a great adventurer"—are more briefly and perhaps more naturally stated
    in English by placing the "and" between the predicate terms and not repeating the
    subject term, as in "Byron was a great poet and a great adventurer." For our purposes,

    Truth table
    
    An array displaying the truth values of compound statements for all possible combinations of their constituent simple statements. A truth table may be used to define truth-functional compound statements; it may also be used to determine whether a deductive argument is valid or invalid.
    
    chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    Negation
    
    Denial; symbolized by the tilde or curl. ~p simply means "it is not the case that p," and may be read as "not-p."
    
    Tilde or curl
    
    The symbol for negation, ~. It appears immediately before (to the left of) the statement that is negated or denied.
    
    We regard the latter as formulating the same statement as the former and symbolize either one as P - A. If both conjuncts of a conjunction have the same predicate term, as in "Lewis was a famous explorer and Clark was a famous explorer," the conjunction is usually abbreviated in English by placing the "and" between the subject terms and not repeating the predicate, as in "Lewis and Clark were famous explorers." Either formulation is symbolized as L - C.
  - |-
    As shown by the truth table defining conjunction, a conjunction is true if and only  
    if both of its conjuncts are true. The word "and" has another use in which it does not  
    merely signify (truth-functional) conjunction, but has the sense of "and subsequently,"  
    meaning temporal succession. Thus the statement, "Jones entered the country at New  
    York and went straight to Chicago," is significant and might be true, whereas "Jones went  
    straight to Chicago and entered the country at New York" is hardly intelligible. There is  
    quite a difference between "He took off his shoes and got into bed" and "He got into bed  
    and took off his shoes."* Such examples show the desirability of having a special symbol  
    with an exclusively truth-functional conjunctive use.
    
    Note that the English words "but," "yet," "also," "still," "although," "however,"  
    "moreover," "nevertheless," and so on, and even the comma and the semicolon, can  
    also be used to conjoin two statements into a single compound statement, and in their  
    conjunctive sense they can all be represented by the dot symbol.
    
    B. Negation
  - |-
    The negation (or contradictory or denial) of a statement in English is often formed by the insertion of a "not" in the original statement. Alternatively, one can express the negation of a statement in English by prefixing to it the phrase "it is false that" or "it is not the case that." It is customary to use the symbol "~", called a tilde or a curl, to form the negation of a statement. (Again, in some books other symbols are used for negation, such as "—" or "1".) Thus, where M symbolizes the statement "All humans are mortal," the various statements "Not all humans are mortal," "Some humans are not mortal," "It is false that all humans are mortal," and "It is not the case that all humans are mortal" are all symbolized as ~ M. More generally, where p is any statement whatever, its negation is written ~ p. Like the four truth-functional connectives, the tilde is a truth-functional logical operator: A negation, such as ~ p, is a truth-functional compound statement whose truth value is exclusively a function of the truth value of its constituent statement, namely p. The negation operator reverses the truth value: The negation of any true statement is false, and the negation of any false statement is true. This fact can be presented very simply and clearly by means of a truth table:
    
    F
    
    T
    
    This truth table may be regarded as the definition of negation (and the negation symbol, wi),

    8.3. Conjunction, Negation, and Disjunction
    
    C. Disjunction
    
    The disjunction (or alternation) of two statements is formed in English by inserting the word "or" between them. The two component statements so combined are called disjuncts (or alternatives).
  - |-
    The English word "or" is ambiguous, having two related but distinguishable meanings. One of them is exemplified in the statement, "Premiums will be waived in the event of sickness or unemployment." The intention here is obviously that premiums are waived not only for sick persons and for unemployed persons, but also for persons who are both sick and unemployed. This sense of the word "or" is called weak or inclusive. An inclusive disjunction is true if one or the other or both disjuncts are true; only if both disjuncts are false is their inclusive disjunction false. The inclusive "or" has the sense of "either, possibly both." Where precision is at a premium, as in contracts and other legal documents, this sense is often made explicit by the use of the phrase "and/or."
    
    The word "or" is also used in a strong or exclusive sense, in which the meaning is not "at least one" but "at least one and at most one." Where a restaurant lists "salad or dessert" on its dinner menu, it is clearly meant that, for the stated price of the meal, the diner may have one or the other but not both. Where precision is at a premium and the exclusive sense of "or" is intended, the phrase "but not both" is often added.
    
    We interpret the inclusive disjunction of two statements as an assertion that at least one of the statements is true, and we interpret their exclusive disjunction as an assertion that at least one of the statements is true but not both are true. Note that the two kinds of disjunction have common meaning: this common meaning, that at least one of the disjuncts is true, is the whole meaning of the inclusive "or" and a part of the meaning of the exclusive "or."
  - |-
    Although disjunctions are stated ambiguously in English, they are unambiguous in  
    Latin. Latin has two different words corresponding to the two different senses of the  
    English word "or." The Latin word *vel* signifies weak or inclusive disjunction, and the  
    Latin word *aut* corresponds to the word "or" in its strong or exclusive sense. It is custom-  
    ary to use the initial letter of the word *vel* to stand for "or" in its weak, inclusive sense.  
    Where $ p $ and $ q $ are any two statements whatever, their weak or inclusive disjunction is  
    written $ p \vee q $. Our symbol for inclusive disjunction, "$ \vee $," called a wedge (or *vel*, or less  
    frequently, a vee) is also a truth-functional connective. An inclusive disjunction is false  
    if and only if both of its disjuncts are false; otherwise it is true. We may regard inclusive  
    disjunction (and the wedge) as defined by the following truth table:
    
    | p | q | $ p \vee q $ |
    |---|---|----------------|
    | F | F |       F        |
    | F | T |       T        |
    | T | F |       T        |
    | T | T |       T        |
    
    The first specimen argument presented in this section was a Disjunctive Syllogism.  
    (A syllogism is a deductive argument consisting of two premises and a conclusion. The  
    term Disjunctive Syllogism is being used in a narrower sense here than it was in Chapter 7.)

    A truth-functional  
    compound statement  
    consisting of two  
    disjuncts connected  
    by the wedge, $ \vee $. An  
    inclusive disjunction  
    is true when at least  
    one of the disjuncts  
    (that is, one or both)  
    is true. Normally called  
    simply "disjunction,"  
    it is also called "weak  
    disjunction."

    Exclusive  
    disjunction or  
    strong disjunction  
    A truth-functional  
    compound statement  
    consisting of two  
    disjuncts, which is true  
    on the condition that  
    one and only one of  
    its disjuncts is true. An  
    exclusive disjunction  
    says that one of the  
    disjuncts is true and that  
    one of the disjuncts is  
    false. It is contrasted  
    with an "inclusive" (or  
    "weak"") disjunction,  
    which says that at least  
    one of the disjuncts is  
    true and that they may  
    both be true.

    Its form is characterized by saying that its first premise is a disjunction; its second premise is the negation of the first disjunct of the first premise; and its conclusion is the same as the second disjunct of the first premise. It is evident that the Disjunctive Syllogism, so defined, is valid on either interpretation of the word "or"—that is, regardless of whether an inclusive or exclusive disjunction is intended. The typical valid argument that has a disjunction for a premise is, like the Disjunctive Syllogism, valid on either interpretation of the word "or," so a simplification may be effected by translating the English word "or" into our logical symbol "V"—regardless of which meaning of the English word "or" is intended. Only a close examination of the context, or an explicit questioning of the speaker or writer, can reveal which sense of "or" is intended. This problem, often impossible to resolve, can be avoided if we agree to treat any occurrence of the word "or" as inclusive. On the other hand, if it is stated explicitly that the disjunction is intended to be exclusive—by means of the added phrase "but not both," for example—we have the symbolic machinery to formulate that additional sense, as will be shown directly.
    
    Where both disjuncts have either the same subject term or the same predicate term, it is often natural to compress the formulation of their disjunction in English by plac-
    ing the "or" so that there is no need to repeat the common part of the two disjuncts. Thus, "Either Smith is the owner or Smith is the manager" might equally well be stated as "Smith is either the owner or the manager," and either one is properly symbolized as O V M. And "Either Red is guilty or Butch is guilty" may be stated as "Either Red or Butch is guilty"; either one may be symbolized as R V B.
  - |-
    The word "unless" is often used to form the disjunction of two statements. Thus,
    "You will do poorly on the exam unless you study" is correctly symbolized as P V S
    because that disjunction asserts that one of the disjuncts is true, and hence that if one
    of them is false, the other must be true. Of course, you may study and do poorly on
    the exam.
    
    The word "unless" is sometimes used to convey more information; it may mean
    (depending on context) that one or the other proposition is true but that not both are
    true. That is, "unless" may be intended as an exclusive disjunction. Thus it was noted by
    Ted Turner that global warming will put New York under water in one hundred years and
    "will be the biggest catastrophe the world has ever seen—unless we have nuclear war."
    Here the speaker did mean that at least one of the two disjuncts is true, but of course they
    cannot both be true. Other uses of "unless" are ambiguous. When we say, "The picnic
    will be held unless it rains," we surely do mean that the picnic will be held if it does not
    rain. Do we mean that it will not be held if it does rain? That may be uncertain. It is wise
    policy to treat every disjunction as weak or inclusive unless it is certain that an exclusive
    disjunction is meant. "Unless" is best symbolized simply with the wedge (V).
    
    D. Punctuation
    
    In English, punctuation is absolutely required if complicated statements are to be clear.
    Many different punctuation marks are used, without which many sentences would be
    highly ambiguous. For example, quite different meanings attach to "The teacher says
    John is a fool" when it is given different punctuations: "The teacher," says John, "is a
    fool"; or "The teacher says ‘John is a fool.'" Punctuation is equally necessary in math-
    ematics. In the absence of a special convention, no number is uniquely denoted by
    2x3 +5, although when it is made clear how its constituents are to be grouped, it denotes
    271
    
    8.3. Conjunction, Negation, and Disjunction
  - |-
    Either 11 or 16: the first when punctuated (2 x 3) + 5, the second when punctuated
    2 x(3 +5). To avoid ambiguity, and to make meaning clear, punctuation marks in mathe-
    matics appear in the form of parentheses, (), which are used to group individual symbols;
    brackets, [ ], which are used to group expressions that include parentheses; and braces,
    { }, which are used to group expressions that include brackets.
    
    In the language of symbolic logic those same punctuation marks—parentheses,
    brackets, and braces—are equally essential, because in logic compound statements are
    themselves often compounded together into more complicated ones. Thus p - q V ris
    ambiguous: it might mean the conjunction of p with the disjunction of q with r, or it
    might mean the disjunction whose first disjunct is the conjunction of p and g and whose
    second disjunct is r. We distinguish between these two different senses by punctuating
    the given statement as p - (gq Vr) or else as (p-q) Vr. That the different ways of punctu-
    ating the original statement do make a difference can be seen by considering the case in
    which p is false and g and r are both true. In this case the second punctuated statement
    is true (because its second disjunct is true), whereas the first one is false (because its first
    conjunct is false). Here the difference in punctuation makes all the difference between
    truth and falsehood, for different punctuations can assign different truth values to the
    ambiguous p-q\r.
    
    The word "either" has a variety of different meanings and uses in English. It has
    conjunctive force in the sentence, "There is danger on either side." More often it is used
    to introduce the first disjunct in a disjunction, as in "Either the blind prisoner has a red
    hat or the blind prisoner has a white hat." There it contributes to the rhetorical balance
    of the sentence, but it does not affect its meaning. Perhaps the most important use of the
    word "either" is to punctuate a compound statement. Thus the sentence
    
    The organization will meet on Thursday and Anand will be elected or the election will be postponed.

    is ambiguous. This ambiguity can be resolved in one direction by placing the word
    "either" at its beginning, or in the other direction by inserting the word "either" before
    the name "Anand." Such punctuation is effected in our symbolic language by parentheses. The ambiguous statement p-g \ r discussed in the preceding paragraph corresponds
    to the ambiguous sentence just examined. The two different punctuations of the statement correspond to the two different punctuations of the sentence effected by the two
    different insertions of the word "either."
    
    The negation of a disjunction is often formed by use of the phrase "neither—nor."
    Thus the statement, "Either Fillmore or Harding was the greatest U.S. president," can
    be contradicted by the statement, "Neither Fillmore nor Harding was the greatest U.S.
    president." The disjunction would be symbolized as F V H, and its negation as either
    ~(F V H) or as ~F . ~H. (The logical equivalence of these two statement forms will be
    discussed in Section 8.10.) It should be clear that to deny a disjunction, which states
    that one or another statement is true, requires that both statements be stated to be
    false.
    
    The word "both" in English has a very important role in logical punctuation,
    and it deserves the most careful attention. When we say "Both Jamal and Derek are
    
    not..." we are saying, as noted just above, that "Neither Jamal nor Derek is . . ."; we
    are applying the negation to each of them. But when we say "Jamal and Derek are not
    both..." we are saying something very different; we are applying the negation to the
    
    pair of them taken together, saying that "it is not the case that they are both... ." This
    difference is very substantial. Entirely different meanings arise when the word "both"
    is placed differently in the English sentence. Consider the great difference between the
    meanings of
    
    Jamal and Derek will not both be elected.
    and
    Jamal and Derek will both not be elected.
  - |-
    The first denies the conjunction J.-D and may be symbolized as ~(J - D). The sec-
    ond says that each one of the two will not be elected, and is symbolized as ~J. ~D. Merely
    changing the position of the two words "both" and "not" alters the logical force of what
    is asserted.
    
    Of course, the word "both" does not always have this role; sometimes we use it only
    to add emphasis. When we say that "Both Lewis and Clark were great explorers," we use
    the word only to state more emphatically what is said by "Lewis and Clark were great
    explorers." When the task is logical analysis, the punctuational role of "both" must be
    very carefully determined.
    
    In the interest of brevity—that is, to decrease the number of parentheses required—it
    is convenient to establish the convention that, in any statement, the negation symbol
    will be understood to apply to the smallest statement that the punctuation permits.
    Without this convention, the statement ~p V q is ambiguous, meaning either (~ p) V q,
    or ~(p V q). By our convention we take it to mean the first of these alternatives, for the
    tilde can (and therefore by our convention does) apply to the first component, p, rather
    than to the larger statement, p V q.
    
    Given a set of punctuation marks for our symbolic language, it is possible to write not
    just conjunctions, negations, and inclusive disjunctions in that language, but exclusive
    disjunctions as well. The exclusive disjunction of p and q asserts that at least one of them
    is true but not both are true, which is written as (p V q) - ~(p - q). Another way of express-
    ing the exclusive disjunction of two disjuncts is by means of the symbol "V": p V q.
  - |-
    The truth value of any compound statement constructed from simple statements  
    using only negation, conjunction, and disjunction—using only the tilde and the truth-  
    functional connectives dot and wedge (i.e., ~, -, V)—is completely determined by the  
    truth or falsehood of its component simple statements. If we know the truth values of  
    simple statements, the truth value of any truth-functional compound of them is eas-  
    ily calculated. In working with such compound statements we always begin with their  
    inmost components and work outward. For example, if A and B are true statements  
    and X and Y are false statements, we calculate the truth value of the compound state-  
    ment ~[~(A - X) - (Y V ~B)] as follows: Because X is false, the conjunction A - X is false,  
    and so its negation ~(A - X) is true. B is true, so its negation ~B is false, and because  
    Y is also false, the disjunction of Y with ~B, Y V ~B, is false. The bracketed statement  
    [~(A - X) - (Y V ~B)] is the conjunction of a true statement and a false statement and is  
    therefore false. Hence its negation, ~[~(A - X) - (Y V ~B)], which is the entire statement,  
    is true. Such a stepwise procedure always enables us to determine the truth value of a  
    compound statement from the truth values of its components.
    
    In some circumstances we may be able to determine the truth value of a truth-  
    functional compound statement even if we cannot determine the truth or falsehood of

    One of its component simple statements. We may do this by first calculating the truth value of the compound statement on the assumption that a given simple component statement is true, and then by calculating the truth value of the compound statement on the assumption that the same simple component statement is false. If both calculations yield the same truth value for the compound statement in question, we have determined the truth value of the compound statement without having to determine the truth value of its unknown component, for we have shown that the entire compound statement must have this particular truth value regardless of the unknown truth value of a component simple statement. Truth tables allow us to expand this method to cases with more than one undetermined component (see Sections 8.7-8.10, and 9.9).

    Where two statements are combined by placing the word "if" before the first and inserting the word "then" between them, the resulting compound statement is a conditional statement (also called a hypothetical, an implication, or an implicative statement). In a conditional statement the component statement that follows the "if" is called the antecedent (or the implicans or—rarely—the protasis), and the component statement that follows the "then" is the consequent (or the implicate or—rarely—the apodosis). For example, "If Mr. Jones is the brakeman's next-door neighbor, then Mr. Jones earns exactly three times as much as the brakeman" is a conditional statement in which "Mr. Jones is the brakeman's next-door neighbor" is the antecedent and "Mr. Jones earns exactly three times as much as the brakeman" is the consequent.
    
    A conditional statement asserts that in any case in which its antecedent is true, its consequent is also true. It does not assert that its antecedent is true, but only that if its antecedent is true, then its consequent is also true. It does not assert that its consequent is true, but only that its consequent is true if its antecedent is true. The essential meaning of a conditional statement is the relationship asserted to hold between the antecedent and the consequent, in that order. To understand the meaning of a conditional statement, then, we must understand what the relationship of implication is.
    
    Implication plausibly appears to have more than one meaning. We found it useful to distinguish different senses of the word "or" before introducing a special logical symbol to correspond exactly to a single one of the meanings of the English word. Had we not done so, the ambiguity of the English would have infected our logical symbolism and prevented it from achieving the clarity and precision aimed at. It will be equally useful to distinguish the different senses of "implies" or "if-then" before we introduce a special logical symbol in this connection.
    
    Consider the following four conditional statements, each of which seems to assert a different type of implication, and to each of which corresponds a different sense of "if-then":
  - |-
    A. If all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, then Socrates is mortal.
    
    B. If Leslie is a bachelor, then Leslie is unmarried.
    
    C. If this piece of blue litmus paper is placed in acid, then this piece of blue litmus paper will turn red.
    
    D. If I receive a raise today, then I'll buy a new car.
    
    277
    
    8.4 Conditional Statements and Material Implication
    
    Even a casual inspection of these four conditional statements reveals that they are
    of quite different types. The consequent of A follows logically from its antecedent,
    whereas the consequent of B follows from its antecedent by the very definition of the
    term bachelor, which means "unmarried man." The consequent of C does not follow
    from its antecedent either by logic alone or by the definition of its terms; the con-
    nection must be discovered empirically, because the implication stated here is causal.
    Finally, the consequent of D does not follow from its antecedent either by logic or by
    definition, nor is there any causal law involved. Statement D reports a decision (or
    makes a promise) of the speaker to behave in the specified way under the specified
    circumstances.
    
    These four conditional statements are different in that each asserts a different type
    of implication between its antecedent and its consequent. But they are not completely
    different; all assert types of implication. Is there any identifiable common meaning,
    any partial meaning that is common to these admittedly different types of implication,
    although perhaps not the whole or complete meaning of any one of them?
  - |-
    The search for a common partial meaning takes on added significance when we  
    recall our procedure in working out a symbolic representation for the English word "or."  
    In that case, we proceeded as follows: First, we emphasized the difference between the  
    two senses of the word, contrasting inclusive with exclusive disjunction. The inclusive  
    disjunction of two statements was observed to mean that at least one of the statements  
    is true, and the exclusive disjunction of two statements was observed to mean that at  
    least one of the statements is true but not both are true. Second, we noted that these  
    two types of disjunction have a common meaning. This common meaning—that at  
    least one of the disjuncts is true—was seen to be the whole meaning of the weak, inclu-  
    sive "or," and a part of the meaning of the strong, exclusive "or." We then introduced  
    the special symbol " V " to represent this common partial meaning (which is the entire  
    meaning of "or" in its inclusive sense). Third, we noted that the symbol representing  
    the common partial meaning is an adequate translation of either sense of the word "or"  
    for the purpose of retaining the Disjunctive Syllogism as a valid form of argument. It  
    was admitted that translating an exclusive "or" into the symbol " V " ignores and loses  
    part of the word's meaning. The part of its meaning that is preserved by this translation  
    is all that is needed for the Disjunctive Syllogism to remain a valid form of argument.  
    Because the Disjunctive Syllogism is typical of arguments involving disjunction, with  
    which we are concerned here, this partial translation of the word "or," which may  
    abstract from its "full" or "complete" meaning in some cases, is wholly adequate for  
    our present purposes.
    
    Now we wish to proceed in the same way, this time in connection with the English  
    phrase "if-then." The first part is already accomplished: We have already emphasized the  
    differences among four senses of the "if-then" phrase corresponding to four different  
    types of implication. We are now ready for the second step, which is to discover a sense  
    that is at least a part of the meaning of all four types of implication.
  - |-
    We approach this problem by asking: What circumstances suffice to establish the
    falsehood of a given conditional statement? Under what circumstances should we agree
    that the conditional statement
    
    If this piece of blue litmus paper is placed in that acid solution, then this piece of blue litmus paper will
    turn red.

    Material
    implication
    
    A truth-functional
    statement consisting of
    an antecedent and a
    consequent, of the form
    p D q. The statement
    "p materially implies
    q'—p D g—is true
    when either p is false, or
    g is true.
    
    Horseshoe
    The symbol for material
    implication, D.
    
    is false? It is important to realize that this conditional does not assert that any blue
    litmus paper is actually placed in the solution, or that any litmus paper actually turns
    red. It asserts merely that if this piece of blue litmus paper is placed in the solution,
    then this piece of blue litmus paper will turn red. It is proved false if this piece of blue
    litmus paper is actually placed in the solution and does not turn red. The acid test, so
    to speak, of the falsehood of a conditional statement is available when its antecedent is
    true, because if its consequent is false while its antecedent is true, the conditional itself
    is thereby proved false.
    
    Any conditional statement, "If p then q," is false if the conjunction p-~gq is true—
    that is, if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. For a conditional to be true,
    then, the indicated conjunction must be false; that is, its negation ~(p-~q) must be true.
    In other words, for any conditional, "If p then q," to be true, the statement ~(p-~4q),
    which is the negation of the conjunction of its antecedent with the negation of its con-
    sequent, must also be true. We may then regard ~(p-~q) as a part of the meaning of "If
    p then q."

    Every conditional statement means to deny that its antecedent is true and its consequent false, but this need not be the whole of its meaning. A conditional such as
    A on p. 276 also asserts a logical connection between its antecedent and consequent, as
    B asserts a definitional connection, C a causal connection, and D a decisional connec-
    tion. No matter what type of implication is asserted by a conditional statement, part of
    its meaning is the negation of the conjunction of its antecedent with the negation of
    its consequent.
    
    We now introduce a special symbol to represent this common partial meaning of the
    "it-then" phrase. We define material implication (a conditional statement) and the
    new symbol ">", called a horseshoe (other systems employ the symbol " > " to express
    this relation), by taking pq as an abbreviation of ~(p-~q). The exact significance of
    the D symbol can be indicated by means of a truth table:
    
    ~q   p:-~q    ~(p- ~q)     pq
    
    ~q   p:-~q    ~(p- ~q)     pq
    
    xe)

    nm oH m7 H Ee}
    47m HAT
    nm 71 HA 7
    4 H 7m HF
    4347 A
    
    Here the first two columns are the guide columns; they simply lay out all possi-
    ble combinations of truth and falsehood for p and q. The third column is filled in by
    reference to the second, the fourth by reference to the first and third, and the fifth by
    reference to the fourth. The sixth is identical to the fifth by definition, as is indicated
    by the two shaded columns. (As we will see in Section 8.10, p D q is logically equivalent
    to ~(p - ~q).)
    
    The symbol ~ is not to be regarded as denoting the meaning of "if-then," or stand-
    ing for the relation of implication. That would be impossible, for there is no single
    meaning of "if-then"; there are several meanings. There is no unique relation of impli-
    cation to be thus represented; there are several different implication relations. Nor is
    the symbol - to be regarded as somehow standing for all the meanings of "if-then."
    These are all different, and any attempt to abbreviate all of them by a single logical
  - |-
    8.4 Conditional Statements and Material Implication
    
    The symbol would render that symbol ambiguous—as ambiguous as the English phrase "if-then" or the English word "implication." The symbol > is completely unambiguous. What pq abbreviates is ~(p→~q), whose meaning is included in the meanings of each of the various kinds of implications considered but does not constitute the entire meaning of any of them.
    
    We can regard the symbol © as representing another kind of implication, and it will be expedient to do so, because a convenient way to read pq is "If p, then q." But it is not the same kind of implication as any of those mentioned earlier. It is called material implication by logicians. In giving it a special name, we admit that it is a special notion, not to be confused with other, more usual, types of implication.
    
    Not all conditional statements in English need assert one of the four types of implication previously considered. Material implication constitutes a fifth type that may be asserted in ordinary discourse. Consider the remark, "If Hitler was a military genius, then I'm a monkey's uncle." It is quite clear that it does not assert logical, definitional, or causal implication. It cannot represent a decisional implication, because it scarcely lies in the speaker's power to make the consequent true. No "real connection," whether logical, definitional, or causal, obtains between antecedent and consequent here. A conditional of this sort is often used as an emphatic or humorous method of denying its antecedent. The consequent of such a conditional is usually a statement that is obviously or ludicrously false. And because no true conditional can have both a true antecedent and a false consequent, to affirm such a conditional amounts to denying that its antecedent is true. The full meaning of the present conditional seems to be the denial that "Hitler was a military genius" is true when "I'm a monkey's uncle" is false. Because the latter is so obviously false, the conditional must be understood to deny the former. One is saying: "Either Hitler was not a military genius or I'm a monkey's uncle (and, obviously, I'm not a monkey's uncle)."
  - |-
    The point here is that no "real connection" between antecedent and consequent  
    is suggested by a material implication. All that a conditional statement "If p, then q"  
    (i.e., p → q) asserts is that it is not the case that the antecedent is true and the consequent  
    is false (i.e., ~(p → q)); that is, it asserts that either the antecedent is false or the  
    consequent is true (i.e., ~p ∨ q). We have defined p → q as an abbreviation for ~(p → ~q);  
    we now see, in the truth table below, that the columns of T's and F's for each of these  
    three statement forms are identical.
    
    p
    q
    F
    F
    
    ~(p → ~q)
    p → q
    ~p ∨ q
    
    All three statement forms  
    ~(p → ~q)  
    p → q  
    ~p ∨ q  
    
    are logically equivalent to each other, an important fact that will be explained and demonstrated in Section 8.10, and utilized to great advantage in Section 9.6.

    **Chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments**
    
    A material implication or conditional statement is a truth-functional statement,  
    and the horseshoe symbol, →, is a truth-functional connective. Thus, the truth table  
    below defines a conditional statement—a material implication—and also the horseshoe  
    symbol, →.

    A conditional statement is false if and only if its antecedent is true and its consequent  
    is false; otherwise it is true.
    
    **Visual Logic**
    
    **Material Implication**
    
    "If the moon is made of green cheese, then the Earth is flat."
    
    This proposition, in the form p → q, is a material implication. A material implication is true when the  
    antecedent (the "if" clause) is false. Therefore a material implication is true when the antecedent is false  
    and the consequent is also false, as in this illustrative proposition.
    
    "If the moon is made of green cheese, then the Earth is round."
  - |-
    This proposition, in the similar form GD R, is also a material implication. A material implication is true when the antecedent (the "if" clause) is false. Therefore a material implication is true when the antecedent is false and the consequent is true, as in this illustrative proposition.
    
    A material implication is false only if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Therefore a material implication is true whenever the antecedent is false, whether the consequent is false or true.
    
    As defined by its definitional truth table on p. 280, the conditional statement p D q has some features that may at first appear odd: The assertion that a false antecedent materially implies a true consequent is true; and the assertion that a false antecedent materially implies a false consequent is also true. This apparent strangeness can be dissipated in part by the following considerations. Because the number 2 is smaller than the number 4 (a fact notated symbolically as 2 < 4), it follows that any number smaller than 2 is smaller than 4. The conditional statement
    
    If x < 2, then x < 4.
    
    is true for any number x whatsoever. If we focus on the numbers 1, 3, and 4, and replace the number variable x in the preceding conditional statement by each of them in turn, we can make the following observations. In
    
    If 1 < 2, then 1 < 4.
    
    both antecedent and consequent are true, and of course the conditional is true. In
    
    If 3 < 2, then 3 < 4.
    
    the antecedent is false and the consequent is true, and of course the conditional is again true. In
    
    If 4 < 2, then 4 < 4.

    both antecedent and consequent are false, but the conditional remains true. These
    last two cases correspond to the third and fourth rows of the table defining the sym-
    bol >. So it is not particularly remarkable or surprising that a conditional should be
    true when the antecedent is false and the consequent is true, or when antecedent
    and consequent are both false. Of course, there is no number that is smaller than
    2 but not smaller than 4; that is, there is no true conditional statement with a true
    antecedent and a false consequent. This is exactly what the defining truth table for
    > lays down.
    
    Now we propose to translate any occurrence of the "if-then" phrase into our logical
    symbol >. This proposal means that in translating conditional statements into our sym-
    bolism, we treat them all as merely material implications. Of course, most conditional
    statements assert more than that a merely material implication holds between their
    antecedents and consequents. So our proposal amounts to suggesting that we ignore, or
    put aside, or "abstract from," part of the meaning of a conditional statement when we
    translate it into our symbolic language. How can this proposal be justified?
    
    Chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    The previous proposal to translate both inclusive and exclusive disjunctions by
    means of the symbol V was justified on the grounds that the validity of the Disjunctive
    Syllogism was preserved even if the additional meaning that attaches to the exclusive
    "or" was ignored. Our present proposal to translate all conditional statements into the
    merely material implication symbolized by > may be justified in exactly the same way.
    Many arguments contain conditional statements of various kinds, but the validity of all
    valid arguments of the general type with which we will be concerned is preserved even
    if the additional meanings of their conditional statements are ignored. This remains to
    be proved, of course, and will occupy our attention in Section 8.8.
    
    Conditional statements can be formulated in a variety of ways. The statement
    
    If he has a good lawyer, then he will be acquitted.
    can equally well be stated without the use of the word "then" as
    If he has a good lawyer, he will be acquitted.
    
    The order of the antecedent and consequent can be reversed, provided that the "if" still
    directly precedes the antecedent, as
  - |-
    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    He will be acquitted if he has a good lawyer.
    
    It should be clear that, in any of the examples just given, the word "if" can be
    replaced by such phrases as "in case," "provided that," "given that," or "on condition
    that," without any change in meaning. Minor adjustments in the phrasings of antecedent
    and consequent permit such alternative phrasings of the same conditional as
    
    That he has a good lawyer implies that he will be acquitted.
    or
    His having a good lawyer entails his acquittal.
    
    A shift from active to passive voice may accompany a reversal of order of antecedent
    and consequent, yielding the logically equivalent
    
    His being acquitted is implied (or entailed) by his having a good lawyer.
    Other variations are possible:
    There is no way he won't be acquitted if he has a good lawyer.
    
    Any of these is symbolized as LD A.
    
    The notions of necessary and sufficient conditions provide other formulations of
    conditional statements. For any specified event, many circumstances are necessary for it
    to occur. Thus, for a normal car to run, it is necessary that there be fuel in its tank, that
    its spark plugs be properly adjusted, that its oil pump be working, and so on. So if the
    event occurs, every one of the conditions necessary for its occurrence must have been
    fulfilled. Hence to say
    
    That there is fuel in its tank is a necessary condition for the car to run.
    or
    The car runs only if there is fuel in its tank.
    which is another way of saying that
    If the car runs then there is fuel in its tank.
    
    Any of these is symbolized as R 5 F. Usually "q is a necessary condition for p" is symbolized
    as p > q. Likewise, "p only if q" is also symbolized as p > q.
  - |-
    For a specified situation there may be many alternative circumstances, any one of which is sufficient to produce that situation. For a purse to contain more than a dollar, for example, it is sufficient for it to contain five quarters, or eleven dimes, or twenty-one nickels, and so on. If any one of these circumstances obtains, the specified situation will be realized. Hence, to say "That the purse contains five quarters is a sufficient condition for it to contain more than a dollar" is to say "If the purse contains five quarters then it contains more than a dollar." In general, "p is a sufficient condition for q" is symbolized as p D q.
    
    To illustrate: Recruiters for the Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs (where annual bonuses are commonly in the millions) grill potential employees repeatedly. Those who survive the grilling are invited to the firm's offices for a full day of interviews, culminating in a dinner with senior Goldman Sachs executives. As it was reported in 1999, "Agile brains and near-perfect grades are necessary but not sufficient conditions for being hired. Just as important is fitting in."*
    
    If p is a sufficient condition for g, we have pq, and q must be a necessary condition for p. If p is a necessary condition for g, we have gD p, and q must be a sufficient condition for p. Hence, if p is necessary and sufficient for g, then gq is sufficient and necessary for p.
    
    p is a sufficient condition for g (q if p): p D q.
    p is a necessary condition for g (g only if p): q D p.
    p is a sufficient condition for g and p is a necessary condition for g (q if and only if p):
    
    (p> q)-(q2 p).
    
    In general, and more briefly, we say "p is necessary and sufficient for g," and we symbolize this by the last conjunctive statement form, namely: (p D q) - (q > p).

    Not every statement containing the word "if" is a conditional. None of the following
    statements is a conditional: "There is food in the refrigerator if you want some," "Your
    table is ready, if you please," "There is a message for you if you're interested," "The meet-
    ing will be held even if no permit is obtained." The presence or absence of particular
    words is never decisive. In every case, one must understand what a given sentence means,
    and then restate that meaning in a symbolic statement.

    Argument Forms and Refutation by
    Logical Analogy
    
    The central task of deductive logic, we have said, is discriminating valid arguments from
    invalid arguments. A valid argument, we explained in the very first chapter, cannot have
    all true premises and a false conclusion. Hence, if the premises of a valid argument are
    true, its conclusion must be true. Conversely, if the conclusion of a valid argument is
    false, at least one of the premises must be false.
    
    This informal account of validity must now be made more precise. To do this we
    introduce the concept of an argument form. Consider the following two arguments, which
    plainly have the same logical form. Suppose we are presented with the first of these
    arguments:
    
    If Bacon wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare, then Bacon was a great writer.
    Bacon was a great writer.
    Therefore Bacon wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare.

    We may agree with the premises but disagree with the conclusion, judging the argument to be invalid. One way of proving invalidity is by the method of logical analogy.
    "You might as well argue," we could retort, "that
    
    If Washington was assassinated, then Washington is dead.
    Washington is dead.
    Therefore Washington was assassinated.

    Refutation by
    logical analogy
    
    A method that shows
    the invalidity of an
    argument by presenting
    another argument that
    has the same form, but
    whose premises are
    known to be true and
    whose conclusion is
    known to be false.
    
    Variable or
    statement variable
    A placeholder; a letter
    (by convention, any
    of the lowercase
    letters, beginning with
    p, q, etc.) for which
    a statement may be
    substituted.
    
    Argument form
    
    An array of symbols—
    one sequence of
    symbols being the
    conclusion and one
    or more sequence(s)
    of symbols being the
    premise(s)—containing
    statement variables but
    no statements, such
    that when statements
    are substituted for the
    statement variables—the
    same statement
    being substituted for
    the same statement
    variable throughout—the
    result is an
    argument.
    
    You cannot seriously defend this argument," we would continue, "because here the
    premises are known to be true and the conclusion is known to be false. This argument
    is obviously invalid; your argument is of the same form, so yours is also invalid." This
    type of refutation is very effective.
  - |-
    This method of refutation by logical analogy points the way to an excellent  
    general technique for testing arguments. To prove the invalidity of an argument, it suf-  
    fices to formulate another argument that (1) has exactly the same form as the first and  
    (2) has true premises and a false conclusion. This method is based on the fact that valid-  
    ity and invalidity are purely formal characteristics of arguments, which is to say that any  
    two arguments that have exactly the same form are either both valid or both invalid,  
    regardless of any differences in the subject matter with which they are concerned. Here  
    we assume that the simple statements involved are neither logically true (e.g., "All chairs  
    are chairs") nor logically false (e.g., "Some chairs are nonchairs"). We also assume that  
    the only logical relations among the simple statements involved are those asserted or  
    entailed by the premises. The point of these restrictions is to limit our considerations,  
    in this chapter and the next, to truth-functional arguments alone, and to exclude other  
    kinds of arguments whose validity turns on more complex logical considerations that  
    are not appropriately introduced at this point.
    
    A given argument exhibits its form very clearly when the simple statements  
    that appear in it are abbreviated by capital letters. Thus we may abbreviate the state-  
    ments, "Bacon wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare," "Bacon was a great writer,"  
    "Washington was assassinated," and "Washington is dead," by the letters B, G, A, and  
    D, respectively, and using the familiar three-dot symbol ".." for "therefore," we may  
    symbolize the two preceding arguments as
    
    B, G, A, D  
    G and D  
    
    So written, their common form is easily seen.
    
    To discuss forms of arguments rather than particular arguments having those forms,  
    we need some method of symbolizing argument forms themselves. To achieve such a  
    method, we introduce the notion of a variable. In the preceding sections we used capi-  
    tal letters to symbolize particular simple statements. To avoid confusion, we use small,  
    or lowercase, letters from the middle part of the alphabet, p, g, s, t, ..., as statement  
    variables. A statement variable, as we shall use the term, is simply a letter for which,  
    or in place of which, a statement may be substituted. Compound statements as well as  
    simple statements may be substituted for statement variables.
  - |-
    We define an argument form as any array of symbols—one sequence of symbols being the conclusion and one or more sequence(s) of symbols being the premise(s)—containing statement variables but no statements, such that when statements are substituted for the statement variables—the same statement being substituted for the same statement variable throughout—the result is an argument. * For definiteness, we establish the convention that in any argument form, p shall be the first statement variable that occurs in it, and as other variables are introduced, they shall be labeled q, r, and s. Thus the expression
    
    pq
    
    is an argument form, for when the statements B and G are substituted for the statement variables p and q, respectively, the result is the first argument in this section. If the statements A and D are substituted for the variables p and q, the result is the second argument. Any argument that results from the substitution of statements for statement variables in an argument form—the same statement being substituted for the same statement variable throughout—is called a substitution instance of that argument form. Any substitution instance of an argument form may be said to have that form, and any argument that has a certain form is said to be a substitution instance of that form.
    
    For any argument there are usually several argument forms that have the given argument as a substitution instance. For example, the first argument of this section,
    
    BOG
    G
    
    is a substitution instance of each of the four argument forms
    
    p q
    pq pq p q
    
    q r r q
  - |-
    Thus we obtain the given argument by substituting B for p and G for q in the first argument form; by substituting B for p and G for both g and r in the second; B for both p and s and G for both g, q and r in the third; and BDG for p, G for q, and B for r in the fourth.
    Of these four argument forms, the first corresponds more closely to the structure of the given argument than do the others. It does so because the given argument results from the first argument form by substituting a different simple statement for each different statement variable in it. We call the first argument form the specific form of the given argument. Our definition of the specific form of a given argument is the following: If an argument is produced by substituting consistently a different simple statement for each different statement variable in an argument form, that argument form is the specific form of the given argument. For any given argument, there is a unique argument form that is the specific form of that argument.

    Argument m in Group A: Examining all the argument forms in Group B, we find

    The Precise Meaning of "Valid"
    and "Invalid"
    
    We are now in a position to address with precision the central questions of deductive logic:
    
    1. What precisely is meant by saying that an argument form is valid, or invalid?
    2. How do we determine whether a deductive argument form is valid, or invalid?
    
    The first of these questions is answered in this section, the second in the following
    section.
  - |-
    The term valid as applied to argument forms may be defined as follows: An argu-
    ment form is valid if and only if it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion. A
    valid argument form has no substitution instance with all true premises and a false
    conclusion. In contrast, the term invalid as applied to argument forms may be defined
    as follows: An invalid argument form can have all true premises and a false conclusion. An
    invalid argument form has at least one substitution instance whose premises are all
    true and whose conclusion is false. If the specific form of a given argument has any
    substitution instance whose premises are true and whose conclusion is false, then the
    
    Valid
    
    A deductive argument
    is valid if and only
    
    if it cannot have all
    true premises and
    
    a false conclusion.
    Validity is a formal
    characteristic; it applies
    only to arguments
    and argument forms,
    as distinguished from
    truth, which applies to
    propositions.
    
    Invalid
    
    Not valid; an invalid
    argument form can have
    all true premises and a
    false conclusion. Every
    deductive argument is
    either valid or invalid;
    invalidity characterizes
    a deductive argument
    that can have all true
    premises and a false
    conclusion.
    
    chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    given argument is invalid. This fact—that any argument whose specific form is an inva-
    lid argument form is an invalid argument—provides the basis for refutation by logical
    analogy (Section 6.2 and Section 8.5). A given argument is proved invalid if a refuting
    analogy can be found for it.
    
    "Thinking up" refuting analogies may not always be easy. Happily, it is not neces-
    sary, because for arguments of this type there is a simpler, purely mechanical method for
    determining whether or not a given argument form is valid or invalid.
    
    8.7 | Testing Argument Validity Using
    Truth Tables: The Complete
    Truth-Table Method (CTTM)
    
    Knowing exactly what it means to say that an argument is valid, or invalid, we now
    present the Complete Truth-Table Method (hereafter, the CTTM), a decision procedure° for
    determining whether any given argument or argument form is valid or invalid.
  - |-
    To test whether an argument form is valid or invalid, we determine whether or not it  
    can have all true premises and a false conclusion, and we do this by exhaustively examining all combinations of truth values for its statement variables. When, for example, an argument form contains just two different statement variables, p and q, there are exactly four combinations of truth values for its statement variables p and q: p and q are both true; p is true and q is false; p is false and q is true; and p and q are both false. Thus, to decide the validity of the following argument form  
    
    (P): p → q  
    (P,): g  
    
    we construct the following truth table:  
    
    | p | q | p → q | g |
    |---|---|-------|---|
    | T | T |   T   |   |
    | T | F |   F   |   |
    | F | T |   T   |   |
    | F | F |   T   |   |
    
    The T's and F's in the two initial or guide columns represent the truth values of the statement variables p and q in the argument form. Each row of this truth table represents one combination of truth values for the statement variables of the argument form, and each row gives the truth value of one or more statement forms for that particular combination of truth values (e.g., row 4 above gives the truth value T or True for p → q when p is false and q is false).  
    
    Most truth tables constructed to test an argument form (or argument) for validity will have multiple columns for multiple statement forms (or multiple statements), because most argument forms (and arguments) have multiple premises and a conclusion. For this reason, each column after the initial guide columns gives the truth values for one particular truth-functional statement form (e.g., p → q above) as a function of the truth values of the statement variables.

    statement variables, one combination of truth values per line. For example, the cell for
    column three, row 1, in the truth table just above gives the truth value of p → q when p is
    true and q is true. To correctly enter a truth value in this cell, we apply the truth-tabular
    definition for material implication (i.e., the horseshoe symbol) to the truth values of
    p and q, respectively, in row 1. Since the antecedent, p, is true and the consequent, q, is
    true, in line 1, we enter T for True in that cell, for the conditional p → q is true whenever
    its consequent is true. Moving to the next cell, we enter F for False, because in line 2
    p is true and q is false, and a conditional is false if and only if its antecedent is true and
    its consequent is false. In general, to enter the correct truth value in a cell, we use our
    knowledge of the truth table for the main logical operator of the statement form of that
    column and the truth values of the statement variables on that particular line.
    
    It is important to note that a truth table can be misread if we fail to properly label
    each premise and the conclusion. In constructing the truth table above, we label the
    third column heading "P," for the first premise of the argument form, the second column
    heading "P," for the second premise, and the first column heading ‘..,' indicating the
    conclusion of the argument form.
    
    In testing any argument form (or argument) for validity, our question is always: Can
    the argument form (or argument) have all true premises and a false conclusion? If an
    argument form (or argument) can have all true premises and a false conclusion—i.e., if
    an argument form is invalid—that argument form does have all true premises and a false
    conclusion for at least one combination of truth values for its statement variables. If, on
    the other hand, an argument form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion—
    i.e., if an argument form is valid—that argument form does not have all true premises and
    a false conclusion for any combination of truth values for its statement variables.
  - |-
    We can see this clearly by examining the above truth table. This argument form is
    invalid if and only if there is at least one combination of truth values for its statement
    variables—one line or row of the truth table—in which all of the premises are true and the
    conclusion is false. If we examine the truth table, we find that in the third row, when p
    is false and q is true, there are T's under both premises and an F under the conclusion,
    which shows that the argument form has all true premises and a false conclusion in this
    particular case.' The fact that the argument form does have all true premises and a false
    conclusion in this particular case proves that the argument form can have all true premises
    and false conclusion, and, therefore, that it is invalid. Any argument of this specific form
    (that is, any argument the specific argument form of which is the given argument form)
    is said to commit the fallacy of affirming the consequent, since its second premise affirms
    the consequent of its conditional first premise.
    
    Truth tables, although simple in concept, are powerful tools. In using them to estab-
    lish the validity or the invalidity of an argument form, it is critically important that the
    table first be constructed correctly. To construct the truth table correctly, there must be a
    guide column for each statement variable in the argument form—p, q, r, and so on. The
    array must exhibit all possible combinations of truth and falsity for all these variables, so
    there must be a number of horizontal rows sufficient to do this: four rows if there are two
    variables, eight rows if there are three variables, sixteen rows if there are four variables,
    and so on. In general, an argument form containing n distinct statement variables requires
    a truth table with n initial guide columns and 2ⁿ rows. For example, the argument form
    
    (P): p → q
    (P,): q → ~r
    "p → ~r
    
    chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    consists of three statement variables—p, q, and r—and so we must construct a truth table
    with 3 guide columns (for p, q, and r, in alphabetical order) and 2³ or 8 rows.

    To ensure that all combinations of truth values are represented in the truth table,
    the standard convention, and the convention adopted here, is as follows for 3 statement
    variables.
    
    e Under the third statement variable in the third guide column (i.e., r), alternate T's
    and F's.
    
    ° Under the second statement variable in the middle guide column (i.e., g), place two
    T's followed by two F's, followed by two T's, followed by two F's.
    
    ° Under the first statement variable in the first guide column (i.e., p), place four T's
    followed by four F's.
    
    If there are four statement variables—p, gq, r, and s—in an argument form, begin in the
    fourth guide column under s and alternate T's and F's as above, and follow the same
    procedure as above, until the first guide column, where one places eight T's followed by
    eight F's. The four guide columns for these four statement variables are as follows.

    Thus, for five statement variables—y, q, r, s, and t—the first column of its 32-row truth
    table (i.e., for p) will have sixteen T's followed by sixteen F's, the second column (i.e.,
    for q) will have eight T's, eight F's, eight T's, and eight F's, and so on.
    
    As stated above, a truth table must also have a vertical column for each of the prem-
    ises and for the conclusion, as well as a column for each compound component state-
    ment out of which the premises and conclusion are built. For the argument form above,
    namely
    
    (P,): p24

    There must, therefore, be two additional columns for the two premises to the right of the three guide columns, a column, immediately right of the third guide column, for ~r, and a column on the far right for the conclusion. This yields the following incomplete truth-table skeleton, consisting of seven columns and eight numbered lines for truth values (i.e., T's and F's). At this juncture it is crucial that we properly label the premises and conclusion to ensure that later, when we have completed the truth table, we examine only the truth values in the columns for the premises and the conclusion.

    In general, we construct the columns for the compound components of the premises and conclusion before we construct the premise and conclusion columns, and we construct these in order of complexity, from simplest to most complex. For example, for the statement form
    
    (pVq)-rlDs
    we would first construct a column for
    
    pV 4q
    
    and then a column for
    
    (pVq)-r
    and lastly a column for
    (pV q)- rs.
    
    Taking the truth-table skeleton above, we mechanically construct this truth table by writing T's and F's for each truth-functional compound statement form, beginning with ~r. In each case, we need to know the truth-tabular definition of the main logical operator of the statement form. Statement form ~r is true whenever r is false, and false whenever r is true. Looking at the column for r, we thereby construct the column for ~r, yielding the completed column for ~r, as follows.

    We next complete the column of truth values for Premise 1, namely p → q. This is a
    conditional statement form, and we know that a conditional is false only when its ante-
    cedent is true and its consequent is false. So, looking at the columns for the antecedent
    p and the consequent q, we place a T under p → q unless p is true and q is false. Since p
    is true and q is false only in lines 3 and 4, we place F's in those lines and T's in lines 1,
    2 and 5-8.

    Next, we complete the column of truth values for Premise 2, namely q → ~r. Again,
    this is a conditional statement form, which is false only when its antecedent q is true
    and its consequent ~r is false. Thus, to correctly populate the column with T's and F's,
    we look at the column for q and the column for ~r. Only in lines 1 and 5 is q true and
    ~r false, so q → ~r is true except on lines 1 and 5.

    Once again, this is a conditional statement form, which is only false when its anteced-
    ent p is true and its consequent ~r is false. Only in lines 1 and 3 is p true and ~r false, so

    The truth table for this argument form is now complete. Once the table has been
    constructed and the completed array is before us, it is essential to read it correctly—that
    is, to use it correctly to make the appraisal of the argument form in question. To this end,
    it is vitally important that we label the premises and conclusion, as we have above. This
    helps to ensure that we look only at the columns for the premises and the conclusion in
    determining whether the argument form is valid or invalid.
    
    In testing this argument form for validity, our question is, as always: Can this argu-
    ment form have all true premises and a false conclusion? If this argument form can have
    all true premises and a false conclusion—i.e., if this argument form is invalid—it does
    have all true premises and a false conclusion for at least one combination of truth values for
    its statement variables, and this will be exhibited in at least one line of the completed truth
    table. If, on the other hand, this argument form cannot have all true premises and a false
    conclusion—i.e., if this argument form is valid—it does not have all true premises and
    a false conclusion for any combination of truth values for its statement variables in the
    completed truth table.
    
    Valid Argument Form: A valid argument form cannot have all true premises
    and a false conclusion. If a truth-functional argument form of Propositional
    Logic cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, it does not have all
    true premises and a false conclusion for any combination of truth values for its
    statement variables. The fact that a valid argument form does not have all true
    premises and a false conclusion for any combination of truth values for its state-
    ment variables is exhibited in a completed truth table, because a completed truth
    table gives the truth values for the premises and conclusion for each and every such
    combination.
  - |-
    Invalid Argument Form: An invalid argument form can have all true premises and a false conclusion. If a truth-functional argument form of Propositional Logic can have all true premises and a false conclusion, it does have all true premises and a false conclusion for at least one combination of truth values for its statement variables. The fact that an invalid argument form does have all true premises and a false conclusion for at least one combination of truth values for its statement variables is exhibited in a completed truth table, because a completed truth table gives the truth values for the premises and conclusion for each and every such combination.
    
    Hence, to determine whether or not there is at least one such case, we need only check, mechanically but carefully, each row to see if, in any row, all of the premises are true and the conclusion is false. In the first row, we see that Premise 1 is true, but Premise 2 is false. In line 2, however, both premises are true, but the conclusion is also true, so we continue to scan down the table. We see that both premises are true in lines 6, 7, and 8, but in all three cases the conclusion is also true. Close scrutiny reveals that in no such case, for no combination of the eight combinations of truth values for the statement variables, are both premises true and the conclusion false. This means that the argument form is valid.
    
    Recall that, once the truth table is fully constructed, the question is: is there any one case, any single row, in which all the premises are true and the conclusion false? If there is such a row, the argument form is invalid; if there is no such row, the argument form is valid. In looking for such a row, we can more efficiently look only at those rows in which the conclusion is false. If we look for only false conclusions in the truth table above, we see that the conclusion is false only in rows 1 and 3, and in both cases the premises are not both true.

    This tells us, very efficiently, that the argument form is valid. (In Section 9.9, we
    shall see that the Shorter Truth-Table Technique exploits this more efficient method by
    constructing only those cases in which the conclusion is false.)

    Consider, next, the following argument form.
    
    (P,): p24
    (P,):qor
    (P,): ~r
    
    Since this argument form consists of three statement variables, its truth table will have
    three guide columns and eight lines, plus one additional column for ~r, three additional
    columns for the premises, and one additional column for the conclusion. We construct
    the truth-table skeleton, with eight columns and eight numbered lines, as follows, taking
    care to label each premise and the conclusion.

    With the truth table fully constructed, we now ask: Is there any one case, any single
    row, in which all the premises are true and the conclusion false? If there is such a row, the
    argument form is invalid; if there is no such row, the argument form is valid. Looking
    only for false conclusions, we see that this argument form has a false conclusion for all
    but two of the cases. In such a case, it is sometimes easier and quicker to look for lines
    on which all of the premises are true. There is only one such row.

    In this single case, where the premises are all true, the conclusion is false. Clearly,
    this argument form can have all true premises and a false conclusion, for when p, q,
    and r are all false, the premises are all true, but the conclusion is false. The truth table
    clearly shows, when properly constructed and properly read, that this argument form
    is invalid.
    
    Consider, lastly, the following argument form.
    
    (P): p → ¬q
    (P2): (q ∨ r) → s
    (C): r → s

    Since this argument form consists of four statement variables—p, q, r, and s—its truth table will have four guide columns and sixteen lines. How many columns are required for this truth table? For any compound statement consisting of truth-functional components, we construct a column for each distinct truth-functional component. Thus, for the first premise we must determine the truth values in each case for the component statement qg - r before we determine the truth values in each case for the entire conditional statement, p > (q -r). And for the second premise, we must determine the truth values in each case for the component statement g V r before we determine the truth values in each case for the entire conditional statement, (g V r) D s. This truth table therefore requires nine columns: four columns for the statement variables, two columns for the truth-functional components g - rand q V r, two columns for the premises, and a column for the conclusion. The truth-table skeleton, with nine columns and 16 rows, and labels for its premises and its conclusion, is constructed as follows.

    To complete the next column of truth values, we need to determine the main logical
    operator of the first premise, p > (q-r). The main logical operator is the outer-most logi-
    cal operator—the logical operator outside of all parentheses, brackets and braces. In this case,
    the first premise is a conditional because its main or outer-most logical operator is the
    horseshoe. Thus, to determine the truth value of conditional statement p D (q-r) in the
    seventh column, we look at the truth value of its antecedent, p, in the first column, and
    the truth value of its consequent, g-r, in the fifth column, for each combination of truth
    values for the statement variables (i.e., in each line). For example, in line 3, when p, gq,
    and r are respectively true, true and false, the antecedent, p, is true and the consequent,
    qt, is false, and so the conditional, p > (q - nr), is false. In this manner, we enter T's and
    F's in column seven for p D (q-r).

    Similarly, for the second premise, (q V r) → s, we can see that it too is a conditional since its main (or outer-most) logical operator is the horseshoe. Thus, to determine the truth value of conditional statement, (q V r) → s, in the eighth column, we look at the truth value of its antecedent, q V r, in the sixth column, and the truth value of its consequent, s, in the fourth column, for each combination of truth values for the statement variables (i.e., in each line). For example, in line 12, when q, r, and s are respectively true, false and false, the antecedent, q V r, is true and the consequent, s, is false, and so the conditional, (q V r) → s, is false. In this manner, we enter T's and F's in column 8 for (q V r) → s.

    8.7. Testing Argument Validity Using Truth Tables: The Complete Truth-Table Method (CTTM)
    
    chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    As is indicated by the shading, there are only four cases in which the conclusion,
    p ~ S, is false, and in each such case the premises are not both true. Since there is no case
    in which the premises are all true and the conclusion false, the argument form is valid.
    
    The foregoing shows that the Complete Truth-Table Method for testing argument
    forms (and arguments) for validity is simple, mechanical, and very powerful. Any truth-
    functional argument form can be tested for validity using this method.
    
    The Complete Truth-Table Method (CTTM)
    
    For any truth-functional argument form (or argument) of Propositional Logic the CTTM determines
    whether it is valid or invalid by determining whether it can have all true premises and a false conclusion.
    Whether this is logically possible for a given argument form is determined by examining every possible
    combination of truth values for the argument form's statement variables.
    
    Valid Argument Form: A valid argument form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion.
    A valid argument form does not have all true premises and a false conclusion for any combination of
    
    truth values for its statement variables.
    
    The complete truth table for a valid argument form does not have all true premises and a false conclu-
    
    sion on any line (i.e., for any combination of truth values for the statement variables).
    
    Invalid Argument Form: An invalid argument form can have all true premises and a false conclusion.
    An invalid argument form does have all true premises and a false conclusion for at least one combina-
    
    tion of truth values for its statement variables.

    The complete truth table for an invalid argument form does have all true premises and a false conclusion on at least one line (i.e., for at least one combination of truth values for the statement variables).
    
    3: Some Common Argument Forms
    
    A. Common Valid Forms
    
    Some valid argument forms are exceedingly common and may be intuitively understood.
    These may now be precisely identified. They should be recognized wherever they appear,
    and they may be called by their widely accepted names: (1) Disjunctive Syllogism,
    (2) Modus Ponens, (3) Modus Tollens, and (4) Hypothetical Syllogism.
    
    Disjunctive Syllogism
    
    One of the simplest argument forms relies on the fact that in every true disjunction, at
    least one of the disjuncts must be true. Therefore, if one of them is false, the other must
    be true. Arguments in this form are exceedingly common. When a candidate for a high
    appointed office was forced to withdraw her candidacy because of a tax violation involv-
    ing one of her employees, a critic wrote: "In trying to cover up her own illegal alien pec-
    cadillo, or stonewall her way out of it, she was driven either by stupidity or arrogance.
    She's obviously not stupid; her plight must result, then, from her arrogance."?
    
    8.8 Some Common Argument Forms
    
    We symbolize the Disjunctive Syllogism as
    
    (P,): pV q
    (P,): ~p
    
    and to show its validity we construct the following truth table:
    
    p  q  pVq  ~p

    The truth table shows that whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. Therefore, the disjunctive syllogism is a valid argument form.
  - |-
    Here, too, the initial or guide columns exhibit all four combinations of truth values for the statement variables, p and q. We fill in the third column by referring to the first two, and the fourth by reference to the first alone. Now the third row is the only one in which T's appear under both premises (the third and fourth columns), and there a T also appears under the conclusion (the second column). The truth table thus shows that the argument form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, and thereby proves the validity of the argument form being tested. As used in this chapter, the term Disjunctive Syllogism is the name of an elementary argument form, here proved valid. This form is always valid, of course, and therefore, in modern logic, disjunctive syllogism always refers to an elementary argument form that is valid. In Syllogistic logic, however, the term disjunctive syllogism is used more broadly, to refer to any syllogism that contains a disjunctive premise; some such syllogisms may of course be invalid. One must be clear whether the expression is being used in the broader or the narrower sense. Here we use it in the narrower sense.
    
    Here, as always, it is essential that the truth table be read accurately; the column representing the conclusion (second from the left) and the columns representing the premises (third and fourth from the left) must be carefully identified. It is for this reason that they should be properly labeled, as above. Only by using those three columns correctly can we reliably determine the validity (or invalidity) of the argument form in question. Note that the very same truth table could be used to test the validity of a very different argument form, one whose premises are represented by the second and third columns and whose conclusion is represented by the fourth column. That argument form is
    
    (P1): p ∨ q  
    (P2): ¬q  
    C: p  
    
    The truth table for this argument consists of the same columns and rows, but, significantly, it is differently labeled.

    This argument form, as we can see from the top row of the truth table, is invalid. The
    CTTM provides a completely mechanical method for determining the validity or invalid-
    ity of any argument of the general type considered here.
    
    We are now in a position to justify our proposal to translate any occurrence of the
    "if-then" phrase into our material implication symbol, >. In Section 8.4, the claim was
    made that all valid arguments of the general type with which we are concerned here
    that involve "if-then" statements remain valid when those statements are interpreted
    as affirming merely material implications. Truth tables can be used to substantiate this
    claim, and will justify our translation of "if-then" into the horseshoe symbol.
    
    Modus Ponens
    
    The simplest type of intuitively valid argument involving a conditional statement is
    illustrated by the argument:
    
    If the second native told the truth, then only one native is a politician.
    The second native told the truth.
    Therefore only one native is a politician.
    
    The specific form of this argument, known as modus ponens ("the method of put-
    ting, or affirming"), is
    
    (P): p24
    (P,): P
    
    and is proved valid by the following truth table:

  - |-
    Here the two premises are represented by the third and first columns, as labeled, and  
    the conclusion is represented by the second. Only in the first row are both premises true,  
    and in that case the conclusion is true also. Or, if we look instead for cases in which the  
    conclusion is false, we see that the conclusion g is false in the second and fourth rows,  
    but in both cases the premises are not all true. This truth table establishes, therefore,  
    that this argument form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, which  
    demonstrates the validity of any argument of the form modus ponens.
    
    Modus Tollens
    
    If a conditional statement is true, then if the consequent is false, the antecedent must  
    also be false. The argument form that relies on this is very commonly used to establish  
    the falsehood of some proposition under attack. To illustrate: A distinguished rabbi,  
    insisting that the Book of Genesis was never meant to be a scientific treatise, presented  
    this crisp argument:
    
    A literal reading of Genesis would lead one to conclude that the world is less than 6,000 years old and that  
    the Grand Canyon could have been carved by the global flood 4,500 years ago. Since this is impossible, a  
    literal reading of Genesis must be wrong."°
    
    The argument may be symbolized as  
    (P): p24  
    (P,): ~q  
    <p
    
    The validity of this argument form, called modus tollens ("the method of taking away,  
    or denying"), may be shown by the following truth table:
    
    p | q | p → q | ~q | ~p  
    ---|---|------|----|----
    T | T |  T   | F  | F  
    T | F |  F   | T  | F  
    F | T |  T   | F  | T  
    F | F |  T   | T  | T  
    
    Here again, there is no case, no line, on which the premises, p → q and ~q, are both  
    true and the conclusion, ~p, is false. The conclusion is false in exactly two cases, on lines  
    1 and 2 (shaded), and in neither case are both premises true.
    
    Hypothetical Syllogism
    
    Another common type of intuitively valid argument contains only conditional state-  
    ments. Here is an example:

    Hypothetical
    Syllogism
    
    A syllogism that
    contains a conditional
    ("hypothetical")
    proposition as a
    premise. If the syllogism
    contains conditional
    (hypothetical)
    propositions exclusively,
    it is called a "pure"
    hypothetical syllogism;
    if the syllogism contains
    one conditional and
    
    one categorical premise,
    
    it is called a "mixed"
    hypothetical syllogism.
    
    Constructive
    Dilemma
    
    An elementary valid
    argument form
    consisting of two
    premises and a
    conclusion. The first
    premise is a conjunction
    of two conditional
    statements. The
    second premise is a
    disjunction in which
    the first disjunct is the
    antecedent of the first
    conditional in the
    
    first premise, and
    
    the second disjunct is
    the antecedent of the
    second conditional in
    the first premise.
    
    The conclusion validly
    infers a disjunction in
    which the first disjunct
    is the consequent of
    the first conditional
    
    in the first premise, and
    the second disjunct is
    the consequent of the
    second conditional in
    the first premise.

    This argument form, called a Hypothetical Syllogism (or, as in Chapter 7, a pure hypothetical syllogism), contains three distinct statement variables, so the truth table must have three initial (or guide) columns and eight rows for all combinations of truth values for the three statement variables, p, q, and r. Besides the initial guide columns, three additional columns are needed: two for the premises, the third for the conclusion. The truth table is:
    
    p  q  r  (p → q)  (q → r)  ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r
    
    Now, let's construct this truth table:
    
    1. p: T, q: T, r: T
       (p → q): T, (q → r): T, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: T
    
    2. p: T, q: T, r: F
       (p → q): T, (q → r): F, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: T
    
    3. p: T, q: F, r: T
       (p → q): F, (q → r): T, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: F
    
    4. p: T, q: F, r: F
       (p → q): F, (q → r): T, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: F
    
    5. p: F, q: T, r: T
       (p → q): T, (q → r): T, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: T
    
    6. p: F, q: T, r: F
       (p → q): T, (q → r): F, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: T
    
    7. p: F, q: F, r: T
       (p → q): T, (q → r): T, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: T
    
    8. p: F, q: F, r: F
       (p → q): T, (q → r): T, ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → r: T
    
    In constructing this truth table, we fill in the fourth column by looking back to the first and second, the fifth by reference to the second and third, and the sixth by reference to the first and third. Examining the completed table, we observe that the premises are all true in the first, fifth, seventh, and eighth rows (as indicated by mid blue shading), and that in all of these the conclusion is also true. Alternatively, we see that the conclusion is only false in the second and fourth rows (as indicated by light blue shading), and in both cases the premises are not both true. Whether we examine all cases of all true premises or all cases in which the conclusion is false, we determine that the argument form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion. Thus, this truth table establishes the validity of the argument form and proves that the hypothetical syllogism remains valid when its conditional statements are translated by means of the horseshoe symbol.
  - |-
    The arguments that concern us here contain only simple statements and compound
    statements that are built up out of simple statements using the tilde (curl) and the
    truth-functional connectives symbolized by the dot, wedge, and horseshoe. As more
    complicated argument forms are considered, larger truth tables are required to test
    them, because for n distinct statement variables a truth table with n initial guide col-
    umns and 2" rows is required. Only two guide columns and four rows are required for
    an argument form with just two statement variables. But three guide columns and eight
    rows are required for an argument form with three variables, such as the hypothetical
    syllogism. To test the validity of an argument form, such as that of the Constructive
    Dilemma,
    
    (P → Q), (P → R)
    (P → S)
    (P → T)
    (P → U)
    (P → V)
    
    which contains four distinct statement variables, a truth table with four initial columns
    and sixteen rows is required.

    As this truth table shows, there are exactly four cases in which the conclusion, q V s, is false (highlighted in light blue), and in every such case, the premises are not all true. Conversely, there are exactly five cases in which the premises are both true (highlighted in mid blue), but in every such case, the conclusion is not false. This truth table demonstrates, therefore, that Constructive Dilemma is a valid argument form.
    
    Enough examples have been provided to illustrate the proper use of the CTTM, and perhaps enough have been given to show that the validity of any valid argument involving conditional statements is preserved when its conditionals are translated into material implications. Any doubts that remain can be allayed by the reader's translating and testing similar examples.
    
    B. Common Invalid Forms
    
    Two invalid argument forms deserve special notice because they superficially resemble valid forms and therefore often tempt careless writers or readers. The fallacy of affirming the consequent, discussed also in Sections 7.7 and 8.7, is symbolized as
    
    (P): p → q  
    (q): q  
    Therefore, (P,): p  
    
    Although the shape of this argument form is something like that of modus ponens, the two argument forms are very different, and this form is not valid. We can see that this argument form is invalid by constructing its truth table as follows:
    
    p | q | p → q | q | p  
    ---|----|-------|----|---  
    T | T |   T   |  T | T  
    T | F |   F   |  F | T  
    F | T |   T   |  T | F  
    F | F |   T   |  F | F  
    
    From this truth table, we can see that in the cases where the conclusion (p) is true, the premises (p → q and q) are not both true. Therefore, the argument form is invalid.

    As the truth table clearly shows on line 3, this argument form is invalid—it clearly
    can have all true premises and a false conclusion because it does have all true premises
    and a false conclusion when p is false and q is true. The invalidity of this argument
    form is well illustrated in a syllogism about the dictatorial president of Iraq, the late
    Saddam Hussein, here recounted by Orlando Patterson (Mr. Patterson's wording of
    the syllogism is very slightly different but has exactly the same logical force). "If one
    is a terrorist one is a tyrant who hates freedom. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who hates
    freedom. Therefore Saddam Hussein is a terrorist."'' Let us suppose that the hypo-
    thetical first premise is true and that the second premise describing Saddam Hussein
    is also true. These premises can both be true and yet it could be the case that Saddam
    Hussein is not a terrorist (i.e., the conclusion could be false). The foregoing truth
    table clearly shows that both premises can be true and the conclusion false. Since the
    second premise affirms (about Saddam Hussein as one tyrant) only the consequent
    of the preceding hypothetical, the argument plainly commits the fallacy of affirming
    the consequent.
    
    Another invalid form, called the fallacy of denying the antecedent, has a shape some-
    what like that of modus tollens and may be symbolized as
    
    (P → Q): ~p
    7q
    
    The truth table for this argument form is:
    
    p   q  ~p  ~q
    T   T  F   F
    T   F  F   T
    F   T  T   F
    F   F  T   T
    
    We see in this truth table that the argument form is invalid—that it can have all true
    premises and a false conclusion, because it does have all true premises and a false conclu-
    sion when p is false and q is true, on line 3.
    
    C. Substitution Instances and Specific Forms
    
    A given argument can be a substitution instance of several different argument forms,
    as we noted earlier when defining argument form. Hence the valid Disjunctive Syllogism
    examined on p. 264, which may be symbolized as
  - |-
    RVW  
    ~R  
    WwW  
    
    8.8 Some Common Argument Forms  
    
    is a substitution instance of the valid argument form  
    
    pV q  
    ~p  
    
    and is also a substitution instance of the invalid argument form  
    
    P  
    q  
    
    It is obvious, in this last form, that from two premises, p and q, we cannot validly infer  
    r. So it is clear that a valid argument can be a substitution instance of a valid argument  
    form and of an invalid argument form. Therefore, in determining whether any given  
    argument is valid, we must look to the specific form of the argument in question. Only the  
    specific form of the argument reveals the full logical structure of that argument, and  
    because it does, we know that if the specific form of an argument is valid, the argument  
    itself must be valid.  
    
    In the illustration just given, we see an argument (R V W, ~R, .. W) and two argu-  
    ment forms of which that argument could be a substitution instance. The first of these  
    argument forms (p V q, ~p, .. qg) is valid, and because that form is the specific form of  
    the given argument, its validity establishes that the given argument is valid. The second  
    of these argument forms is invalid, but because it is not the specific form of the given  
    argument, it cannot be used to show that the given argument is invalid.  
    
    This point should be emphasized: An argument form that is valid can have only valid  
    arguments as substitution instances. That is, all of the substitution instances of a valid  
    form must be valid. This is proved by the truth-table proof of validity for the valid argu-  
    ment form, which shows that there is no possible substitution instance of a valid form  
    that has all true premises and a false conclusion.

    8.9 | Statement Forms and Material Equivalence
    
    A. Statement Forms and Statements
  - |-
    We now make explicit a notion that was assumed in Sections 8.7 and 8.8, the notion of a statement form. There is an exact parallel between the relation of argument to argument form, on the one hand, and the relation of statement to statement form, on the other. The definition of a statement form makes this evident: A statement form is any sequence of symbols containing statement variables but no statements, such that when statements are substituted for the statement variables—the same statement being substituted for the same statement variable throughout—the result is a statement. Thus pV q is a statement form, because when statements are substituted for the variables p and q, a statement results. The resulting statement is a disjunction, so pV q is called a disjunctive statement form. Analogously, p-q and p Dq are respectively called conjunctive and conditional statement forms, and ~ p is called a negation statement form or a denial statement form. Just as any argument of a certain form is said to be a substitution instance of that argument form, so any statement of a certain form is said to be a substitution instance of that statement form. Just as we distinguished the specific form of a given argument, so we distinguish the specific form of a given statement as that statement form from which the statement results by substituting consistently a different simple statement for each different statement variable. Thus pV q is the specific form of the statement, "The blind prisoner has a red hat or the blind prisoner has a white hat."
    
    With this definition of "statement form," we can now provide a precise and more succinct definition of "argument form": an argument form is a sequence of statement forms, where all but the last statement form are premises, and the last statement form is the conclusion.

    Viewed by many as the most original and creative of American logicians—Bertrand Russell called him "certainly the greatest American thinker ever"—Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) made contributions of such complexity and variety to the fields of logic and mathematics that it is not easy to summarize them. For him, what we call logic was the formal branch of the theory of signs, semiotics—a study of which he was the founder.
  - |-
    The son of a professor of mathematics and astronomy at Harvard, Peirce was fascinated
    by logic from the time that he read Whateley's Elements of Logic at the age of 12. He received
    his BA and MA from Harvard, but was despised by one of his instructors, Charles William
    Eliot, who—as President of Harvard for forty years—made it virtually impossible for Peirce
    to obtain the academic employment that he sought.

    Biography
    
    Chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    It was in the United States Coast Survey that Peirce was chiefly
    employed until, at the age of 40, he was appointed lecturer in logic at
    the recently established Johns Hopkins University. This position he
    held for five years, but he lost it as a consequence of assorted marital
    and sexual scandals in which he became involved. Academic employ-
    ment was from that time denied him everywhere. Peirce was an odd
    man, with an odd manner; he was not very likeable, or sociable, or
    cooperative; his conduct was often irresponsible. Probably he suf-
    fered from some serious psychological disabilities.
  - |-
    As a thinker, however, he was productive in science and mathematics and philosophy, as well as in logic. He wrote prolifically; some of his writings have not yet been published. He defended the frequency theory of probability, contending that science can achieve no more than statistical probabilities—never certainties. He worked on infinitesimals and on the theory of mathematical continua. He developed the logic of relations ("If X is taller than Y, and Y is taller than Z, then X is taller than Z"). He refined quantification theory. He created a three-value logic in which "undetermined" was the third value. He improved truth tables. He devised symbols for new logical operations. He was one of the first to see that Boolean calculations could be carried out in the material world using electrical switches.
    
    Some scholars who much later participated in the design and construction of the first electronic computers credited their insights to the suggestiveness of Peirce's writings. The American logician C. I. Lewis wrote that "the contributions of C. S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer."
    
    In philosophy Peirce is most famous as the founder, with John Dewey, of the American movement we call pragmatism, which was for him essentially a theory of truth: A proposition is true if it works satisfactorily, and the meaning of a proposition is to be found in the practical consequences of accepting it. He reported that he learned philosophy, when he was a college student, by reading every day a few pages of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, a work he studied regularly for ten years.
  - |-
    Peirce was a man of most peculiar habits. He spent his inheritance on land and a large
    house in eastern Pennsylvania that he could not afford to maintain. He lived beyond his
    means; he relied upon his friends to pay his debts and his taxes. During the last years of his
    life he could not afford to heat his home in winter, and lived largely on old bread donated
    by a local baker. In that big house in Milford, Pennsylvania, he died in 1914 at the age of 74.
    
    B. Tautologous, Contradictory, and Contingent
    Statement Forms
    
    The statement, "Lincoln was assassinated" (symbolized as L), and the statement, "Either
    Lincoln was assassinated or else he wasn't" (symbolized as L V ~L), are both obviously
    true. But, we would say, they are true "in different ways" or have "different kinds" of
    truth. Similarly, the statement, "Washington was assassinated" (symbolized as W), and
    the statement "Washington was both assassinated and not assassinated" (symbolized as
    W .~W), are both plainly false—but they also are false "in different ways" or have "dif-
    ferent kinds" of falsehood. These differences in the "kinds" of truth or of falsehood are
    important and very great.
    
    That the statement L is true, and that the statement W is false, are historical facts—
    facts about the way events did happen. There is no logical necessity about them. Events
    8.9 Statement Forms and Material Equivalence
    
    might have occurred differently, and therefore the truth values of such statements as
    L and W must be discovered by an empirical study of history. But the statement L V ~ L,
    although true, is not a truth of history. There is logical necessity here: Events could not
    have been such as to make it false, and its truth can be known independently of any
    particular empirical investigation. The statement L V ~ L is a logical truth, a formal truth,
    true in virtue of its logical form alone. It is a substitution instance of a statement form
    that is true for all combinations of truth values for its constituent statement variables.
  - |-
    A statement form that is true for all combinations of truth values for its constituent  
    statement variables is a tautologous statement form, or a tautology. A tautologous state-  
    ment form can have only tautologous substitution instances. To show that the statement  
    form p V ~p is a tautology, we construct the following truth table:
    
    | p | ~p | p ∨ ~p |
    |---|----|--------|
    | T | F  | T      |
    | T | T  | T      |
    
    There is only one initial or guide column to this truth table, because the form we  
    are considering contains only one statement variable. Consequently, there are only two  
    rows, which represent all possible truth values for its constituent statement variable,  
    namely p. There are only T's in the column under the statement form in question,  
    p ∨ ~p, and this fact shows that the statement form p ∨ ~p is true for all possible truth  
    values of its statement variable, p. Any statement that is a substitution instance of a  
    tautologous statement form is true in virtue of its form, and is itself said to be tautolo-  
    gous, or a tautology. A truth-functional tautology, such as p ∨ ~p, is necessarily true in the  
    clear and rigorous sense that it cannot be false for any combination of truth values for  
    its constituent statement variable(s). Just as a valid, purely truth-functional argument  
    form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion for any combination of truth  
    values for its constituent statement variables, a tautologous statement form cannot  
    be false for any combination of truth values for its constituent statement variable(s).  
    This fact is perhaps most vividly exemplified by the argument form of petitio principii  
    (begging the question)
    
    (P,): p
    
    and the corresponding conditional statement form  
    p → p.
    
    The argument form clearly begs the question by assuming in its premise what it infers in  
    its conclusion. Still, it is a valid argument form, as is made clear by constructing its truth  
    table.
    
    | P | p → p |
    |---|--------|
    | T | T      |
    
    This argument form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion because when  
    its premise, p, is true, its conclusion, p, is true, and when its conclusion, p, is false, its

    **Contradiction**
    
    A statement form that is false for all combinations of truth values for its constituent statement variables, and for which all substitution instances must be false.
    
    **Contingent Statement Form**
    
    A statement form that can be true or false—which is true for at least one combination of truth values for its constituent statement variables, and which is false for at least one combination of truth values for its constituent statement variables—is a contingent statement form; it is neither tautologous nor contradictory.
    
    A premise, p, is false. At the end of Section 4.5, we pointed out that this fallacy type, circular reasoning or begging the question (petitio principii), is valid, but trivial. We can now more rigorously say that although the argument form is valid, and a substitution instance of it may be sound, it is non-demonstrative in the sense that no argument of this specific form can demonstrate the truth of its conclusion, since it assumes the truth of that very statement in its premise(s). No rational person who doubts or wonders about the truth of "There exist intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe" will or should be convinced of its truth by someone who deduces this statement from itself!
    
    Similarly, the conditional statement form
    
    p → p
    
    is tautologous, as is readily seen by constructing its truth table.
    
    T T
    
    The conditional statement form p → p is tautologous because it cannot be false, for if its antecedent, p, is true, its consequent, p, is true, and if its antecedent, p, is false, the conditional is true. This limit case of validity and tautologousness will be explicated shortly, in Section 8.9 (D), and the important connection between a valid argument form and its corresponding tautologous conditional statement form will prove helpful in Section 9.11 (A), when we justify the Rule of Conditional Proof.
  - |-
    A statement form that is false for all combinations of truth values for its constituent
    statement variables is a self-contradictory statement form, or a contradiction, and
    is logically false. The statement form p - ~p is a contradiction, which is made clear by
    the following truth table.
    
    Pp ~p Pp: ~Pp
    T F
    T F
    
    We can easily see that the statement form p - ~p is false for all combinations of
    truth values for its one statement variable, p. When p is true, ~ p is false, and so the con-
    junction of p and ~p, namely p - ~p, is false, because one of its conjuncts, ~p, is false.
    And when p is false, ~p is true, and the conjunction, p - ~p, is false, because one of its
    conjuncts, p, is false. Any statement, such as W - ~ W, which is a substitution instance
    of a self-contradictory statement form, is necessarily false in virtue of its form—false for
    every possible combination of truth values for the statement variables of its statement
    form—and is itself said to be self-contradictory, or a contradiction.
    
    A statement form that can be true or false—which is true for at least one combi-
    nation of truth values for its constituent statement variables and which is false for
    at least one combination of truth values for its constituent statement variables—is
    a contingent statement form. Since a contingent statement form can be true or
    false, it will have both true and false statements among its substitution instances. Any
    statement whose specific form is contingent is called a contingent statement. (It will be
    recalled that we are assuming here that no simple statements are either logically true or
    logically false. Only contingent simple statements are admitted here. See pp. 192-3.) Thus
    p, ~p, p-q, pV q, and pDq are all contingent statement forms, and such statements
    as L, ~L, L-W, LV W, and LDW are contingent statements, because their truth
    values are dependent, or contingent, on their contents rather than on their forms
    alone.

    Not all statement forms are so obviously tautological or self-contradictory or contingent as the simple examples cited. For example, the statement form [(p > q) → p] → p is not at all obvious, though its truth table will show it to be a tautology.

    We can see in the truth table above that this statement form, [(p > q) → p] → p (called Peirce's Law), is tautologous, as it is true for every combination of truth values for its constituent statement variables, p and q. The column for the statement form p → q and the column for the statement form (p → q) → p indicate that both of these statement forms are contingent, since both are true for at least one combination of truth values for the statement variables p and q.
    
    C. Material Equivalence
    
    A material equivalence is a truth-functional statement, just as disjunction and material implication are truth-functional statements. The truth value of any statement formed by linking two statements with a truth-functional connective, as explained earlier, depends on (is a function of) the truth or falsity of the statements it connects. Thus, we say that the disjunction of A and B is true if either A is true or B is true or if they are both true. A material equivalence is a truth-functional statement that asserts that the statements it connects have the same truth value. Two statements that are equivalent in truth value, therefore, are materially equivalent. One straightforward definition is this: Two statements are materially equivalent when they are both true, or both false.
    
    Just as the symbol for disjunction is the wedge, and the symbol for material implication is the horseshoe, there is also a special symbol for material equivalence, the three-bar sign or tribar, =. (Some systems employ the symbol "≡.") And just as we gave truth-table definitions for the wedge and the horseshoe, we can do so for the tribar. Here is the truth table for material equivalence, =.

    are both false—that  
    is, when they have  
    the same truth value. Materially equivalent  
    statements materially

    chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments  
    
    another. Therefore any two statements that are materially equivalent must imply one  
    another, because they are either both true or both false.  
    
    Since any two statements, A and B, that are materially equivalent imply one another,  
    we may infer from their material equivalence that B is true if A is true (A > B), and  
    also that B is true only if A is true (B D A). The converse also holds: A is true if B is true  
    (BD A), and A is true only if B is true (A > B). Because both of these relations are entailed  
    by material equivalence, we can read the three-bar sign, =, to say "if and only if." Thus,  
    "A if and only if B" (often abbreviated as "A iff B") is symbolized as A = B, which is logi-  
    cally equivalent to the conjunction, (B > A) and (A D B).  
    
    In everyday discourse we use this logical relation only occasionally. I will go to the  
    championship game, one may say, if and only if I can acquire a ticket. I will go if I do  
    acquire a ticket, but I can go only if I acquire a ticket. So my going to the game, and my  
    acquiring a ticket to the game, are materially equivalent.
  - |-
    Every implication is a conditional statement, as we noted earlier. Two statements,
    A and B, that are materially equivalent entail the truth of the conditional A D B, and
    also entail the truth of the conditional B > A. Thus, A =B entails the truth of (A D B)
    and the truth of (B 5 A); A = B entails the conjunction of these two conditionals, namely
    (A > B)- (BD A). Because the implication goes both ways when material equivalence
    holds, a statement of the form A = B is often called a biconditional. The biconditional
    statement "A if and only if B," symbolized as A = B, is so called because it is logically
    equivalent (as will be shown in Section 8.10) to the conjunction of two conditional state-
    ments, namely (A 5 B)- (BD A).
    
    We can now state the important connections between a biconditional (a material
    equivalence), a conditional, and necessary and sufficient conditions (as discussed in
    Section 8.4).
    
    "q if p" or "if p, then q" (p is a sufficient condition for q): p D q.
    
    "gq only if p" (p is a necessary condition for q): q D p.
    
    "gif and only if p" (pis a sufficient condition for q and p is a necessary condition for q):
    (p> q)-(q> p).
    
    "p if and only if q" (gis a sufficient condition for p and q is a necessary condition for p):
    (q > p) (p> 4).
    
    "p if and only if q" (q is a sufficient condition for p and q is a necessary condition
    for p): p = 4.
    
    (q> p):(p>q) (p>q)-(q>p) p=q

    As we Shall see shortly, in Section 8.10, the statement forms in the last three col-
    umns are logically equivalent to each other. Thus, the biconditional statement A = B
    does capture the two conditionals of "A if and only if B'—i.e., B D A and A D B—as is
    shown by the conjunction of those two conditional statements in the logically equivalent
    statement (A D B)- (BD A).
    
    There are five truth-functional logical operators (i.e., four connectives and one
    non-connective logical operator) on which deductive arguments commonly depend:

    Rules of Thumb for the Five Logical Operators
    
    To enable the reader to remember the definitional truth table for each logical operator, we provide the
    following five rules of thumb.
    
    Conjunction: A conjunction is true only when both of its conjuncts are true; otherwise it is false.
    
    Disjunction: A disjunction is false only when both of its disjuncts are false; otherwise it is true.
    
    Conditional: A conditional is false only when its antecedent is true and its consequent is false; otherwise
    it is true.
    
    Biconditional: A biconditional is true only when the statements on either side of the tribar have the same
    truth value; otherwise it is false.
  - |-
    Negation: A negation is true only when the negated statement is false; otherwise the negation is false.
    (A negation has the opposite truth value of the negated statement.)
    
    D. Arguments, Conditional Statements, and Tautologies
    
    To every argument there corresponds a conditional statement whose antecedent is the
    conjunction of the argument's premises and whose consequent is the argument's conclu-
    sion. Thus, an argument having the form of modus ponens,
    
    (P,): pq
    (P,): p
    
    has a corresponding conditional statement of the form [(p > q)- p] > 4.
    
    chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    An argument form is valid if and only if it cannot have all true premises and a false
    conclusion. A conditional statement is false if and only if its antecedent is true and its
    consequent is false. The above conditional will only be false, therefore, in those cases in
    which both premises—p 5 gq and p—are true and the conclusion, q, is false. If an argu-
    ment form is valid, there are no such cases, which means that the corresponding condi-
    tional statement cannot be false. Thus, if an argument form is valid, its corresponding
    conditional statement must be a tautology.
    
    The important relationship between an argument form (or argument) and its cor-
    responding conditional statement can be greatly clarified by truth tables. The foregoing
    argument form and its corresponding conditional statement are presented in the follow-
    ing truth table.
    
    P, a P, Antecedent Consequent Conditional
    T T T T T T
    T F F F F T
    F T T F T T
    F F T F F T
    
    In this truth table we see that the two premises are only both true in line 1, when p is
    true and q is true. In this combination of truth values for the statement variables p and
    q, both premises are true, and the conclusion is also true. Thus, this argument form is
    valid because it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion.
  - |-
    The conditional statement that corresponds to the argument form is in the last column of the truth table. Since a conditional statement is only false if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false, this conditional statement would only be false if its antecedent, namely (p → q) → p (i.e., the conjunction of the argument's two premises), were true and its consequent, statement q (i.e., the conclusion of the argument), were false. As we can clearly see, in all four combinations of truth values for the statement variables p and q (i.e., in all four lines), there is no case in which the premises are all true and the conclusion false. Correspondingly, the fourth and fifth columns show that there is no case in which the antecedent of the conditional (column 4) is true and the consequent (column 5) is false. For this reason, the conditional statement (column 6) is true in all four cases. The conditional statement cannot be false—it cannot have a true antecedent and a false consequent—because the argument form cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion (i.e., because the argument form is valid). This shows that the argument form is valid if and only if the corresponding conditional statement is a tautology."
    
    For every invalid argument form of the truth-functional variety, however, the corresponding conditional statement will not be a tautology. The statement that the conjunction of its premises implies its conclusion is, for an invalid argument, either contingent or contradictory.* To see this, consider the invalid argument form for affirming the consequent:
    
    (P1): p → q  
    (P2): q  
    
    The truth table for this argument form and its corresponding conditional is as follows.

    As the truth table shows, there are two combinations of truth values for the statement
    variables of this argument form in which both of the premises are true. On line 1, when p
    is true and q is true, both premises are true and the conclusion is also true. In that particular
    case, the antecedent (column 4) and the consequent (column 5) are true, and therefore
    the corresponding conditional statement (column 6) is true. However, on line 3, the two
    premises are both true and the conclusion is false, which shows that the argument form is
    invalid because it can have all true premises and a false conclusion. The invalidity of this
    argument form is reflected in the fact that the corresponding conditional statement is false
    in that particular case (line 3), since, in that case, its antecedent (column 4) is true and its
    consequent (column 5) is false. The conditional statement is not a tautology, but rather
    contingent, and therefore the corresponding argument form is invalid. The conditional
    statement is contingent because it can be false (line 3) and it can be true (lines 1, 2, and 4);
    the conditional can be false because it can have a true antecedent and a false consequent
    (line 3); and this is possible because this invalid argument form can have all true premises
    and a false conclusion, as it does in fact have on line 3, when p is false and q is true.
    
    The fact that an argument form is valid if and only if its corresponding conditional
    is a tautology will be important in the explanation and justification of Conditional Proof
    in Section 9.11.

    8.10) Logical Equivalence
    
    At this point we introduce a new relation, important and very useful, but not a  
    truth-functional connective, and somewhat more complicated than any of the truth-  
    functional connectives just discussed.
    
    Statements are materially equivalent when they have the same truth value. Because  
    two materially equivalent statements are either both true, or both false, we can readily  
    see that they must (materially) imply one another, because a false antecedent (materially)  
    implies any statement, and a true consequent is (materially) implied by any statement.  
    We may therefore read the tribar sign, =, as "if and only if." The following truth table,  
    from Section 8.9 (C), clearly exhibits the fact that p = q is true only when p and q have  
    the same truth value.

    Statements that are merely materially equivalent most certainly cannot be substituted for one another. Knowing that they are materially equivalent, we know only that their truth values are the same. The statements, "Jupiter is larger than the Earth" and "Tokyo is the capital of Japan," are materially equivalent because they are both true, but we obviously cannot replace one with the other. Similarly, the statements, "All spiders are poisonous" and "No spiders are poisonous," are materially equivalent simply because they are both false, but they certainly cannot replace one another!
    
    There are many circumstances, however, in which we must express the relationship that does permit mutual replacement. Two statements can be equivalent in a sense much stronger than that of material equivalence. They may be logically equivalent in the precise sense that they have exactly the same truth value for every combination of truth values of their constituent simple parts. This yields the following definition of logical equivalence: Two statement forms are logically equivalent if and only if they have the same truth value for every combination of truth values for their constituent statement variables.
    
    Consider the statement form
    
    p → q
    and the statement form
    ~p ∨ q.
    
    These two statement forms are logically equivalent, as is shown by the following truth table.
    
    T T T T T
    T F F F F
    F T T T T
    F F T T T
    
    We can see that for each of the four combinations of truth values for p and q, p → q and ~p ∨ q have the same truth value. For instance, when p is false and q is true (line 3), p → q is true and ~p ∨ q is also true. The same goes for the remaining combinations of truth values for statement variables p and q.
    
    The reader may well remember our definition of material implication earlier in this chapter. We defined
    
    p → q
    as an abbreviation for
    ~(p ∧ ~q).
    
    This was possible only because p → q is logically equivalent to ~(p ∧ ~q), as is demonstrated in the following extension of the last truth table.
    
    p | q | p → q | ~p | ~q | ~(p ∧ ~q)
    ---|---|-------|----|----|---------
    T | T |   T   |  F |  F |    T
    T | F |   F   |  F |  T |    F

    We can see that for each of the four combinations of truth values for p and q, the  
    three statement forms in the last three columns—p → q and ~p V q and ~(p → ~q)—have  
    the same truth value. Each of these three statement forms is logically equivalent to the  
    other two. This makes clear what was said in Section 8.4: a material implication "If p,  
    then q" (p → q) is logically equivalent to the denial that its antecedent is true and its  
    consequent is false (~ (p → ~q)), which is logically equivalent to the assertion that either  
    
    **Logical Equivalence**  
    
    **Logical equivalence**  
    Two statement forms  
    are logically equivalent  
    if and only if they have  
    the same truth value  
    for every combination  
    of truth values for their  
    constituent statement  
    variables. If two  
    statement forms are  
    logically equivalent,  
    
    the statement of their  
    material equivalence is  
    a tautology. Statements  
    that are logically  
    equivalent must have  
    the same meaning, and  
    may therefore replace  
    one another wherever  
    they occur.

    **Double negation**  
    An expression of the  
    logical equivalence  
    of a statement and  
    the negation of the  
    negation of that  
    statement. Symbolized  
    as p ≡ ~~p.  
    
    The logical equivalences mean that each of these statement forms can be substituted for one of the others within a statement, and that each can be deduced from one of the others in a proof of validity (see Chapter 9, Rules of Replacement).  
    
    **Logical equivalence is not material equivalence, but there is an interesting connec-**  
    **tion between the two. For any material equivalence, such as**  
    
    we can use a truth table to determine its truth value for each combination of truth values  
    for p and q.  
    
    p | q | (p → q) ≡ (~p V q)  
    T | T | F | T | T | T  
    T | F | F | F | F | T  
    F | T | T | T | T | T  
    F | F | T | T | T | T
  - |-
    This truth table shows that the material equivalence (p D q) = (~p V q) is true for every  
    combination of truth values for p and gq. Since any two logically equivalent statement  
    forms will have the same truth values for the same combinations of truth values for their  
    statement variables, the statement of their material equivalence will be true for every such  
    combination, and hence the statement of their material equivalence will be a tautology. Put dit-  
    ferently, if two statement forms are logically equivalent, the statement that they have the  
    same truth value is itself necessarily true. This fact yields a second, equivalent definition  
    of logical equivalence: Two statements are logically equivalent if and only if the statement  
    of their material equivalence is a tautology. To express this very strong logical relationship,  
    we use the tribar with a small T immediately above it, =, indicating that two statement  
    forms (or statements) are logically equivalent—indicating that the material equivalence of  
    the two statements is a tautology. Because material equivalence is a biconditional (the two  
    statements implying one another), we may think of this symbol of logical equivalence, =,  
    as expressing a tautological biconditional.
    
    Some simple logical equivalences that are very commonly used will make this rela-  
    tion, and its great power, very clear. It is a commonplace that p and ~~ p mean the  
    same thing; "he is aware of that difficulty" and "he is not unaware of that difficulty" are  
    two statements with the same content. In substance, either of these expressions may be  
    replaced by the other because they both say the same thing. This principle of double  
    negation, whose truth is obvious to all, may be exhibited in a truth table, where the  
    material equivalence of two statement forms is shown to be a tautology:
    
    This truth table proves that p and ~ ~ p are logically equivalent. This very useful logical  
    equivalence, double negation, is symbolized as
    
    p = ~~p
  - |-
    The difference between material equivalence on the one hand and logical equivalence on the other hand is very great and very important. The former is a truth-functional statement form, p = q, which may be true or false depending only on the truth or falsity of the statement forms on either side of the tribar, =. But the latter, logical equivalence, =, is not a mere connective, and it expresses a relation between two statements that is not truth-functional. Two statements are logically equivalent if and only if it is absolutely impossible for them to have different truth values—if and only if they have the same truth value for every combination of truth values for their statement variables. However, if they always have the same truth value, logically equivalent statements may be substituted for one another in any truth-functional statement without changing the truth value of that statement. By contrast, two statements are materially equivalent if they merely happen to have the same truth value, even if there are no factual connections between them. Statements that are merely materially equivalent certainly may not be substituted for one another!
    
    There are two well-known logical equivalences (that is, logically true biconditionals) of great importance because they express the interrelations among conjunction and disjunction, and their negations. Let us examine these two logical equivalences more closely.
    
    First, what will serve to deny that a disjunction is true? Any disjunction p ∨ q asserts no more than that at least one of its two disjuncts is true. One cannot contradict it by asserting that at least one is false; one must (to deny it) assert that both disjuncts are false. Therefore, asserting the negation of the disjunction (p ∨ q) is logically equivalent to asserting the conjunction of the negations of p and of q. To show this in a truth table, we may formulate the biconditional, ~(p ∨ q) = (~ p ∧ ~ q), place it at the top of its own column, and examine its truth value for all combinations of truth values for the constituent statement variables, that is, in each row.

    F  T  T  F  T  F  F  T  
    F  F  F  T  T  T  T  T  
    
    Of course we see that, whatever the truth values of p and of q, ~(p V q) has  
    the same truth value as ~p - ~q (as is indicated by the lighter shading), and, hence,  
    the biconditional ~(p V q) = (~p - ~q) is true in every case (as is indicated by the  
    darker shading). The biconditional must be true; it is a logically true biconditional. It  
    is a tautology. Because the statement of that material equivalence is a tautology,  
    we conclude that its two component statements are logically equivalent. We have  
    proved that  
    
    ~(p V q) = (~p - ~q)  
    
    Similarly, asserting the conjunction of p and q asserts that both are true, so to con-  
    tradict this assertion we need merely assert that at least one is false. Thus, asserting the  
    negation of the conjunction (p ∧ q) is logically equivalent to asserting the disjunction of  
    the negations of p and of q. In symbols, the biconditional, ~(p ∧ q) = (~p ∨ ~q) may be  
    shown, in a truth table, to be a tautology. Such a table proves that  
    
    ~(p ∧ q) = (~p ∨ ~q)

    Two important logical equivalences. The first states that the negation of a disjunction is  
    logically equivalent to the conjunction of the negations of its disjuncts: ~(p ∨ q) =  
    (~p ∧ ~q). The second states that the negation of a conjunction is logically equivalent  
    to the disjunction of the negations of its conjuncts: ~(p ∧ q) as (~p ∨ ~q).

    These two tautologous biconditionals, or logical equivalences, are known as De
    Morgan's theorems, because they were formally stated by the mathematician and logi-
    cian Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871). De Morgan's theorems can be formulated in
    English thus:
    
    a. The negation of the disjunction of two statements is logically equivalent to the
    conjunction of the negations of the two statements;
    
    and
    
    b. The negation of the conjunction of two statements is logically equivalent to the
    disjunction of the negations of the two statements.
    
    These theorems of De Morgan are exceedingly useful.
    
    We ended Section 8.9 (C) by noting that the biconditional A = B is logically equiva-
    lent to the conjunction of two conditional statements, namely (A 5 B) - (B D A). We can
    now show that their respective specific statement forms are logically equivalent.

    are logically equivalent, as it shows that they have exactly the same truth value for every
    combination of truth values for their constituent statement variables. Thus, the biconditional
    statement A = B does capture the two conditionals of "A if and only if B"'—i.e., B > A
    and A D B—as is shown by the conjunction of those two conditional statements in the
    logically equivalent statement (A 5 B) - (B 5 A). Moreover, since the statement forms
    p=qand (p > q)- (¢ 2 p) are logically equivalent, this means they may be substituted for
    one another in any truth-functional context, including, most notably, a proof of validity,
    as we will soon see in Chapter 9.
    
    Another important logical equivalence is very helpful when we seek to manipulate
    truth-functional connectives. Material implication, D, was defined (in Section 8.4) as
    an abbreviated way of saying ~ (p -~ q). That is, "p materially implies q" simply means,
    by definition, that it is not the case that p is true and q is false. In this definition we
    see that the definiens, ~(p-~q), is the denial of a conjunction. And by De Morgan's
    theorem we know that any such denial is logically equivalent to the disjunction of
    the denials of the conjuncts; that is, we know that ~ (p-~ q) is logically equivalent to
    (~ p V ~~ q); and this expression in turn, applying the principle of double negation, is
    logically equivalent to ~ p V q. The following truth table indicates logical equivalences
    in two different ways.
    
    p q -~q ~(p-~q) prXq = ~pPVq (pq)=(~pVq)
    T T F F F T T T T
    T F F T T F F F T
    F T T F F T T T T
    F F T T F T T T T
    
    The lighter shading indicates the columns of identical truth values for the three logi-
    cally equivalent statement forms:
    
    ~(p-~q)
    pq
    ~pVq
  - |-
    The darker shading indicates the column of truth values for the biconditional (p → q) = (¬p ∨ q). We can see that this biconditional is a tautology—that p → q and ¬p ∨ q have the same truth values for every combination of truth values for p and q (as is shown in their respective columns)—which means that p → q and ¬p ∨ q are logically equivalent. Since logically equivalent statement forms (and statements) mean the same thing, the original definiens of the horseshoe, ¬(p → ¬q), may be replaced with no change of meaning by the simpler expression ¬p ∨ q. This gives us a very useful definition of material implication: p → q is logically equivalent to ¬p ∨ q. In symbols we write:
    
    (p → q) ≡ (¬p ∨ q)
    
    This definition of material implication is widely relied on in the formulation of logical statements, in the analysis of arguments, and in proofs of validity. As we will see in Chapter 9, the transformation of one truth-functional statement into another logically equivalent truth-functional statement is crucial to the execution of proofs of validity. Such transformation is often essential, and transformation is more efficient when the statements we are working with have the same central connective. With the simple definition of the horseshoe we have just established, (p → q) ≡ (¬p ∨ q), statements in which the horseshoe is the main connective can be conveniently replaced by statements in which the wedge is the main connective; and likewise, disjunctions may be readily replaced by conditionals. When we seek to present a formal proof of the validity of deductive arguments, replacements of this kind are very useful indeed.
  - |-
    Before going on to the methods of proving validity and testing for validity in the next chapter, it is worthwhile to pause for a more thorough consideration of the meaning of material implication. Implication is central in argument but, as we noted earlier, the word "implies" is highly ambiguous. Material implication, on which we rely in this analysis, is only one sense of that word, although it is a very important sense, of course. The definition of material implication explained just above makes it clear that when we say, in this important sense, that "p implies q," we are saying no more than that "either p is false or q is true."
    
    Chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    Asserting the "if-then" relation in this sense has consequences that may seem paradoxical. For in this sense we can say, correctly, "If a statement is true, then it is implied by any statement whatever." Because it is true that the earth is round, it follows that "The moon is made of green cheese implies that the earth is round." This appears to be very curious, especially because it also follows that "The moon is not made of green cheese implies that the earth is round." Our precise understanding of material implication also entitles us to say, correctly, "If a statement is false, then it implies any statement whatever." Because it is false that the moon is made of green cheese, it follows that "The moon is made of green cheese implies that the earth is round," and this is the more curious when we realize that it also follows that "The moon is made of green cheese implies that the earth is not round."
  - |-
    Why do these true statements seem so curious? It is because we recognize that the shape of the earth and the cheesiness of the moon are utterly irrelevant to each other. As we normally use the word "implies," a statement cannot imply some other statement, false or true, to which it is utterly irrelevant. That is the case when "implies" is used in most of its everyday senses. And yet those "paradoxical" statements in the preceding paragraph are indeed true, and not really problematic at all, because they use the word "implies" in the logical sense of "material implication." The precise meaning of material implication we have made very clear; we understand that to say p materially implies q is only to say that either p is false or q is true.
    
    What needs to be borne in mind is this: Meaning—subject matter—is strictly irrelevant to material implication. Material implication is a truth function. Only the truth and falsity of the antecedent and the consequent, not their content, are relevant here. There is nothing paradoxical in stating that any disjunction is true that contains one true disjunct. Well, when we say that "The moon is made of green cheese (materially) implies that the earth is round," we know that to be logically equivalent to saying "Either the moon is not made of green cheese or the earth is round"—a disjunction that is most certainly true. And any disjunction we may confront in which "The moon is not made of green cheese" is the first disjunct will certainly be true, no matter what the second disjunct asserts. So, yes, "The moon is made of green cheese (materially) implies that the earth is square" because that is logically equivalent to "The moon is not made of green cheese or the earth is square." A false statement materially implies any statement whatever. A true statement is materially implied by any statement whatever.
  - |-
    Every occurrence of "if-then" should be treated, we have said, as a material implica-
    tion, and represented with the horseshoe, 5. The justification of this practice, its logical
    expediency, is the fact that doing so preserves the validity of all valid arguments of the
    type with which we are concerned in this part of our logical studies. Other symboliza-
    tions have been proposed, adequate to other types of implication, but they belong to
    more advanced parts of logic, beyond the scope of this book.
    
    The Three "Laws of Thought": Principles of Logic
    
    Some early thinkers, after having defined logic as "the science of the laws of thought,"
    went on to assert that there are exactly three basic laws of thought, laws so fundamen-
    tal that obedience to them is both the necessary and the sufficient condition of correct
    thinking. These three have traditionally been called:
    327
    
    8.11 The Three "Laws of Thought": Principles of Logic
    
    e The principle of identity. This principle asserts that if any statement is true, then
    it is true. Using our notation we may rephrase it by saying that the Principle of
    Identity asserts that every statement of the form p → p must be true, that every such
    statement is a tautology.
    
    e The principle of non-contradiction. This principle asserts that no state-
    ment can be both true and false. Using our notation we may rephrase it by saying
    that the Principle of Non-Contradiction asserts that every statement of the form
    p ∨ ~p must be false—that every such statement is self-contradictory. Expressed in
    our symbolism, the Principle of Non-Contradiction is the statement ~(p → ~p); every
    statement of this form is a tautology.
    
    e The principle of excluded middle. This principle asserts that every statement is
    either true or false. Using our notation we may rephrase it by saying that the Principle
    of Excluded Middle asserts that every statement of the form p ∨ ~p must be true,
    that every such statement is a tautology.
    
    It is obvious that these three principles are indeed true and that the expressions of these
    three principles as truth-functional statements are (logically true) tautologies.

    Modern logic no longer views logic, however, as the science of the "laws of thought."
    Since the pioneering work of especially Frege, Russell and Whitehead, and Wittgenstein,
    logic is viewed as the study of the methods and principles used to distinguish correct
    from incorrect reasoning. As we have seen in this chapter, and as we will see in the next
    chapter, this study focuses on the logical relations between statements, and especially the
    inference relation between one or more premises and a conclusion. The principal question
    of logic is: Does this conclusion follow necessarily from these premises? Is it possible for
    its premises to be true and its conclusion false? The question, therefore, is: If these three
    principles are not laws of thought, do they nonetheless have a privileged role in logic or
    in constituting the very nature of logic?
    
    In the period 1879-1913, during which modern logic was created, Frege, and Russell and
    Whitehead, sought to ground all of logic (and all of mathematics (Russell and Whitehead)
    or most of mathematics (Frege)) on a few fundamental, possibly self-evident, logical axi-
    oms. Their aim was to provide a sufficient number of axioms, or "primitive propositions," as
    they were called, from which to prove all logical truths. In their monumental three-volume
    work Principia Mathematica (1910-1913), Russell and Whitehead provide six truth-func-
    tional tautologies as the axioms of their Propositional Calculus, claiming only that these
    six "are to some extent a matter of arbitrary choice," and that they must be judged by their
    "adequacy," in enabling the proof of logical truths, and by their "coherence," or by the
    fact that they "must lead to no contradictions." They immediately announce that The Law
    of the Excluded Middle and The Law of Non-Contradiction (along with most of the Rules
    of Replacement in Chapter 9 of this book) "are among the most important" logical truths
    deduced from the axioms; later in the work they deduce both.
  - |-
    In *The Problems of Philosophy* (1912), Russell says that, "[f]or no very good reason, three ["self-evident logical"] principles have been singled out by tradition under the name of ‘Laws of Thought'," and after listing the three laws of thought, says that "[t]hese three laws are samples of self-evident logical principles, but are not really more fundamental or more self-evident than various other similar principles."** Since Wittgenstein's analysis of truth-functionality and truth-functional inference in his *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1921, 1922), modern logic has had the tools of this chapter to show that Russell was right to claim that the axioms of *Principia Mathematica*, and the Three Laws of Thought, are no more tautologous and no more self-evidently true than other truth-functional
    
    **Principle of identity**  
    This principle asserts that if any statement is true, then it is true.
    
    **Principle of non-contradiction**  
    The principle that asserts that no statement can be both true and false.
    
    **Principle of excluded middle**  
    The principle that asserts that any statement is either true or false.
    
    Chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    All truth-functional tautologies are true for every combination of truth values for their constituent simple statements; they are all on an equal footing, for they are all demonstrably tautologous by the truth-table method. This important fact shows, however, that self-evidence—whether real or illusory or a cognitive function of meaning understanding—is completely unnecessary in logic. What really matters in a system of logic, such as the one presented in this chapter and the next two, is that it be expressively complete (i.e., that every truth function is constructible with the symbols of the system) and that it be deductively complete in that every valid argument can be proved valid by means of its rules (as is the case with the Nineteen Rules of Inference and Replacement presented in the next chapter).
  - |-
    The fact that all truth-functional tautologies are equally tautologous does not settle the question of whether some truth-functional tautologies are more important or capture the fundamental nature of logic more than other tautologies. For 65 years and 15 editions, Introduction to Logic has correctly noted, in this very section, that the three principles—the Principle of Identity, the Principle of Excluded Middle, and the Principle of Non-Contradiction—guide the construction of truth tables, including the definitional truth tables that define conjunction, negation, disjunction, material implication, and material equivalence. In the initial guide columns of each row of a truth table we place either a T or an F, being guided by the Principle of Excluded Middle (or the Principle of Bivalence, as it is sometimes called). Nowhere do we put both T and F, being guided by the Principle of Non-Contradiction. Once having put a T under a symbol in a given row, being guided by the Principle of Identity (and/or the Principle of Non-Contradiction), when we encounter that symbol in other columns of that row, we ensure that it be assigned the same truth value, namely T. We construct a truth table in this way because of the fundamental nature of statements, and truth and falsity: a statement must be either true or false, and not both true and false. The account of truth functions given in this chapter, and the account of proof of validity given in the next chapter, are both grounded on these fundamental truths. Valid logical inference, the central topic of logic and this book, requires that each statement be either true or false (Excluded Middle, or Bivalence) and not both true and false (Non-Contradiction). It is amply clear, therefore, that the Principle of Excluded Middle and the Principle of Non-Contradiction are part of the fabric of logic.
    
    It is beyond the scope of this book to fully explore the nature of these principles and why it is that logic adheres to them. We do know, however, and can say that logic requires that each statement have one truth value (of two possible truth values) and only one truth value.

    Interestingly, at the very time that "classical" modern logic was completed as a
    deductive system, with a complete and completely rigorous truth-functional semantics,
    logicians and mathematicians proposed nonstandard logical systems (i.e., nonstandard or
    "non-classical systems" of logic, or "logic").'° For example, while proving the complete-
    ness of the Propositional Calculus of Principia Mathematica, Paul Bernays (1918) and Emil
    Post (1921'') independently wondered what sorts of systems would result if three or more
    truth values were admitted, thus giving rise to 3-Valued Logic and n-Valued Logic. On
    a completely different front, the Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer argued that the
    logic of mathematics must restrict the Principle of Excluded Middle, eliciting the inde-
    pendent formalizations of Intuitionistic Logic, between 1925 and 1930, by V. Glivenko,
    A. Kolmogorov, and A. Heyting.'* Shortly thereafter, just after the birth of systematic
    Wave and Matrix Theories of Quantum Mechanics in the 1920s, John von Neumann and
    Garrett Birkhoff proposed a system of Quantum Logic that rejected the Distributive Law
    (see the Rule of Replacement, Distribution, in Chapter 9). And even earlier, in 1912,"
    
    8.11 The Three "Laws of Thought": Principles of Logic
    
    C. I. Lewis rejected Russell's use of "implies" and material implication itself and replaced
    it with strict implication and Modal Logic. Thus, since the middle dawn of modern logic,
    logicians and mathematicians have proposed extensions to pure "classical" Propositional
    and Predicate Logic (i.e., the logic presented in this book in Chapters 8-10), including
    Tense Logics and Epistemic Logics, and deviations from classical logic, including such
    "Deviant Logics"? as Intuitionistic Logic, Quantum Logic, and Paraconsistent Logic
    (which rejects Non-Contradiction).

    Extensions of classical logic are intended to complete logic by enabling logic to capture all valid inferences. This chapter and the next present the core of logic, Propositional Logic, which captures many valid argument forms not captured by Aristotelian Syllogistic logic, and also most argument forms captured by Aristotelian Syllogistic logic. But Propositional Logic is not complete. For this reason, in Chapter 10 we will extend the Propositional Logic of Chapters 8-9, via Quantification Theory, to First-Order Predicate Logic. This extension will complete standard, "classical" modern logic. The question whether First-Order Predicate Logic, which was proved complete by Kurt Gédel in his Ph.D. Dissertation in 1930, requires an extension for this or that reason is an interesting and very large philosophical question, which cannot be tackled in the present book.
    
    What seems clear, however, some 140 years after Frege's Begriffsschrift and over 105 years after Principia Mathematica is that philosophers and logicians still view standard or classical Propositional Logic and Predicate Logic as the logic of reasoning about the physical world. Statements about the physical world, in the present or past tense, must be true or false, and no such statement can be both true and false, for no single state of affairs or fact can both be the case and not be the case. The definition of "validity," namely that a valid deductive argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, yields a theory of inference that agrees with our statements about reality, our reasoning about reality, and the knowledge we have and gain about reality. Hence, though it is not the case that obedience to the three Principles of Logic is both a necessary and sufficient condition of correct thinking, it is true that adherence to the three Principles of Logic is necessary for correct (valid) inference-making and a correct account of tautologies, contradictions, and contingent statements.
  - |-
    It is worth noting that there is considerable agreement here with Plato and Aristotle.
    Plato appealed explicitly to the Principle of Non-Contradiction in Book IV of his Republic (at
    numbers 436 and 439). Aristotle discussed all three of these principles in Books IV and XI
    of his Metaphysics. Of the Principle of Non-Contradiction, Aristotle wrote: "That the same
    attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the same subject and in the
    same respect" is a principle "which everyone must have who understands anything that is,"
    and which "everyone must already have when he comes to a special study." It is, he con-
    cluded, "the most certain of all principles." Thus, whether or not the three principles are
    "laws of thought," they are principles that determine the very nature of logic—i.e., classical
    logic—the subject of this book, from Aristotelian Syllogistic logic to classical modern logic.
    
    Summary
    
    This chapter has presented the fundamental concepts of modern symbolic logic.
    
    In Section 8.1, we explained the general approach of modern symbolic logic and its need for an artificial symbolic language.
    
    Chapter 8 Truth-Functional Statements and Arguments
    
    In Section 8.2, we introduced the concepts of truth value, truth function, truth-functional statement,
    and simple and compound statements.
    
    In Section 8.3, we defined the truth-functional statements of conjunction (and the dot, -), negation
    (and the tilde, ~), and disjunction (and the wedge, ∨). We also explained logical punctuation.
    
    In Section 8.4, we discussed the different senses of implication and defined the truth-functional statement material implication (the horseshoe: >).
    
    In Section 8.5, we explained the formal structure of arguments, defined argument forms and arguments, and explained other concepts essential in analyzing deductive arguments.
    
    In Section 8.6, we gave a precise account of valid and invalid argument forms.
    
    In Section 8.7, we explained the Complete Truth Table Method (CTTM) of testing the validity of argument forms and arguments, and demonstrated this method on a variety of argument forms and arguments.
  - |-
    In Section 8.8, we identified and described a few very common argument forms, some valid and some
    invalid; and we demonstrated their validity or invalidity by means of truth tables.
    
    In Section 8.9, we explained the formal structure of statements and defined essential terms for deal-
    ing with statement forms. We introduced tautologous, contradictory, and contingent statement forms,
    and defined a fifth truth-functional statement, material equivalence (three bars: =).
    
    In Section 8.10, we introduced and defined a powerful new relation, logical equivalence, using the
    symbol =. We explained that two statement forms are logically equivalent if and only if they have the
    same truth value for every combination of truth values for their constituent statement variables. We also
    explained why statements that are logically equivalent may be substituted for one another, while state-
    ments that are merely materially equivalent cannot replace one another. We introduced several logical
    equivalences of special importance: De Morgan's theorems, the principle of double negation, and the
    definition of material implication. For each of these we demonstrated the logical equivalence by means
    of a truth table.
    
    In Section 8.11, we discussed three logical principles (and three corresponding tautologies) that have
    been thought by many to be fundamental in all reasoning: the Principle of Identity, the Principle of
    Non-Contradiction, and the Principle of Excluded Middle (Bivalence). We explained how the Principles
    of Non-Contradiction and Excluded Middle are central to standard, classical Propositional Logic, and we
    sketched how alternatives to these principles and the "logics" that have resulted are nonstandard.
    
    End Notes
    
    1 There are two classes of exceptions: (1) Some invalid argument forms whose conclusion is not
    contained in the premises—such as p, therefore g (and p, q, therefore r, etc.)—do not con-
    tain a compound statement form; (2) Some valid argument forms whose conclusion is also a
    premise—such as p, therefore p (and p, q, therefore p, etc.)—do not contain a compound state-
    ment form. An argument of the first type is: A, therefore B. This argument has p, therefore g
    as its specific form. An argument of the second type is: A, therefore A. Both arguments do not
    contain a compound statement.

    On the second formulation, we have: (~H V M) . ~M; therefore ~ H (Hitler was not a military
    genius). We can see clearly here, what will be shown in Section 8.9, namely, that the condi-
    tional H > M and the disjunction ~H V M are logically equivalent.

    4 When, in Section 8.9, we define "statement form," we will be able to define "argument form"
    as a sequence of statement forms, where all but the last statement form are premises, and the last
    statement form is the conclusion.

    8.11 The Three "Laws of Thought": Principles of Logic
    
    A decision procedure is a step-by-step procedure (i.e., algorithm) for deciding (answering) a yes/no
    question in a finite number of steps. The Complete Truth-Table Method is a decision procedure
    for validity in Propositional Logic (i.e., pure truth-functional logic): it is a purely mechanical
    method for determining whether or not any truth-functional argument is valid. See Section
    9.9 for the Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT), a more efficient decision procedure for Prop-
    ositional Logic. The STTT can be best understood and mastered after the Complete Truth-Table
    Method has been mastered.
    
    Each row of the truth table represents a whole class of substitution instances.
    
    This shows that there is at least one substitution instance of this argument form that has all
    true premises and a false conclusion.
    
    By a ‘case' we mean a combination of truth values for the statement variables of the argument
    form. In the case of an argument, a case is a combination of truth values for the simple state-
    ments of the argument.

    In Section 8.9 (D) it is shown that for every valid argument form there is a corresponding tautological conditional. Hence, for the valid argument form "p, therefore p," there is a corresponding tautological conditional, namely p → p.
    
    Put somewhat differently, given that the antecedent of the conditional is the conjunction of both premises, the antecedent is only true if both premises are true. And given that the consequent of the conditional is the conclusion of the argument form, the conditional can only be false if the argument form can have all true premises and a false conclusion (i.e., if the argument form is invalid). Conversely, if the argument form is valid, it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, and its corresponding conditional is a tautology because it cannot be false.
    
    The conditional corresponding to an argument form is a contradiction if and only if the conjunction of the premises is a tautology and the conclusion is a contradiction, e.g., [(p ∨ ¬p) → (q ∨ ¬q)] → (q → ¬q).

    Indeed, in his seminal work on "natural deduction" (Gentzen, 1935)—on which the system of
    natural deduction of this book is based—Gerhard Gentzen refers to the Frege-Russell system of
    Propositional Logic and Predicate Logic as "classical logic," and explicitly contrasts it with the
    five-year-old "intuitionist logic" of Arend Heyting. Similarly, in their (1936), Garrett Birkhoff
    and John von Neumann use "classical logic" in the very same way, claiming that "quantum
    mechanics [does] not conform to classical logic" (p. 823). See: G. Gentzen, "Investigations into
    Logical Deduction," American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 4, 1964 (1935), pp. 288-230

    ics," Annals of Mathematics, Second Series, Vol. 37, No. 4, 1936, pp. 823-843.
    
    In his "Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions" (American Journal of
    Mathematics, Vol. 43, Issue. 3, 1921, pp. 163-185), Emil Post explicitly refers to his "m-valued"
    logics as "‘non-Aristotelian' logics" (p. 164) and compares them to Non-Euclidean geometries.

    9.1 Formal Proof of Validity
    
    As was said at the outset of this book, logic concerns reasoning and the study of logic is the
    study of correct versus incorrect reasoning. In this chapter we will see that valid deductive
    reasoning constitutes proof, and that proofs are central in, and vitally important to, logic.
    
    In Propositional Logic (and in Predicate Logic, as presented in Chapter 10), we can
    prove an argument valid by deducing its conclusion from its premises by a sequence of
    valid deductive inferences. A formal proof of validity is a rigorous demonstration that an
    argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion. If the premises of an
    argument are true, a proof of that argument's validity establishes that its conclusion is
    also true.
    
    Consider, for example, the following argument:
    
    (P,): If Anderson was nominated, then she went to Boston.
    (P,): If she went to Boston, then she campaigned there.
    (P,): If she campaigned there, she met Douglas.
    (P,): Anderson did not meet Douglas.
    (P,): Either Anderson was nominated or someone more eligible was selected.
    Therefore someone more eligible was selected.
    
    The validity of this argument may be intuitively obvious, but let us consider the matter
    of proof. The discussion will be facilitated by translating the argument into symbolism as
    
    (P,): ADB
    (P,): BDC
    (P,): CD D
    (P,): ~D
    (P): AVE
    TE
    
    We can prove this argument valid by deducing its conclusion, inference by inference, using
    a sequence of elementary valid arguments.
  - |-
    To understand the nature of a formal proof of validity and its use of elementary valid arguments, let us first introduce some fundamental concepts and technical terms. We initiate a proof of the foregoing argument by first validly inferring A > C from the first two premises, A D B and B 5 C. The form of this argument is:
    
    ADB  
    BOC  
    ADC  
    
    This elementary valid argument (inference) is a substitution instance of the elementary valid argument form Hypothetical Syllogism (H.S.), introduced and proved valid in Section 8.8.
    
    pq  
    q → r  
    p → r  
    
    We define an elementary valid argument form as a simple valid argument form in a list of nine specific valid argument forms, which we shall use as rules of inference. A rule of inference is a valid argument form or logical equivalence stipulated as a rule of inference. An elementary valid argument is defined as any argument that is a substitution instance of an elementary valid argument form. Note that any substitution instance of an elementary valid argument form is an elementary valid argument. Thus the argument
    
    (A ∧ B) → [C = (D ∨ B)]  
    A ∧ B  
    ¬C = (D ∨ E)  
    
    is an elementary valid argument because it is a substitution instance of the elementary valid argument form Modus Ponens (M.P.). It results from
    
    P → Q  
    P  
    
    Elementary valid argument form  
    Any one of a set of specified simple valid argument forms that serve as rules of inference and that may therefore be used in constructing a formal proof of validity.
    
    Rules of inference  
    A valid argument form stipulated as a rule of inference. Rules of inference are rules that ensure valid inferences from one or more statements to an inferred statement. Twenty-three rules of inference are set forth in this book: nine elementary valid argument forms, ten logical equivalences, and four rules governing instantiation and generalization in quantified logic.

    Formal proof of validity
    
    A sequence of statements each of which is either a premise of a given argument, or follows from the preceding statements of the sequence by one of the rules of inference, where the last statement in the sequence is the conclusion of the argument whose validity is proved; a formal proof of validity is a rigorous demonstration that an argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion.
    
    By substituting A - B for p and C = (D ∨ E) for q, and it is therefore of that form even though Modus Ponens is not the specific form of the given argument.
    
    A formal proof of validity of a given argument is a sequence of valid deductive inferences made in accordance with rules of inference. A proof of validity is constructed by writing the premises and the statements that we deduce from them in a single statement column, and writing in the justification ledger, a column to the right of the statement column, the "justification" for each inferred statement in the proof. It is convenient to list all the premises first and to write the conclusion either on a separate line, or at the beginning of the justification ledger, separated from the premises by a diagonal line and the therefore symbol (.-.). All of the statements in the statement column are numbered, and the "justification" for each statement consists of the numbers of the preceding statements from which it is inferred, together with the abbreviation for the rule of inference by which it was inferred.
    
    A complete proof of the foregoing argument requires four valid inferences using three distinct rules of inference, each of which is an elementary valid argument form.

    This proof proves the validity of the argument by validly inferring its conclusion from its five premises by a sequence of four valid deductive inferences. The four statements in the statement column on lines 6-9 are each validly deduced from previous statements (i.e., premises and/or validly inferred statements) using an elementary valid argument form designated as a rule of inference. On line 6 the conditional statement A → C is validly inferred from A ∨ B and B → C (Premises 1 and 2) by the rule of inference Hypothetical Syllogism (H.S.). In the justification ledger, to the right of the statement A → C, we cite the lines of the statements used for the inference (i.e., 1 and 2) and the abbreviation of the rule of inference employed (i.e., "H.S." for Hypothetical Syllogism). Next, on line 7, A → D is validly inferred from A → C (line 6) and C → D (line 3) by Hypothetical Syllogism. In the justification ledger to the right of the inferred statement A → D we write "6, 3, H.S." to indicate that A → D has been deduced from the statements on lines 6 and 3 by Hypothetical Syllogism. Third, on line 8, we validly infer ¬A from A → D (line 7) and ¬D (line 4) by Modus Tollens (M.T.), and we indicate the statements used in the inference and the rule employed by writing in the justification ledger "7, 4, M.T." Lastly, we validly deduce the conclusion of the argument, E, from A ∨ E (line 5) and ¬A (line 8) by Disjunctive Syllogism (D.S.), writing "5, 8, D.S." in the justification ledger. That the conclusion can be validly deduced from the five premises of the original argument by four elementary valid arguments proves the original argument to be valid. Here the elementary valid argument forms Hypothetical Syllogism (H.S.), Modus Tollens (M.T.), and Disjunctive Syllogism (D.S.) are used.

    Disjunctive Syllogism (D.S.) are used as rules of inference whose application allows conclusions to be validly inferred or deduced from premises. A formal proof of validity of any given argument, such as the proof just presented, is a sequence of statements,
      
    9.1 Formal Proof of Validity
    
    beginning with the premises of the argument, followed by validly inferred statements,
    and ending in the validly inferred conclusion of the argument."
    
    The method of deducing the conclusion of a deductive argument—using rules of
    inference successively to prove the validity of the argument—is often called natural
    deduction. We prove an argument to be valid by explicitly making one valid inference
    after another until we validly infer the conclusion.' Such deductive proofs are said to be
    "natural" (or "natural deductions") partly because they establish the validity of arguments
    and partly because the inference-by-inference process is in fact how we actually reason
    much or most of the time. Using natural deduction, we can provide a formal proof of
    the validity of any argument that is valid.
    
    Modus Tollens and Disjunctive Syllogism are indeed very elementary valid argument
    forms. What other valid argument forms are considered to be rules of inference? In the
    next section we begin with a list of just nine elementary valid argument forms, desig-
    nated as rules of inference, which can be used in constructing formal proofs of validity.
    With their aid, formal proofs of validity can be constructed for a wide range of more
    complicated arguments. The names provided are for the most part standard, and the use
    of their abbreviations permits formal proofs to be set down with a minimum of writing.
    
    Kurt Godel
    
    The Institute for Advanced Study was founded in Princeton, NJ, in 1930. Two of its first
    members were Albert Einstein and John von Neumann; a third early member was the great
    Austrian logician, Kurt Godel (1906-1978), who by 1931, at the age of 25, had published
    his two "Incompleteness Theorems."
  - |-
    To understand Gédel's impact in the logical world one must bear in mind the great  
    Logicist project that for decades had been the program of modern logicians Gottlob Frege,  
    Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead: to prove that mathematics is founded upon  
    logic and can be derived from a few basic logical axioms. Russell and Whitehead had sought  
    to culminate this undertaking with Principia Mathematica (1910-1913). Success would  
    require that the logical system devised be both consistent and complete. But Gédel demon-  
    strated, in a paper entitled "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica  
    and Related System I" (1931), that for any consistent axiomatic system powerful enough  
    to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers, there are undecidable propositions, such  
    that neither proposition B nor its negation ~B is derivable in the system. This is Gédel's  
    First Incompleteness Theorem. On the standard interpretation, since B or ~ B must be true,  
    there must, for any such consistent axiomatized system, always be at least one true but  
    unprovable proposition. This result dealt a devastating blow to Logicist and other founda-  
    tional efforts, for it meant that the search for some set of axioms that would be sufficient to  
    ground all of mathematics (or even all of elementary number theory) was doomed. In his  
    1931 paper, Gédel also sketched a proof of his Second Incompleteness Theorem (discovered  
    independently by John von Neumann, and communicated to Gédel in a November 20,  
    1930 letter): if such an axiomatic system is consistent, its consistency cannot be established  
    within the system itself.
    
    Over the remainder of his career Gédel did much other important foundational work  
    in logic and set theory. In 1951, on the occasion of Gédel receiving the Albert Einstein  
    Award, John von Neumann emphasized the importance of Gédel's achievements and, in  
    particular, his Incompleteness Theorems:
    
    Natural deduction  
    A method of proving  
    the validity of a  
    deductive argument by  
    using rules of inference.
    
    Biography  
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
  - |-
    Kurt Godel's achievement in modern logic is singular and monumental—indeed it is more than a monument, it
    is a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time... . The subject of logic has certainly completely
    changed its nature and possibilities with Godel's achievement|, and] . . . will never again be the same.*
    
    Godel was born in the city of Brno, in what was then Austria-
    Hungary. As a boy his insatiable curiosity led to his nickname, Herr
    Warum—"Mt. Why." Excelling both in languages and in mathematics
    in his early schooling, he moved to Vienna at the age of 18. In 1933,
    two years after the publication of his incompleteness papers, Godel
    visited the United States for the first time; he lectured at the Institute
    for Advanced Study and met Albert Einstein there. That same year
    Hitler came to power in Germany. When Austria was absorbed by
    Nazi Germany in 1938, Godel's circumstances in Vienna were fraught
    with danger. The Second World War began on September 1, 1939,
    and on January 18, 1940, Godel and his wife Adele made a circuitous
    escape to the U.S.A. by way of the Trans-Siberian railway and Japan.
    By late March 1940, Godel was safe in Princeton, where, from 1946
    on, he continued his work as a distinguished permanent member
    of the faculty at the Institute for Advanced Study. Many years later,
    Albert Einstein, who had become Godel's regular companion, con-
    fided to friends that he continued to visit the Institute chiefly "to
    have the privilege of walking home with Godel."
    
    Kurt Godel was one of the many superb scholars—physicists,
    philosophers, logicians, mathematicians, literary figures, and thinkers of every sort—who
    enriched American intellectual life as a consequence of the horrors of Nazi oppression. Godel
    proudly became an American citizen in 1948. He made a close study of the Constitution
    of the United States, and he remained in the U.S.A. until his death, in Princeton, in 1978.
    
    9.2 | The Elementary Valid Argument Forms
  - |-
    Our object is to build a set of logical rules—rules of inference—with which we can prove
    the validity of deductive arguments if they are valid. We began with a few elementary
    valid argument forms that have already been introduced—Modus Ponens, for example,
    and Disjunctive Syllogism. These are indeed simple and common, but we need a set of
    rules that is more powerful. The rules of inference may be thought of as a logical toolbox,
    from which tools may be taken, as needed, to prove validity. What else is needed for our
    toolbox? How shall we expand the list of rules of inference?
    
    The needed rules of inference consist of two sets, each set containing rules of a dif-
    ferent kind. The first is a set of elementary valid argument forms. The second set consists
    of a small group of elementary logical equivalences. In this section we discuss only the
    elementary valid argument forms.
    
    To this point we have become acquainted with four elementary valid argument forms:
    
    1. Modus Ponens (M.P.)  
    pq  
    P  
    
    2. Modus Tollens (M.T.)  
    pq  
    ~q  
    
    3. Hypothetical Syllogism (H.S.)  
    pq  
    qr  
    pr  
    
    4. Disjunctive Syllogism (D.S.)  
    pvq  
    ~p  
    q  
    
    For an effective logical toolbox we need to add five more. Let us examine these additional
    argument forms—each of which is valid and can be readily proved valid using a truth
    table.
    
    5. Rule 5 is called Constructive Dilemma (C.D.). It is symbolized as  
    (pq) ∧ (rs)  
    p ∨ r  
    q ∨ s
  - |-
    A dilemma is an argument in which one of two alternatives must be chosen. In this
    argument form the alternatives are the antecedents of the two conditional propositions
    (p → q) and (r → s). We know from Modus Ponens that if we are given (p → q) and p, we
    may infer q; and if we are given (r → s) and r, we may infer s. Therefore if we are given
    both (p → q), and (r → s), and either p or r (that is, either of the antecedents), we may
    infer validly either q or s (that is, one or the other of the consequents). Constructive
    Dilemma is, in effect, a combination of two arguments in Modus Ponens form, and it is
    most certainly valid, as a truth table can make evident. We add Constructive Dilemma
    (C.D.) to our toolbox.
    
    6. Absorption (Abs.)
    p → q
    p:
    
    Any proposition p always implies itself, of course. Therefore, if we know that p → q, we
    may validly infer that p implies both itself and q. That is all that Absorption says. Why
    (one may ask) do we need so elementary a rule? The need for it will become clearer as
    we go on; in short, we need it because it will be very convenient, even essential at times,
    to carry the p across the horseshoe. In effect, Absorption makes the principle of identity,
    one of the basic logical principles discussed in Section 8.11, always available for our use.
    We add Absorption (Abs.) to our logical toolbox.
    
    The next two elementary valid argument forms are intuitively very easy to grasp if
    we understand the logical connectives explained earlier.
    
    7. Simplification (Simp.)
    p ∧ q
    
    Simplification says only that if two propositions, p and q, are true when they are con-
    joined (p ∧ q), we may validly infer that one of them, p, is true by itself. We simplify the

    Dilemma (C.D.)

    one of nine elementary
    valid argument forms.
    Constructive dilemma
    permits the inference
    that if(p>q)-(ros)
    is true, and p V ris also
    true, then g V s must
    be true.
    
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    expression before us; we "pull" p from the conjunction and stand it on its own. Because
    we are given that p - g, we know that both p and g must be true; we therefore know with
    certainty that p is true.
    
    What about q? Isn't g true for exactly the same reason? Yes, it is. Then why does the
    elementary argument form, Simplification, conclude only that p is true? The reason is
    that we want to keep our toolbox uncluttered. The rules of inference must always be
    applied exactly as they appear. We surely need a rule that will enable us to take conjunc-
    tions apart, but we do not need two such rules; one will suffice. When we need to validly
    infer the right conjunct g from a conjunction p - q we will be able to put g where p is now,
    and then use only the one rule, Simplification, which we add to our toolbox.
    
    8. Conjunction (Conj.)
    P
    
    q
    
    "p-g
    
    Conjunction says only that if two propositions, p and g, are known to be true, we can
    put them together into one conjunctive expression, p -g. We may conjoin them. If they
    are true separately, they must also be true when they are conjoined. In this case the order
    presents no problem, because we may always treat the one we seek to put on the left as
    p, and the other as qg. That joint truth is what a conjunction asserts. We add Conjunction
    (Conj.) to our logical toolbox.
    
    The last of the nine elementary valid argument forms is also a straightforward con-
    sequence of the meaning of the logical connectives—in this case, disjunction.
    
    9. Addition (Add.)

    Any disjunction must be true if either of its disjuncts is true. That is, p V q is true if p is
    true, or if q is true, or if they are both true. That is what disjunction means. It obviously
    follows from this that if we know that some proposition, p, is true, we also know that
    either it is true or some other—any other!—proposition is true. So we can validly infer a
    true disjunction, p V q, using the one proposition known to be true as p, and adding to it
    (in the logical, disjunctive sense) any proposition we care to. We call this logical addition.
    The additional proposition, q, is not conjoined to p; it is used with p to build a disjunc-
    tion that we may know with certainty to be true because one of the disjuncts, p, is known
    to be true. The disjunction we thus build will be true no matter what that added proposi-
    tion asserts—no matter how absurd or wildly false it may be! We know that Michigan is
    north of Florida. Therefore we know that either Michigan is north of Florida or the moon
    is made of green cheese! Indeed, we know that either Michigan is north of Florida or
    2+2=5. The truth or falsity of the added proposition does not affect the truth of the
    disjunction we build, because that disjunction is made certainly true by the truth of the
    disjunct with which we began. Therefore, if we are given p as true, we may validly infer for
    any q whatever that p V q. This principle, Addition (Add.), we add to our logical toolbox.
    
    Our set of nine elementary valid argument forms is now complete. All nine of these argu-
    ment forms are very plainly valid. Any one of them whose validity we may doubt can
    9.2 The Elementary Valid Argument Forms
    
    be readily proved to be valid using a truth table. Each of them is simple and intuitively
    clear; as a set we will find them powerful as we go on to construct formal proofs for the
    
    validity of more extended arguments.

    Two features of these elementary argument forms must be emphasized. First, they
    must be applied with exactitude. An argument that one proves valid using Modus Ponens
    must have that exact form: p > q, p, therefore g. Each statement variable must be replaced
    by some statement (simple or compound) consistently and accurately. Thus, for example,
    if we are given (C V D) D (J V K) and (C V D), we may infer (J V K) by Modus Ponens. But
    we may not infer (K V J) by Modus Ponens, even though it may be true. The elementary
    argument form must be fitted precisely to the argument with which we are working. No
    shortcut—no fudging of any kind—is permitted, because we seek to know with certainty
    that the outcome of our reasoning is valid, and that can be known only if we can dem-
    
    onstrate that every link in the chain of our reasoning is absolutely solid.
    
    Chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
  - |-
    Second, these elementary valid argument forms must be applied to the statement or statements used as premises for the inference, not to only part of one or more statements. Thus, for example, if we are given [(X - Y) D Z] - T, we cannot validly infer X by Simplification. X is one of the conjuncts of a conjunction, but that conjunction is part of a more complex compound statement. X may not be true even if that more complex statement is true. We may only infer that if X and Y are both true, then Z is true. Simplification applies only to an entire statement, which must be a conjunction; the statement inferred by means of Simplification must be the left conjunct (and only the left conjunct) of that conjunction. So, from the statement [(X - Y) D Z] - T, we may validly infer (X - Y) D Z by Simplification. But we may not infer T by Simplification (because it is not the left conjunct), even though it may be true.
    
    Formal proofs in deductive logic have crushing power, but they possess that power only because, when they are correct, there can be not the slightest doubt of the validity of each inference drawn. The tiniest gap destroys the power of the whole.
    
    The nine elementary valid argument forms we have given should be committed to memory. They must be always readily in mind as we go on to construct formal proofs. Only if we comprehend these elementary argument forms fully, and can apply them immediately and accurately, may we expect to succeed in devising formal proofs of the validity of more extended arguments.
    
    EXERCISES
    
    Here follows a set of twenty elementary valid arguments. They are valid because each of them is exactly in the form of one of the nine elementary valid argument forms. For each of them, state the rule of inference by which its conclusion follows from its premise or premises.

    9.3 | Formal Proofs of Validity Exhibited
    
    We have defined a formal proof of validity for a given argument as a sequence of state-
    ments, each of which either is a premise of that argument or a statement that validly
    follows from preceding statements of the sequence, such that the last statement in the
    sequence is the conclusion of the argument whose validity is being proved. Our task will be
    to build such sequences, to prove the validity of arguments with which we are confronted.
    
    Doing this can be a challenge. Before attempting to construct such sequences, it will
    be helpful to become familiar with the look and character of formal proofs. In this sec-
    tion we examine a number of complete formal proofs, to see how they work and to get
    a "feel" for constructing them.
  - |-
    Our first step is not to devise such proofs, but to understand and appreciate them.
    A sequence of statements is put before us in each case. Every statement in that sequence
    will either be a premise or follow from preceding statements in the sequence using one
    of the elementary valid argument forms—just as in the illustration that was presented
    in Section 9.1. When we confront such a proof, but the rule of inference that justifies
    each step in the proof is not given, we know (having been told that these are completed
    proofs) that every statement in the proof that is not itself a premise can be deduced from
    the preceding statements. To understand those deductions, the nine elementary valid
    argument forms must be kept in mind.

    The first two statements of this proof are seen to be premises, because they appear before  
    the "therefore" symbol (..); what appears immediately to the right of that symbol is the  
    conclusion of this argument, A - D. The very last statement of the sequence is (as it must  
    be if the formal proof is correct) that same conclusion, A - D. What about the statements  
    between the premises and the conclusion? We can deduce statement A (line 3) from  
    A - B (line 1) by Simplification. So in the justification ledger to the right of statement A  
    on line 3, we write the line number for the statement from which A is inferred and the  
    rule by which A is inferred from A - B: "1, Simp." The disjunction A V C is on line 4.  
    How can A V C be inferred from the statements above it? We cannot infer A V C from  
    (A V C) D D on line 2 by Simplification. But we can infer A V C from A on line 3 by  
    Addition. Addition tells us that if p is true, then p V q is true, whatever q may be. Using  
    that logical pattern precisely, we may infer from A that A V C is true. In the justification  
    ledger to the right of A V C on line 4 we therefore write "3, Add." Statement D is on line  
    5. D appears in line 2 as the consequent of a conditional statement, (A V C) → D. We  
    validly inferred A V C on line 4; now, using Modus Ponens, we infer D from (A V C) → D  
    (line 2) and A V C (line 4). To the right of D on line 5 we therefore write "2, 4, M.P." A has  
    been deduced (on line 3) and D has been deduced (on line 5). We may therefore validly  
    conjoin them as A - D on line 6. To the right of A - D on line 6 we therefore write "3,  
    5, Conj." A - D is the conclusion of the argument, and it is therefore the last statement

    presented to us complete, has thus been "fleshed out" by specifying the justification of
    each inference within it.
    
    In this example, and the exercises that follow, every inference of each proof can
    be justified by using one of the elementary valid argument forms in our logical tool-
    box. No other inferences of any kind are permitted, however plausible they may seem.
    When we had occasion to refer to an argument form that has two premises (e.g., M.P.
    or D.S.), we indicated first, in the justification, the numbers of the lines used, in the
    order in which they appear in the elementary valid argument form. Thus, line 5 in Example
    1 is justified by 2, 4, M.P.
    
    To become proficient in the construction of formal proofs, we must become fully
    familiar with the shape and rhythm of the nine elementary argument forms—the first
    nine of the rules of inference that we will be using extensively.

    9.4 | Constructing Formal Proofs of Validity
  - |-
    Now we turn to one of the central tasks of deductive logic: proving formally that valid  
    arguments really are valid. In the preceding sections we examined formal proofs that  
    needed only to be supplemented by the justifications of the steps taken. From this point,  
    however, we will confront arguments whose formal proofs must be constructed. This is  
    an easy task for many arguments, a more challenging task for some. Whether the proof  
    needed is short and simple, or long and complex, the rules of inference are in every case  
    our instruments. Success requires mastery of these rules. Having the list of rules before  
    one will probably not be sufficient. One must be able to call on the rules "from within" as  
    the proofs are being devised. The ability to do this will grow rapidly with practice, and  
    yields many satisfactions.
    
    Let us begin by constructing proofs for simple arguments. The only rules needed (or  
    available for our use) are the nine elementary valid argument forms with which we have  
    been working. This limitation we will later overcome, but even with only these nine rules  
    in our logical toolbox, very many arguments can be formally proved valid. We begin  
    with arguments that require, in addition to the premises, no more than two (additional)  
    inferred statements.
    
    We will look first at two examples, the first two in the set of exercises on pp. 345-346.
    
    In the first example consider the argument:
    
    (P,): A  
    (P,): B  
    ~(AVC)-B
    
    The conclusion of this argument (A V C) - B is a conjunction; we see immediately that the  
    second conjunct, B, is readily at hand as a premise in line 2. All that is now needed is the  
    statement of the disjunction, (A V C), which may then be conjoined with B to complete  
    the proof. (A V C) is easily obtained from the premise A, in line 1; we simply add C using  
    the rule Addition, which tells us that to any given p with a truth value of true we may  
    add (disjunctively) any g whatever. In this example we have been told that A is true, so  
    we may infer by this rule that A V C must be true. The third line of this proof is "3. A V C,
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:
    
    ---
    
    1. Add." In line 4 we can conjoin this disjunction (line 3) with the premise B (line 2):
    "4. (A ∨ C) ∨ B, 3, 2, Conj." This final line of the sequence is the conclusion of the argument being proved. The formal proof is complete.
    
    Here is a second example of an argument whose formal proof requires only two additional lines in the sequence:
    
    (P,): D → E  
    (P,): D ∨ F  
    
    The conclusion of this argument, E, is the consequent of the conditional statement D → E, which is given as the first premise. We know that we will be able to infer the truth of E by Modus Ponens if we can establish the truth of D. We can establish the truth of D, of course, by Simplification from the second premise, D ∨ F. So the complete formal proof consists of the following four lines:
    
    1. D → E  
    2. D ∨ F  
    3. D 2, Simp.  
    4. E 1, 3, MP.
    
    In each of these examples, and in all the exercises immediately following, a formal proof for each argument may be constructed by adding just two inferred statements. This will be an easy task if the nine elementary valid argument forms are clearly in mind. Remember that the final inferred statement in the sequence of each proof is always the conclusion of the argument being proved.

    9.5 | Constructing More Extended Formal Proofs  
    
    Arguments whose formal proof requires only two inferred statements are quite simple.  
    We now advance to construct formal proofs of the validity of more complex arguments.  
    However, the procedure will be the same: The target for the final inferred statement of  
    the sequence will always be the conclusion of the argument, and the rules of inference  
    
    will always be our only logical tools.  
    347  
    
    9.5 Constructing More Extended Formal Proofs  
    
    Let us look closely at an example—the first exercise of Set A below, an argument  
    whose proof requires three inferred statements:  
    
    1 AV(BDA)  
    2. ~A-C  
    ~B  
    
    In devising the proof of this argument (as in most cases), we need some plan of  
    action, some strategy with which we can progress, using our rules, toward the conclu-  
    sion sought. Here that conclusion is ~B. We ask ourselves: Where in the premises does  
    B appear? Only as the antecedent of the conditional B D A, which is a component of  
    the first premise. How might ~B be derived? Using Modus Tollens, we can infer it from  
    B > A it we can establish that conditional separately and moreover establish ~A. Both  
    of those needed statements can be readily inferred. ~A is inferred from ~A - C on line 2  
    by Simplification:  
    
    3. ~A 2, Simp.  
    We can then apply ~A to A V (BD A) on line 1 to infer B D A using Disjunctive Syllogism:  
    4. BOA 1, 3, DS.  
    
    The proof may then be completed by inferring ~B from B 3D A (line 4) and ~A (line 3),  
    using Modus Tollens:  
    
    5S. ~B 4,3, M.T.
  - |-
    The strategy used in this argument is readily devised. In the case of some proofs, devising the needed strategy will not be so simple, but it is usually helpful to ask: What statement(s) will enable one to infer the conclusion? What statement(s) will enable one to infer that? One continues to move backward from the conclusion toward the premises given.
    
    EXERCISES
    
    A. For each of the following arguments, it is possible to provide a formal proof of validity by validly inferring just three statements. Writing these out, carefully and accurately, will strengthen your command of the rules of inference, a needed preparation for the construction of proofs that are more extended and more complex.

    Formal proofs most often require more than two or three inferred statements. Some
    proofs are very lengthy. Whatever their length, however, the same procedure and the same
    strategic techniques are called for in devising the needed proofs. In this section we rely
    entirely on the nine elementary valid argument forms that serve as our rules of inference.
    
    As we begin to construct longer and more complicated proofs, let us look closely at
    an example of such proofs—the first exercise of Set B on p. 349. It is not difficult, but it
    is more extended than those we have worked with so far.
    
    (P,): ADB
    (P,): AV (C-D)
    (P,):~B-~E
    
    The strategy needed for the proof of this argument is not hard to see: To obtain C we
    must break apart the premise in line 2; to do that we will need ~ A; to establish ~A we
    will need to apply Modus Tollens to A D B on line 1 using ~ B. Therefore we continue the
    sequence with the fourth line of the proof by applying Simplification to ~B- ~ Eon line 3:
    
    1 ADB
    2. AV(C-D)
    3. ~B-~E [..C
    4. ~B 3, Simp.
    
    Using ~B on line 4 we can obtain ~A from A 5 B on line 1:
    
    5. ~A 1, 4, M.T.
    
    With ~A established we can break line 2 apart, as we had planned, using D:S.:
    
    6. C-D 2,5, DS.
    
    The conclusion may be pulled readily from C - D on the sixth line by Simplification.
    7. C 6, Simp.

    Seven lines (including the premises) are required for this formal proof. Some proofs
    require very many more lines than this, but the objective and the method remain always
    the same.
    
    It sometimes happens, as one is devising a formal proof, that a statement is correctly
    inferred and added to the numbered sequence but turns out not to be needed; a solid
    proof may be given without using that statement. In such a case it is usually best to rewrite
    the proof, eliminating the unneeded statement. However, if the unneeded statement is
    retained, and the proof remains accurately constructed using other statements correctly
    inferred, the inclusion of the unneeded statement (although perhaps inelegant) does not
    render the proof incorrect. Logicians tend to prefer shorter proofs, proofs that move to
    the conclusion as directly as the rules of inference permit. But if, as one is constructing
    a more complicated proof, it becomes apparent that some much earlier statement(s) has
    been needlessly inferred, it may be more efficient to allow such statement(s) to remain in
    place, using (as one goes forward) the more extended numbering that that inclusion makes
    necessary. Logical solidity is the critical objective. A solid formal proof, one in which each
    statement is correctly inferred and the conclusion is correctly linked to the premises by an unbroken
    chain of inferences using the rules of inference correctly, remains a proof—even if it is not as
    crisp and elegant as some other proof that could be devised.

    In the study of logic, our aim is to evaluate arguments in a natural language, such  
    as English. When an argument in everyday discourse confronts us, we can prove it to  
    be valid (if it really is valid) by first translating the statements (from English, or from  
    any other natural language) into our symbolic language, and then constructing a formal  
    proof of that symbolic translation. The symbolic version of the argument may reveal  
    that the argument is, in fact, more simple (or possibly more complex) than one had sup-  
    posed on first hearing or reading it. Consider the following example (the first in the set  
    of exercises that immediately follow):  
    
    1. If either Gertrude or Herbert wins, then both Jens and Kenneth lose. Gertrude  
    wins. Therefore Jens loses. (G—Gertrude wins; H—Herbert wins; /—Jens loses;  
    K—Kenneth loses.)  
    
    Abbreviations for each statement are provided in this context because, without them,  
    those involved in the discussion of these arguments would be likely to employ vari-  
    ous abbreviations, making communication difficult. Using the abbreviations suggested  
    greatly facilitates discussion.  
    
    Translated from the English into symbolic notation, this first argument appears as

    C. Each of the following arguments in English may be similarly translated, and for each,
    a formal proof of validity (using only the nine elementary valid argument forms as
    rules of inference) may be constructed. These proofs vary in length, some requiring a
    sequence of thirteen statements (including the premises) to complete the formal proofs.
    The suggested abbreviations should be used for the sake of clarity. Bear in mind that, as
    one proceeds to produce a formal proof of an argument presented in a natural language,
    it is of the utmost importance that the translation into symbolic notation of the statements
    appearing discursively in the argument be perfectly accurate; if it is not, one will be work-
    ing with an argument that is different from the original one, and in that case any proof
    devised will be useless, being not applicable to the original argument.

    Expanding the Rules of Inference:
    Replacement Rules
    
    The nine elementary valid argument forms with which we have been working are
    powerful tools of inference, but they are not powerful enough. There are very many
    valid truth-functional arguments whose validity cannot be proved using only the nine
    rules thus far developed. We need to expand the set of rules, to increase the power of
    our logical toolbox.
    
    To illustrate the problem, consider the following simple argument, which is plainly
    valid:
    
    If you travel directly from Chicago to Los Angeles, you must cross the Mississippi River. If you travel only along
    the Atlantic seaboard, you will not cross the Mississippi River. Therefore if you travel directly from Chicago to
    Los Angeles, you will not travel only along the Atlantic seaboard.
    
    Translated into symbolic notation, this argument appears as
    
    (P,): DDC
    (P,): AD ~C
    .DD~A
    
    This conclusion certainly does follow from the given premises. But, try as we may, there
    is no way to prove that it is valid using only the elementary valid argument forms. Our
    logical toolbox is not fully adequate.
    
    What is missing? Chiefly, what is missing is the ability to replace one statement
    by another that is logically equivalent to it. We need to be able to put, in place of
    any given statement, any other statement whose meaning is exactly the same as that
    of the statement being replaced. We need rules that identify legitimate replacements
    precisely.

    Such rules are available to us. Recall that the only compound statements that concern
    us here (as we noted in Section 8.2) are truth-functional compound statements, and in a
    truth-functional compound statement, if we replace any component by another state-
    ment having the same truth value, the truth value of the compound statement remains
    unchanged. Therefore we may accept as an additional principle of inference what may
    be called the general rule of replacement—a rule that permits us to infer from any
    statement the result of replacing all or part of that statement by any other statement
    logically equivalent to the statement replaced.
    
    The correctness of such replacements is intuitively obvious. To illustrate, the princi-
    ple of Double Negation (D.N.) asserts that p is logically equivalent to ~~ p. Using the rule

    of replacement we may say, correctly, that from the statement A D ~~B, any one of the
    following statements may be validly inferred:
    
    ADB,
    
    ~~A D> ~~B,
    
    ~~(A D ~~B), and even
    AD ~~~~B.
    
    When we put any one of these in place of A 5 ~~B, we do no more than exchange one
    statement for another that is its logical equivalent.
    
    This rule of replacement is a powerful enrichment of our rules of inference. In its
    general form, however, its application is problematic because its content is not definite;
    we are not always sure what statements are indeed logically equivalent to some other
    statements, and thus (if we have the rule only in its general form) we may be unsure
    whether that rule applies in a given case. To overcome this problem in a way that makes
    the rule of replacement applicable with indubitable accuracy, we make the rule definite
    by listing ten specific logical equivalences to which the rule of replacement may certainly
    be applied. Each of these equivalences—they are all logically true biconditionals—will
    serve as a separate rule of inference. We list the ten logical equivalences here, as ten rules,
    and we number them consecutively to follow the first nine rules of inference already set
    forth in the preceding sections of this chapter.

    Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871), an influential deductive logician, and John Stuart Mill, an influential inductive logician, were strict contemporaries—born in the same year and dying two years apart. Oddly, both their fathers were employed by the East India Company. De Morgan was born in India; when the family returned to England he proved to be a very precocious student in languages and in mathematics. At Cambridge University De Morgan received the Bachelor of Arts degree.
    
    In those days one could be a candidate for the Master of Arts degree at Cambridge, and for a Fellowship there, only if one signed an oath accepting the doctrines of the Church of England. Such theological tests for academic degrees were abolished in Cambridge and Oxford late in the nineteenth century, but that was too late for De Morgan, whose religious views and moral integrity obliged him to refuse to sign such an oath. He therefore had to leave Cambridge. He continued his work in London; at the age of 22 he was appointed pro- 
    fessor of mathematics at University College, London, an institution founded with a com-
    mitment to religious neutrality. He opened his professorship there with a famous lecture
    on the nature of the study of mathematics, its difficulties and its potential. De Morgan's
    papers in logic and mathematics, written during his long academic career in London, often
    became the focus of discussion among the scholars of the London Mathematical Society,
    of which he was the first president.
    
    In his book Formal Logic (1847), De Morgan noted a great deficiency of classical logic.
    The Aristotelians say that from two particular propositions, "Some Ps are As" and "Some
    Ps are Bs," nothing can be validly deduced about the relations of As and Bs. They say (as
    we saw in our explication of Aristotelian syllogisms in Chapter 6 of this book) that in a
    valid syllogism the middle term must be distributed—that it must be taken universally in at

    At least one of the premises to effect the link that makes the deduction possible. De Morgan pointed out that this is not correct if we know that "Most Ps are As" and "Most Ps are Bs." With some quantitative premises we can deduce a connection between As and Bs. Suppose, for example, a ship had been sunk on which there were 1,000 passengers, of whom 700 drowned. If we know that 500 passengers were in their cabins at the time of the tragedy, it follows of necessity that at least 200 passengers were drowned in their cabins. This he called the numerically definite syllogism.
    
    De Morgan also advanced the field called the logic of relatives. Identity and difference are relations to which logicians have given great attention, but there are other relations, such as equality, affinity, and especially equivalence, that also deserve the logicians' attention, as De Morgan showed.
    
    Two logical equivalences, widely useful and intuitively clear, received from De Morgan their time-honored formulation and carry his name: De Morgan's Theorems (explained in Chapter 8 and in this chapter), which remain a permanent and prominent instrument in deductive reasoning.

    Let us now examine each of these ten logical equivalences. We will use them frequently and will rely on them in constructing formal proofs of validity, and therefore we must grasp their force as deeply, and control them as fully, as we do the nine elementary valid argument forms. We take these ten in order, giving for each the name, the abbreviation commonly used for it, and its exact logical form(s).
    
    10. De Morgan's Theorems (DeM.) ~(p ∧ q) = (~ p ∨ ~q)
    ~(p ∨ q) = (~p ∧ ~q)
    
    This logical equivalence was explained in detail in Section 8.10. De Morgan's theorems have two variants. One variant asserts that when we deny that two propositions are both true, that is logically equivalent to asserting that either one of them is false, or the other one is false, or they are both false. (The negation of a conjunction is logically equivalent to the disjunction of the negations of the conjuncts.) The second variant of De Morgan's theorems asserts that when we deny that either of two propositions is true, that is logically equivalent to asserting that both of them are false. (The negation of a disjunction is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the negations of the disjuncts.)
    
    These two biconditionals are tautologies, of course. That is, the expression of the material equivalence of the two sides of each is always true, and thus can have no false substitution instance. All ten of the logical equivalences now being recognized as rules of inference are tautological biconditionals in exactly this sense.
    
    11. Commutation (Com.) (p ∨ q) = (q ∨ p)
    (p ∧ q) = (q ∧ p)
  - |-
    These two equivalences simply assert that the order of statement of the elements of a conjunction, or of a disjunction, does not matter. We are always permitted to turn them around, to commute them, because, whichever order happens to appear, the meanings remain exactly the same.
    
    Recall that Rule 7, Simplification, permitted us to pull p from the conjunction p - q, but not q. Now, with Commutation, we can always replace p - q with q - p—so that, with Simplification and Commutation both at hand, we can readily infer each of the conjuncts from a conjunction.
    
    12. Association (Assoc.) [pV (qVr)] = (pV qVr]
    
    [p-(q-r)]=[(p-q)-r]
    
    357
    
    9.6 Expanding the Rules of Inference: Replacement Rules
    
    These two equivalences do no more than allow us to group statements differently. If we know three different statements to be true, to assert that p is true along with q and r clumped, is logically equivalent to asserting that p and q are clumped is true along with r. Equivalence also holds if the three are grouped as disjuncts: p or the disjunction q V r, is a grouping logically equivalent to the disjunction p V q, or r. The statement form p V (q V r) is true if any of the three statement forms (i.e., p, q, r) is true, and it is only false if all three are false; this is clearly also the case for the logically equivalent statement form (p V q) V r.
    
    13. Distribution (Dist.) [p-(qVr)] = [(p-q) V(p-r)]
    [pV (q-r)] = [(pV q) (pV r)]
  - |-
    Of all the rules permitting replacement, this one may be the least obvious—but it too is a
    tautology, of course. It also has two variants. The first variant asserts merely that the con-
    junction of one statement with the disjunction of two other statements is logically equiva-
    lent to a disjunction whose first disjunct is the conjunction of the first statement with the
    second and whose second disjunct is the conjunction of the first statement with the third.
    In other words, the conjunction p - (¢ V r) is true only if p is true and at least one of q or
    r is true; similarly, (p- gq) V (p- rn is true only if p is true and one of q or r is true (i.e., if p is
    true and q is true, the entire disjunction is true because its left disjunct, p - q, is true; and
    if p is true and r is true, the entire disjunction is true because its right disjunct, namely p - r,
    is true). The second variant asserts merely that the disjunction of one statement with the
    conjunction of two others is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the disjunction of
    the first and the second and the disjunction of the first and the third. In other words, the
    disjunction p V (q - r) is true if either p is true or the conjunction gq - ris true; similarly, the
    conjunction (p V q)- (p V rn is true if either p is true (which makes both disjunctions true)
    or both q and r are true (i.e., the conjunction g - ris true), which makes both disjunctions
    true. The rule is named Distribution because it distributes the first element of the three,
    exhibiting its logical connections with each of the other two statements separately.
    
    14. Double Negation (D.N.) p = ~~ p
    
    Intuitively clear to everyone, this rule simply asserts that any statement is logically equiv-
    alent to the negation of the negation of that statement.
    
    15. Transposition (Trans.) (pq) = (~q D~ Pp)
  - |-
    This logical equivalence permits us to turn any conditional statement around. We know  
    that if any conditional statement is true, then if its consequent is false its antecedent  
    must also be false. Therefore any conditional statement is logically equivalent to the  
    conditional statement asserting that the negation of its consequent implies the negation  
    of its antecedent. Clearly, Transposition, in the form of a logical equivalence, expresses  
    the logical force of the elementary argument form modus tollens.
    
    16. Material Implication (Impl.) (p → q) = (~ p ∨ q)
    
    This logical equivalence does no more than formulate the definition of material implica-
    tion explained in Section 8.4 as a replacement that can serve as a rule of inference. We  
    saw there, and in Section 8.10, that p → q simply means that either the antecedent, p, is  
    false or the consequent, q, is true.
    
    As we go on to construct formal proofs, this definition of material implication  
    will become very important, because it is often easier to manipulate or combine two  
    statements if they have the same basic form—that is, if they are both in disjunctive form,  
    or if they are both in conditional form. If one is in disjunctive form and the other is in  
    conditional form, we can, using this rule, transform one of them into the form of the  
    other. This will be very convenient.
    
    17. Material Equivalence (Equiv.) (p ↔ q) = [(p → q) ∧ (q → p)]  
    (p ↔ q) = [(p → q) ∧ (q → p)]
  - |-
    The two variants of this rule simply assert the two essential meanings of material equivalence, explained in detail in Section 8.9. There we explained that two statements are materially equivalent if they both have the same truth value; therefore (first variant) the assertion of their material equivalence (with the tribar, =) is logically equivalent to asserting that they are both true, or that they are both false. We also explained at that point that if two statements are both true, they must materially imply one another, and likewise if they are both false, they must materially imply one another; therefore (second variant) the statement that they are materially equivalent is logically equivalent to the statement that they imply one another.
    
    18. Exportation (Exp.) [(p → q) ∧ r] = [p → (q → r)]
    
    This replacement rule states a logical biconditional that is intuitively clear upon reflection: If one asserts that two propositions conjoined are known to imply a third, that is logically equivalent to asserting that if one of those two propositions is known to be true, then the truth of the other must imply the truth of the third. Like all the others, this logical equivalence may be readily confirmed using a truth table.
    
    19. Tautology (Taut.) p = (p ∨ p)
    p = (p ∧ p)
    
    The two variants of this last rule are patently obvious but very useful. They say simply that any statement is logically equivalent to the disjunction of itself with itself, and that any statement is logically equivalent to the conjunction of itself with itself. It sometimes happens that, as the outcome of a series of inferences, we learn that the proposition we seek to establish is either true or true. From this disjunction we may readily infer (using this rule) that the proposition in question is true. The same applies to the conjunction of a statement with itself.
  - |-
    It should be noted that the word "tautology" is used in three different senses. It can  
    mean (1) a statement form all of whose substitution instances are true; in this sense the  
    statement form (p D g) D [p D (p D q)] is a tautology. It can mean (2) a statement—for  
    example, (A > B) D [A D (A D B)| whose specific form is a tautology in sense (1). It can  
    also mean (3) the particular logical equivalence we have just introduced, number 19 in our  
    list of rules of inference.
    
    There is an important difference between the first nine and the last ten rules of infer-  
    ence. The ten rules of replacement are logical equivalences, which enable us to replace  
    all or part of one statement with a logically equivalent statement. The first nine rules of  
    inference are not logical equivalences, but elementary valid argument forms, which can be  
    applied only to entire statements, each of which is on its own line of a proof. Thus, in a formal  
    proof of validity, statement A can be inferred from the statement A - B by Simplification  
    only if A - B is the entire statement on one line of a proof. It is obvious that A cannot be

    for if A is true and B and C are both false, (A - B) 5 C is true but A D C is false. Again,
    although A V B follows from A by Addition, we cannot infer (A V B) > C from A 5 C by
    Addition or by any other rule of inference. For if A and C are both false and B is true,
    A > Cis true but (A V B) > Cis false. On the other hand, any of the last ten rules can be applied
    either to an entire statement or to a part of a statement. Not only can the entire statement
    A D (BD C) be inferred from the entire statement (A - B) > C by Exportation, but from the
    statement [(A - B) D C] V Dwe can infer [A 5 (BD C)] V Dby replacing, using Exportation,
    a part of the former, namely its left disjunct (A - B) > C, with the logically equivalent state-
    ment A 5 (BD C). By replacement, logically equivalent statements can replace each other
    wherever they occur, even where they do not constitute the entire statement on a line of
    a proof. But the first nine rules of inference can be used only with entire statements, each
    on its own line of a proof, each serving as a premise of the inference.
    This crucial difference is illustrated by a proof of the following argument.
    
    (P,):~D D (~ED ~F)
    (P,): ~(F-~D) D~G
    ~GDE
    
    This argument can be proved as follows.
    
    1. ~DD(-ED ~F)
    
    2. ~(F-~D)D~G /..GDE
    3. ~DOD(FODE) 1, Transp.

    5. (F-~D)DE 4, Com.
    6. GoD(F-~D) 2, Transp.
    7. GOE 6, 5, HLS.
    
    On line 3, we replace part of the statement on line 1, namely ~E > ~F, with the logi-
    cally equivalent statement F 5 E, using the rule of replacement Transposition. On line 4,
    however, we replace all of the statement on line 3, namely ~D 5 (F 3 E), with the
    logically equivalent statement (~D- F) D E, using the rule of replacement Exportation.
    In both cases, we make a valid inference using a rule of replacement. On line 5, we
    use Commutation to replace only a part of the conditional on line 4, namely its ante-
    cedent, ~D - F, with the logically equivalent statement F - ~D. However, on line 6,
    we apply the rule of replacement Transposition to the entire statement on line 2: we
    replace the entire statement ~(F - ~D) 5 ~G with the the logically equivalent statement
    G D (F- ~D). These four inferences show quite clearly that a rule of replacement can
    be applied to all of a statement (e.g., the inferences on lines 4 and 6, using Exportation
    and Transposition, respectively) or to a part of a statement (e.g., the inferences on lines
    3 and 5, using Exportation and Commutation, respectively). Finally, on line 7, we use
    Hypothetical Syllogism (H.S.) to validly infer the conclusion, G D E. Unlike the ten rules
    of replacement, which are logical equivalences, Hypothetical Syllogism is an elemen-
    tary valid argument form which can only be applied to entire statements. This is indeed
    what has been done on line 7. G D E is deduced from two entire statements: G D (F- ~D)
    on line 6 and (F- ~D) D E on line 5.

    The first nine rules of inference cannot be applied to a part of a statement. For exam-
    ple, Simplification enables us to validly infer the left conjunct from a conjunction that is
    itself the entire statement on a line (i.e., either a premise or a validly inferred statement).
    For this reason, we cannot infer F on line 8

    from F - ~D on line 6 by Simplification, because the conjunction F - ~D on line 6 is not
    itself an entire statement, on its own line, but rather the consequent of the conditional
    statement G → D (F - ~D). Indeed, statement F cannot be inferred by any of the nineteen
    rules because F does not validly follow from G → D (F - ~D), for if G is false and F is false,
    G → D (F - ~D) is true, but F is false. Simplification, like the other eight elementary valid
    argument forms, permits us to infer a statement from one (or more) other statement(s),
    not from a part of a statement. Only a rule of replacement can be applied to a compo-
    nent part of a statement, and in such a case one logically equivalent statement replaces
    another logically equivalent statement.

    EXERCISES
    
    The following set of arguments involves, in each case, one inference only, in which one
    of the ten logical equivalences set forth in this section has been employed. Here are two
    examples, the first two in the exercise set immediately following.
    
    Example 1
    
    (P,): (A ∧ B) → (C ∨ D)
    (A ∧ B) → (~D ∨ ~C)
    
    Solution
    
    The conclusion of this simple argument is exactly like its premise, except for the fact
    that the second conjunct in the premise, C ∨ D, has been replaced by the logically
    equivalent statement ~D ∨ ~C. That replacement is plainly justified by the rule we call
    Transposition (Trans.):
    
    (p ∧ q) ↔ (~q ∨ ~p)
    
    Example 2
    (P,): (E ∧ F) → (G ∧ ~H)
    (¬E ∨ P) → (G ∧ ~H)

    The System of Natural Deduction
    
    The nineteen rules of inference that have been set forth (nine elementary valid argument
    forms and ten logical equivalences) are all the rules that are needed in truth-functional
    logic. Together they constitute a system of natural deduction that is compact and read-
    ily mastered, but nonetheless complete.* This means that, using this set of rules, one can
    construct a formal proof of validity for any valid truth-functional argument.
  - |-
    Two seeming flaws of this list of nineteen rules deserve attention. First, the set is  
    somewhat redundant, in the sense that these nineteen do not constitute the minimum  
    that would suffice for the construction of formal proofs of validity for extended argu-  
    ments. To illustrate this we might note that Modus Tollens could be dropped from  
    the list without any real weakening of our proof apparatus, because any line that  
    depends on that rule can be justified by appealing instead to other rules in our list.  
    Suppose, for example, we know that A → D is true, and that ~D is true, and sup-  
    pose we want to deduce that ~A is true. Modus Tollens allows us to do that directly.  
    If Modus Tollens were not included in the list of rules, we would still have no trouble  
    deducing ~A from A → D and ~D; we would simply need to infer ~D → ~A from  
    A → D by Transposition (Trans.), then obtain ~A from ~D → ~A by Modus Ponens  
    (M.P.). We keep Modus Tollens in the list because it is such a commonly used and intui-  
    tively obvious rule of inference. Others among the nineteen rules are redundant in this  
    sense.
    
    Second, the list of nineteen rules may also be said to be deficient in one sense. Because  
    the set of rules is short, there are some arguments that, although they are simple and  
    intuitively valid, require several steps to prove. To illustrate this point, consider the  
    argument
    
    (P): A ∨ B  
    (P): ~B  
    
    which is obviously valid. Its form, equally valid, is
    
    (P): p ∨ q  
    (P): ~q  
    
    However, this elementary argument form has not been included as a rule of inference.  
    No single rule of inference will serve in this case, so we must construct the proof using  
    two rules of inference, commuting the first premise, and then applying Disjunctive  
    Syllogism, thus:
    
    1. A ∨ B  
    2. ~B /.. A  
    
    3. B ∨ A 1, Com.  
    4. A 3, 2, D.S
  - |-
    * This kind of completeness of a set of rules can be proved. One method of proving such completeness may be found
    inl. M. Copi, Symbolic Logic, 5th edition (New York: Macmillan, 1979), chapter 8.
    
    9.7 The System of Natural Deduction
    
    One may complain that the system is in this way clumsy, at times obliging a slow
    and tortuous path to a proof that ought to be easy and direct. There is good reason
    for this clumsiness. We certainly want a set of rules that is complete, as this set is; but
    we also want a set of rules that is short and easily mastered. We could add rules to
    our set—additional equivalences, or additional valid argument forms—but with each
    such addition our logical toolbox would become more congested and more difficult to
    command. We could delete some rules (e.g., Modus Tollens, as noted above), but with
    each such deletion the set, although smaller, would become even more clumsy, requir-
    ing extended proofs for very simple arguments. Long experience has taught that this
    set of nineteen rules serves as an ideal compromise: a list of rules of inference that is
    short enough to master fully, yet long enough to do all that one may need to do with
    reasonable efficiency.
    
    The notion of formal proof is an effective notion, which means that it can be decided
    quite mechanically, in a finite number of steps, whether or not a given sequence of
    statements constitutes a formal proof (with reference to a given list of rules of infer-
    ence). No thinking is required, either in the sense of thinking about what the state-
    ments in the sequence "mean" or in the sense of using logical intuition to check any
    step's validity. Only two things are required. The first is the ability to see that a state-
    ment occurring in one place is precisely the same as a statement occurring in another,
    for we must be able to check that some statements in the proof are premises of the
    argument being proved valid and that the last statement in the proof is the conclu-
    sion of that argument. The second thing that is required is the ability to see whether a
    given statement has a certain pattern—that is, to see if it is a substitution instance of
    a given statement form.
  - |-
    Thus, any question about whether the numbered sequence of statements on p. 362 is a formal proof of validity can easily be settled in a completely mechanical fashion. That lines 1 and 2 are the premises and line 4 is the conclusion of the given argument is obvious on inspection. That 3 follows from preceding lines by one of the given rules of inference can be decided in a finite number of steps—even where the notation "1, Com." is not written at the side. The explanatory notation in the justification ledger is a help and should always be included, but it is not, strictly speaking, a necessary part of the proof itself. At every line, there are only finitely many preceding lines and only finitely many rules of inference or reference forms to be consulted. Although it is time-consuming, it can be verified by inspection and comparison of shapes that 3 does not follow from 1 and 2 by Modus Ponens, or by Modus Tollens, or by a Hypothetical Syllogism . . . and so on, until in following this procedure we come to the question of whether 3 follows from 1 by the principle of Commutation, and there we see, simply by looking at the forms, that it does. In the same way, the legitimacy of any statement in any formal proof can be tested in a finite number of steps, none of which involves anything more than comparing forms or shapes.
    
    To preserve this effectiveness, we require that only one inference be made at a time. One might be tempted to shorten a proof by combining multiple inferences on one line, but the space and time saved are negligible. More important is the effectiveness we achieve by limiting each step of a proof to one inference by means of one single rule of inference.
    
    Although a formal proof of validity is effective in the sense that it can be mechanically decided, of any given sequence, whether it is a proof, constructing a formal proof

    This is not an effective procedure. In this respect, formal proofs differ from truth tables. The
    making of truth tables is completely mechanical: given any argument of the sort with
    which we are now concerned, we can always construct a truth table to test its validity
    by following the Complete Truth-Table Method set forth in Chapter 8. But we have no
    effective or mechanical rules for the construction of formal proofs. Here we must think,
    or "figure out," where to begin and how to proceed. Nevertheless, proving an argument
    valid by constructing a formal proof of its validity is sometimes much easier than the
    purely mechanical construction of a truth table with perhaps hundreds or even thou-
    sands of rows.
  - |-
    Although we have no purely mechanical rules for constructing formal proofs,
    some rough-and-ready rules of thumb or hints on procedure may be suggested. The
    first is simply to begin deducing statements from the given premises by the given
    rules of inference. As more and more of these deduced statements become available
    as premises for further deductions, the greater is the likelihood of being able to see
    how to deduce the conclusion of the argument to be proved valid. Another hint
    is to try to eliminate statements that occur in the premises but not in the conclu-
    sion. Such elimination can proceed, of course, only in accordance with the rules
    of inference, but the rules contain many techniques for eliminating statements.
    Simplification is such a rule, whereby the right-hand conjunct can be dropped from
    a whole line that is a conjunction. Commutation is a rule that permits switching the
    left-hand conjunct of a conjunction over to the right-hand side, from which it can be
    dropped by Simplification. The "middle" term g can be eliminated by a Hypothetical
    Syllogism given two statements of the patterns p → gq and g → r. Distribution is a use-
    ful rule for transforming a disjunction of the pattern p ∨ (g → r) into the conjunction
    (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬r), whose right-hand conjunct can then be eliminated by Simplification.
    Another rule of thumb is to introduce by means of Addition a statement that occurs
    in the conclusion but not in any premise. Yet another method, often very productive,
    is to work backward from the conclusion by looking for some statement or statements
    from which it can be deduced, and then trying to deduce those intermediate state-
    ments from the premises. There is, however, no substitute for practice as a method of
    acquiring facility in the construction of formal proofs.

    Having now a set of nineteen rules at our disposition, rather than just nine, the task of constructing formal proofs becomes somewhat more complicated. The objective remains the same, of course, but the process of devising the proof involves inspection of a larger intellectual toolbox. The unbroken logical chain that we devise, leading ultimately to the conclusion, may now include steps justified by either an elementary valid argument form or a logical equivalence. Any given proof is likely to employ rules of both kinds. The balance or order of their use is determined only by the logical need encountered as we implement the strategy that leads to the consummation of the proof.
    
    Following is a set of flawless formal proofs, each of which relies on rules of both kinds. To become accustomed to the use of the full set of rules, we examine each of these proofs to determine what rule has been used to justify each step in that proof, noting that justification to the right of each inferred statement. We begin with two examples.

    The first step in this proof, obviously, must manipulate the single premise. What can we
    do with it that will be helpful? If we apply Material Implication (Impl.), we will obtain
    a statement, ~A V ~A, to which we can apply the logical equivalence Tautology (Taut.),
    and that will yield the conclusion we seek. So the proof is

    In this proof we need only rearrange the statements, whose conjunction is given as the
    conclusion. In the first step we can commute the main conjunction of the first prem-
    ise, which will yield (C - D) - B. Then we need only regroup the three statements by
    Association. So the proof is

    (or lines) being used, and then the name (abbreviated) of the rule of inference that has
    been applied to those numbered lines.

    As we advance to arguments whose formal proofs require three inferences, it becomes  
    important to devise a strategy for determining the needed sequence. Most such argu-  
    ments remain fairly simple, but the path to the proof may sometimes be less than obvi-  
    ous. Again we begin with two examples, the first two exercises of Set C, which follows  
    the examples.  
    
    Example 1  
    
    (P,):~A DA  
    A  
    
    Solution  
    
    We have only one premise with which to work. It is often fruitful to convert con-  
    ditional statements into disjunctions. Doing that with line 1 (using Impl.) will  
    yield ~~A as the first of the disjuncts; that component may be readily replaced  
    with A; then, applying the argument form Tautology will give us what we aim for.  
    The proof is

    BOC
    Solution
    
    The single premise in this argument contains the statement D. We need a proof whose conclusion is B D C, and therefore we must somehow eliminate that D. How can we do that? We can break apart the statement (C - D) by distributing the statement ~B. Distribution asserts, in one of its variants, that p V (q - r) → (p V q) - (p V r). Applied to line 1, that replacement will yield (~B V C) - (~B V D). These two disjunctions are just conjoined, so by simplification we may extract ~B V C. This statement may be replaced, using Impl., by B D C, which is the conclusion sought. The proof is

    Formal proofs of validity sometimes require many inferences—and many inferred
    statements—in the needed sequence. We will find that certain patterns of inference
    are encountered repeatedly in longer proofs. It is wise to become familiar with these
    recurring patterns.
    
    This may be nicely illustrated using the first two exercises of Set D, which follows
    immediately below. First, suppose that a given statement, A, is known to be false. The
    next stage of the proof may require that we prove that some different statement, say B,
    is implied by the truth of the statement that we know is false. This can be easily proved,
    and the pattern is not uncommon. Put formally, how may we infer A D B from ~ A? Let
    us examine the argument.
    
    Example 1
    
    (P,): ~A
    ADB
    
    Solution
    
    If ~A is known to be true, as here, then A must be false. A false statement materially
    implies any other statement. So A D B must be true, whatever B may assert, if we know
    that ~A is true. In this case, ~A is given as premise; we only need to add the desired B
    and then apply Implication. The proof of the argument (or the proof segment, when it
    is a part of some longer proof) is
    
    1. (P,):~A
    
    ADB
    2. ~AVB 1, Add.
    3. ADB 2, Impl.

    .~ DDC
  - |-
    This pattern arises very frequently. The truth of some statement C is known. In this case  
    it is given as a premise; in some longer proof we might have established its truth at some  
    other point in the sequence. We know that a true statement is materially implied by any  
    statement whatever. Therefore any statement we choose, D, must imply C. Put formally,  
    how may we infer D → D C from C?
    
    Solution
    
    D does not appear in the premise but it does appear in the conclusion, so we must  
    somehow get D into the sequence of steps. We could simply add D, but that won't  
    succeed—because after commuting that disjunction, and replacing it, using Impl., with a  
    conditional, we wind up with ~D → D C, which is certainly not the conclusion we were after.  
    We want D → D C. To obtain this needed result we must, in the very first step, add ~ D rather  
    than D. This we certainly may do, because Addition permits us to add disjunctively any  
    statement whatever to a statement we know to be true. Then, applying Com. and Impl. will give us what we seek. The formal proof of the argument in this case (or the proof  
    segment, when it occurs as part of a longer proof) is
    
    1 (PP): C
    
    D → D C

    D. Each of the exercises immediately below exhibits a commonly recurring pattern.  
    Constructing the formal proof in each case will take some ingenuity, and (in a few cases)

    When, after substantial practice, one has become well familiar with the nineteen rules of inference, and is comfortable in applying them, it is time to tackle formal proofs that are longer and more convoluted. The three sets of exercises that follow will present some challenges, but devising these formal proofs will be a source of genuine satisfaction.  
    The great mathematician, G. H. Hardy, long ago observed that there is a natural and widespread thirst for intellectual "kick"—and that "nothing else has quite the kick" that solving logical problems has.  
    
    Arguments in a natural language, as in the last two sets, need no further explanation. After translating them into symbolic notation, using the suggested abbreviations, the procedure for constructing the proofs is no different from that used when we begin with an argument formulated in symbols. Before adventuring further in the realm of logical proofs, it will be helpful to examine, from Exercise Set E, two examples of the kinds of formal proofs we will be dealing with from this point forward.  
    
    The arguments presented in all these sets of exercises are valid. Therefore, because the system of nineteen rules we have devised is known to be complete, we may be certain that a formal proof for each one of those arguments can be constructed. Nevertheless, the path from the premises to the conclusion may be far from obvious. In each case, some plan of action must be devised as one goes forward.  
    
    We illustrate the need for a plan of attack, and the way in which such a plan may be devised, by examining very closely two of the exercises—the first and the last—in Set E, which follows on pp. 376-377.

    In this argument the conclusion unites a statement that appears in the second premise, C, with a statement that appears in the first premise, ~B. How shall we effect that unification? The first premise is a conditional whose consequent, ~B, is also the consequent of the conclusion. The second premise contains the negation of the antecedent of the first premise, ~A. If we can manipulate the second premise to emerge with C D A, we can achieve the needed unification with H.S. We can do that. If we apply De M. to the second premise we will get a disjunction that, when replaced by a conditional using Impl., will be one short step away from the conditional needed. The formal proof is
    
    1. ADd~B
    
    (P,): ~(C-~A)
    
    2. CO~B
    3. ~CV~-A 2, De M.
    4. COd-~~A 3, Impl.
    5. COA 4,D.N.
    6. CD~B 5, 1, HLS.
    
    Note that in this proof, as in many, a somewhat different sequence can be devised that leads to the same successful result. Line 3 is a needed first step. But we could have kept the disjunction on line 4, at that point only replacing ~~A by A:
    
    4. ~CVA 3,DN. Replacement of this by a conditional is then needed.
    5. COA 4, Impl. H.S. then again concludes the proof:
    6. CO-~B 5,1,HS.
    
    The difference between the two sequences, in this case, is chiefly one of order. Sometimes there are alternative proofs using quite different strategies altogether.
    
    Let us examine, as our final explication of the detail of formal proofs, one of the longer arguments in Set E, exercise 20, in which devising the strategy needed is more challenging.
    
    Example 2
    
    (P,): (RV S) D (T- U)
    (P,): ~RD (VD ~V)
    (P,): ~T
    
    .~V
  - |-
    The conclusion we seek, ~ V, appears only in the second of the three premises, and even there it is buried in a longer compound statement. How may we prove it? We notice that the consequent of the second premise, V D ~ V is a conditional that, if replaced by a disjunction, yields ~ V V ~ V, which in turn yields ~ V independently, by Taut. Might we obtain V > ~V by M.P.? For that we need ~R. R appears in the first premise, as part of a disjunction; if we can obtain the negation of that disjunction, we may derive ~R. To obtain the negation of that disjunction we need the negation of the consequent of the first premise, so M.T. may be applied. It can be seen that the negation of that consequent T - U should be available, because the third premise asserts ~T, and if ~T is true, then T - U surely is false. How may we show this? We look at the negation that we seek: ~(T- U). This is logically equivalent to ~T V ~U. We can establish ~T V ~U simply by adding ~U to ~T. All the elements of the plan are before us; we need only put them into a logical sequence that is watertight. This is not at all difficult once the strategy has been devised. We begin by building the negation of the consequent of the first premise, then derive the negation of the antecedent of that premise, then obtain ~R. With ~R we establish (V 5 ~ V) by MLP., and the conclusion we want to prove is at hand. The actual lines of the formal proof are

    tion of day and night for the first three days. But either the word "day" is used in
    Scripture in a different sense from that in which it is commonly accepted now or
    else the sun must have been the cause of the alternation of day and night for the
    first three days. Hence it follows that either the Mosaic account of the cosmogony

If people are always guided by their sense of duty, they do not often neglect their duty; and if they are always guided by their desire for pleasure, they do not forgo the enjoyment of many pleasures. Therefore people must forgo the enjoyment of many pleasures if and only if they do not often neglect their duty. (D, F, P. N)
    
    Although world population is increasing, agricultural production is declining and manufacturing output remains constant. If agricultural production declines and world population increases, then either new food sources will become available or else there will be a radical redistribution of food resources in the world unless human nutritional requirements diminish.

Therefore there will be a radical redistribution of food resources in the world. (W, A, M, N, R, H, P)

    G. The five arguments that follow are also valid, and a proof of the validity of each of
    them is called for. However, these proofs will be somewhat more difficult to construct
    than those in earlier exercises, and students who find themselves stymied from time to
    time ought not become discouraged. What may appear difficult on first appraisal may
    come to seem much less difficult with continuing efforts. Familiarity with the nineteen
    rules of inference, and repeated practice in applying those rules, are the keys to the con-
    struction of these proofs.

    For an invalid argument there is, of course, no formal proof of validity. However, if we
    fail to discover a formal proof of validity, this failure does not prove that the argument
    is invalid and that no such proof can be constructed. It may only mean that we have
    not tried hard enough. Our inability to find a proof of validity may be caused by the fact
    that the argument is not valid, but it may be caused by our own lack of ingenuity—as
    a consequence of the non-effective character of the process of proof construction. Not
    being able to construct a formal proof of its validity does not prove an argument to be
    invalid. What does constitute a proof that a given argument is invalid?
    
    A truth table can constitute a proof that an argument is invalid. The Complete
    Truth-Table Method, CTTM, explained in detail in Section 8.7, is a decision procedure
    for determining validity or invalidity in Propositional Logic. It is a rigorous method;
    it never fails. But it is cumbersome and inefficient. We now seek a technique that can give
    the same absolutely reliable results more efficiently. This technique we call the Shorter
    Truth-Table Technique (hereafter STTT).
    
    Recall that a valid deductive argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion.
    In testing an argument or argument form using the CTTM, we construct a complete truth
    table and then examine all cases in which the conclusion is false to determine whether,
    in any such case, the premises are all true. If there is such a case, the argument is invalid;
    if not, the argument is valid.
    
    The motivating idea of the STTT is that, since we need only check all cases in which the
    conclusion is false (or all cases in which the premises are all true), it is far more efficient
    to construct a shorter truth table with only false conclusions (or only all true premises).

    For example, the following argument form
    
    (Pi): (qVr)Ds  
    pos  
    
    has four statement variables, and its complete truth table has 2⁴ or 16 lines. Using the  
    STTT, however, we determine that the argument is valid by constructing the following  
    one-line shorter truth table.
    
    P, P, 2  
    Pp qeor es ep 2D (q - n , (q Vn D Ss =. p D Ss  
    2 7 T TF T T TT OT T T TF F TF F  
    
    The conclusion, p 2 s, is false only if p is true and s is false. Since p is the antecedent  
    of p D (q-r), Premise 1 is true only if its consequent, q - r, is true. But q - r is true only if  
    q is true and r is true, which means that Premise 2 cannot be true, given that q is true, r  
    is true, and s is false. This proves—in one line rather than 16 lines—that the argument is  
    valid because it proves that the two premises cannot both be true on the only truth values  
    for p and s that make the conclusion false.
    
    We employ the STTT to construct the shortest possible truth table to determine whether  
    it is possible for an argument (or argument form) to have all true premises and a false  
    conclusion. In executing the STTT we either prove that this is possible (and the argument  
    is invalid) or that it is impossible (and the argument is valid).
    
    **INVALID:** A shorter truth table proves that an argument (or argument form) is inva-  
    lid by proving that it is possible for the argument (or argument form) to have all  
    true premises and a false conclusion. The shorter truth table proves this possibility  
    by constructing a truth table line in which the conclusion is false and all of the  
    premises are true for one combination of truth values for the simple statements (or  
    statement variables).

    premises and a false conclusion. The shorter truth table proves this impossibility
    by showing that the premises are not all true for any false conclusion (or that the
    conclusion is not false for any case in which all of the premises are true). E.g., for
    a valid argument with a simple statement conclusion, the shorter truth table will
    necessarily have at least one false premise.

    In the remainder of Section 9.9 we will test arguments, rather than argument forms, for
    validity. Thus, in what follows, we will make truth-value assignments to the simple state-
    ments of an argument to determine whether or not that argument is valid.
    
    A. An Essential Skill: Making Forced and
    Unforced Truth-Value Assignments
    
    To execute the STTT, we must first learn how to assign truth values to simple and com-
    pound statements, and how to make forced truth-value assignments. Suppose, for example,
    that we wish to determine whether the following argument is valid.
    
    (P,): DDG
    (P,): GDA
    . DDH
    
    In applying the STTT, we will first make the conclusion false. The conclusion of this argu-
    ment is the conditional statement
    
    DD HH
    
    To indicate that this conditional statement is false, we place an F under its main logical
    operator, the horseshoe:
    
    DD HH
    F
    
    If this conditional statement—consisting of the two simple statements D and H—is false,
    D must be true and H must be false. When we execute the STTT, we assign truth values to
    compound statements, as we just have, and often the truth value of a compound state-
    ment, such as the falsity of D D H, forces us to make particular truth-value assignments to
    simple statements, in this case to D and to H. Thus, in this case we are forced to assign
    the truth value true (T) to D and the truth value false (F) to H.
    
    DD HH
    T F F & F
  - |-
    The truth-value assignments to D and H are forced truth-value assignments. They are  
    forced by the falsity of D > H. Given the definitional truth table for the conditional pre-  
    sented in Chapter 8, a conditional statement is false only if its antecedent is true and its  
    consequent is false. Thus, if D > H is false, D must be true and H must be false. We define  
      
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction  
    
    a forced truth-value assignment as the assignment of a truth value to a simple or compound  
    statement that is compelled or required by:  
    
    (i) the truth-functional nature of simple and compound statements,  
    (ii) our goal(s), and/or  
    (iii) truth-value assignments already made.  
    
    In executing the STTT, just as we need to make conclusions false, we need to make  
    premises true by assigning truth values to their constituent simple statements. Suppose,  
    for example, that an argument has the conjunction E - F as a premise, and we wish to  
    make it true.  
    
    EE. F  
    T  
    
    The truth-value assignments made to E and F are forced because, as we know, this  
    conjunction is true only if E is true and F is true.  
    
    E.: F  
    T T T  
    
    As a third example, suppose that the conclusion of an argument is the disjunction  
    GV J, which we wish to make false.  
    
    GV J  
    F  
    
    As we know from Chapter 8, a disjunction is false only if both of its disjuncts are false.  
    Thus, the truth-value assignments we must make to G and J are forced truth-value assign-  
    ments: G must be false and J must be false.  
    
    GV J  
    F EF E  
    
    In executing the STTT, whenever we assign a truth value to a simple statement in  
    a conclusion or a premise, we must consistently assign the same truth value to that  
    simple statement wherever it occurs in the argument. For example, suppose we are  
    executing the STTT for an argument that has simple statement M as its conclusion,  
    and one of the argument's premises is R D M. Once we have assigned the truth value  
    false (F) to M in the conclusion, we must consistently assign that same truth value to  
    M in the premise R D M.  
    
    R DM  
    F
  - |-
    At this juncture we try to make this premise true. As we know, a conditional with a
    false consequent is true only if its antecedent is false. Thus, to make this conditional true,
    given the falsity of its consequent, M, we are forced to assign the truth value false (F) to R.
    
    RDM
    
    F T F
    
    9.9 Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT)
    
    The truth-value assignment of false to R is a forced truth-value assignment: it is forced
    by three factors: (1) M already has the truth value false, (2) our goal is to make this
    conditional premise true, and (3) a conditional with a false consequent is true only if its
    antecedent is false.
    
    Suppose, however, that the conclusion of an argument is the conjunction K - N, and
    we wish to make it false.
    
    K -. N
    
    In this instance, are we forced to make particular truth-value assignments to simple state-
    ments K and N? No. There are no forced truth-value assignments because a conjunction
    of simple statements is false in three ways: T- F, F- T, and F - E8 As we will see in detail
    in Section 9.9 (D), in this case we make unforced truth-value assignments and construct a
    separate line for each truth-value combination on which the conjunction is false.

    mons
    
    To make correct truth-value assignments—forced and unforced—it is essential that
    one knows the definitional truth tables for the five logical operators, which were presented
    in Chapter 8. Before moving on to the demonstrations of the STTT that follow, the reader
    is encouraged to review the definitional truth tables and the rules of thumb for the logical
    operators (Section 8.9 (C)), which we present again here, for ease of access.
    
    Conjunction: A conjunction is true only when both of its conjuncts are true; other-
    wise it is false.
    
    Disjunction: A disjunction is false only when both of its disjuncts are false; otherwise
    it is true.
    
    Conditional: A conditional is false only when its antecedent is true and its conse-
    quent is false; otherwise it is true.
  - |-
    Biconditional: A biconditional is true only when the statements on either side of the
    tribar have the same truth value; otherwise it is false.
    
    Negation: A negation is true only when the negated statement is false; otherwise the
    negation is false. (A negation has the opposite truth value of the negated statement.)
    
    As the rules of thumb indicate, the truth values of compound statements force truth-
    value assignments in accordance with the definitional truth tables in the following ways.
    
    Conjunction: G ∧ H is true: Make G true and H true.
    Disjunction: G ∨ H is false: Make G false and H false.
    Conditional: G → H is false: Make G true and H false.
    Negation: ~G is true: Make G false.
    
    ~G is false: Make G true.
    
    Forced truth-value assignments give the STITT its great efficiency. To ensure that forced
    truth-value assignments are made efficiently and systematically, they are made in accord-
    ance with the following two maxims.
    
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    MAXIM I: If possible, first make forced truth-value assignments to the conclusion or a prem-
    ise, as determined in Step 1 of the 4-Step STTT (see Section 9.9 (B), below).
    
    MAXIM II: Make forced truth-value assignments to premises that are simple statements or
    the negations of simple statements before making forced truth-value assignments to more
    complex compound premises.
    
    To ensure that unforced truth-value assignments are made efficiently and systemati-
    cally, they are made in accordance with Maxims III, IV and V.
    
    MAXIM III: If there are no—or no more—forced truth-value assignments, make unforced
    truth-value assignments to the conclusion to make it false in every possible way,
    or make unforced truth-value assignments to the premise that is true in the fewest
    number of ways.
    
    MAXIM IV: If truth-value assignments to two or more premises are equally forced (e.g.,
    to two simple statements) or equally unforced, make the left-most truth-value assign-
    ment first.
  - |-
    MAXIM V: In constructing a multiple-line shorter truth table, construct a false conclusion (or a true premise) (a) using only those truth-value combinations that yield the desired truth value for that compound statement, and (b) construct these in the order they would appear in a complete truth table (see Section 8.7). For example, for a compound statement consisting of two simple statements, use, in order, only those combinations of TT, TF, and FT, and FF that yield the desired truth value for the statement.
    
    The reader will better understand forced truth-value assignments and the employment of Maxims I-V as the STTT is presented in Section 9.9 (B), and then explained and demonstrated for seven distinct arguments, in Sections 9.9 (C) and (D). The great power and efficiency of the STTT will be fully appreciated when the STTT is mastered. As always, practice leads to mastery. We encourage the reader to attain that mastery by completing the following Truth-Value Assignment Exercises, and then the 24 STTT Exercises at the end of Section 9.9 (D).

    For the following statements, if there are forced truth-value assignments, make them.
    If there are no forced truth-value assignments, determine, using Maxim V, the requisite
    truth-value combinations on which, and the number of ways that, the statement can be
    true (or false), as the case requires.

    B. The Four Steps of the Shorter Truth-Table Technique  
    
    The STTT is a procedure having four steps. These steps are taken in one of two distinct  
    sequences; either sequence will correctly determine whether or not a given argument is  
    valid. The determination of which of the two paths is to be followed—which of the two  
    paths is the most efficient for a given argument—is the first step in each sequence, and  
    is therefore the same in both.  
    
    Most compound statements are true, or false, in more than one way, that is, for more  
    than one combination of truth values for the constituent simple statements.' For example,  
    QV R is true in three ways: Q is true and R is true; Q is true and R is false; and Q is false  
    and R is true. Similarly, M - N is false in three ways: M is true and N is false; M is false and  
    N is true; and M is false and N is false. However, some compound statements are true or  
    false in only one way: e.g., QD R is false only if Q is true and R is false; and W - X is true  
    only if W is true and X is true.

    Step 2.: Make the Conclusion False.

    Assign truth values to the simple statements  
    in the conclusion that make the conclusion false. If there  
    is more than one assignment of truth values in which  
    
    the conclusion is false, create a separate line in the  
    shorter truth table for each such assignment, and,  
    
    in accordance with Maxims III and V,* execute  
    
    the 4-step STTT procedure one line at  
    a time.
    
    Step 3.: Make As Many Premises True as Possible.
    
    For each assignment of truth values on  
    which the conclusion is false, endeavor to make  
    all of the premises true by making all forced truth-  
    value assignments to simple and compound  
    statements throughout the argument.
    
    Step 1: Determine whether any  
    premise is true in fewer ways than the  
    conclusion is false.
    
    If no premise is true in fewer ways than the conclusion is  
    false, we execute the C-Sequence (i.e., Steps 2., 3. and 4);  
    if at least one premise is true in fewer ways than the  
    conclusion is false, we execute the P-Sequence  
    (i.e., Steps 2,, 3, and 4).
    
    If YES
    
    Step 2,: Make All of the Premises True.
    
    Beginning with the premise that is true in  
    
    the fewest number of ways, assign truth values  
    to the simple statements of the premises that  
    make the premises all true. If there is more than one  
    
    assignment of truth values in which that premise  
    
    is true, create a separate line in the shorter  
    
    truth table for each such assignment, and,  
    
    in accordance with Maxims III, IV, and V,  
    execute the 4-step STTT procedure  
    one line at a time.
    
    Step 3,: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    For each assignment of truth values on  
    which the premises are all true, endeavor to  
    make the conclusion false by making all forced  
    truth-value assignments to simple and  
    compound statements throughout  
    the argument.
    
    Step 4: Test for Validity.
    
    Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.
    
    INVALID: Stop immediately if a truth table line has all true premises and a false  
    conclusion, for in that case the argument has been proved invalid.
  - |-
    VALID: An argument is proved valid if either (a) for all false conclusions, there is at least one false premise, or (b) for all cases of all true premises, the conclusion is true, or (c) the conclusion cannot be false and/or the premises cannot all be true.
    
    * Maxim V applies only to arguments with multiply false conclusions, and is therefore introduced in Section 9.9 (D), demonstrated in Examples 5 and 7,

    9.9 Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT)
    
    In the following two sections, we apply the STTT to arguments whose conclusions
    are false in only one way (Section 9.9 (C)) and to arguments whose conclusions are false
    in multiple ways (Section 9.9 (D)). We will see that Steps 2, 3, and 4 provide the most
    efficient method for the former arguments, and that when arguments have conclusions
    that are false in multiple ways, correctly selecting one of the two sequences in Step 1
    saves a great deal of time and work.
    
    C. The C-Sequence in Simple Cases: Examples of Arguments
    Whose Conclusions are False in Only One Way
    
    The STTT is most efficient when the conclusion of the argument is false on only one combination of truth values for its constituent simple statements. In the present section, we demonstrate Steps 2, 3, and 4 of the STTT for four such arguments, and in each case we execute the STTT in a one-line truth table.
    
    Example 1: A Simple Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Simple Statement
    Example 2: A Complex Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Simple Statement
    Example 3: An Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Conditional
    
    Example 4: An Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Disjunction
    
    In each of these examples, we begin by determining, in Step 1, that no premise is true in fewer ways than the conclusion is false.
  - |-
    The first example is simple and is intended to enable the reader to understand the STTT without complete detail and without much complexity. Example 2 also has a simple statement as its conclusion, but because the argument is more complex, we use it to explain the 4-Step STTT in detail, including Maxims I, II, and IV.
    
    EXAMPLE 1: A Simple Argument in which the Conclusion
    Is a Simple Statement
    
    Consider the following simple argument.
    
    (P,): FDG
    (P,): F
    .G
    
    To construct a shorter truth table, we write out the premises in sequence, separating each
    from its successor by a comma, and separating the last premise from the conclusion by
    the three dots for ‘therefore' (..). To the left of the first premise, we create a guide ‘col-
    umn' for each simple statement.
    
    F G FD G, F . G
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any Premise Is True in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion
    Is False.
    
    The conclusion is simple statement G, which is false in only one way, when G is false.
    Since no premise can be true in fewer ways, we proceed with Steps 2., 3., and 4.
    
    STEP 2: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    There is only one way for the conclusion of this argument to be false: simple state-
    ment G must be false. So, we place an F (false) under statement G (and an F under G in
    the guide column).

    mT
    
    A Note on Shading: Throughout Section 9.9, we will shade the truth values of the
    premises and conclusion of an argument. This will enable us to easily see—by examining
    only the shaded truth values—whether or not a completed shorter truth-table line has
    all true premises and a false conclusion. In constructing a shorter truth table, the reader
    should circle the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.
    
    Since G is false in the conclusion, G must be made false in Premise 1.

    | | F
    
    STEP 3,: Make as Many Premises True as Possible.
    
    We now endeavor to make all of the premises true. Following Maxim II, we first make
    simple statement F true in Premise 2.
  - |-
    9.9 Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT)
    
    EXAMPLE 2: A Complex Argument in which the Conclusion
    Is a Simple Statement
    
    We will now explain the STTT in step-by-step detail using an argument with somewhat
    greater complexity than the argument of Example 1.
    
    (P,): (EV F) → (G - H)
    (Pj): (GVA)OI
    (P,): E
    
    Since this argument contains five distinct simple statements, its complete truth table
    would have 2° or 32 rows. Using the STTT, we will determine whether this argument is
    valid or invalid in a one-line truth table.
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any Premise Is True in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion
    Is False.
    
    The conclusion is simple statement J, which is false in only one way, when J is false.
    Since no premise can be true in fewer ways, we proceed with Steps 2., 3., and 4.
    
    STEP 2: Make the Conclusion False.
    In Step 2, we are first directed by Maxim I.
  - |-
    MAXIM I: If possible, first make forced truth-value assignments to the conclusion or a premise, as determined in Step 1.
    
    There is only one way for the conclusion of this argument to be false: statement I must be false. So, we are forced to make statement I false by placing an F (false) under statement I.
    
    EF GH I (EV F) > G- A, GZG@VANMDT, E-. 1
    | F
    
    When we assign a truth value to a simple statement, that truth value must be immediately assigned to that simple statement wherever else it occurs in the argument (and underneath that simple statement in the guide columns). Statement J occurs also in Premise 2, so we immediately assign the truth value false to J in Premise 2 (and also to Tin the guide columns).
    
    EF GH iI (EV F) DG :-A, GZG@VHMDT, E-. 1
    } } F
    
    It is important to understand why we do this. Statement J is made false also in Premise 2 because a line in a shorter truth table—like a line in a complete truth table—is just a particular combination of truth values for the argument's constituent simple statements (and the truth values of compound statements consisting only of these simple statements). If, therefore, a statement, such as I, is false somewhere on a given line, all occurrences of that statement on that line must have the same truth value. For this reason, when we assign a
    truth value to a simple statement on a line in a shorter truth table, we immediately assign the same truth value to that simple statement in all of its occurrences on that line.
    
    STEP 3: Make as Many Premises True as Possible.
    
    Now that the conclusion has been made false, it is worth remembering that our C-Sequence goal is to make all of the premises true on the truth-value assignment(s) that make(s) the conclusion false. If this is possible, the argument is invalid; if it is not possible, the argument is valid. In executing this procedure correctly, we will either prove that the argument is invalid or prove that the argument is valid.
  - |-
    At this juncture, we employ Maxim II, a rule that ensures that we execute the STTT in the simplest and most efficient manner possible.
    
    MAXIM II: Make forced truth-value assignments to premises that are simple statements or the negations of simple statements before making forced truth-value assignments to more complex compound premises.
    
    A forced truth-value assignment is the assignment of a truth value to a simple or compound statement that is compelled or required by:
    
    (i) the truth-functional nature of simple and compound statements,
    (ii) our goal(s), and/or
    (iii) truth-value assignments already made.
    
    For example, (ii) our first goal forces us, in Step 2,, to make all and only truth-value assignments to simple statements in the conclusion that make the conclusion false. Since there is only one way for the conclusion, simple statement J, to be false, we first assigned the truth value false to simple statement J in all of its occurrences. Once this is done, since (ii) our next goal, in Step 3., is to make all of the premises true, sometimes (iii) the truth-value assignments already made to simple statements in a premise force us to make particular truth-value assignments to other simple or compound statements to (ii) achieve our goal of making that particular premise true, given (i) the truth-functional nature of compound statements.
    
    Applying Maxim II, are any premises simple statements or negations of simple statements? Yes. Premise 3 is simple statement E. We are therefore compelled, by Maxim II, to first make E true in Premise 3, and in all of its other occurrences, before moving on to forced truth-value assignments to compound statements. Thus, we make E true in Premise 3 and in Premise 1 (and in the guide column for E).

    Given that E is true and J is false, are there any other forced truth-value assignments? Yes, there are two. Since E is true, we are forced to make E V F true, for a disjunction is true provided that at least one of its disjuncts is true. Given that I is false, we are also forced to make G V H false, for Premise 2, (G V H) → IJ, is a conditional with a false consequent, which is only true if its antecedent is false. Since these two truth-value assignments—to Premise 1 and to Premise 2—are equally forced, we must apply Maxim IV.
    
    9.9 Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT)
    
    MAXIM IV: If truth-value assignments to two or more premises are equally forced (e.g., to two simple statements) or equally unforced, make the left-most truth-value assignment first.
    
    Applying Maxim IV, we begin with the left-most forced truth-value assignment, to Premise 1. Since E is true in Premise 1, the antecedent of Premise 1, E V F, is true; so we place a T under the wedge of E V F.
    
    E F G H 1 (E V F) → (G → H), G V H + I, E • |
    T F T T F T F
    
    Given that E V F is true, Premise 1 is true only if its consequent, G → H, is true; so we place a T (true) under the dot of G → H.
    
    E F G H 1 (E V F) → (G → H), G V H + I, E • |
    T F T T F T T

    Making forced truth-value assignments means in part that, to execute Step 3,, the truth
    value of a compound statement forces truth-value assignments to compound and/or sim-
    ple statements (see Section 9.9 (A)). For example, since the conditional (E V F) D (G.- H)
    has a true antecedent, it is true only if its consequent, the conjunction G - H, is true. In
    turn, the conjunction G - H is true only if both of its conjuncts, simple statement G and
    simple statement H, are true. The truth values of compound statements force truth-value
    assignments in the following ways.
    
    Conjunction: G-Histrue: Make G true and H true.
    Disjunction: GV His false: Make G false and H false.
    Conditional: G2 His false: Make G true and H false.
    Negation: ~G is true: Make G false.
    
    ~G is false: Make G true.
    
    Thus, we are now forced to make G true and H true in the conjunction G - A (and in
    the guide columns for G and H).

    As always, once we have assigned truth values to simple statements G and H, we
    make those same truth-value assignments to G and to H in all of their occurrences. We

    ---
    
    **STEP 4: Test for Validity.**
    
    Is the argument valid or invalid? It is easy to see from the complete one-line truth table that the argument is valid, for the premises cannot all be true for any truth-value assignment in which the conclusion is false. There is only one truth-value assignment on which the conclusion is false (i.e., when J is false), and there is only one truth-value assignment on which Premise 3 is true (i.e., when E is true). These truth-value assignments, in turn, force the consequent of Premise 1 to be true, which in turn forces G and H to both be true. These forced truth-value assignments make the antecedent of Premise 2, G V H, true, which, given the falsity of I, makes Premise 2, (G V H) 5 I, false. So, although we can make Premise 3 and Premise 1 true given the falsity of the conclusion, we cannot make Premise 2 true.'* Thus, on the only assignment of truth values that makes the conclusion false, the premises are not all true. This proves that this argument cannot have a false conclusion and all true premises, which proves that it is valid.'
  - |-
    Our work is complete. Instead of constructing the 32-line complete truth table, we have executed the STTT in a single line and determined that the argument is valid. Although a proof of this argument consists of only five inferences (Add., M.P., Simp., Add., and M.P.), the STTT takes no more time than the proof. For arguments that require more difficult and lengthy proofs, the STTT will typically be much more efficient. And in a case when one is trying vainly to prove an invalid argument valid, the STTT is almost always far more efficient than the CTTM."
    
    EXAMPLE 3: An Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Conditional
    
    Examples 1 and 2 show how efficient the STTT is when the conclusion of an argument is a simple statement (or the negation of a simple statement). We will now see that the STTT is equally efficient if the conclusion of the argument is a more complex compound statement that is false for only one combination of truth values for its constituent simple statements. Consider the following argument.
    
    (P1): (B D W) - (G D ~S)
    (P2): (~B - ~G) D (C - P)
    (P3): ~W
    (P4): P
    Conclusion: C D ~G
    
    Since this argument contains six distinct simple statements, its complete truth table would have 2^6 or 64 lines. Using the STTT, however, we will determine whether this argument is valid or invalid in one line.
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any Premise Is True in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion Is False.
    
    Given that the argument's conclusion, C D ~G, is false for only one combination of truth values for C and G (i.e., when C is true and G is true), we proceed with Steps 2, 3, and 4 and are able to test for validity very easily and very quickly, in a one-line shorter truth table.
    
    STEP 2: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    In executing Step 2, we follow Maxim I and first make forced truth-value assignments to the conclusion. Since the main logical operator of the conclusion, C D ~G, is the horseshoe, we first place an F under the horseshoe of C D ~G.

    STEP 3: Make as Many Premises True as Possible.
    
    Following Maxim II, we first make forced truth-value assignments to premises that
    are simple statements or the negations of simple statements. Since we are forced to make
    a truth-value assignment to the negation of a simple statement in Premise 3 and toa
    simple statement in Premise 4, we apply Maxim II and first make ~ W true in Premise 3.

    We must now assign the truth value false to W wherever else it occurs. W occurs in

    Continuing with Maxim II, we move rightward from ~ W and make the forced truth-
    value assignment of true to simple statement P in Premise 4.

    Given that P is true in Premise 4, it must immediately be made true in its only other

    This means that B can have either truth value in Premise 2. B also occurs in Premise 1.  
    Are we forced to assign a particular truth value to B in Premise 1? Yes we are. Since Premise  
    1 is a conjunction, it is true only if both of its conjuncts are true. The left conjunct of  
    Premise 1 is the conditional B > W, whose consequent W is false; we are therefore forced  
    to make B false in order to make B D W true.

    Again, since Premise 1 is a conjunction, it is only true if its right conjunct is also true.  
    The right conjunct of Premise 1 is the conditional G D5 ~S, and its antecedent, statement  
    G, is true. Thus, to make G D ~S true, we are forced to make its consequent, ~S, true,

    The shorter truth table is now complete, because on forced truth-value assignments
    to the conclusion and Premises 3, 4, 2, and 1 (in that order), all of the premises are true
    and the conclusion is false.
    
    STEP 4: Test for Validity.
    
    Step 4 tells us that if, for any false conclusion, consistent truth-value assignments
    make all of the premises true, we should stop, for that proves that the argument is
    invalid. In making the conclusion false and Premise 3 and Premise 4 true, Premise 2
    was made true, and we were then forced to make B false and S false to make Premise 1
    true. On these truth-value assignments, all of the premises are true and the conclusion
    is false, which establishes that the argument is invalid. We have proved that the argu-
    ment is invalid by showing that it can have all true premises and a false conclusion,
    and we have shown this to be possible by demonstrating that the argument does have
    all true premises and a false conclusion when its simple statements have the following

    constituent simple statements (i.e., when X is true and Y is true), we proceed with Steps
    2. 3,, and 4 and begin by making the conclusion false.
    
    STEP 2.: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    Following Maxim I, we first make forced truth-value assignments to the conclusion.
    Since the conclusion is the disjunction ~X V ~ Y, we begin by placing an F under the wedge.

    (X V Y) Dd (
    
    Since we have made X true and Y true in the conclusion, we must make those same
    truth-value assignments to X and Y wherever else they occur in the argument. X and Y
    each have three other occurrences in the premises of the argument.
    
    (X V Y) Dd (
    
    STEP 3: Make as Many Premises True as Possible.
    
    We now look for forced truth-value assignments to simple statements in the premises.
    In this case, however, the forced truth-value assignments to X and Y in the conclusion have
    completed all truth-value assignments to the simple statements, X and Y, in the premises.
    We therefore apply Maxim IV and determine the truth value of the left-most premise,
    Premise 1. Given that X is true and Y is true, the antecedent of Premise 1, X V Y, is true.

    The conclusion of this argument, ~X V ~ Y, is false only if X is true and Y is true. On
    this combination of truth values for _X and_X, Premise 1 is true, but Premise 2 is false. This
    proves that the argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, which
    proves that the argument is valid.
    
    D. Conclusions that are False on Multiple Truth-Value
    Combinations
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text, with all formatting errors fixed:
    
    To this point, we have applied the STTT to four arguments, all of which have conclusions that are false on only one combination of truth values for their constituent simple statements. The STTT is most efficiently employed when only one assignment of truth values to the simple statements of the conclusion makes the conclusion false. In all such cases, we execute Steps 2, 3, and 4, and use the STTT to construct a one-line shorter truth table.
    
    When, however, the conclusion of an argument is false on multiple combinations of truth values to its constituent simple statements, the situation is somewhat more complex; we may need to execute the STTT for multiple lines of a shorter truth table. To maximize efficiency in such cases, we determine, at Step 1, whether to execute the C-Sequence or the P-Sequence of the STTT by ascertaining whether any premise is true in fewer ways than the ways in which the conclusion is false.
    
    In this section we will test the following three arguments using the STTT and demonstrate how Step 1 determines whether to use the C-Sequence or the P-Sequence.
    
    Example 5: An Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Conjunction of Simple Statements
    
    Example 6: An Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Conjunction of Simple Statements
    
    Example 7: An Argument in which the Conclusion Is a Biconditional of Simple Statements
    
    Chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    In Example 6 we will demonstrate when and how Steps 2, 3, and 4 should be used to greatly maximize efficiency.
    
    EXAMPLE 5: An Argument in which the Conclusion
    Is a Conjunction of Simple Statements
    
    The following argument has a conjunctive conclusion.
    
    (P1): M ∨ N
    
    (P2): (M ∨ N) → O
    
    (P3): (M ∨ N) ⊃ D
    
    Conclusion: O ∧ P
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any Premise Is True in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion
    Is False.
  - |-
    The conclusion, O - P, is false on three combinations of truth values for its constituent
    simple statements, O and P: T- F, F- T, and F- FE Each premise, however, is true in at least
    three ways: Premise 1 is true in three ways (i.e., T V T, T V EF, F V T), Premise 2 is true in
    five ways, and Premise 3 is true in five ways. Since no premise is true in fewer ways than
    the conclusion is false, we proceed with Steps 2.,, 3., and 4.
    
    STEP 2: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    In making a conclusion false for multiple combinations of truth values for its constit-
    uent simple statements, or in making a premise true for multiple combinations of truth
    values for its constituent simple statements, we always proceed according to Maxim V:
    
    MAXIM V: In constructing a multiple-line shorter truth table, construct a false con-
    clusion (or a true premise) (a) using only those truth-value combinations that yield the
    desired truth value for that compound statement, and (b) construct these in the order they
    would appear in a complete truth table (see Section 8.7). For example, for a compound
    statement consisting of two simple statements, use only those combinations of TT,
    TE, FT, and FF that yield the desired truth value for the statement.
    
    Recall from Chapter 8 (Section 8.7) our method of constructing complete truth tables,
    and how we determined the number of rows and how to populate the guide columns
    with T's and F's. We learnt there that for a compound statement consisting of n simple
    statements, there are 2^n truth-value combinations. Thus, for a compound statement
    consisting of two simple statements, there are 2^2 or 4 truth-value combinations: TT, TF,
    FT, and FF. Similarly, for a compound statement consisting of three simple statements,
    there are 2^3 or 8 truth-value combinations. And for a compound statement consisting of
    four distinct simple statements, there are 2^4 or 16 truth-value combinations. And so on.
  - |-
    Maxim V directs us to construct (a) only those truth-value combinations that yield  
    the desired truth value for a compound statement, and it directs us to (b) construct these  
    in the order they would appear in a complete truth table. For example, suppose that the  
    conclusion of an argument is the conjunction Q – R, and we wish to make it false. There  
    are four truth-value combinations for the two simple statements, Q and R: T–T, T–F  
    F–T, and F–F. However, we construct a multiple-line truth table only for the truth-value  
    combinations T–F, F–T, and F–F (in this order), since only they make the conjunction  
    Q–R false (i.e., we omit T – T, because Q – R is true if Q is true and R is true).
    
    T  
    |  
    | | T  
    | | |
    
    Similarly, if we are constructing a multiple-line truth table for the premise H – (I > J),  
    which contains three simple statements, there are eight truth-value combinations for H,  
    I, and J: TTT, TTE, TFT, TFE, FTT, FTE, FFT, and FFE. Following Maxim V, we would construct  
    a truth table line for only those truth-value combinations for simple statements H, I, and  
    J, that make the premise true. Of the eight possible combinations of truth values for these  
    three simple statements, only three (i.e., TTT, TFT, TFF) make H – (I > J) true. We would  
    therefore construct three lines for the premise H – (I > J), using these three truth-value  
    combinations—TTT, TFT, TFF—in this order, because this is the order they would appear  
    in a complete truth table.
    
    T T T T T  
    T T T T  
    T T F T F  
    
    We omit the other five combinations (i.e., TTF, FTT, FTF, FFT, and FFF) because  
    H – (I > J) is false on these truth-value combinations.
  - |-
    In applying Maxim V to the argument at hand, since the conjunctive conclusion
    O - Pis not false for T - T, we construct the following three-line shorter truth table for the
    three truth-value combinations T - F, F- T, and F- F.
    
    , (M VY N Dd O , (M V N D P
    
    STEP 3,: Make as Many Premises True as Possible.
    
    In a multiple-line shorter truth table, we execute Step 3,, by considering, one at a time,
    each set of truth-value assignments under which the conclusion is false. If, for any false
    conclusion, we are able to make all of the premises true, we stop, for in that case we have
    proved that the argument is invalid. However, in order to prove an argument valid via
    Step 3., we must consider all combinations of truth values for simple statements that
    make the conclusion false, and we must show for each such combination that the argu-
    ment cannot have all true premises. If an argument is valid, there will be at least one
    forced false premise for each false conclusion.
    
    Since the conclusion of this argument, O - P, is false in three ways, we begin with
    the first truth-value assignments and execute Step 3. by making forced truth-value
    assignments until either we succeed in making all of the premises true, or we are forced
    to make a premise false, in which case we move on to the next line in this three-line
    truth table.
    
    Given that O is true and P is false in the first line of our shorter truth table, we consistently assign those truth values to O and P, respectively, wherever else they occur. O occurs
    as the consequent of Premise 2, so we make O true there; P occurs as the consequent of
    Premise 3, so we make P false there.

    Step 3, now requires that we endeavor to make all of the premises true under these
    truth-value assignments. At this juncture, there is only one forced truth-value assignment:
    given the falsity of P in Premise 3, Premise 3 is true only if its antecedent, M V N, is false.

    Line 1 of our shorter truth table is complete. The truth of O and the falsity of P make
    Premise 2 true and force M and N both to be false to make Premise 3 true. These truth-
    value assignments make Premise 1 false, which shows that the premises cannot all be
    true when O is true and P is false.

    Because we were not able to make all of the premises true for the first false conclusion, we move on to line 2 and assign false to O and true to P wherever else they occur.

    Before moving on to our last line, it is worth noting that neither validity nor inva-

    could have all true premises and a false conclusion, in which case the argument would be
    invalid. It is also possible that in this last case of a false conclusion, it is not possible for all
    of the premises to be true, in which case the argument would be valid. This means that,
    as far as we know at this juncture, this argument could be valid or invalid. To determine
    whether the argument is valid or invalid, we need to determine the truth values of the
    premises when O is false and P is false.

    Once again, the falsity of O in Premise 2 requires, for the truth of Premise 2, that the

    Given that these three lines exhaust the possible combinations of truth values for
    O and P in which the conclusion is false, we have proved that the premises cannot all
    be true and the conclusion false for any combination of truth values for the argument's
    simple statements. This proves that this argument is valid.

    Is any one of the premises true in fewer than three ways? Yes. Premise 2 is true in only one way (i.e., if J is false) and Premise 4 is true in only one way (i.e., G is true). Thus, we execute Steps 2, 3, and 4 (i.e., the P-Sequence) and first make all of the premises true. We do this because, if we start with Step 2, and the argument is valid, we will have to check all three false conclusions; but if we start with Step 2, we need only construct and check a one-line shorter truth table. Steps 2 and 3, and the C-Sequence and the P-Sequence,
    9.9 Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT)
    
    are designed to maximize the efficiency of the STTT by ensuring that the STTT is executed in the fewest number of lines.
    
    STEP 2: Make the Premises All True.
    
    In making all of the premises true, we begin with forced truth-values assignments.
    Applying Maxim II, we first look for premises that are simple statements or the negations
    of simple statements. There are two such forced truth-value assignments, in Premise 2
    (~J) and in Premise 4 (G), so we apply Maxim IV and begin by making the left-most forced
    truth-value assignment, to Premise 2, first.
    
    We must now make J false wherever else J occurs. Since J occurs in Premise 1, we
    make J false in Premise 1.
    
    Next, we make G true wherever else it occurs in the argument. G is the antecedent
    of Premise 3, so we make G true there.
    
    Applying Maxim IV, we continue with forced truth-value assignments beginning with
    the left-most premise. Since our aim in Step 2 is to make all of the premises true, since J is false,
    we make Premise 1 true by making K true, and we place a T under the wedge of J V K.
    
    We are forced to consistently assign the truth value T (true) to K wherever else K
    occurs. Since K occurs also in the conclusion, we make K true in the conclusion.

    Continuing with Maxim II, we now move right-ward to Premise 3. Given that G is
    true, we must make H true in order to make G D H true.
    
    Our shorter truth table is complete.
    STEP 3: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    Obviously, it is not possible to make the conclusion false, because it is true on the
    only combination of truth values for simple statements that makes all of the premises
    true. In order, J was forced false, G was forced true, K was forced true, and, lastly, H was
    forced true.
    
    STEP 4: Test for Validity.
    
    On the only combination of truth values for the constituent simple statements on
    which the premises are all true, the conclusion is also true. This proves that the argu-
    ment is valid, for it proves that the argument cannot have all true premises and a false
    conclusion.
    
    EXAMPLE 7: An Argument in which the Conclusion Is a
    Biconditional of Simple Statements
    
    Lastly, consider the following argument, whose conclusion is a biconditional.
    
    (P1): T- (U V V)
    
    (P2): TD [UD (W- X)]
    (P3): (T-V) D ~(WV X)
    WX
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any Premise Is True in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion
    Is False.
    
    The conclusion, W =X, is false on two combinations of truth values for its constitu-
    ent simple statements: W is true and X is false, and W is false and X is true. Is any premise
    true for only one combination of truth values for its constituent simple statements?
    Premise 1 is the conjunction T- (U V V), which is true in three ways: T is true, U is true
    and V is true; T is true, U is true and V is false; and T is true, U is false and V is true.
    Premise 2 is true in multiple ways, and the same is true of Premise 3. Thus, we proceed
    with Steps 2, 3, and 4.
    
    STEP 2: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    First, we place an F under the tribar of the biconditional conclusion, W =X.

    Next, following Maxim V, we construct each combination of truth values in which
    the conclusion is false. We do this by enumerating the four possible combinations—
    T=T, T=E£, F=T, and F = F—and then eliminating those combinations that do not make
    the conclusion false. The Maxim V procedure yields, in order: T = F, and F =T.

    truth values on which the conclusion is false (line 1): W is true and X is false. Applying
    these truth-value assignments to W and X elsewhere in the argument, we get the follow-

    At this juncture, there are two forced truth-value assignments, one in Premise 2 and one in Premise 3. Applying Maxim IV, we make the left-most forced truth-value assignment. Since T is true as the antecedent of Premise 2, the consequent, UD (W.-X), must be true. Given that the consequent of the conditional UD (W - X) is false, this conditional is true only if its antecedent, U, is false. So we place an F under U and a T under the horseshoe of UD (W - X).

    Line 1 of our shorter truth table is complete.
    
    We must always be careful with multiple-line shorter truth tables to draw the correct
    interim conclusion. We have not proved that this argument is valid, because we have
    not yet checked the second false conclusion. What we have shown, so far, is that the
    argument does not have all true premises and a false conclusion when W is true and X is
    false. For all we know, it is possible that the argument can have all true premises and a
    false conclusion when W is false and X is true. So we must now check that second and
    last false conclusion.

    Again, Maxim II does not apply because there are no premises that are simple state-
    ments or the negations of simple statements. So, we apply Maxim IV and begin with
    the left-most forced truth-value assignment. Since Premise 1 is true only if both of its
    conjuncts are true, we make T true and we place a T under the wedge of UV V.

    As in line 1, there are now two forced truth-value assignments, one in Premise 2 and
    one in Premise 3. Applying Maxim IV, we make the left-most forced truth-value assign-
    ment. Since T is true as the antecedent of Premise 2, the consequent, U > (W - X), must
    be true. Given that the consequent of the conditional U D (W - X) is false, this condi-
    tional is true only if its antecedent, U, is false. So we place an F under U and a T under
    the horseshoe of UD (W- X).

    STEP 4: Test for Validity.
    
    We have completed line 2. What have we shown? In line 2 alone, we have shown that
    the argument does not have all true premises and a false conclusion when W is false and
    X is true. But this is the second of only two combinations of truth values in which the
    conclusion, W =X, is false, and in both cases, the argument does not have (and, therefore,
    cannot have!') all true premises and a false conclusion. Since these two combinations of
    truth values for W and X are the only truth-value combinations that make the conclusion,
    W = X, false, this proves that the argument cannot have all true premises and a false
    conclusion, which proves that it is valid.
    
    Summary of the STTT
  - |-
    We have now applied the STTT to seven different arguments. The first four arguments we  
    tested in one-line truth tables because their conclusions were false in only one way. In  
    Examples 5 and 7, where the conclusion is false in multiple ways, we determined that the  
    C-Sequence was most efficient, and then used Steps 2., 3., and 4 to determine, in three-  
    line and two-line truth tables, respectively, that the arguments are valid. In Example 6,  
    where the conclusion is false in multiple ways, we determined that the P-Sequence is  
    most efficient, and therefore used Steps 2., 3., and 4 to efficiently prove the validity of  
    the argument in one line.
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any Premise Is True in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion  
    Is False.  
    STEP 2: Either (C) Make the Conclusion False or (P) Make All of the Premises True.
    
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    STEP 3: Either (C) Make as Many Premises True as Possible or (P) Make the Conclusion  
    False.
    
    STEP 4: Test for Validity.
    
    MAXIM I: If possible, first make forced truth-value assignments to the conclusion or a  
    premise, as determined in Step 1 of the 4-Step STTT (see Section 9.9 (B)).
    
    MAXIM II: Make forced truth-value assignments to premises that are simple statements or  
    the negations of simple statements before making forced truth-value assignments to more  
    complex compound premises.
    
    MAXIM III: If there are no—or no more—forced truth-value assignments, make unforced  
    truth-value assignments to the conclusion to make it false in every possible way,  
    or make unforced truth-value assignments to the premise that is true in the fewest  
    number of ways.
    
    MAXIM IV: If truth-value assignments to two or more premises are equally forced (e.g.,  
    to two simple statements) or equally unforced, make the left-most truth-value assign-  
    ment first.
  - |-
    **9.9 Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT)**
    
    **MAXIM V:** In constructing a multiple-line shorter truth table, construct a false conclusion (or a true premise) (a) using only those truth-value combinations that yield the desired truth value for that compound statement, and (b) construct these in the order they would appear in a complete truth table (see Section 8.7). For example, for a compound statement consisting of two simple statements, use, in order, only those combinations of TT, TF, FT, and FF that yield the desired truth value for the statement.
    
    **INVALIDITY:** We prove an argument invalid by constructing a truth table row in which the premises are all true and the conclusion false for one combination of truth values for the constituent simple statements.
    
    **VALIDITY:** We prove an argument valid by proving that the premises cannot all be true for any false conclusion (i.e., the C-Sequence of the STTT), or by proving that the conclusion cannot be false for any set of true premises (i.e., the P-Sequence of the STTT).
    
    **Supplementary material on the STTT is provided in Appendices A, B, and C at the back of this book.**
    
    **EXERCISES**
    
    For each of the following arguments, use the STTT to determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. For some of these arguments, Steps 2, 3, and 4 (i.e., the C-Sequence) will be most efficient; for some of these arguments Steps 2, 3, and 4 (i.e., the P-Sequence) will be most efficient.

    9.10) Inconsistency
  - |-
    An argument is invalid if it can have all true premises and a false conclusion. As we saw
    in Sections 8.7 and 9.9, if an argument is invalid, it has all true premises and a false
    conclusion for at least one combination of truth values for its simple statements. On
    the contrary, if an argument is valid it cannot have all true premises and a false conclu-
    sion, which means that it does not have all true premises and a false conclusion for any
    combination of truth values for its simple statements. This, the definition of validity,
    has the following curious consequence: Any argument whose premises are inconsist-
    ent must be valid.
    
    In the following argument, for example, the premises appear to be totally irrelevant
    to the conclusion:
    
    (P1): If the airplane had engine trouble, it would have landed at Bend.
    
    (P2): If the airplane did not have engine trouble, it would have landed at Creswell.
    (P3): The airplane did not land at either Bend or Creswell.
    
    Therefore the airplane must have landed in Denver.
    
    Here is its symbolic translation:
    
    (P1): ACB
    (P2): ~A DC
    (P3): ~(B V C)

    9.10 Inconsistency
    
    Any attempt to assign truth values to its component simple statements in such a way
    as to make the conclusion false and the premises all true is doomed to failure. Even if
    we ignore the conclusion and attend only to the premises, we find that there is no way
    to assign truth values to their components such that the premises will all be true. No
    truth-value assignment can make them all true because they are inconsistent with one
    another. Their conjunction is self-contradictory, being a substitution instance of a self-
    contradictory statement form. Thus, in the truth table for this argument below, at least
    one of the premises is false in every row.

    Because there is no combination of truth values for the simple statements of this
    argument (i.e., no row) in which the premises are all true, there is no combination
    of truth values for the simple statements of this argument (i.e., no row) in which the
    premises are all true and the conclusion false. This truth table demonstrates that this argu-
    ment is valid because it shows that the argument cannot have all true premises and false
    conclusion; the argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion because
    it cannot have all true premises.
    
    Since the argument is valid, we can also provide a formal proof of its validity:
    
    1. ADB
    
    2. ~ADC
    
    3. ~(BV C)/
    
    4. ~B-.~C 3, De M.
    
    S. ~B 4, Simp.
    
    6. ~A 1, 5, M.T.
    
    7. C 2, 6, M.P.
    
    8. ~C-~B 4, Com.
    
    9. ~C 8, Simp.
    10. CVD 7, Add.
    
    11. D 10, 9, DS.
  - |-
    In this proof, lines 1 through 9 are devoted to making explicit the inconsistency that is implicitly contained in the premises. That inconsistency emerges clearly in line 7 (which asserts C) and line 9 (which asserts ~C). Once this explicit contradiction has been expressed, the conclusion follows swiftly using Add. and D.S.
    
    Thus we see that if a set of premises is inconsistent, those premises will validly yield any conclusion, no matter how irrelevant. The essence of the matter is more simply shown with the following outrageous argument, whose openly inconsistent premises allow us to infer—validly!—an irrelevant and absurd conclusion.
    
    Today is Sunday.
    Today is not Sunday.
    Therefore the moon is made of green cheese.
    
    In symbols we have
    
    (P,): S
    (P,): ~S
    
    The formal proof of the validity of this argument is almost immediately obvious:
    
    1. S
    2. ~S /..M
    3. S ∨ M | 1, Add.
    4. M | 3, 2, DS.
    
    Of course, an argument that is valid because its premises are inconsistent cannot possibly be sound—tfor if the premises are inconsistent with each other, they cannot possibly be all true. By such an argument, therefore, it is not possible to establish any conclusion to be true, because at least one of the premises must be false."°
  - |-
    How can such meager premises make any argument in which they occur valid?
    The premises of a valid argument imply its conclusion not merely in the sense of
    "material" implication, but logically, or strictly. The premises of a valid argument entail
    the conclusion. A valid argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion—and this is the situation that obtains when an argument cannot have all true
    premises, putting the conclusion aside. What we have shown is this: Any argument with
    inconsistent premises is valid, regardless of what its conclusion may be. An argument with
    inconsistent premises cannot have all true premises, and, therefore, it cannot have all
    true premise and a false conclusion; thus it is valid. Its validity may be established by
    a truth table, or as we saw above, by a formal proof in which the contradiction is first
    formally expressed (for example, S and ~S), the desired conclusion is then added to
    one side of the contradiction (for example, S V M), and that desired conclusion (for
    example, M) is then inferred by Disjunctive Syllogism using the other side of the con-
    tradiction (for example, ~ S).
    
    This discussion helps to explain why consistency is prized so highly. One reason is
    that two inconsistent statements cannot both be true. In a courtroom, therefore, cross-
    examination often aims to bring a hostile witness to contradict himself. If a witness
    makes inconsistent assertions, not all that he says can be true, and his credibility is
    seriously undermined. When it has been once established that a witness has lied under
    oath (or is perhaps thoroughly confused), no testimony of that witness can be fully
    trusted. Lawyers say: Falsus in unum, falsus in omnibus—" untrustworthy in one thing,
    untrustworthy in all."
    
    Another, deeper reason why inconsistency is so repugnant is that—as we have seen—
    any and every conclusion follows logically from inconsistent statements taken as premises.
    Inconsistent statements are not "meaningless"; their trouble is just the opposite—
    they mean too much. They mean everything, in the sense of implying everything, and
    if everything is asserted, half of what is asserted is surely false, because every statement
    has a denial.
  - |-
    We are thus provided with an answer to the old riddle: What happens when an irre-
    sistible force meets an immovable object? The situation described by the riddle involves a
    contradiction. An irresistible force can meet an immovable object only if both exist; there
    must be an irresistible force and there must also be an immovable object. But if there is
    an irresistible force, there can be no immovable object. Let us make the contradiction
    explicit: There is an immovable object, and there is no immovable object. From these
    inconsistent premises, any conclusion may validly be inferred. So the correct answer to
    the question, "What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object?" is
    "Everything!"
    
    Inconsistency, devastating when found among the premises of an argument, can
    be highly amusing. Everett Dirksen, leader of the Republican Party in the U.S. Senate
    for a decade in the twentieth century, enjoyed describing himself as "a man of fixed
    and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times."*! When an
    internal contradiction, not recognized by a speaker, yields unseen absurdity, we call
    the statement an "Irish bull." Writes the schoolboy, for example, "The climate of the
    Australian interior is so bad that the inhabitants don't live there anymore." Yogi Berra,
    famous for his Irish bulls, observed that a certain restaurant, once very popular, had
    become "so crowded that nobody goes there anymore." He also said, "When you see
    a fork in the road, take it."
    
    As a matter of logic, in an internally inconsistent set, not all the propositions can
    be true. But human beings are not always logical and do utter, and sometimes may even
    believe, two propositions that contradict one another. This may seem difficult to do, but
    we are told by Lewis Carroll, a very reliable authority in such matters, that the White
    Queen in Alice in Wonderland made a regular practice of believing six impossible things
    before breakfast!

    1. If the linguistics investigators are correct, then if more than one dialect was present in ancient Greece, then different tribes came down at different times from the north. If different tribes came down at different times from the north, they must have come from the Danube River valley. But archaeological excavations would have revealed traces of different tribes there if different tribes had come down at different times from the north, and archaeological excavations have revealed no such traces there. Hence if more than one dialect was present in ancient Greece, then the linguistics investigators are not correct. (C, M, D, V, A)
    
    2. If there are the ordinary symptoms of a cold and the patient has a high temperature, then if there are tiny spots on his skin, he has measles. Of course the patient cannot have measles if his record shows that he has had them before. The patient does have a high temperature and his record shows that he has had measles before. Besides the ordinary symptoms of a cold, there are tiny spots on his skin. I conclude that the patient has a viral infection. (O, T, S, M, R, V)
    
    3. If God were willing to prevent evil, but unable to do so, he would be impotent; if he were able to prevent evil, but unwilling to do so, he would be malevolent. Evil can exist only if God is either unwilling or unable to prevent it. There is evil. If God exists, he is neither impotent nor malevolent. Therefore God does not exist. (W, A, I, M, E, G)
    
    4. If I buy a new car this spring or have my old car fixed, then I'll get up to Canada this summer and stop off in Duluth. I'll visit my parents if I stop off in Duluth. If I visit my parents, they'll insist on my spending the summer with them. If they insist on my spending the summer with them, I'll be there till autumn. But if I stay there till autumn, then I won't get to Canada after all! So I won't have my old car fixed. (N, F, C, D, V, I, A)

If Salome studies hard but lacks intelligence, then her efforts will be appreciated; and if her efforts are appreciated, then she will pass her courses. If Salome is intelligent, then she studies hard. Therefore Salome will pass her courses. (I, S, G, P, A)

    6. If there is a single norm for greatness of poetry, then Milton and Edgar Guest cannot both be great poets. If either Pope or Dryden is regarded as a great poet, then Wordsworth is certainly no great poet; but if Wordsworth is no great poet, then neither is Keats nor Shelley. But after all, even though Edgar Guest is not, Dryden and Keats are both great poets. Hence there is no single norm for greatness of poetry. (N, M, G, P, D, W, K, S)
    
    7. If the butler were present, he would have been seen; and if he had been seen, he would have been questioned. If he had been questioned, he would have replied; and if he had replied, he would have been heard. But the butler was not heard. If the butler was neither seen nor heard, then he must have been on duty; and if he was on duty, he must have been present. Therefore the butler was questioned. (BP S, Q, R, H, D)
    
    8. If the butler told the truth, then the window was closed when he entered the room; and if the gardener told the truth, then the automatic sprinkler system was not operating on the evening of the murder. If the butler and the gardener are both lying, then a conspiracy must exist to protect someone in the house and there would have been a little pool of water on the floor just inside the window. We know that the window could not have been closed when the butler entered the room. There was a little pool of water on the floor just inside the window. So if there is a conspiracy to protect someone in the house, then the gardener did not tell the truth. (B, W, G, S, C, P)

    9. Their chief would leave the country if she feared capture, and she would not leave
    the country unless she feared capture. If she feared capture and left the country,
    then the enemy's espionage network would be demoralized and powerless to harm
    us. If she did not fear capture and remained in the country, it would mean that she
    was ignorant of our own agents' work. If she is really ignorant of our agents' work,
    then our agents can consolidate their positions within the enemy's organization;
    and if our agents can consolidate their positions there, they will render the enemy's
    espionage network powerless to harm us. Therefore the enemy's espionage network
    will be powerless to harm us. (L, F, D, P, I, C)
    
    *10. If the investigators of extrasensory perception are regarded as honest, then consid-
    erable evidence for extrasensory perception must be admitted; and the doctrine of
    clairvoyance must be considered seriously if extrasensory perception is tentatively
    accepted as a fact. If considerable evidence for extrasensory perception is admit-
    ted, then it must be tentatively accepted as a fact and an effort must be made to
    explain it. The doctrine of clairvoyance must be considered seriously if we are
    prepared to take seriously that class of phenomena called occult; and if we are pre-
    pared to take seriously that class of phenomena called occult, a new respect must
    be paid to mediums. If we pursue the matter further, then if a new respect must
    be paid to mediums, we must take seriously their claims to communicate with
    the dead. We do pursue the matter further, but still we are practically committed
    to believing in ghosts if we take seriously the mediums' claims to communicate
    with the dead. Hence if the investigators of extrasensory perception are regarded
    as honest, we are practically committed to believing in ghosts. (H, A, C, F, E, O,

These proofs will be more difficult to construct than in preceding exercises, but they will offer greater satisfaction.

    If the president cuts Social Security benefit payments, he will lose the support of the senior citizens; and if he cuts defense spending, he will lose the support of the conservatives. If the president loses the support of either the senior citizens or the conservatives, then his influence in the Senate will diminish. But his influence in the Senate will not diminish. Therefore the president will not cut either Social Security benefits or defense spending. (B, S, D, C)

    If inflation continues, then interest rates will remain high. If inflation continues,
    then if interest rates remain high then business activity will decrease. If interest
    rates remain high, then if business activity decreases then unemployment will rise.
    So if unemployment rises, then inflation will continue. (, H, D, U)
    
    If taxes are reduced, then inflation will rise, but if the budget is balanced, then unem-
    ployment will increase. If the president keeps his campaign promises, then either taxes
    are reduced or the budget is balanced. Therefore if the president keeps his campaign
    promises, then either inflation will rise or unemployment will increase. (J [, B, U, K)

    9.11] Conditional Proof
    
    The nineteen rules of inference are complete (as we have seen in Section 9.7) in the sense
    that any valid truth-functional argument can be proved valid using just those nineteen
    rules. Some proofs, however, are long and difficult to devise. In this section we introduce
    a new rule that will shorten and simplify many proofs, the rule of Conditional Proof
    (C.P.). This rule differs from the others in having no simple formulation; it is a technique
    with which we can deduce a conditional statement by hypothetically assuming its ante-
    cedent and deducing its consequent from that assumption. The hypothetical argument
    form of a conditional proof is:
    
    p / .. q (Assumption, C.P.)
    q
    pq C.P.
    
    As we will see, we infer statement qg in a finite number of steps from the assumed
    statement p (and, usually, premises and/or inferred statements), and we conclude
    p > q. C.P. can be used to validly infer any statement that follows from the premises;
    it is not restricted to deducing only a conditional conclusion. In fact, as we will see in
    Section 9.11 (E), one can prove that a statement is a tautology using C.P. and no premises.
    
    A. Conditional Proof Justified and Explained
  - |-
    Conditional Proof (C.P.) can best be explained and justified by reference to the principle
    of Exportation and the correspondence, noted in Section 8.9 (D), between valid argument
    forms and tautologies.
    
    To every valid argument there corresponds a tautologous conditional statement
    whose antecedent is the conjunction of the argument's premises and whose consequent
    is the conclusion of that argument. Suppose an argument before us has a conditional
    conclusion, symbolized as A → C. Suppose also that we symbolize the conjunction of its
    premises as P. Call this Argument I.
    
    (P),: P
    A → C
    Argument I
    
    Argument I is valid if and only if its corresponding conditional statement
    P → (A → C) (1)
    
    is a tautology. If we can deduce the conclusion A → C from the premises conjoined in
    P by a sequence of statements deduced by means of the nineteen rules of inference, we

    some statement q, and
    finally concludes, via
    the rule "Conditional

    statement "p → q"
    (i.e., if p, then q).

    thereby prove Argument I to be valid and its associated conditional (1) to be a tautology.
    Now (1) is logically equivalent, by Exportation, to (2).
    
    (P ∧ A) → C (2)
    
    And (2) is the conditional associated with a somewhat different argument, Argument II,
    namely:
    
    (P),: P
    (P),: A
    C
    Argument II

    This second argument has as its premises all of the premises of Argument I plus an addi-
    tional premise, statement A, which is the antecedent of the conclusion of Argument I.
    And the conclusion of Argument IJ is the consequent of the conclusion of Argument I.
    Now if we deduce the conclusion of Argument II, statement C, from the premises
    conjoined in P - A by a sequence of statements deduced by means of the nineteen
    rules of inference, we thereby prove that its associated conditional statement (2) is a
    tautology. But since (2) and (1) are logically equivalent, in proving that (2) is a tau-
    tology, we have proved that (1) is a tautology, from which it follows that the origi-
    nal argument, Argument I—with one less premise and the conditional conclusion
    A > C—is valid also.
    
    In general, for any set of premises P, and for any statements A and C, Argument I is
    valid if and only if Argument II is valid. Thus, we can prove the validity of Argument I
    
    (P,): P
    ADC Argument I
    
    by adding A to the premises P of Argument I, and then deducing C by a sequence of state-
    ments deduced by means of the nineteen rules of inference. In this manner, we prove
    the validity of Argument II
    
    (P,): P
    (P,): A
    .C Argument II
    
    and thereby prove the validity of Argument I.
    This reasoning constitutes a complete justification for Conditional Proof (C.P.).
    
    B. The Conditional Proof Procedure
    
    We now exhibit the general procedure for a conditional proof. Consider the following
    argument.
    
    (P,): (AV B) D (CD)
    (P,): (DV E)DF
    ~ADFE
    
    To prove this argument valid using C.P., we first, as normally, write out the argument's
    two premises on lines 1 and 2, followed by its conclusion on the justification ledger on
    line 2, preceded by a forward slash and the therefore symbol (i.e., /.".).

    Because the conclusion is a conditional statement, we set up for a conditional proof by
    assuming the antecedent of the conditional statement A → F, namely A. We indicate that
    statement A is an assumption by placing a vertical line, called a scope line, to its left.
    
    1. (A∨B)→(C→D)
    2. (D∨E)→F [A→D]
    3. |A / .. F (Assumption, C.P.)
    
    In the justification ledger, we write " / ..," followed by the desired conclusion of the
    C.P. sub-proof, namely F, followed by "(Assumption, C.P.)" to indicate that statement A is
    the assumption of a conditional proof. Every statement deduced using that assumption will
    be within its scope, so the vertical scope line will be extended downward to show this.
    
    Although a proof of the foregoing argument using only the nineteen rules requires
    20 lines, a conditional proof is much shorter and straightforward.
    
    1. (A∨B)→(C→D)
    2. (D∨E)→F /.. A→F
    3. A / .. F (Assumption, C.P.)

    5. |C→D 1,4, M.P.
    6. |D→C 5, Com.
    7. |D 6, Simp.
    8. |D∨E 7, Add.
    9. |F 2, 8, M.P.
    10. A→F 3-9, C.P.
    
    When the statement to be deduced in the conditional proof, namely F, is deduced on
    line 9, we discharge the assumption and end the scope line for the conditional proof,
    indicating that we have completed the conditional proof of F from the two premises
    and the additional assumption, statement A. This conditional proof proves that the
    conditional statement A → F follows validly from the two premises alone. To clearly
    show this, we write statement A → F immediately below the conditional proof scope
    line. On the justification ledger we indicate the range of lines in the conditional proof,
    (lines) "3-9," and we write "C.P." to indicate that A → F was deduced by means of
    a conditional proof.
  - |-
    This conditional proof proves that if, in addition to the two true premises, statement A is also true, then F is true as well, which means that A → F (if A, then F) must be true if the two premises are true. In other words, A → F is validly inferred, by means of a conditional proof, from the two premises alone. The validity of this argument has been proved using four rules of inference and Conditional Proof (C.P.).
    
    Never forget that an assumption introduced for a conditional proof has limited scope. The vertical line is there to remind us of this. The inferences made within the scope of that assumption, for the entire duration of the conditional proof (C.P.), are restricted to that C.P. sub-proof and cannot be used outside the scope of the conditional proof (i.e., after the conditional proof is completed). For instance, on line 6, statement D → C is inferred from the two premises and the additional ("temporary") C.P. assumption, namely statement A. The conjunction D → C does not follow from the two premises alone; it follows from the conjunction of the two premises and the C.P. assumption, statement A. Since the scope of the conditional proof assumption and the conditional proof itself is indicated by the vertical scope line, that scope line terminates when the assumption is discharged and the conditional proof is completed. The conclusion of the conditional proof is then written below the conditional proof, outside of the conditional proof and its scope line.
    
    For these reasons, propositions deduced within a conditional proof—within the scope of its assumption (i.e., within the scope of its scope line)—cannot be used outside of (after) the conditional proof, for such inferred propositions do not necessarily follow from the premises alone. For instance, D ∨ E, which is inferred on line 8, cannot be used with Premise 2 to infer F on line 11 by Modus Ponens.

    The inference of F on line 11 is incorrect because it has been inferred partly from DVE, which is within the scope of the scope line (and the assumed statement A). DVE has not been inferred from the premises alone; in fact, DVE does not validly follow from the premises alone. It is because DVE does not necessarily follow from the premises alone that it cannot be used in inferences outside the scope of (i.e., after) the conditional proof and its assumption. No statement occurring to the right of the scope line can be used in an inference after the scope line has terminated (i.e., after the assumption has been discharged). One can, however, use statements occurring before and after the conditional proof after the conditional proof (i.e., below the end of the scope line). Thus, one could infer (DVE)DF on line 11 from (DVE)DF on line 2 by Material Implication, and one could infer ~FD~A on line 12 from ADF on line 10, by Transposition.

    When using the method of Conditional Proof, every original premise retains its unlimited scope all the way to the end of the proof. The original premises may be supplemented by additional assumptions, but every such assumption will have limited scope that does not extend to the end of the proof. The conclusion of a conditional proof, which is inferred from the sequence of inferences within a conditional proof, is a statement inferred from the premises, just as much as a statement inferred directly from the premises, without any application of C.P. (e.g., just as much as (~D D5 E) D F is inferred from the premises alone when it is inferred, by Material Implication, on line 11 from (D V E) D F on line 2).
    
    The method of Conditional Proof is best mastered by practice. The more proofs one executes by means of Conditional Proof, the more readily one sees how it can be employed in a variety of contexts.
    
    To that end, we now examine additional examples of Conditional Proof (C.P.), and in so doing compare the length and difficulty of proofs with and without C.P. Note first that a proof of the argument proved above in 10 lines with C.P. requires a 20-line proof if executed with only the nineteen rules of inference.

    It is essential that one masters the nineteen rules; such mastery will enable one to execute even very difficult proofs, with or without C.P. However, when we compare the 20-line proof above with the 10-line conditional proof earlier given, we see that the conditional proof is not only half the length of the other, but also that the longer proof requires three applications of Distribution and a level of insight that the conditional proof does not require. Once we assume statement A in the conditional proof, we immediately see how to execute the proof: By Addition we can infer A V B, which enables us to infer C-D. Commuting and simplifying C- D to D, enables us to infer D V E by Addition, and then infer the consequent of the conditional conclusion, namely F, by Modus Ponens.
    The flow of the conditional proof is natural, readily grasped and displayed, as the 20-line proof is not. Conditional proof does not replace the mastery of the nineteen rules, but after that mastery it is a powerful addition to our logical toolbox.
    
    Here is a valid argument, whose proof with the nineteen rules is rather difficult, requiring 18 lines.

    With C.P. we can prove this argument valid in 12 lines, as follows.

    Again, not only is the conditional proof considerably shorter than the proof using
    only the nineteen rules, the conditional proof is much more easily executed. As
    soon as we assume L → Q, we immediately see that H can be inferred from L ∧ H and L, and
    that S can be inferred from Q → S and Q. H and S can be readily conjoined, giving us the
    consequent of the conditional statement we seek to derive.
    
    C. Nested Conditional Sub-Proofs
    
    The rule of Conditional Proof can be applied inside a conditional proof, such that one
    has a nested conditional sub-proof and its scope line within a conditional proof and its
    scope line. For example, a conditional proof of validity for
    
    (P → A) ∧ (B → D) ∧ (C → D)
    (P → A) ∧ (B → D) ∧ (C → D)
    . A → (B → D) Argument III
    
    will be a proof of the validity for
    
    (P → A) ∧ (B → D) ∧ (C → D)
    (P → A) ∧ (B → D) ∧ (C → D)
    (P → A)
    
    B → (C → D) Argument IV
    
    and since the latter itself has a conditional conclusion, it can be given a conditional proof
    by proving the validity of

    "D Argument V
    
    If A D (B D D) validly follows from the original two premises of Argument III, we  
    can prove this by assuming A and deducing B 5D D in a conditional proof. Once we  
    have begun this first conditional proof, we can further assume B in a second, nested  
    
    Conditional Proof

    conditional sub-proof and prove that D validly follows. This double conditional proof,  
    consisting of a main conditional proof and a C.P. sub-proof, is set up as follows.

    2. BO(CDD) /..AD(BDD)
    
    3. A / .. BD D (Assumption, C.P.)
    4 | B / .. D (Assumption, C.P.)
    
    Each use of C.P. must be indicated by its own vertical scope line. For example, the verti-
    cal scope line beside assumption B is itself to the right of a scope line, which indicates
    that the scope of the conditional proof with assumption B is itself within the scope of
    a different conditional (or indirect') proof. Each conditional proof is also indicated, in
    the justification ledger, by its own slant line (forward slash: /), a "therefore" sign (..), the
    statement to be deduced from the stated assumption, and the notation "(Assumption,
    C.P.)" or "(A.C.P.)." The complete double conditional proof of Argument HI above, con-
    taining a nested C.P. sub-proof, is as follows.

    In executing the second, nested conditional proof we prove that D validly follows from
    the four premises in Argument V. This proof demonstrates that Argument IV is valid—
    i.e., that B D D validly follows from the three premises of Argument IV—by proving
    that if the original two premises of Argument III are true, and A is also true, then if B (is
    true), then D (is true) (i.e., B D D follows). This nested conditional proof completes the
    first conditional proof, since we have proved that if the two original premises are true,
    and we further assume the truth of statement A, B D D validly follows. The main con-
    ditional proof and its C.P. sub-proof prove the validity of Argument HI by proving that
    A D (B D D) validly follows from the original two premises of Argument III.
    
    The proof of this argument with only the nineteen rules is also only 10 lines long,
    but it is not nearly as easy to execute as the conditional proof.

    9.11 Conditional Proof
    
    These two proofs show that the power of conditional proof resides not only in the
    shortening of proofs. Here the two proofs are the same length, but whereas the second
    proof requires insight or perseverance and a certain mastery of Exportation in both direc-
    tions, the conditional proof is very much obvious. Once one has made the two assump-
    tions for the two conditional proofs, four automatic applications of Modus Ponens (M.P.)
    later one is discharging both assumptions and completing the proof.
    
    Another example of an argument that can be proved valid by multiple, nested appli-
    cations of Conditional Proof is the following argument.

    However, with C.P. in hand, we can execute the proof far more efficiently. Indeed,  
    if we set up for C.P, and assume statement D, the antecedent of the conditional conclu-  
    sion D 5 I, we should immediately see that the desired statement I occurs only in H 5 I,  
    as the consequent of a conditional. Since we have H as a premise, if we can infer H 5 I,  
    we will be able to infer I by M.P. To derive H > I from Premise 2 by M.P., we need to first  
    derive the antecedent of the second premise, namely F 5 G. To this end, we set up for a  
    second, nested C.P. by assuming the antecedent of F 5 G (i.e., F).  
    
    Please Note: Now that we fully understand the nature of a Conditional Proof  
    assumption, we Shall henceforth abbreviate "Assumption, C.P." as "A.C.P."

    Once we derive F > G by C.P., we infer H > I by M.P., and then derive statement J from HD I and H by M.-P., thus concluding our original conditional proof with the desired conclusion, DD I.

    This proof demonstrates the power of C.P. when combined with a firm understanding
    of proof technique. In this case, we realize that we should set up for a second, nested
    conditional proof because we have looked for the needed statement J in the premises.
    
    D. Conditional Proofs for Arguments Whose Conclusions
    Are Not Conditional Statements
    
    Conditional Proof can be used to prove the validity of all arguments** whose conclusions
    are not conditional statements. Arguments whose conclusions are logically equivalent
    to conditional statements are obvious examples. Consider the following two arguments.
    
    (P,): (AV B) D (CD)
    
    (P,): (DV E)DF
    AVE
    
    (P,): (AV B) D (C-D)
    
    (P,): (DV E) DF
    ~(A-~F)
    
    Since both ~A V F and ~(A - ~ F) are logically equivalent to A 5 F, proofs of these arguments
    can be constructed by extending the 10-line proof appearing in Section 9.11 (B), above,
    by one and three inferences, respectively. Thus, a proof of the first argument above is:

    And a proof of the second argument above is exactly two lines longer:

    13. ~(A.-~F) 12, De M.  
    
    These two proofs exhibit the utility and power of Conditional Proof. At any point  
    in a proof," if we wish to infer a disjunction or a negated conjunction, we can set up  
    for conditional proof. For example, in the last argument proved just above, if we know  
    our logical equivalences, namely, the rules of replacement, we immediately know that  
    
    ~(A+~F)  
    
    is logically equivalent to  
    ~A\VF  
    
    by Double Negation and De Morgan's theorem, and that ~A V F is logically equivalent to  
    ADF  
    
    by Material Implication. Recognizing these logical equivalences, we set up for condi-  
    tional proof to prove the conditional statement A > F, and once we have validly deduced  
    A > F, we infer ~A V F by Material Implication, and then ~ (A - ~ F) by Double Negation  
    and De Morgan's Theorem.  
    
    Consider the following argument.

    However, a conditional proof of this argument is much more easily executed. Once  
    we set up for C.P., we immediately see that the consequent of the conditional conclusion  
    is ~S V E. If the conclusion were J D (S D E), we would immediately think of setting up  
    for a double conditional proof as follows:
    
    1. [J V A D I S V K) D C-I-Y)]
    2. (-I V ~M) D E J D (~S V E)
    3. J /:. S D E (A.C.P.)
    4. ||S / :. E (A.C.P.)
    
    If we know our rules of replacement, however, we see that the consequent of the con-  
    dential conclusion is ~ S $ V E, and we know that ~S V E is logically equivalent (by Material  
    Implication) to a conditional statement, namely S D E. Thus, we set up for a nested C.P.  
    sub-proof by assuming S and setting out to derive E.
    
    1. [J V A D I S V K) D C-I-Y)]
    2. (-I V ~M) D E J D (~S V E)
    3. [J /.. S D E (A.C.P.)

    13. J O (S D E) 3-12, CP.
    14. J O (S V E) 13, Impl.
  - |-
    When we infer E on line 11 by M.P., we discharge the second C.P. assumption and
    infer S D E on line 12. Since S$ D E is the conclusion of our first conditional proof, we
    immediately discharge our first C.P. assumption and infer J D (S D E) on line 13. Recall
    that we set up for a nested C.P. proof with the knowledge that J 5 (S D E) is logically
    equivalent to J > (~S V E). Hence, we need only infer J D (~S V E) on line 14 and our
    
    proof is complete.
    
    Lastly, conditional proof is very useful in proving the validity of arguments whose
    conclusions are biconditional statements. For example, the following argument has a
    
    biconditional as its conclusion.
    
    (P,): (CV D) D (EDF)
    (P,): [ED E-F] DG
    (P,): GD [(-HV ~~H) 9 (C-H)
    
    ". C=G
    
    As we know, the biconditional
    
    C=G
    
    is logically equivalent to the following conjunction of two conditional statements
    
    (CDG)-(GD ©).
    
    Thus, to deduce the biconditional we can deduce the two conditional statements
    by two consecutive conditional proofs and then conjoin their conclusions using
    
    Conjunction.

    Conditional Proof
    
    Chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    The structure of this proof is two separate and consecutive conditional proofs, followed
    by the conjunction of their respective conclusions. It is important to note that the infer-
    ence of (C → D → G) → (G → C) on line 19 does not violate scope restrictions: C → D → G is inferred
    on line 9, after a conditional proof, and G → C is inferred on line 18, after the second main
    conditional proof. Once these two conditional statements are conjoined on line 19, the
    conclusion of the argument, C = G, is deduced on line 20 by Material Equivalence.
    
    As we have seen in this section, Conditional Proof is a powerful and highly flexible
    addition to our logical toolbox. When C.P. is added to the nineteen rules of inference,
    we can more easily and efficiently prove the validity of a variety of arguments. Moreover,
    C.P. can be employed anytime we wish to deduce a conditional statement, either for its
    own sake or in order to deduce a biconditional.

    E. Conditional Proofs of Tautologies  
    
    Conditional proof can also be used to prove that a statement is a tautology. In this case,  
    since one is not proving the validity of an argument, one proves a tautology from no  
    premises. Instead, we assume the antecedent of the desired statement, deduce its conse-  
    quent, and infer the conditional tautology. In proving that the consequent must be true  
    if the antecedent is true, we prove that the conditional statement is a tautology, because  
    it cannot be false.  
    
    9.11 Conditional Proof  
    
    Consider the following conditional tautology.  
    (QQIDRD[PIQIDCPOR)  
    
    This statement is proved tautologous by the following conditional proof.

    We assume Q 5 R in the main conditional proof, and then immediately assume P D Q
    in a second, nested C.P. sub-proof, since P 5 Q is the antecedent of the consequent of
    the tautology to be proved. We then infer P D R by H.S., discharge the second assump-
    tion and conclude the conditional sub-proof by inferring (P D Q) D (PD R), and then
    immediately discharge the first main assumption and infer (QD R) D [((PD Q) D (PD R)
    by C.P.
    
    In Section 9.12 (F), we will see that conditional proof is the most efficient way to
    prove conditional tautologies.

    Indirect proof
    
    A proof that assumes,
    for the sake of the
    proof, the negation
    (e.g., ~p) of the
    statement (e.g., p)
    
    that is to be proved,
    and then derives a
    contradiction from that
    assumption alone or
    from the conjunction
    of that assumption
    
    and premises. When
    
    a contradiction
    
    is deduced, the
    assumption is
    discharged and
    
    the negation of
    
    the assumption is
    deductively inferred.
    For example, if ~ p is
    assumed on its own
    scope line, then a
    contradiction of the
    form q- ~q is deduced;
    then the assumption
    
    is discharged, and the
    negation of the original
    assumption, namely p, is
    deduced.
    
    9.12] Indirect Proof
    
    In this section we introduce and explain Indirect Proof (I.P.), a second very powerful
    method of proof. In an indirect proof, we assume a statement, ~p (or p), deduce a con-
    tradiction of the form q- ~q, and validly infer the negation of our assumption, namely
    p (or ~p). The two hypothetical argument forms of an indirect proof are:
    
    ~p / (Assumption, I.P.) p / (Assumption, I.P.)
    q-~q q:-~q
    Pp I.P. ~p I.P.
    
    An indirect proof of validity is indirect because, rather than proceeding directly from
    premises to a conclusion by valid inferences, we proceed indirectly to a conclusion by
    way of a contradiction. The deduction of a contradiction is essential in an indirect proof,
    whereas no contradiction is derived in a direct proof.
    
    A. Indirect Proof of Validity Justified and Explained
    
    The method of indirect proof can be used to prove the validity of any valid argument.
    To understand why this is the case, we must recall that a valid argument cannot have all
    true premises and a false conclusion. Thus, an argument
    
    is valid if and only if the conjunction of its premises and the negation of its conclusion
    (i.e., the falsity of its conclusion)
    
    (P1 ∧ P2 ∧ ... ∧ Pn) ∧ ~C

    It is a contradiction. In this fact lies the justification of indirect proof. If we assume the falsity
    of an argument's conclusion (i.e., its negation) and validly infer an explicit contradiction
    from the argument's premises and that assumption, we thereby prove that the argument
    is valid, for the derived contradiction proves that the argument cannot have all true
    premises and a false conclusion.

    To fully understand how Indirect Proof (I.P.) proves the validity of any argument, we
    need to understand that if an argument is valid, the conjunction of its premises and the
    negation of its conclusion—(P, - P,) - ~C—can be a contradiction in three distinct ways.
    
    (A) (P,-P,)-~C ~C contradicts P,-P,. | Consistent premises and a

    (B) (P| - P,)-~C ~C isa contradiction. | Conclusion is a tautology
    
    is a contradiction because
    
    (C) (P,-P,)-~C P,-P,  isacontradiction. Premises are inconsistent
    is a contradiction because
    
    The conjunction (P, - P,) -~C can be a contradiction in three distinct ways because argu-
    ments can be valid in three distinct ways:
    
    (A) A valid argument with consistent premises and a contingent conclusion can have
    all true premises, and it can have a false conclusion, but it cannot have both all true
    premises and a false conclusion, because the truth of its conclusion is contained
    within (or entailed by) the truth of its premises (Argument VI, below).
    
    (B) A valid argument with a tautological conclusion cannot have all true premises and
    a false conclusion because it cannot have a false conclusion (Argument VI, below).
    
    (C) A valid argument with inconsistent premises cannot have all true premises and
    a false conclusion because it cannot have all true premises (Argument VIII, below).
    
    Let us look at each of these in turn to see how an indirect proof validly infers a contradic-
    tion in each case, thereby proving the validity of an argument.
  - |-
    Consider, first, Case (A) above. Recall that contradictory statements cannot both be true. If, therefore, we add a contingent statement to a consistent set of premises and are able to deduce a contradiction, the negation of that further assumption must validly follow from the premises. Take, for example, the following valid argument.
    
    (P,):FDG Argument VI
    (P,): F
    .G
    
    If we add, as an additional assumption, the negation of the conclusion, ~G, we are able to deduce a contradiction as follows:
    
    1. FDG
    
    2. -F /..G
    
    3. ~G / (Assumption I.P.)
    4 ~F 1, 3, M.T.
    
    5 F.~F 2, 4, Conj.
    
    This contradiction, F - ~F, is deducible from the conjunction of the two premises and the I.P. assumption ~ G, because ~ G contradicts the original two consistent prem-
    ises. That ~G contradicts the two premises is most evident in the fact that G could be
    (directly) inferred on line 4 by M.P., enabling the derivation of a different contradic-
    tion, namely G- ~G.
    
    1. FDG
    
    2. -F /..G
    
    3. ~G / (Assumption I.P.)
    4. G 1, 2, M.P.
    
    5. G:~G 4, 3, Conj.
    
    9.12
    
    Indirect Proof
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    This derivation explicitly shows that the deduction of F - ~F is possible in the first case
    only because G validly follows from the original two consistent premises—i.e., only
    because ~G contradicts the conjunction of the premises, (F D G) - F.*° Thus, on line 6
    we may validly infer G, the negation of our I.P. assumption ~G, from the original two
    premises by Indirect Proof.
    
    6. G 3-5, IP
    
    The justification just given applies to the vast majority of valid arguments in this book,
    whose contingent conclusions validly follow from consistent premises.
  - |-
    Consider, next, Case (B) from above. Any argument with a tautological conclusion is  
    valid: it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion because its conclusion cannot  
    be false.?' For example, the following argument is valid because, although its consistent  
    premises can all be true, its tautological conclusion cannot be false.
    
    (P,):FDG Argument VII  
    (P,): F  
    . HV ~H  
    
    If we augment the premises by adding, as an additional assumption, the negation of this  
    tautological conclusion, we can deduce a contradiction as follows.
    
    1. FDG  
    
    2. -F . AV ~H  
    
    3. ~(HV ~H) / (Assumption I.P.)

    5. ~~H.~H 4, Com.  
    
    6. H.~H 5, D.N.  
    
    Because we have deduced a contradiction from consistent premises and an additional  
    assumption, we may validly infer the negation of our assumption, namely H V ~ H.
    
    7,.HV~H ~~ 3-6, LP.  
    
    Unlike Argument VI, the additional I.P. assumption ~(H V ~H) does not contradict  
    the original two consistent premises. Rather, ~(H V ~H) enables the deduction of a con-  
    tradiction of the form q - ~ gq because ~ (HV ~ H) is itselfa contradiction. The negation of a  
    tautology is a contradiction, and so if we add the negation of any tautology to consistent  
    (or inconsistent) premises, we will be able to deduce a contradiction, of the paradigmatic  
    form q - ~q, from the negated tautology alone. We have here deduced the contradiction  
    H.~H from the I.P. assumption ~ (H V ~H) alone, which shows that the negation of this  
    assumption, H V ~H, follows validly from the consistent premises.
    
    What Arguments VI and VII show is that whenever an additional assumption is  
    added to consistent premises and a contradiction is deduced, the negation of that addi-  
    tional assumption follows validly from those premises. This justifies the use of I.P. for all  
    valid arguments with consistent premises.
  - |-
    This leaves us needing to justify, lastly, the use of I.P. in proving the validity of
    arguments with inconsistent premises. The requisite justification for Case (C), above,
    is easily provided, for as we know from Section 9.10, any argument with inconsistent
    premises is valid: an argument with inconsistent premises cannot have all true premises
    and a false conclusion because it cannot have all true premises. Consider, for example,
    the following argument:
    
    (P,): FDG Argument VIII
    (P,): F
    (P,): ~G
    
    We can add as an additional I.P. assumption the negation of the conclusion, namely ~ R,
    and deduce a contradiction as follows.
    
    1. FDG
    
    2. -F
    
    3. ~G /..R
    
    4. ~R / (Assumption, I.P.)
    5. ~F 1, 3, M.T.
    
    6. F.~F 2, 5, Conj.
    
    Having deduced a contradiction from inconsistent premises, we may validly infer the
    negation of our assumption, namely R.
    
    7. R 4-6, I.P.
    
    In this case, where the premises themselves are inconsistent, we can add the negation of
    any statement and deduce a contradiction, not because the additional assumption con-
    tradicts the premises (as in Argument VI) and not because the additional assumption is
    itself a contradiction (as in Argument VII), but because the premises themselves are
    inconsistent. Since any statement, such as R, follows from inconsistent premises, we may
    assume the negation of R, namely ~ R, deduce a contradiction from the premises alone,
    and validly infer R.
  - |-
    This completes our detailed justification of indirect proof. We have shown that if we  
    add an assumption ~ p (or p) to a set of premises and derive a contradiction, we are justi-  
    fied in inferring the negation of our assumption, p (or ~ p) whether or not the premises are  
    logically consistent. If the premises are inconsistent (Argument VIII), any statement  
    (e.g., R) validly follows. If the premises are consistent, either the additional assump-  
    tion contradicts the consistent premises (Argument VI), in which case its negation  
    validly follows from the premises, or the additional assumption is itself a contradic-  
    tion (Argument VII), in which case its negation, a tautology, validly follows from the  
    premises.
    
    B. The Indirect Proof Procedure
    
    We now exhibit the general procedure for an indirect proof in detail.
    
    An indirect proof of validity is initiated by writing out, as an additional assumed prem-  
    ise to the right of a new scope line,"® the negation, ~p, of the statement we wish to  
    deduce, p (or we assume p, if we wish to deduce ~ p""). We can assume the negation of the  
    argument's conclusion, or we can, at any time, assume the negation of a statement we  
    
    Indirect Proof  
     chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    wish to deduce. If we can derive an explicit contradiction of the form q - ~q from the set  
    of premises thus augmented, we can validly infer the negation of the I.P. assumption. In  
    the case in which the I.P. assumption is the negation of the argument's conclusion, we  
    thereby prove that the argument with which we began is valid. The method is illustrated  
    with an indirect proof of the following argument:
    
    1 AD(B-C)  
    2. (BVD)DE  
    3. DVA /-E  
    
    In the very next line we begin our I.P. proof by writing out our I.P. assumption ~E, the  
    negation of the conclusion, in the statement column, to the immediate right of a new  
    scope line. Now that we fully understand the nature of an Indirect Proof assumption, we  
    shall henceforth abbreviate "Assumption I.P" as "A.I.P."
    
    4. |~E / (ALB)

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:
    
    ---
    
    In the justification ledger, we write "/ (A.LP.)" to indicate that statement ~E is an LP. assumption. With the now enlarged set of premises we can, using the established rules of inference, deduce an explicit contradiction, and then validly infer the desired conclusion E.

    The second last line of the proof contains an explicit contradiction, B → ~B, which is a demonstration of the absurdity to which we were led by assuming ~E in line 4. This contradiction demonstrates that E validly follows from the premises by showing that the conjunction of the premises and ~E is a contradiction. The indirect proof is completed by discharging the I.P. assumption (i.e., terminating the scope line) and inferring the negation of the I.P. assumption, namely E, on the last line of the proof. In the justification ledger, we cite the interval of lines of the indirect proof (i.e., in this case, lines "4-13"), followed by "T.P."

    The method of indirect proof—also called "reductio ad absurdum" because we are
    reduced to absurdity when we deduce a contradiction—strengthens our proof methods by
    making it possible, in some circumstances, to prove validity more quickly than would
    be possible without it. We can illustrate this by first constructing a direct formal proof
    of the validity of an argument, and then demonstrating the validity of that same argu-
    ment using an indirect proof. In the following example, the direct proof is on the left
    and requires 15 lines; the indirect proof is on the right and requires only 8 lines. As with
    conditional proof, a scope line is used to indicate the scope of an indirect proof.

    Indirect Proof  
    
    Chapter 9 Methods of Deduction  
    
    As with a conditional sub-proof nested in a conditional proof, one must always  
    observe the scope restrictions of assumptions (and their associated scope lines): one  
    cannot use an assumed or inferred statement from a conditional proof or indirect proof  
    outside its scope (i.e., after the assumption has been discharged). Thus, in the foregoing  
    proof, we cannot use the inferred statement M > D (line 6) after the assumption of the  
    indirect proof has been discharged on line 14. For example, we cannot infer  
    
    1S. MD V INCORRECT 7,2, HS.
  - |-
    The statement M D D was inferred on line 6 from the premises and two additional assumptions. MD D does not validly follow from the premises alone; it follows from the premises and the I.P. assumption C.*! It is because M D D does not (necessarily) follow from the premises alone that it cannot be used in an inference after its I.P. assumption has been discharged on line 13. The only statements that can appear in the statement column without a scope line beside them are premises and statements validly inferred from the premises (i.e., including statements validly inferred from other statements already inferred from the premises alone). Thus, M > V cannot appear in the statement column without a scope line beside it because it has been inferred from a premise (D > V, on line 2) and a statement that was not inferred from the premises alone (i.e., M > D, on line 6).

    If a sharp fall in the prime rate of interest produces a rally in the stock market, then inflation is sure to come soon. But if a drop in the money supply produces a sharp fall in the prime rate of interest, then early inflation is equally certain. So inflation will soon be upon us. (F, R, I, D)

    D. Indirect Proofs of Tautologies
    
    Indirect proof can be used to prove that a statement is tautologous, for if a statement is a tautology, its negation is a contradiction. Suppose, for example, we wish to prove that
    
    G ∨ ~G
    
    is a tautology. In such a case, we prove that G ∨ ~G is a tautology by assuming its negation and validly inferring an explicit contradiction.

    Here, in our I.P. proof, we assume ~(G V ~G) and validly infer from it the explicit contradiction G - ~G. This proves that the initial I.P. assumption is a contradiction, from which it follows that its negation, G V ~G, is a tautology. As in any other indirect proof, once we deduce an explicit contradiction, as we have on line 4, we discharge the I.P. assumption and validly infer the negation of the I.P. assumption.
    
    Similarly, to prove that
    
    [(M>Q)-M]5Q
    
    is a tautology, we proceed as follows.

    E. The Redundancy of Indirect Proof
    
    Although indirect proofs are a little shorter, it is worth noting that once conditional
    proof has been added to the nineteen rules of inference, indirect proof is redundant.
    To see this, consider the following argument.
    
    (P,): AD (B-C)
    (P,): (BV D) DE
    (P,): DV A
    
    This argument can be proved valid by means of C.P. The key to such a proof is the fact,
    discussed in Section 9.10, that one can deduce any statement from a contradiction using
    Addition and Disjunctive Syllogism.

    Once we arrive at contradictory statements B (line 11) and ~B (line 12), we sim-
    ply infer B V E using Addition and then E, from B V E and ~B, using Disjunctive
    Syllogism. We here end our conditional proof by discharging our assumption, ending
    the scope line, and inferring ~ E > E on line 15. We do not yet have the desired conclu-
    sion, but we are close. Using Material Implication, we infer ~~E V E, then by Double
    Negation we infer E V E, and, finally, by Tautology, we infer the conclusion of the
    argument, E.
    
    An indirect proof for this argument would infer B - ~B on line 13, and then dis-
    charge the assumption and complete the indirect proof on line 14 with the inferred
    conclusion E. Thus, an indirect proof can be viewed as an abbreviation of a conditional
    proof: in both cases, a sub-proof is executed that enables the inference of the negation
    of the assumed statement (or a statement logically equivalent to that negation*'). In all
    
    Indirect Proof
    
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    similar cases of indirect proofs and their conditional proof surrogates, the conditional
    proof is four lines longer.
    
    Thus, although Indirect Proof of validity is not strictly needed given the nineteen rules
    of inference and Conditional Proof, Indirect Proof permits shorter proofs than correspond-
    ing conditional proofs. For this reason, we add Indirect Proof to our logical toolkit.
    
    F. Conditional Proofs of Tautologies Revisited
    
    Indirect proofs of tautologies are typically the shortest and easiest proofs of tautologies.
    However, as Section 9.11 (E) indicates, a conditional proof is usually more efficient than
    an indirect proof when the tautology to be proved is a conditional statement. For exam-
    ple, in Section 9.12 (D) above, we proved that
    
    [(M5 Q)-MJ]5Q
    
    is a tautology in 13 lines using IP. The tautologousness of this conditional statement is
    proved in only 6 lines using C.P.

    Similarly, the tautology
    QI RD[PIQIPOR),
    
    which was proved in 5 lines using C.P. in Section 9.11 (E), requires a 16-line proof using
    IP. The reader is encouraged to execute the indirect proof and compare the two proofs.*
    
    G. The Statements of a Proof of Validity
    
    Now that we have added C.P. and I.P. to our logical toolbox, we can state with complete-
    ness that a formal proof of validity is a sequence of statements, each of which is either
    
    e a premise,
    
    e a statement validly inferred from the premises,
    
    e an assumption of limited scope,
    
    e a statement validly inferred within a conditional proof, or
    e a statement validly inferred within an indirect proof.
    
    A statement inferred in a proof of validity by means of C.P. or I.P.—i.e., the conclu-
    sion of a C.P. or LP. proof of validity—is a statement validly inferred from the premises.*
    Thus, every statement in a proof of validity that is not adjacent to a scope line is either
    a premise or a statement validly inferred from the premises.
    9.13. Sound Arguments and Demonstrative Arguments Distinguished
    
    Sound Arguments and Demonstrative
    Arguments Distinguished
    
    In this chapter, we have provided a natural deduction proof technique for valid argu-
    ments of Propositional Logic. Any valid argument of Propositional Logic can be proved
    valid using the nineteen rules of inference (with or without conditional proof and indi-
    rect proof). This proof technique is indeed natural: it mirrors our truth-functional reason-
    ing, and the manner in which we establish the truth of truth-functional statements by
    validly inferring them from other true truth-functional statements.
    
    Validity is crucial in all of this.

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    Recall that a valid deductive argument is an argument that cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion. From this definition it follows that if a valid deductive argument has all true premises, it must have a true conclusion. When we actually do establish the truth of a statement by deducing it from other true statements, we validly infer a true contingent statement from one or more other true contingent statements. Such an argument is both valid and sound.
    
    However, as we have partially seen in Section 9.10, not all valid arguments can establish the truth of their conclusions. In this section we explain this situation in a little more detail, and we also explain how some sound arguments cannot establish the truth of their conclusions.
    
    In Section 9.10, we considered the following argument.
    
    Today is Sunday.
    Today is not Sunday.
    Therefore the moon is made of green cheese.
    
    We symbolized this argument as:
    
    (P,): S Argument IX
    (P,): ~S
    
    Argument IX is valid because it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, and this is so because it cannot have all true premises. As we noted in Section 9.10, and in Section 9.12 (Argument VIII), if a set of premises is inconsistent, those premises will validly yield any conclusion, no matter how irrelevant. However, as we also noted in Section 9.10, an argument that is valid because its premises are inconsistent cannot be sound, tor if its premises are inconsistent, they cannot possibly be all true. It follows that a valid argument with inconsistent premises cannot establish any conclusion to be true, because at least one of its premises must be false.
    
    There are, however, other valid arguments that are sound, but which do not and cannot establish the truth of their conclusions. Consider, for example, the following argument.
    
    Paris is the capital of France.
    Therefore, either New York is the capital of England or New York is not the capital of England.
    
    Demonstrative
    argument
    
    A sound argument with
    a contingent conclusion.
    
    This argument may be symbolized as follows.
    
    (P,): P Argument X
    .NV-+-N
  - |-
    Note first that this argument is valid. It is valid because, like Argument VII in Section 9.12, it has a tautological conclusion. Any argument with a tautological conclusion is valid because it cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, and this is because it cannot have a false conclusion.
    
    The second thing to note is that, like a valid argument with inconsistent premises, the premise of Argument X is irrelevant to its conclusion, for there is no simple statement that is a component of both the premise and the conclusion. Thus, Argument X's premise does not and cannot establish the truth of its conclusion.
    
    Third, unlike a valid argument with inconsistent premises, Argument X is sound. Its premise is (contingently) true, and its conclusion is true because tautologies are (necessarily) true. Any argument with a tautological conclusion can be sound, depending on whether or not its premises happen to be true.
    
    Fourth, and most importantly, sound arguments with tautological conclusions, such as Argument X, do not and cannot establish the truth of their conclusions. A tautology is not true because it follows necessarily from true premises, and it is not true because it corresponds to a state of affairs in reality. A tautology is true no matter how reality is constituted, and for that reason tautological conclusions tell us nothing about reality.
    
    It is of the utmost importance that we distinguish sound arguments with tautological conclusions from sound arguments with contingent conclusions. If the conclusion of a sound argument is a contingent statement, that conclusion speaks truly of reality. The great utility of sound arguments with contingent conclusions—which we here call demonstrative arguments—is that they establish the truth of contingent statements, and thereby persuade us of the truth of statements that we do not know to be true by direct and personal observation.
    
    Consider, for example, the following sound argument.
    
    If Bruce Rauner is Governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner has the constitutional authority to veto bills passed by the Illinois legislature.
    
    Bruce Rauner is Governor of Illinois.
    
    Therefore, Bruce Rauner has the constitutional authority to veto bills passed by the Illinois legislature.
    
    This argument may be symbolized as follows.
    
    (P,):ROV Argument XI
    (P,): R
    .V
  - |-
    Since this sound argument has a contingent conclusion (and consistent premises, like Argument VI in Section 9.12), it is a demonstrative argument with a true contingent conclusion. True contingent statements correspond to reality; we learn about reality by learning that a contingent statement is true. For example, someone who knows only that her Illinois neighbor is Bruce Rauner and that he is the Governor of Illinois, learns something about her neighbor when she learns that the first premise of Argument XI is true: she learns that her neighbor, Bruce, has the constitutional authority to veto bills passed by the Illinois legislature.
    
    The power of demonstrative arguments is that they demonstrate or prove their contingent conclusions to be true. For this reason, we can and do learn a great deal from them. Demonstrative arguments are sometimes important and influential.
    
    These considerations yield a very important conclusion for our logical considerations. Logic is the study of correct versus incorrect reasoning, where, in the case of Deductive Logic, "correct" means "valid." What we have here seen is that there are two types of valid arguments that cannot be demonstrative:
    
    (1) A valid argument with inconsistent premises is unsound and, therefore, cannot be demonstrative.
    
    (2) A valid argument with a tautological conclusion cannot be demonstrative because its conclusion cannot convey any contingent, real world content.
    
    If our aim is to know how reality is, we should not be persuaded by a sound argument whose conclusion is a tautology. Nor should we be persuaded by a valid argument whose premises are inconsistent. Instead, we should consider only arguments that can be demonstrative, only valid arguments with consistent premises and contingent conclusions (e.g., Argument XI and Argument VI).
    
    Summary
    
    In this chapter we explained various methods with which the validity or invalidity of deductive arguments may be proved.
    
    In Section 9.1 we introduced and explained the notion of a formal proof of validity, and we explained how one can prove the validity of a valid argument by a sequence of valid inferences in accordance with rules of inference.
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:
    
    ---
    
    In Section 9.2 we examined in detail the elementary valid argument forms that constitute the first nine rules of inference, and illustrated their use in simple arguments.
    
    In Section 9.3 we illustrated the ways in which the elementary valid argument forms can be used to build formal proofs of validity.
    
    In Section 9.4 we began the process of constructing formal proofs of validity, using only the first nine rules of inference.
    
    In Section 9.5 we illustrated the ways in which the first nine rules of inference can be used to construct more extended formal proofs of validity.
    
    In Section 9.6 we introduced the general rule of replacement, and expanded the rules of inference by adding ten logical equivalences, each of which permits us to infer from a statement the result of replacing all or part of that statement by a statement logically equivalent to the statement replaced.
    
    In Section 9.7 we discussed the features of the system of natural deduction that contains our nineteen rules of inference.
    
    In Section 9.8 we began the enterprise of building formal proofs of validity using all nineteen rules of inference: nine elementary valid argument forms, and ten logical equivalences permitting replacement.

    Chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    In Section 9.9 we explained and illustrated the Shorter Truth-Table Technique for determining validity and invalidity.
    
    In Section 9.10 we discussed inconsistency, explaining why any argument with inconsistent premises cannot be sound, but will be valid.
    
    In Section 9.11 we explained and illustrated the rule of Conditional Proof (C.P.).
    
    In Section 9.12 we explained and illustrated the method of Indirect Proof (I.P.).
    
    In Section 9.13 we explained the important difference between sound arguments and demonstrative arguments. Since only demonstrative arguments establish the truth of their conclusions, if we want to know how reality is, we should consider only valid arguments with consistent premises and contingent conclusions.
    
    End Notes
    
    The first nine rules of inference, each an elementary valid argument form, are presented in Section 9.2.
    
    See Section 9.12 (G) for a detailed statement of the components of a formal proof of validity.
    In one very important sense, a formal proof of validity, such as the one just given, completes an argument by making valid reasoning fully explicit and completely rigorous or gap-free.

    If the conclusion is a tautology, it will not be possible to make the conclusion false; but in that
    case, the argument is valid, for if the conclusion cannot be false, the argument cannot have all
    true premises and a false conclusion. Similarly, if the premises are logically inconsistent, it will
    not be possible to make the premises all true; but in that case, the argument is valid, for if the
    premises cannot all be true, the argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion.
    See Section 9.10 and especially Section 9.13 for a discussion of validity, soundness, and demon-
    strativeness, especially in connection with tautological conclusions and inconsistent premises.
    It is instructive to construct the complete truth table for this argument and see that this line
    is in fact the second line of the complete, 16-line truth table. See Section 8.7, where this argu-
    ment form was tested using the CTTM.
    
    Here we abbreviate three false conjunctions as T - F (true and false), F - T (false and true), and
    F . F (false and false). This abbreviation method will be used throughout our discussion of the
    STTT. So, e.g., we will speak of a disjunction as true in three ways: T V T, TV F and FY T.
    Hereafter, when we speak of the number of ways in which a compound statement can be true
    (or false), we mean the number of combinations of truth values for its constituent simple state-
    ments that make that compound statement true (or false).
  - |-
    In Section 9.9 (D), we will apply the STTT to arguments with multiply false conclusions (i.e.,
    conclusions false for multiple truth-value combinations) and show how a correct answer to
    the Step 1 question sometimes directs us to execute Steps 2, 3, and 4.
    
    A good logician is a lazy logician! We always aim to prove validity or invalidity in the fewest
    possible steps.
    
    If we did not follow Maxim IV, and instead tried to make Premise 2 true, we would have made
    G V H false in Premise 2 by making both G and H false. If G and H are false in Premise 1, since
    E is true, the conditional (E V F) > (G - H) would be false. This would prove that the argument
    cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, which proves that the argument is valid.
    
    9.13. Sound Arguments and Demonstrative Arguments Distinguished
    
    13 In proving that the argument cannot have a false conclusion and all true premises, although
    we have not constructed the complete truth table for this argument, we have proved that
    that complete truth table does not have a line in which the premises are all true and the con-
    clusion is false.
    
    14 The STTT is more efficient than the CTTM for all of the arguments in Introduction to Logic.
    
    15 For many shorter truth tables we will not have room for guide columns in this book. We
    encourage the reader to always have and use guide columns in shorter truth tables.
    
    16 If no premise is true in fewer ways than the conclusion is false, we will not need to consider
    multiple false conclusions if, for the first false conclusion, all of the premises are true. In
    that and only that case, we do not need to consider any of the other false conclusions, since
    we prove that the argument is invalid using the truth-value assignments for the first false
    conclusion.
  - |-
    17 In cases such as this one, where the premises are not all true on forced truth-value assignments
    for all possible false conclusions, the fact that an argument does not have all true premises for
    any false conclusion proves that the argument cannot have all true premises for any false con-
    clusion. There are only four lines in the 32-line truth table (lines 9-12) in which Premise 1
    and Premise 2 are true (i.e., when T is true, U is false, and V is true), and only in two of these
    cases (lines 10 and 11) is the conclusion false. Our shorter truth table exhibits and exam-
    ines these two truth-value combinations in the complete truth table (i.e., lines 10 and 11).
    It shows that in the only two cases where the conclusion is false and Premises 1 and 2 are
    true, Premise 3 is false.

    22 For definiteness, we specify that the conjunction has its conjuncts associated to the left, that
    is, if the premises are P1, P2, and P3, the conjunction is (P1 ∧ P2) ∧ P3. If there is a fourth premise, P4,
    the conjunction is [(P1 ∧ P2) ∧ P3] ∧ P4, and so on.

    25 A conditional proof sub-proof can be executed at any point in a proof.
  - |-
    26 The truth of ~G contradicts the premises because the truth of G is contained within (or entailed by) the truth of the conjunction of the premises, (F > G) - F. In other words, the conjunction of the premises, (F > G) - F, is true only if G is true.
    
    27 See Section 9.13 for a discussion of valid arguments with tautological conclusions.
    
    28 We will see in Section 9.12 (D) that one can prove a statement to be a tautology by assuming the negation of that statement. In such a case, one proves that the statement is a tautology; one does not prove that an argument is valid, and so one does not employ the I.P. assumption as an additional premise.
    
    29 See Exercises A 2, 4, and 6 in 9.12 (C), where the conclusions are, respectively, ~G, ~R and ~O.
    
    30 We can also construct a conditional proof within an indirect proof, which is especially helpful when our I.P. assumption enables us to infer, via C.P., a conditional that contradicts a conditional premise.
    
    31 The reader can use the STTT to determine that M > D does not follow from the premises alone by proving that the premises can all be true and M > D can be false. One can similarly use the STTT to prove that M > V does not validly follow from the premises.
    
    32 This is the second tautology of 9.12 (F).
    
    chapter 9 Methods of Deduction
    
    33 The indirect proof would infer E after the assumption (i.e., ~ E) is discharged, whereas the conditional proof would infer ~ E > E, which is logically equivalent to E.
    
    34 This proof is given as Exercise 12 in 9.12 (D) and its solution is given at the back of the book.
  - |-
    35 There is one exception to this. We can prove that any tautological conclusion (e.g., N V ~N) validly follows from any irrelevant premise (e.g., P) using C.P. or I.P. In this case, the statement on the last line of the proof, the conclusion N V ~N, is not inferred from the premise(s), although the proof establishes that it validly follows from the premise(s).

    10.1) The Need for Quantification
    
    Many valid deductive arguments cannot be tested using the logical techniques of the
    preceding two chapters. Therefore we must now enhance our analytical tools. We do this
    with quantification, a late nineteenth-century development chiefly credited to Gottlob
    Frege (1848-1925), a great German logician and the founder of modern logic. His dis-
    covery of quantification has been called the deepest single technical advance ever made
    in logic.

    chapter 10 Predicate Logic: Quantification Theory
    
    Arithmetic (1879). The problem he confronted can be seen in
    this way: Logicians had long dealt with the basic connectives by
    which propositions are tied together—and, or, if—then, explained in
    Chapters 8 and 9 in this book—but they had not yet devised the
    language with which to express fully, and to manipulate, expressions involving the concepts "some" and "all." Propositions having forms like "Some women overcome every hurdle," and "Some
    hurdles are overcome by every woman," as they might occur in
    argument, did not yield to the logical language then at hand.
    A new way to express these concepts accurately, a new Begriffsschrift,
    had to be invented.
  - |-
    Frege did this. Within this new formal language his development of quantification, explained and applied in this chapter, became a turning point in modern logic. Virtually all twentieth-century logicians were influenced by Frege's work. His larger objective was to show that mathematics (excluding geometry) is logically demonstrable from purely logical truths, an enterprise later advanced in a similar way by Bertrand Russell, with whom Frege corresponded in great detail, especially between 1902 and 1904. In his Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) Frege sketched his logicist project and criticized others' accounts of mathematics; later, in his Basic Laws of Arithmetic (1893 and 1903), he advanced the great project by building upon symbolic axioms derived from his earlier Concept Script. Frege abandoned his plan for a third volume of the Basic Laws, seemingly because he could not see a philosophically well-grounded way to eliminate the contradiction (i.e., Russell's Paradox) from his system.
    
    Many philosophers and logicians were saddened to read Frege's 1924 Diary, which shows that, very late in his life, Frege was an anti-Semite.
    
    To understand how quantification increases the power of logical analysis, we must recognize the limitations of the methods we have developed so far. The preceding chapters have shown that we can test deductive arguments effectively—but only arguments of one certain type, those whose validity depends entirely on the ways in which simple statements are truth-functionally combined into compound statements. Applying elementary argument forms and the rule of replacement, we draw inferences that permit us to discriminate valid from invalid arguments of that type. This we have done extensively.
    
    When we confront arguments built of propositions that are not compound, however, those techniques are not adequate; they cannot reach the critical elements in the reasoning process. Consider, for example, the ancient argument
    
    (P1): All humans are mortal.
    (P2): Socrates is human.
    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
  - |-
    * It was to arguments of this type that the classical or Aristotelian logic was primarily devoted, as described in
    Chapters 5 and 6. Those traditional methods, however, do not possess the generality or power of the newer symbolic
    logic and cannot be extended to cover all deductive arguments of the kinds we are likely to confront.
    
    10.2 Singular Propositions
    
    This argument is obviously valid. However, using the methods so far introduced we can
    only symbolize it as
    
    (P,): A
    (P,): H
    .M
    
    and symbolized in this way it appears not to be valid. What is wrong here? The difficulty
    arises from the fact that the validity of the argument in English, which is intuitively
    clear, depends on the inner logical structure of its premises, and that inner structure can-
    not be revealed by the system we have developed thus far for symbolizing statements.
    The symbolization immediately above, plainly too blunt, is the best we can do without
    quantifiers. That is because the propositions in this valid argument are not compound,
    and the techniques presented thus far, which are designed to deal with compound state-
    ments, cannot deal adequately with noncompound statements. A method is needed
    with which noncompound statements can be described and symbolized in such a way
    that their inner logical structure will be revealed. The theory of quantification pro-
    vides that method.
    
    Quantification enables us to interpret noncompound premises as compound state-
    ments, without loss of meaning. With that interpretation we can then use all the ele-
    mentary argument forms and the rule of replacement (as we have done with compound
    statements), drawing inferences and proving validity or invalidity—after which the com-
    pound conclusion reached may be transformed (again using quantification) back into
    the noncompound form with which we began. This technique adds very greatly to the
    power of our analytical machinery.
    
    The methods of deduction developed earlier remain fundamental; quantifiers do not
    alter the rules of inference in any way. What has gone before is called Propositional Logic.
    We now proceed, using some additional symbolization, to apply these rules of inference
    more widely, in what is called Predicate Logic. The inner structure of propositions—the
    relations of subjects and predicates—is brought to the surface and made accessible by
    quantifiers. Introducing this symbolization is the next essential step.
    
    10.2) Singular Propositions
  - |-
    We begin with the simplest kind of noncompound statement, illustrated by the second premise of the illustrative argument above, "Socrates is human." Statements of this kind have traditionally been called singular propositions. An affirmative singular proposition asserts that a particular individual has some specified attribute. "Socrates" is the subject term in the present example (as ordinary grammar and traditional logic both agree), and "human" is the predicate term. The subject term denotes a particular individual; the predicate term designates some attribute that individual is said to have.
    
    The same subject term, obviously, can occur in different singular propositions. One may assert that "Socrates is mortal," or "Socrates is fat," or "Socrates is wise," or "Socrates is beautiful." Of these assertions, some are true (the first and the third), and some are false (the second and fourth). Similarly, the very same predicate term can occur in different singular propositions. The term human is a predicate that appears in each of the following: "Aristotle is human," "Brazil is human," "Chicago is human," and "O'Keeffe is human"—of which the first and fourth are true, while the second and third are false.

    In quantification theory,  
    an expression that  
    contains an individual  
    variable and becomes  
    a statement when that  
    variable is replaced with  
    an individual constant.  
    A propositional  
    function can also  
    become a statement  
    by the process of  
    generalization.
    
    An "individual" in this symbolism can refer not only to persons, but to any individual  
    thing, such as a country, a book, a city, or anything of which an attribute (such as "human"  
    or "heavy") can be predicated. Attributes do not have to be adjectives (such as "mortal"  
    or "wise") as in our examples thus far, but can also be nouns (such as "a human"). In  
    grammar the distinction between adjective and noun is important, of course, but in this  
    context it is not significant. We do not need to distinguish between "Socrates is mortal"  
    and "Socrates is a mortal." Predicates can also be verbs, as in "Aristotle writes," which can  
    be expressed alternatively as "Aristotle is a writer." The critical first step is to distinguish  
    between the subject and the predicate terms, between the individuals and the attributes  
    they may be said to have. We next introduce two different kinds of symbols for referring  
    to individuals and to attributes.
    
    To denote individuals we use (following a very widely adopted convention) small, or  
    lowercase, letters, from a through w. These symbols are individual constants. In any  
    particular context in which they may occur, each will designate one particular individual  
    throughout the whole of that context. It is usually convenient to denote an individual  
    by the first letter of its (or his or her) name. We may use the letter s to denote Socrates,  
    a to denote Aristotle, b to denote Brazil, c to denote Chicago, and so forth.
    
    Capital letters are used as predicate symbols to symbolize attributes that individu-  
    als may have, and again it is convenient to use the first letter of the attribute referred to:  
    H for human, M for mortal, F for fat, W for wise, and so forth.
  - |-
    Singular propositions can now be symbolized. By writing a predicate symbol (e.g., "AH" for "human" or "M" for mortal) immediately to the left of an individual constant, we symbolize the singular proposition affirming that the individual named has the attribute specified. Thus the singular proposition, "Socrates is human," will be symbolized simply as Hs, with the predicate symbol "H" first, followed immediately by the individual constant "s." Of course, Ha symbolizes "Aristotle is human," Hb symbolizes "Brazil is human," Hc symbolizes "Chicago is human," and so forth.
    
    It is important to note the pattern that is common to these terms. Each begins with the same predicate symbol, H, and is immediately followed by an individual constant denoting some individual, s or a or b or c, and so forth. We could write the pattern as "H—", where the dash to the right of the predicate symbol is a place marker for some individual symbol. This pattern we symbolize as Hx. We use Hx [sometimes written as H(x)] to symbolize the common pattern of all singular propositions that attribute "being human" to some individual. The letter x is called an individual variable—it is simply a place marker, indicating where the various individual letters a through w (the individual constants) may be written. When one of those constants does appear in place of x, we have a singular proposition. The letter x is available to serve as the variable because, by convention, a through w are the only letters we allow to serve as individual constants.
    
    Let us examine the symbol Hx more closely. It is called a propositional function. We define a propositional function as an expression that (1) contains a predicate symbol and an individual variable, and (2) yields a proposition when an individual constant is substituted for its individual variable.* So a propositional function is not itself a proposition, although it yields one by substitution. Individual constants may be thought of as the proper names of individuals. Any singular proposition is a substitution instance of a propositional function; it is the result of substituting some individual constant for the individual variable in that propositional function.
  - |-
    * Some writers regard "propositional functions" as the meanings of such expressions, but here we define them to be
    the expressions themselves.
    
    10.3. Universal and Existential Quantifiers
    
    A propositional function normally has some true substitution instances and some false
    substitution instances. If H symbolizes human, s symbolizes Socrates, and c symbolizes
    Chicago, then Hs is true and Hc is false. With the substitution made, what confronts us
    is a proposition; before the substitution is made, we have only the propositional function.
    There are an unlimited number of such propositional functions, of course: Hx, and Mx,
    and Bx, and Fx, and Wx, and so on. We call these propositional functions simple predicates,
    to distinguish them from more complex propositional functions to be introduced in fol-
    lowing sections. A simple predicate is a propositional function that has some true and
    some false substitution instances, each of which is an affirmative singular proposition.
    
    10.3) Universal and Existential Quantifiers
    
    A singular proposition affirms that some individual thing has a given predicate, so it is
    the substitution instance of some propositional function. If the predicate is M for mortal,
    or B for beautiful, we have the simple predicates Mx or Bx, which assert humanity or
    beauty of nothing in particular. If we substitute Socrates for the variable x, we get singular
    propositions, "Socrates is mortal," or "Socrates is beautiful." But we might wish to assert
    that the attribute in question is possessed by more than a single individual. We might
    wish to say that "Everything is mortal," or that "Something is beautiful." These expres-
    sions contain predicate terms, but they are not singular propositions because they do not
    refer specifically to any particular individuals. These are general propositions.
    
    Let us look closely at the first of these general propositions, "Everything is mortal."
    It may be expressed in various ways that are logically equivalent. We could express it by
    saying "All things are mortal." We could express it by saying:
  - |-

    Given any individual thing whatever, it is mortal.
    In this latter formulation the word "it" is a pronoun that refers back to the word "thing"
    that precedes it. We can use the letter x, our individual variable, in place of both the
    pronoun and its antecedent. So we can rewrite the first general proposition as
    
    Given any x, x is mortal.
    
    Alternatively, using the notation for predicates we introduced in the preceding section,
    we may write
    
    Given any x, Mx.
    
    We know that Mx is a propositional function, not a proposition. But here, in this last
    formulation, we have an expression that contains Mx, and that clearly is a proposition.
    The phrase "Given any x" is customarily symbolized by "(x)", which is called the uni-
    versal quantifier. That first general proposition may now be completely symbolized as
    
    (x)Mx
    which says "Everything is mortal."
    
    This analysis shows that we can convert a propositional function into a proposition
    not only by substitution, but also by generalization, or quantification.

    means "Given any x, F is
    true of it."

    Alfred North Whitehead
    
    Alfred North Whitehead was born in 1861 in Ramsgate, Kent, England, the son of an
    Anglican minister. After graduating from a prestigious "public" school, he studied math-
    ematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, eventually becoming a Fellow of that College.
    The famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, was one of his students in mathematics
    there. Another of his students, Bertrand Russell, was later to become his collaborator and
    co-author.
  - |-
    Together, Whitehead and Russell produced, after the labor of a decade, the highly influ-
    ential treatise, *Principia Mathematica*, in three volumes: 1910, 1912, and 1913. In this work
    the derivation of mathematics from basic logical principles, earlier attempted by Gottlob
    Frege in Germany, was at last carried out. That joint product is one of the most significant
    achievements of twentieth-century logic.
    
    The friendship of Whitehead and Russell was split sharply by
    political differences. Whitehead had three sons, one of whom was
    killed in the First World War. Russell was a pacifist who actively
    objected to British participation in the war. The two authors were
    divided deeply and permanently. When a new edition of *Principia*
    Mathematica was published in 1927, Whitehead refused to contrib-
    ute to it.
    
    After a full career teaching mathematics and logic at Cambridge
    University, and then in London, Whitehead turned to the develop-
    ment of metaphysical and historical themes. In 1924 he was invited
    to Harvard to teach philosophy; he did so, and spent the remainder
    of his life in America. *Science and the Modern World* (1925) was his
    penetrating account of the role of science and mathematics in the
    rise of Western civilization. *Process and Reality* (1929) presented his
    metaphysical views, in which, in the tradition of the ancient phi-
    losopher Heraclitus, "all things flow," and nothing is stable. Truths,
    he therefore thought, could be no more than half-truths. But it is
    as creative logician, and as Russell's collaborator in the writing of
    *Principia Mathematica*, that he is best known. Whitehead died in
    Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1947.
    
    Biography
    
    Consider now the second general proposition we had entertained: "Something is
    beautiful." This may also be expressed as
    
    There is at least one thing that is beautiful.
    In this latter formulation, the word "that" is a relative pronoun referring to the word
    "thing." Using our individual variable x once again in place of both the pronoun "that"
    and its antecedent "thing," we may rewrite the second general proposition as
    
    There is at least one x such that x is beautiful.
    
    Or, using the notation for predicates, we may write
  - |-
    There is at least one x such that Bx.
    457
    
    10.3. Universal and Existential Quantifiers
    
    Once again we see that, although Bx is a propositional function and not a proposition,
    we have here an expression that contains Bx that is a proposition. The phrase "there is
    at least one x such that" is customarily symbolized as "4x"; the J is called the existen-
    tial quantifier. Thus the second general proposition may be completely symbolized as
    
    (4x) Bx
    
    which says "Something is beautiful."
    
    Thus we see that propositions may be formed from propositional functions either by
    instantiation, that is, by substituting an individual constant for its individual variable,
    or by generalization, that is, by placing a universal or existential quantifier before the
    propositional function.
    
    Now consider: The universal quantification of a propositional function, (x)Mx, is true if
    and only if all the substitution instances of the function are true; that is what universality
    means here. It is also clear that the existential quantification of a propositional function,
    (4x)Mx, is true if and only if its propositional function has at least one true substitution
    instance. To understand quantified propositions and how they relate to one another, we
    will show how the traditional square of opposition can be represented in terms of quanti-
    fied propositions. To do this, for the rest of this section we will assume (what no one will
    deny) that there exists at least one individual. Under this very weak assumption, every
    propositional function must have at least one substitution instance, an instance that may
    or may not be true. But it is certain that, under this assumption, if the universal quanti-
    fication of a propositional function is true, then the existential quantification of it must
    also be true. That is, if every x is M, then, if there exists at least one thing, that thing is M.
  - |-
    Up to this point, only affirmative singular propositions have been given as substitution instances of propositional functions. Mx (x is mortal) is a propositional function. Ms is an instance of it, an affirmative singular proposition that says "Socrates is mortal." But not all propositions are affirmative. One may deny that Socrates is mortal, saying ~ Ms, "Socrates is not mortal." If Ms is a substitution instance of Mx, then ~ Ms may be regarded as a substitution instance of the propositional function ~Mx. Thus we may enlarge our conception of propositional functions, beyond the simple predicates introduced in the preceding section, to permit them to contain the negation symbol, "~".
    
    With the negation symbol at our disposal, we may now enrich our understanding of quantification as follows. We begin with the general proposition
    
    Nothing is perfect.
    which we can paraphrase as
    
    Everything is imperfect.
    which in turn may be written as
    
    Given any individual thing whatever, it is not perfect.
    which can be rewritten as
    
    Given any x, x is not perfect.
    
    Existential
    quantifier
    
    In quantification theory,
    a symbol, ∀, used
    before a propositional
    function to assert that
    the function has one or
    more true substitution
    instances. Thus "
    (∀x)Fx " means "there
    exists an x such that F is
    true of it."
    
    Instantiation
    
    In quantification
    theory, the process
    
    of substituting an
    individual constant for
    an individual variable,
    thereby converting a
    propositional function
    into a proposition.
    
    Generalization
    
    In quantification
    theory, the process of
    forming a proposition
    from a propositional
    function by placing a
    universal quantifier or
    an existential quantifier
    before it.
    
    chapter 10 Predicate Logic: Quantification Theory
    
    If P symbolizes the attribute of being perfect, we can use the notation just developed (the quantifier and the negation sign) to express this proposition ("Nothing is perfect.") as (∀x)~Px.
    
    Now we are in a position to list and illustrate a series of important connections between universal and existential quantification.
  - |-
    First, the (universal) general proposition "Everything is mortal" is denied by the (existential) general proposition "Something is not mortal." Using symbols, we may say that  
    (x)Mx is denied by (4x) Mx. Because each of these is the denial of the other, we may certainly say (prefacing the one with a negation symbol) that the biconditional  
    
    ~ (x)Mx = (4x) ~ Mx  
    
    is necessarily, logically true.
    
    Second, "Everything is mortal" expresses exactly what is expressed by "There is nothing that is not mortal"—which may be formulated as another biconditional, also logically true:
    
    (x)Mx = (4x) Mx
    
    Third, it is clear that the (universal) general proposition, "Nothing is mortal," is  
    denied by the (existential) general proposition, "Something is mortal." In symbols we  
    say that (x)~Mx is denied by (4x)Mx. And because each of these is the denial of the  
    other, we may certainly say (again prefacing the one with a negation symbol) that the  
    biconditional  
    
    ~ (x) ~ Mx = (4x) Mx  
    
    is necessarily, logically true.
    
    Fourth, "Everything is not mortal" expresses exactly what is expressed by "There  
    is nothing that is mortal"—which may be formulated as a logically true biconditional:
    
    (x)~ Mx = (4x) Mx
    
    These four logically true biconditionals set forth the interrelations of universal and  
    existential quantifiers. We may replace any proposition in which the quantifier is pref-  
    aced by a negation sign (using these logically true biconditionals) with another logically  
    equivalent proposition in which the quantifier is not prefaced by a negation sign. We  
    list these four logically true biconditionals again, now replacing the illustrative predicate  
    M (for mortal) with the symbol ® (the Greek letter phi), which will stand for any simple  
    predicate whatsoever.

    10.4) Traditional Subject-Predicate Propositions
    
    Using the existential and universal quantifiers, and with an understanding of the square
    of opposition in Figure 10-1, we are now in a position to analyze (and to use accurately
    in reasoning) the four types of general propositions that have been traditionally empha-
    sized in the study of logic. The standard illustrations of these four types are the following:
    
    All humans are mortal. (universal affirmative: A)
    
    No humans are mortal. (universal negative: E)
    
    Some humans are mortal. (particular affirmative: I)
    Some humans are not mortal. (particular negative: O)
    
    Each of these types is commonly referred to by its letter: the two affirmative propositions,
    A and I (from the Latin affirmo, "I affirm"); and the two negative propositions, E and O
    (from the Latin nego, "I deny").*

    In symbolizing these propositions by means of quantifiers, we are led to a further
    enlargement of our conception of a propositional function. Turning first to the A propo-
    sition, "All humans are mortal," we proceed by means of successive paraphrasings, begin-
    ning with
    
    Given any individual thing whatever, if it is human then it is mortal.
    
    * An account of the traditional analysis of these four types of propositions was presented in Chapter 5.
    
    chapter 10 Predicate Logic: Quantification Theory
    
    The two instances of the pronoun "it" clearly refer to their common antecedent, the
    word "thing." As in the early part of the preceding section, because those three words
    have the same (indefinite) reference, they can be replaced by the letter x and the propo-
    sition rewritten as
    
    Given any x, if x is human then x is mortal.
    Now using our previously introduced notation for "if-then," we can rewrite the preceding as
    Given any x, x is human 25 x is mortal.
    
    Finally, using our now-familiar notation for propositional functions and quantifiers, the
    original A proposition is expressed as
    
    (x)(Hx D Mx)
    
    In our symbolic translation, the A proposition appears as the universal quantification
    of a new kind of propositional function. The expression Hx D Mx is a propositional
    function that has as its substitution instances neither affirmative nor negative singular
    propositions, but conditional statements whose antecedents and consequents are sin-
    gular propositions that have the same subject term. Among the substitution instances of
    the propositional function Hx D Mx are the conditional statements Ha > Ma, Hb > Mb,
    Hc > Mc, Hd D Mad, and so on.
  - |-
    There are also propositional functions whose substitution instances are conjunc-
    tions of singular propositions that have the same subject terms. Thus the conjunc-
    tions Ha-Ma, Hb-Mb, Hc-Mc, Hd-Md, and so on, are substitution instances of the
    propositional function Hx- Mx. There are also propositional functions such as Wx \ Bx
    , whose substitution instances are disjunctions such as Wa\ B a and Wb\ Bb. In fact,
    any truth-functionally compound statement whose simple component statements are
    singular propositions that all have the same subject term may be regarded as a substitu-
    tion instance of a propositional function containing some or all of the various truth-
    functional connectives and operators (dot, wedge, horseshoe, three-bar equivalence, and
    curl), in addition to the simple predicates Ax, Bx, Cx, Dx,....In our translation of the A
    proposition as (x)(Hx D Mx), the parentheses serve as punctuation marks. They indicate
    that the universal quantifier (x) "applies to" or "has within its scope" the entire (com-
    plex) propositional function Hx D Mx.
    
    Before going on to discuss the other traditional forms of categorical propositions,
    it should be observed that our symbolic formula (x)(Hx D Mx) translates not only the
    standard-form proposition, "All H's are M's," but any other English sentence that has the
    same meaning. When, for example, a character in Henrik Ibsen's play, Love's Comedy,
    says, "A friend married is a friend lost," that is just another way of saying, "All friends
    who marry are friends who are lost." There are many ways, in English, of saying the
    same thing.
    
    Here is a list, not exhaustive, of different ways in which we commonly express uni-
    versal affirmative propositions in English:
    
    H's are M's.
    An H is an M.
    Every H is M.
    Each H is M.
    Any H is M.
    No H's are not M.
    Everything that is H is M.
    Anything that is H is M.
    If anything is H, it is M.
    If something is H, it is M.
    Whatever is H is M.
    A's are all M's.
  - |-
    Nothing is an H unless it is an M.
    Nothing is an H but not an M.
    
    To evaluate an argument we must understand the language in which the propositions of that argument are expressed. Some English idioms are a little misleading, using
    a temporal term when no reference to time is intended. Thus the proposition, "H's are
    always M's," is ordinarily understood to mean simply that all H's are M's. Again, the same
    meaning may be expressed using abstract nouns: "Humanity implies (or entails) mor-
    tality" is correctly symbolized as an A proposition. That the language of symbolic logic
    has a single expression for the common meaning of a considerable number of English
    sentences may be regarded as an advantage of symbolic logic over English for cognitive
    or informative purposes—although admittedly a disadvantage from the point of view of
    rhetorical power or poetic expressiveness.
    
    Quantification of the A Proposition
    The A proposition, "All humans are mortal," asserts that if anything is a human, then it is mortal. In
    other words, for any given thing x, if x is a human, then x is mortal. Substituting the horseshoe symbol
    for "if-then," we get
    
    Given any x, x is a human > x is mortal.
    
    In the notation for propositional functions and quantifiers this becomes
    
    (x)|Hx D Mx]
    
    Quantification of the E Proposition
    
    The E proposition, "No humans are mortals," asserts that if anything is human, then it is not mortal.
    In other words, for any given thing x, if x is a human, then x is not mortal. Substituting the horseshoe
    symbol for "if-then," we get:
    
    Given any x, x is a human D x is not mortal.
    
    In the notation for propositional functions and quantifiers, this becomes
    
    chapter 10 Predicate Logic: Quantification Theory
    
    (x) [Hx D~ Mx]
    
    This symbolic translation expresses not only the traditional E form in English, but also such diverse
    ways of saying the same thing as "There are no H's that are M," "Nothing is both an H and an M," and
    "H's are never M."
    
    Quantification of the | Proposition
  - |-
    The I proposition, "Some humans are mortal," asserts that there is at least one thing that is a human and is mortal. In other words, there is at least one x such that x is a human and x is mortal. Substituting the dot symbol for conjunction, we get
    
    There is at least one x such that x is a human - x is mortal.
    In the notation for propositional functions and quantifiers, this becomes
    
    (4x) | Hx - Mx]
    
    Quantification of the O Proposition
    
    The O proposition, "Some humans are not mortal," asserts that there is at least one thing that is a human and is not mortal. In other words, there is at least one x such that x is human and x is not mortal. Substituting the dot symbol for conjunction we get
    
    There is at least one x such that x is a human - x is not mortal.
    
    In the notation for propositional functions and quantifiers, this becomes
    
    (4x) (Hx -~Mx]
    
    Where the Greek letters phi (®) and psi (W) are used to represent any predicates whatever, the four general subject-predicate propositions of traditional logic may be represented in a square array as shown in Figure 10-2.
    
    (x) (Px> Vx) (x) (Px> ~WVx)
    
    (3x) (Ox - Vx) (3x) (x - ~Wx) Figure 10-2
    
    The relations displayed in Figure 10-2 match those displayed in Figure 5-2. For exam-
    ple, we have seen that A and O are contradictories, each being the denial of the other;
    and we have seen that E and I are also contradictories.
    
    10.4 Traditional Subject—Predicate Propositions
    
    Thus far we have worked under the weak assumption that there exists at least one
    individual. Under this assumption, we expect an I proposition to follow from its cor-
    responding A proposition, and an O from its corresponding E. But in fact our new
    formulation of universal categorical propositions as conditionals neatly incorporates
    the Boolean interpretation so that, say, an A proposition may very well be true while its
    corresponding I proposition is false. This we will now explain.
  - |-
    Where $ x $ is a propositional function that has no true substitution instances, then  
    no matter what kinds of substitution instances the propositional function ‘?x may have,  
    the universal quantification of the (complex) propositional function $ \exists x D Bx $ will be  
    true. For example, consider the propositional function, "x is a centaur," which we abbre-  
    viate as $ Cx $. Because there are no centaurs, every substitution instance of $ Cx $ is false, that  
    is, $ Ca $, $ Cb $, $ Cc $,...are all false. Hence every substitution instance of the complex proposi-  
    tional function $ Cx D Bx $ will be a conditional statement whose antecedent is false. The  
    substitution instances $ Ca D Ba $, $ Cb D Bb $, $ Cc D Bc $, ... are therefore all true, because any  
    conditional statement asserting a material implication must be true if its antecedent is  
    false. Because all its substitution instances are true, the universal quantification of the  
    propositional function $ Cx D Bx $, which is the A proposition $ (x)(Cx D Bx) $, is true. But  
    the corresponding I proposition $ (4x)(Cx- Bx) $ is false, because the propositional function  
    $ Cx- Bx $ has no true substitution instances. That $ Cx- Bx $ has no true substitution instances  
    follows from the fact that $ Cx $ has no true substitution instances. The various substitution  
    instances of $ Cx- Bx $ are $ Ca- Ba $, $ Cb- Bb $, $ Cc- Bc $, ... each of which is a conjunction whose  
    first conjunct is false, because $ Ca $, $ Cb $, $ Cc $, ... are all false. Because all its substitution  
    instances are false, the existential quantification of the propositional function $ Cx- Bx $,  
    which is the I proposition $ (4x)(Cx- Bx) $, is false. Hence an A proposition may be true  
    while its corresponding I proposition is false.
    
    This analysis shows also why an E proposition may be true while its corresponding O  
    proposition is false. If we replace the propositional function $ Bx $ by the propositional func-  
    tion $ \sim Bx $ in the preceding discussion, then $ (x)(Cx D \sim Bx) $ may be true while $ (4x)(Cx: \sim Bx) $  
    will be false because, of course, there are no centaurs.
  - |-
    The key to the matter is this: A propositions and E propositions do not assert or suppose that anything exists; they assert only that (if one thing then another) is the case. But I propositions and O propositions do suppose that some things exist; they assert that (this and the other) is the case. The existential quantifier in I and O propositions makes a critical difference. It would plainly be a mistake to infer the existence of anything from a proposition that does not assert or suppose the existence of anything.
    
    If we make the general assumption that there exists at least one individual, then (x)(Cx D Bx) does imply (4x)(Cx D Bx). But the latter is not an I proposition. The I proposition, "Some centaurs are beautiful," is symbolized as (4x)(Cx- Bx), which says that there is at least one centaur that is beautiful. But what is symbolized as (4x)(Cx D Bx) can be rendered in English as "There is at least one thing such that, if it is a centaur, then it is beautiful." It does not say that there is a centaur, but only that there is an individual that either is not a centaur or is beautiful. This proposition would be false in only two possible cases: first, if there were no individuals at all; and second, if all individuals were centaurs and none of them were beautiful. We rule out the first case by making the explicit (and obviously true) assumption that there is at least one individual in the universe; and the second case is so extremely implausible that any proposition of the form (4x)(®x D ¥x) is bound to be quite trivial, in contrast to the significant I form (4x)(®x- Px). The foregoing should make clear that, although in English the A

    A formula in which

    and I propositions "All humans are mortal" and "Some humans are mortal" differ only
    in their initial words, "all" and "some," their difference in meaning is not confined to
    the matter of universal versus existential quantification, but goes deeper than that. The
    propositional functions quantified to yield A and I propositions are not just differently
    quantified; they are different propositional functions, one containing ">", the other
    "." . In other words, A and I propositions are not as much alike as they appear in English.
    Their differences are brought out very clearly in the notation of propositional functions
    and quantifiers.
    
    For purposes of logical manipulation we can work best with formulas in which the
    negation sign, if one appears at all, applies only to simple predicates. So we will want to
    replace formulas in ways that have this result. This we can do quite readily. We know
    from the rule of replacement established in Chapter 9 that we are always entitled to
    replace an expression by another that is logically equivalent to it; and we have at our
    disposal four logical equivalences (listed in Section 10.3) in which each of the proposi-
    tions in which the quantifier is negated is shown equivalent to another proposition in
    which the negation sign applies directly to the predicates. Using the rules of inference
    with which we have long been familiar, we can shift negation signs so that, in the end,
    they no longer apply to compound expressions but apply only to simple predicates. Thus,
    for example, the formula
    
    ~ (Ax)( Fx - ~ Gx)
    
    can be successively rewritten. First, when we apply the fourth logical equivalence given
    on p. 458, it is transformed into
    
    (X)~ (Fx - ~ Gx)
    
    Then when we apply De Morgan's theorem, it becomes
    (x)(~ Fx V ~~ Gx)
    
    Next, the principle of Double Negation gives us
    (x)(~ Fx V Gx)
    
    And finally, when we invoke the definition of Material Implication, the original formula
    is rewritten as the A proposition
    
    (x)( Fx D Gx)
    
    We call a formula in which negation signs apply only to simple predicates a normal-
    form formula.
  - |-
    Before turning to the topic of inferences involving noncompound statements, the reader should acquire some practice in translating noncompound statements from English into logical symbolism. The English language has so many irregular and idiomatic constructions that there can be no simple rules for translating an English sentence into logical notation. What is required in each case is that the meaning of the sentence be understood and then restated in terms of propositional functions and quantifiers.

    John von Neumann
    
    Logic is absolutely central in the design of computers. John von Neumann (1903-1957), a
    Hungarian-American mathematician and logician, helped to bring logic into all our lives
    through his work on the intellectual architecture of computers.
    
    Von Neumann's intellect was utterly remarkable; he inspired awe among his colleagues,
    who regarded him as among the greatest mathematicians of modern history. As a very
    young boy in Hungary, under the direction of private tutors, he had mastered arithmetic,
    algebra, analytic geometry and trigonometry. He taught himself calculus. He exhibited
    prodigious skills in learning languages, including classical Greek and Latin, and in memo-
    rizing vast bodies of material. The speed and depth of his mental calculations, even as a
    youth, were staggering.
  - |-
    At the age of 22 he received his Ph.D. in mathematics in Hungary, and that same year his diploma in chemical engineering in Switzerland. He lectured at the University of Berlin, and then in Hanover. When his father died, in 1929, the family emigrated to the United States, where von Neumann anglicized his first name (from Janos to John). He was invited to Princeton University and became one of the first professors selected, in 1933, for the Institute for Advanced Study there (Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl also joined in 1933; Kurt Godel became a member in 1940). Von Neumann remained a mathematics professor at the Institute until his early death from cancer in 1957. He lived an active social life in Princeton. He loved good clothes and fine cars; he loved eating, and drinking, and telling jokes. He threw great parties and enjoyed the good life. He was warmly liked and enormously admired by his friends and colleagues.
  - |-
    In the 1920s, von Neumann contributed to logic and the foundations of mathematics with numerous papers on set theory and fundamental work on proof theory. On September 7, 1930, at the Second Conference for Epistemology of the Exact Sciences in Kőnigsberg, Kurt Gödel sketched a preliminary version of his First Incompleteness result, and afterward he and von Neumann discussed various possibilities. On November 20, 1930, von Neumann wrote Gödel to excitedly inform him that he, von Neumann, had "achieved a [remarkable] result," "[n]amely, I was able to show that the consistency of mathematics is unprovable." Von Neumann had independently discovered Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem! Gödel immediately informed von Neumann of his completed paper, already submitted and received on November 17, 1930, which included the proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem and a sketch of the Second Incompleteness Theorem. In his November 29 reply, von Neumann wrote that "[a]s you have established the theorem on the unprovability of consistency as a natural continuation and deepening of your earlier results, I clearly won't publish on this subject."! Six years later, von Neumann and Garrett Birkhoff ushered in Quantum Logic with the publication of their seminal "The Logic of Quantum Mechanics."
    
    As a theoretical mathematician von Neumann contributed significantly to the development of the atomic bomb during the Second World War. During that war the first general-purpose electronic computer, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was designed at the University of Pennsylvania. Logicians (including the distinguished Michigan logician, Arthur Burks) were its creators. As the war ended, a second and more

    Advanced computer project was undertaken there: EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). John von Neumann was called in to assist in its development. He did so, summarizing and improving all logical computer design, and writing, in 1945, the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. That computer (physically huge, although exceedingly weak in comparison to electronic computers now commonly at hand) was actually built. It was completed at the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland in 1949, and ran successfully, day and night, for about ten years, from 1951 to 1961. John von Neumann, as logician, had played a key role in the birth of the computer age. His very last work, written while he was in hospital in 1956, and published posthumously, was entitled: The Computer and the Brain.
    
    10.5) Proving Validity
    
    To construct formal proofs of validity for arguments whose validity turns on the inner structures of noncompound statements that occur in them, we must expand our list of rules of inference. Only four additional rules are required, and they will be introduced in connection with arguments for which they are needed.
    
    Consider the first argument we discussed in this chapter: "All humans are mortal. Socrates is human. Therefore Socrates is mortal." It is symbolized as
    
    (P,): (%)(HX D Mx)
    (P,): Hs
    .. Ms
    
    The first premise affirms the truth of the universal quantification of the propositional function Hx D Mx. Because the universal quantification of a propositional function is true if and only if all of its substitution instances are true, from the first premise we can infer any desired substitution instance of the propositional function Hx 5 Mx. In par-
    ticular, we can infer the substitution instance Hs D Ms.
    
    Bertrand Russell
  - |-
    Bertrand Arthur William, Lord Russell, The Right Honourable The Earl Russell (1872-1970), was one of the most remarkable thinkers of recent centuries. His grandfather had been England's Prime Minister, befriended by Queen Victoria; his parents, religious skeptics who endorsed free love, died by the time he was four. Placed then in the custody of his grandparents, he encountered early in life the most prominent thinkers and writers of those days.
    
    Independently wealthy, Russell studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming eventually a Fellow of that College. His sexual and familial adventures were many and daring; he later ran a progressive school in which nudity for all was the rule. He married four times: in 1894, then in 1921, then again in 1936, and finally—at last happily at the age of 80—in 1952. The radical sexual freedom that he professed he practiced unrelentingly and without shame.
    
    10.5 Proving Validity
    
    In the very early years of the twentieth century, inspired by Frege, Russell developed his own logicism—the view that mathematics grows out of logic —which he first formulated in The Principles of Mathematics in 1903. Collaborating closely with the mathematician, Alfred North Whitehead, he pursued tenaciously the project of proving that this derivation could indeed be carried out, overcoming the problems that Frege's work had failed to solve. Ten years of arduous labor resulted in their publication of one of the towering works of modern logic: Principia Mathematica (3 volumes: 1910, 1912, 1913).
    
    Russell was a pacifist; he was dismissed from Trinity College and went to prison for his activism against British participation in the First World War. But he campaigned actively against Hitler in the Second World War, and came to believe that although war is indeed always a very great evil, there are times when it is the lesser of the evils we confront. He campaigned against the brutality of the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union in the post-war years, and then again, engaging in deliberate, orderly civil disobedience, against America's involvement in the Vietnam War.

    He taught at the City College of New York, and at the University of Chicago, and at
    the University of California at Los Angeles—but even in America he was often hounded
    because of his radical opinions on matters of sex, very publicly expressed. He is famous for
    the clarity and beauty of his prose, nowhere more evident than in his History of Western
    Philosophy (1945), which became a worldwide bestseller. In 1950 he was awarded the Nobel
    Prize in Literature. Over the years Russell had many very distinguished students whom
    he admired and who carried on his work. Among them were the philosopher Ludwig
    Wittgenstein, at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later the logician Irving Copi, at the
    University of Chicago.
    
    Colorful, prolific, creative, passionate and courageous, Bertrand Russell was not only
    one of the great modern logicians; he was one of the most extraordinary intellectual figures
    of his time.
    
    From that and the second premise Hs, the conclusion Ms follows directly by Modus
    Ponens.
    If we add to our list of rules of inference the principle that any substitution instance of
    a propositional function can validly be inferred from its universal quantification, then we can
    give a formal proof of the validity of the given argument by reference to the expanded
    list of elementary valid argument forms. This new rule of inference is the principle of
    Universal Instantiation and is abbreviated as U.I. Using the Greek letter nu (v) to
    represent any individual symbol whatever, we state the new rule as:
    
    In quantification theory,
    a rule of inference
    that permits the valid
    inference of any
    substitution instance of
    a propositional function
    
    from the universal
    quantification of the
    propositional function.
    
    "Dy (where v is any individual symbol)

    Gerhard Gentzen and Stanislaw Jaskowski in 1934.

    4. Hs → Ms 1, U.I.
    5. Ms 3, 2, M.P.
  - |-
    The addition of U.I. strengthens our proof apparatus considerably, but more is required. The need for additional rules governing quantification arises in connection with arguments such as "All humans are mortal. All Greeks are human. Therefore all Greeks are mortal." The symbolic translation of this argument is
    
    (x)(Hx → Mx)
    (x)(Gx → Hx)
    ∴ (x)(Gx → Mx)
    
    Here both the premises and the conclusion are general propositions rather than singular ones, universal quantifications of propositional functions rather than substitution instances of them. From the two premises, by U.I., we may validly infer the following pairs of conditional statements:
    
    Ga → Ha Gb → Hb Ge → Hc Gd → Hd
    
    Ha → Ma Hb → Mb Hc → Mc Hd → Md}...
    and by successive uses of the principle of the Hypothetical Syllogism we may validly infer the conclusions:
    
    Ga → Ma, Gb → Mb, Gc → Mc, Gd → Md,>
    
    If a, b, c, d,... were all the individuals that exist, it would follow that from the truth of the premises one could validly infer the truth of all substitution instances of the propositional function Gx → Mx. The universal quantification of a propositional function is true if and only if all its substitution instances are true, so we can go on to infer the truth of (x)(Gx → Mx), which is the conclusion of the given argument.
    
    The preceding paragraph may be thought of as containing an informal proof of the validity of the given argument, in which the principle of the hypothetical syllogism and two principles governing quantification are appealed to. But it describes indefinitely long sequences of statements: the lists of all substitution instances of the two propositional functions quantified universally in the premises, and the list of all substitution instances of the propositional function whose universal quantification is the conclusion. A formal proof cannot contain such indefinitely, perhaps even infinitely, long sequences of statements, so some method must be sought for expressing those indefinitely long sequences in some finite, definite fashion.

    A method for doing this is suggested by a common technique of elementary mathematics. A geometer, seeking to prove that all triangles possess a certain attribute, may begin with the words "Let ABC be any arbitrarily selected triangle." Then the geometer begins to reason about the triangle ABC and establishes that it has the attribute in question. From this she concludes that all triangles have that attribute. Now what justifies her final conclusion? Granted of the particular triangle ABC that it has the attribute, why does it follow that all triangles do? The answer to this question is easily given. If no assumption other than its triangularity is made about the triangle ABC, then the symbol "ABC" can be taken as denoting any triangle one pleases. Then the geometer's argument establishes that any triangle has the attribute in question, and if any triangle has it, then all triangles do. We now introduce a notation analogous to the geometer's in talking about "any arbitrarily selected triangle ABC." This will avoid the pretense of listing an indefinite or infinite number of substitution instances of a propositional function, for instead we shall talk about any substitution instance of the propositional function.
    
    We shall use the (hitherto unused) lowercase letter y to denote any arbitrarily selected individual. We shall use it in a way similar to that in which the geometer used the letters ABC. Because the truth of any substitution instance of a propositional function follows from its universal quantification, we can infer the substitution instance that results from replacing x by y, where y denotes "any arbitrarily selected" individual. Thus we may begin our formal proof of the validity of the given argument as follows:
    
    1. (x)(Hx → Mx)
    2. (x)(Gx → Hx)
    3. (x)(Gx → Mx)
    4. Hy → My 1, ULL.
    5. Gy → Hy 2, ULL.
    6. Gy → My 4,3, HS.
  - |-
    From the premises we have deduced the statement Gy D My, which in effect, because y denotes "any arbitrarily selected individual," asserts the truth of any substitution instance of the propositional function Gx > Mx. Because any substitution instance is true, all substitution instances must be true, and hence the universal quantification of that propositional function is true also. We may add this principle to our list of rules of inference, stating it as follows: From the substitution instance of a propositional function with respect to the name of any arbitrarily selected individual, one can validly infer the universal quantification of that propositional function. This new principle permits us to generalize, that is, to go from a special substitution instance to a generalized or universally quantified expression, so we refer to it as the principle of Universal Generalization and abbreviate it as U.G. It is stated as
    
    U.G.: My (where y denotes "any arbitrarily selected individual")
    ". (X)(®x)
    
    The sixth and final line of the formal proof already begun may now be written (and justified) as
    
    6. (x)(Gx D Mx) 5, U.G.
    
    Let us review the preceding discussion. In the geometer's proof, the only assumption made about ABC is that it is a triangle; hence what is proved true of ABC is proved true of any triangle. In our proof, the only assumption made about y is that it is an individual; hence what is proved true of y is proved true of any individual. The symbol y is an individual symbol, but it is a very special one. Typically it is introduced into a proof by using U.I., and only the presence of y permits the use of U.G.

    Here is another valid argument, the demonstration of whose validity requires the use of U.G. as well as U.I.: "No humans are perfect. All Greeks are humans. Therefore no Greeks are perfect."* The formal proof of its validity is:

    There may seem to be some artificiality about the preceding. It may be argued that distinguishing carefully between (x)(®x) and Oy, so that they are not treated as identical but must be inferred from each other by U.I. and U.G., is to insist on a distinction without a difference. But there certainly is a formal difference between them. The statement (x)(Hx D Mx) is a noncompound statement, whereas Hy > My is compound, being a conditional. From the two noncompound statements (x)(Gx D Hx) and (x)(Hx D Mx), no relevant inference can be drawn by means of the original list of nineteen rules of inference. But from the compound statements Gy > Hy and Hy D My, the indicated conclusion Gy D My follows by a Hypothetical Syllogism. The principle of U.I. is used to get from noncompound statements, to which our earlier rules of inference do not usefully apply, to compound statements, to which they can be applied to derive the desired conclusion. The quantification principles thus augment our logical apparatus to make it capable of validating arguments essentially involving noncompound (generalized) propositions as well as the other (simpler) kind of argument discussed in earlier chapters. On the other hand, in spite of this formal difference, there must be a logical equivalence between (x)(®x) and Oy, or the rules U.I. and U.G. would not be valid. Both the difference and the logical equivalence are important for our purpose of validating arguments by reference to a list of rules of inference. The addition of U.I. and U.G. to our list strengthens it considerably.
    
    The list must be expanded further when we turn to arguments that involve existential propositions. A convenient example with which to begin is "All criminals are vicious. Some humans are criminals. Therefore some humans are vicious." It is symbolized as
    
    (P,): (%)(Cx D Vx)
    (P,): (4x) (Hx - Cx)

    The existential quantification of a propositional function is true if and only if the
    function has at least one true substitution instance. Hence whatever attribute may be
    designated by ®, (Ax)(®x) says that there is at least one individual that has the attribute
    ®. If an individual constant (other than the special symbol y) is used nowhere earlier
    in the context, we may use it to denote either the individual that has the attribute ©,
    
    * This is an appropriate point to observe that, for arguments of some kinds, the traditional syllogistic analysis can estab-
    lish validity as efficiently as modern quantified logic. A classical logician would quickly identify this syllogism as having
    the mood EAE in the first figure—necessarily of the form Ce/arent, and therefore immediately seen to be valid. See
    Section 6.5 for a summary exposition of the valid standard-form categorical syllogisms.
    
    or some one of the individuals that have ® if there are several. Knowing that there is
    such an individual, say, a, we know that ®a is a true substitution instance of the propo-
    sitional function ®x. Hence we add to our list of rules of inference this principle: From
    the existential quantification of a propositional function, we may infer the truth of its substitu-
    tion instance with respect to any individual constant (other than y) that occurs nowhere earlier
    in that context. The new rule of inference is the principle of Existential Instantiation
    and is abbreviated as "E.I." It is stated as:
    
    E.I: (4x)(®x) [where v is any individual constant (other than y)
    
    having no previous occurrence in the context]
    "Dv
    
    Granted the additional rule of inference E.I., we may begin a demonstration of the
    validity of the stated argument:

    Thus far we have deduced Ha-Va, which is a substitution instance of the propositional function whose existential quantification is asserted by the conclusion. Because the existential quantification of a propositional function is true if and only if it has at least one true substitution instance, we add to our list of rules of inference the principle that from any true substitution instance of a propositional function we may validly infer the existential quantification of that propositional function. This fourth and final rule of inference is the principle of Existential Generalization, abbreviated as E.G. and stated as
    
    E.G.: Ov (where v is any individual symbol)

    The need for the indicated restriction on the use of E.I. can be seen by considering
    the obviously invalid argument, "Some alligators are kept in captivity. Some birds are
    kept in captivity. Therefore some alligators are birds." If we failed to heed the restriction
    on E.I. that a substitution instance of a propositional function inferred by E.I. from the

    symbol (other than y) that has no previous occurrence in the context, then we might proceed
    to construct a "proof" of validity for this invalid argument. Such an erroneous "proof"
    might proceed as follows:

    The error in this "proof" occurs at line 4. From the second premise (4x)(Bx - Cx),  
    we know that there is at least one thing that is both a bird and kept in captivity. If we  
    were free to assign it the name a in line 4, we could, of course, assert Ba - Ca. But we are  
    not free to make any such assignment of a, for it has already been preempted in line 3  
    to serve as the name for an alligator that is kept in captivity. To avoid errors of this sort,  
    we must obey the indicated restriction whenever we use E.I. The preceding discussion  
    should make clear that in any demonstration requiring the use of both E.I. and U.L., E.I.  
    should always be used first.  
    
    For more complicated modes of argumentation, especially those that involve rela-  
    tions, certain additional restrictions must be placed on our four quantification rules. But  
    for arguments of the present sort, traditionally called categorical syllogisms, the present  
    restrictions are sufficient to prevent mistakes.

    The conclusion of this argument is an existentially quantified statement. Plainly, the

    have to instantiate the premises, applying E.I. to the second premise and U.I. to the first

    **10.6, Proving Invalidity**
  - |-
    To prove the invalidity of an argument involving quantifiers, we can use the method of refutation by logical analogy. For example, the argument, "All conservatives are opponents of the administration; some delegates are opponents of the administration; therefore some delegates are conservatives," is proved invalid by the analogy, "All cats are animals; some dogs are animals; therefore some dogs are cats," which is obviously invalid, because its premises are known to be true and its conclusion is known to be false. Such analogies, however, are not always easy to devise. Some more effective method of proving invalidity is desirable.
    
    In Chapter 9 we used the Shorter Truth-Table Technique (STTT) to prove the invalidity of invalid arguments involving truth-functional compound statements. That method consisted of making truth-value assignments to the component simple statements in arguments, in such a way as to make the premises true and the conclusions false. That method can be adapted for arguments involving quantifiers. The adaptation involves our general assumption that there is at least one individual. For an argument involving quantifiers to be valid, it must be impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false as long as there is at least one individual.
    
    The general assumption that there is at least one individual is satisfied if there is exactly one individual, or if there are exactly two individuals, or exactly three individuals, or....
    
    If any one of these assumptions about the exact number of individuals is made, there is an equivalence between general propositions and truth-functional compounds of singular propositions. If there is exactly one individual, say a, then

    (x)(®x) = ba = (4x)(@x)

    If there are exactly two individuals, say $ a $ and $ b $, then  
    $$
    (x) (x) =[@a - Ob] \quad \text{and} \quad (Ax)(@x) =[@a \vee Ob]

    If there are exactly three individuals, say $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, then  
    $$
    (x)(®x) =[@a - Ob - Gc] \quad \text{and} \quad (4x)(@x) =[@a \vee Ob \vee Gc]
    $$
    
    In general, if there are exactly $ n $ individuals, say $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, ..., $ n $, then  
    $$
    (x)(®x) =[@a - Ob - @c - \dots - On] \quad \text{and} \quad (Ax)(@x) =[@a \vee Ob \vee Oc \vee \dots \vee On]
    $$
    
    These biconditionals are true as a consequence of our definitions of the universal and  
    existential quantifiers. No use is made here of the four quantification rules explained in  
    Section 10.5.
    
    An argument involving quantifiers is valid if, and only if, it is valid no matter how  
    many individuals there are, provided there is at least one. So an argument involving  
    quantifiers is proved invalid if there is a possible universe or model containing at least  
    one individual such that the argument's premises are true and its conclusion false of  
    that model. Consider the argument, "All mercenaries are undependable. No guerrillas are  
    mercenaries. Therefore no guerrillas are undependable." It may be symbolized as
    
    $$
    (x)( Mx \rightarrow Ux)
    $$
    $$
    (x)(Gx \rightarrow \neg Mx)
    $$
    $$
    (x)(Gx \rightarrow \neg Ux)
    $$
    
    If there is exactly one individual, say $ a $, this argument is logically equivalent to
    
    $$
    (P,): Ma \rightarrow Ua
    $$
    $$
    (P,): Ga \rightarrow \neg Ma
    $$
    $$
    \text{".Ga} \rightarrow \neg Ua
    $$

    The latter can be proved invalid by assigning the truth value true to Ga and Ua and false to Ma. (This assignment of truth values is a shorthand way of describing the model in question as containing only the one individual, a, which is a guerrilla and undependable but is not a mercenary.) Hence the original argument is not valid for a model containing exactly one individual, and it is therefore invalid. Similarly, we can prove the invalidity of the first argument mentioned in this section (on p. 477) by describing a model containing exactly one individual, a, so that Aa and Da are assigned the value true and Ca is assigned the value false.*
    
    Some arguments, for example,
    
    (P,): (AX)Fx
    ". (X) FX
    
    may be valid for any model in which there is exactly one individual, but invalid for a model containing two or more individuals. Such arguments must also count as invalid, because a valid argument must be valid regardless of how many individuals there are, so long as there is at least one. Another example of this kind of argument is "All collies are affectionate. Some collies are watchdogs. Therefore all watchdogs are affectionate." Its symbolic translation is
    
    (P,): (x)(Cx D Ax)
    (P,): (4x)(Cx - Wx)
    ". (X)(Wx D AX)
    
    For a model containing exactly one individual, a, it is logically equivalent to
    
    (P,): Ca D Aa
    (P,): Ca- Wa
    ..WaD Aa
    
    which is valid. But for a model containing two individuals, a and J, it is logically equivalent to
    
    (P,): (Ca D Aa) - (Cb D Ab)
    (P,): (Ca-Wa) V (Cb - Wb)
    ".(Wa D Aa)- (Wb D Ab)
    
    which is proved invalid by assigning true to Ca, Aa, Wa, Wb, and false to Cb and AD.
    Hence the original argument is not valid for a model containing exactly two individu-
    als, and it is therefore invalid. For any invalid argument of this general type, it is pos-
    sible to describe a model containing some definite number of individuals for which its

    * Here we assume that the simple predicates Ax, Bx, Cx, Dx, . . ., occurring in our propositions are neither necessary,
    that is, logically true of all individuals (for example, x is identical with itself), nor impossible, that is, logically false of
    all individuals (for example, x is different from itself). We also assume that the only logical relations among the simple
    predicates involved are those asserted or logically implied by the premises. The point of these restrictions is to permit
    us to assign truth values arbitrarily to the substitution instances of these simple predicates without any inconsistency—
    for, of course, a correct description of any model must be consistent.
    479
    
    10.6 Proving Invalidity
    
    A logically equivalent truth-functional argument can be proved invalid by the method
    of assigning truth values.
    
    It should be emphasized again: In moving from a given argument involving gen-
    eral propositions to a truth-functional argument (one that is logically equivalent to the
    given argument for a specified model), no use is made of our four quantification rules.
    Instead, each statement of the truth-functional argument is logically equivalent to the
    corresponding general proposition of the given argument, and that logical equivalence
    is shown by the biconditionals formulated earlier in this section on p. 477, whose logical
    truth for the model in question follows from the very definitions of the universal and
    existential quantifiers.
  - |-
    The procedure for proving the invalidity of an argument containing general propositions is the following. First, consider a one-element model containing only the individual a. Then, write out the logically equivalent truth-functional argument for that model, which is obtained by moving from each general proposition (quantified propositional function) of the original argument to the substitution instance of that propositional function with respect to a. If the truth-functional argument can be proved invalid by assigning truth values to its component simple statements, that suffices to prove the original argument invalid. If that cannot be done, next consider a two-element model containing the individuals a and b. In order to obtain the logically equivalent truth-functional argument for this larger model, one can simply join each original substitution instance with respect to a to a new substitution instance of the same propositional function with respect to b. This "joining" must be in accord with the logical equivalences stated on p. 477; that is, where the original argument contains a universally quantified propositional function, (x)(®x), the new substitution instance Ob is combined with the first substitution instance ®a by conjunction ("-"); but where the original argument contains an existentially quantified propositional function, (4x)(®x), the new substitution instance ®b is combined with the first substitution instance Oa by disjunction ("\'"). The preceding example illustrates this procedure. If the new truth-functional argument can be proved invalid by assigning truth values to its component simple statements, that suffices to prove the original argument invalid. If that cannot be done, next consider a three-element model containing the individuals a, b, and c. And so on. None of the exercises in this book requires a model containing more than three elements.

    All the arguments considered in the preceding two sections were of the form traditionally called categorical syllogisms. These consist of two premises and a conclusion, each of which is analyzable either as a singular proposition or as one of the A, E, I, or O varieties. We turn now to the problem of evaluating somewhat more complicated arguments. These require no greater logical apparatus than has already been developed, yet they are asyllogistic arguments; that is, they cannot be reduced to standard-form categorical syllogisms, and therefore evaluating them requires a more powerful logic than was traditionally used in testing categorical syllogisms.
    
    In this section we are still concerned with general propositions, formed by quantifying propositional functions that contain only a single individual variable. In the categorical syllogism, the only kinds of propositional functions quantified were of the forms Ox D Px, OX D ~Px, Ox- Px, and Ox- ~Px. Now we shall be quantifying propositional functions with more complicated internal structures. An example will help make this clear. Consider the argument
    
    (P,): Hotels are both expensive and depressing.
    (P,): Some hotels are shabby.
    Therefore some expensive things are shabby.
    
    This argument, for all its obvious validity, is not amenable to the traditional sort of analysis. True enough, it could be expressed in terms of A and I propositions by using the symbols Hx, Bx, Sx, and Ex to abbreviate the propositional functions "x is a hotel," "x is both expensive and depressing," "x is shabby," and "x is expensive," respectively.* Using these abbreviations, we might propose to symbolize the given argument as
    
    (P,): (%)(Hx D Bx)
    (P,): (AX) (HX - Sx)
    ". (AX) CEX - Sx)
    
    * This would, however, violate the restriction stated in the footnote on p. 478.

    Forcing the argument into the straitjacket of the traditional A and I forms in this way
    obscures its validity. The argument just given in symbols is invalid, although the origi-
    nal argument is perfectly valid. A notation restricted to categorical propositions here
    obscures the logical connection between Bx and Ex. A more adequate analysis is obtained
    by using Hx, Sx, and Ex, as explained, plus Dx as an abbreviation for "x is depressing." By
    using these symbols, the original argument can be translated as
    
    1. (x)[Hx → (Ex → Dx)]
    2. (Ax)(Hx → Sx)
    3. (Ax)(Ex → Sx)
    
    Thus symbolized, a demonstration of its validity is easily constructed. One such demon-
    stration proceeds as follows:
    
    4. Hw → Sw 2, E..
    5. Hw → (Ew → Dw) | 1, ULL.
    6. Hw 3, Simp.
    7. Ew → Dw 4,5, M.P.
    8. Ew 6, Simp.
    9. Sw → Hw 3, Com.
    10. Sw 8, Simp.
    11. Ew → Sw 7,9, Conj.
    12. (Ax)(Ex → Sx) 10, E.G.
    
    In symbolizing general propositions that result from quantifying more complicated
    propositional functions, care must be taken not to be misled by the deceptiveness of
    ordinary English. One cannot translate from English into our logical notation by fol-
    lowing any formal or mechanical rules. In every case, one must understand the meaning
    of the English sentence, and then symbolize that meaning in terms of propositional functions
    and quantifiers.

    Three locutions of ordinary English that are sometimes troublesome are the following. First, note that a statement such as "All athletes are either very strong or very quick" is not a disjunction, although it contains the connective "or." It definitely does not have the same meaning as "Either all athletes are very strong or all athletes are very quick." The former is properly symbolized—using obvious abbreviations—as
    
    (x)[Ax → (Sx ∨ Qx)]
    whereas the latter is symbolized as
    
    (x)(Ax → Sx) ∨ (x)(Ax → Qx)
    
    Second, note that a statement such as "Oysters and clams are delicious," while it can be stated as the conjunction of two general propositions—"Oysters are delicious and clams are delicious"—also can be stated as a single noncompound general proposition, in which case the word "and" is properly symbolized by the "∨" rather than by the ".". The stated proposition is symbolized as
    
    (x)[(Ox ∨ Cx) → Dx]
    not as
    (x)[(Ox ∧ Cx) → Dx]
    
    For to say that oysters and clams are delicious is to say that anything is delicious that is either an oyster or a clam, not to say that anything is delicious that is both an oyster and a clam.
    
    Third, what are called exceptive propositions require very careful attention. Such propositions—for example, "All except previous winners are eligible"—may be treated as the conjunction of two general propositions. Using the example just given, we might reasonably understand the proposition to assert both that previous winners are not eligible, and that those who are not previous winners are eligible. It is symbolized as:
    
    (x)(Px → ¬Ex) ∧ (x)(¬Px → Ex)
    
    The same exceptive proposition may also be translated as a noncompound general proposition that is the universal quantification of a propositional function containing the symbol for material equivalence "=" (a biconditional), and symbolized thus:
    
    (x)(Ex = ¬Px)
    
    which can also be rendered in English as "Anyone is eligible if and only if that person is not a previous winner." Exceptive propositions are most conveniently regarded as quantified biconditionals.

    Whether a proposition is in fact exceptive is sometimes difficult to determine.
    A controversy requiring resolution by a federal court panel illustrates this contextual difficulty. The Census Act, a law that establishes the rules for the conduct of the national census every ten years, contains the following passage:
    
    Sec. 195. Except for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, the Secretary [of Commerce] shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method known as "sampling" in carrying out the provisions of this title.
    
    For the 2000 census, which did determine population for the purposes of apportionment, the Census Bureau sought to use the sampling technique, and was sued by the House of Representatives, which claimed that the passage quoted here prohibits sampling in such a census. The Bureau defended its plan, contending that the passage authorizes the use of sampling in some contexts, but in apportionment contexts leaves the matter undetermined. Which interpretation of that exceptive provision in the statute is correct?
    The court found the House position correct, writing:
    
    Consider the directive "except for my grandmother's wedding dress, you shall take the contents of my closet to the cleaners." It is ... likely that the granddaughter would be upset if the recipient of her directive were to take the wedding dress to the cleaners and subsequently argue that she had left this decision to his discretion. The reason for this result... is because of our background knowledge concerning wedding dresses: We know they are extraordinarily fragile and of deep sentimental value to family members. We therefore would not expect that a decision to take [that] dress to the cleaners would be purely discretionary.
    The apportionment of Congressional representatives among the states is the wedding dress in the closet... . The apportionment function is the "sole constitutional function of the decennial enumeration."
    The manner in which it is conducted may impact not only the distribution of representatives among the states, but also the balance of political power within the House. ... This court finds that the Census Act prohibits the use of statistical sampling to determine the population for the purpose of apportionment of representatives among the states... .
  - |-
    The exceptive proposition in this statute is thus to be understood as asserting the con-
    junction of two propositions: (1) that the use of sampling is not permitted in the context
    of apportionment, and (2) that in all other contexts sampling is discretionary. A contro-
    versial sentence in exceptive form must be interpreted in its context.
    
    In Section 10.5, our list of rules of inference was expanded by four, and we showed
    that the expanded list was sufficient to demonstrate the validity of categorical syl-
    logisms when they are valid. We have just seen that the same expanded list suffices
    to establish the validity of asyllogistic arguments of the type described. Now we may
    observe that, just as the expanded list was sufficient to establish validity in asyllogistic
    arguments, so also the method of proving syllogisms invalid (explained in Section 10.6)
    by describing possible nonempty universes, or models, is sufficient to prove the inva-
    lidity of asyllogistic arguments of the present type as well. The following asyllogistic
    argument,
    
    Managers and superintendents are either competent workers or relatives of the
    owner.
    
    Anyone who dares to complain must be either a superintendent or a relative of the
    owner.
    
    Managers and foremen alone are competent workers.
    
    Someone did dare to complain.
    
    Therefore some superintendent is a relative of the owner.
    
    may be symbolized as
    
    (P,): (X)[(Mx V Sx) 3D (Cx V Rx)]
    (P,): (x) LDx D (Sx V Rx)]
    
    (P,): (X)[(Mx V Fx) = Cx]
    
    (P,): (dx)Dx
    
    ". (Ax)(Sx - Rx)
    
    and we can prove it invalid by describing a possible universe or model containing the
    single individual a and assigning the truth value true to Ca, Da, Fa, Ra, and the truth
    value false to Sa.

    Chapter 10 Btaityay
    
    In Section 10.1, we explained that the analytical techniques of the previous chapters are not adequate to deal with arguments whose validity depends on the inner logical structure of noncompound
    propositions. We described quantification as a theory that, with some additional symbolization, ena-
    bles us to exhibit this inner structure and thereby greatly enhances our analytical powers.
    
    In Section 10.2, we explained singular propositions and introduced the symbols for an indi-
    vidual variable x, for individual constants (lowercase letters a through w), and for attributes (capi-
    tal letters). We introduced the concept of a propositional function, an expression that contains an
    individual variable and becomes a statement when an individual constant is substituted for the indi-
    vidual variable. A proposition may thus be obtained from a propositional function by the process of
    instantiation.
    
    In Section 10.3, we explained how propositions also can be obtained from propositional functions
    by means of generalization, that is, using quantifiers such as "everything," "nothing," and "some."
    We introduced the universal quantifier (x), meaning "given any x," and the existential quantifier (4x),
    meaning "there is at least one x such that." On a square of opposition, we showed the relations between
    universal and existential quantification.
    
    In Section 10.4, we showed how each of the four main types of general propositions,
    
    e A: universal affirmative propositions
    e E: universal negative propositions
    I: particular affirmative propositions
    O: particular negative propositions

    It is correctly symbolized by propositional functions and quantifiers. We also explained the modern interpretation of the relations of A, E, I, and O propositions.
    In Section 10.5, we expanded the list of rules of inference, adding four additional rules:
    
    Universal Instantiation, U.I.
    Universal Generalization, U.G.
    Existential Instantiation, E.I.
    Existential Generalization, E.G.
    
    and showed how, by using these and the other nineteen rules set forth earlier, we can construct a
    formal proof of validity of deductive arguments that depend on the inner structure of noncompound
    propositions.
    
    In Section 10.6, we explained how the method of refutation by logical analogy can be used to prove
    the invalidity of arguments involving quantifiers by creating a model, or possible universe, containing
    exactly one, or exactly two, or exactly three (etc.) individuals and the restatement of the constituent
    propositions of an argument in that possible universe. An argument involving quantifiers is proved invalid
    if we can exhibit a possible universe containing at least one individual, such that the argument's premises
    are true and its conclusion is false in that universe.
    
    In Section 10.7, we explained how we can symbolize and evaluate asyllogistic arguments, those con-
    taining propositions not reducible to A, E, I, and O propositions, or singular propositions. We noted the
    complexity of exceptive propositions and other propositions whose logical meaning must first be under-
    stood and then rendered accurately with propositional functions and quantifiers.

    (x)(Sx D Bx) All spiders both have eight legs and are unwelcome in a lunch box.
    
    (Ax) (Sx - Rx) Some spiders are radioactive.

    However, choices C and D state, unjustifiably, that ALL x that are radioactive are unwelcome in a lunch box, and that anything that is not a spider is not unwelcome in a lunch box—that is, that anything other than a spider would be totally fine in a lunch box. These conclusions are not implied by the argument.

    11.1 Induction and Deduction Revisited
    
    Arguments are built on premises that are believed, or assumed, to be true. Some premises
    we establish by deductive arguments that have preceded, but very many of the premises
    on which we must rely cannot be established by deduction. Our reasoning process usu-
    ally begins with the accepted truth of some "matters of fact," in David Hume's phrase.
    To establish matters of fact we must rely on reasoning that is inductive.
    
    Induction thus provides the starting points—the foundation—for the reasoning that
    concerns us most. We reason to establish truths in our everyday lives, to learn facts
    about our society, to understand the natural world. Deduction is certainly powerful in
    enabling us to move from known (or assumed) propositions to other propositions that
    those premises entail, but in the search for truths with which our reasoning must begin,
    it is insufficient.
  - |-
    The inductive arguments with which we establish matters of fact differ fundamentally from the deductive arguments that were the concern in Part II of this book. One essential contrast between the two families of argument (noted much earlier in our discussion of basic logical concepts, Section 1.5) lies in the relation of the premises to the conclusion in the arguments of the two great families. In deductive arguments, the claim is made that conclusions follow with certainty from their premises. That claim is appropriate because any deductive argument, if it is good, brings to light in its conclusion what was already buried in its premises. The relation between premises and conclusion, in deduction, is one of logical necessity. In every deductive argument, if it is valid and if its premises are true, its conclusion must be true.
    
    In inductive arguments—the concern of this chapter and those that follow—the relation between premises and conclusion is not one of logical necessity. The claim of certainty is not made. The terms valid and invalid simply do not apply. This does not mean that inductive arguments are always weak; sometimes they are very strong indeed, and fully deserve our confidence. Scientists now assert without reservation (for example) that smoking is a cause of cancer. This is true, but it is a truth that cannot be known with the demonstrative certainty of a valid syllogism. If p or q is true, and not p is true, we may conclude that q must be the case, beyond all doubt. It is a truth we establish as an inescapable consequence of the relations of the concepts involved. Empirical truths—about the consequences of smoking, or the causes of cancer, and all others of that sort—cannot satisfy the standard of deductive certainty. By that standard, as one distinguished medical investigator observes, "No one will ever be able to prove that smoking causes cancer, or that anything causes anything."!
  - |-
    In the realm of induction, as we seek new knowledge of facts about the world,
    nothing is beyond all doubt. We must rely on arguments that support their conclusions
    only as probable, or probably true. Some such arguments are of only moderate worth;
    others are very powerful, as we shall see. The strengths and weaknesses of inductive
    arguments, and the techniques for the evaluation of such arguments, are the focus of
    Part III of this book.
    
    Arguments grounded on analogies, aiming to establish particular conclusions, are
    examined first, in this chapter. Arguments that go beyond particulars, aiming to estab-
    lish generally applicable causal laws, are examined in the following chapter. The uses of
    hypotheses and their confirmation in developing scientific theories follows in Chapter 13;
    and we conclude, in Chapter 14, with an analysis of the concept of probability itself, the
    conceptual instrument with which inductive conclusions are commonly expressed.
    
    11.2 Argument by Analogy
    
    The most common type of inductive argument relies on analogy. If I report that I got
    very good service from a computer of a certain make and model, you may infer that a
    new computer of the same make and model will serve you well. That conclusion has
    some degree of probability, but the argument is far from compelling. When a new
    book is called to my attention and I infer that I will enjoy reading it because I have
    read and enjoyed other books by the same author, I may have my confidence in that
    author strengthened when I read the book—or I may be disappointed. Analogy is the
    common ground of our everyday inferences from past experience to what the future
    will hold.
    
    Here follow two more analogical arguments, carefully formulated. The first con-
    cludes, on the basis of what we commonly think to be prudent and fair, that it would be
    prudent and fair to adopt now a major change in public policy:
  - |-
    Some people look on preemployment testing of teachers as unfair—a kind of double jeopardy. "Teachers are already college graduates," they say. "Why should they be tested?" That's easy. Lawyers are college graduates and graduates of professional school, too, but they have to take a bar exam. And a number of other professions ask prospective members to prove that they know their stuff by taking and passing examinations: accountants, actuaries, doctors, architects. There is no reason why teachers shouldn't be required to do this too.
    
    The second illustration is an argument—entirely plausible when first presented two centuries ago—whose conclusion is very probably false:
    
    We may observe a very great similitude between this earth which we inhabit, and the other planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. They all revolve around the sun, as the earth does, although at different distances and in different periods. They borrow all their light from the sun, as the earth does. Several of them are known to revolve around their axis like the earth, and by that means, must have a like succession of day and night. Some of them have moons, that serve to give them light in the absence of the sun, as our moon does to us. They are all, in their motions, subject to the same law of gravitation, as the earth is. From all this similitude, it is not unreasonable to think that those planets may, like our earth, be the habitation of various orders of living creatures. There is some probability in this conclusion from analogy.'

    Neither these arguments, nor those everyday inferences we draw about computers
    and books and the like, are demonstratively valid. Their conclusions are not claimed to
    follow from their premises with logical necessity, and they obviously do not follow with
    certainty. What is appropriate for judging the employability of lawyers and doctors may
    not be appropriate for judging the employability of teachers. The Earth is very likely to be
    the only inhabited planet in our solar system. Your new computer may prove unsuitable
    for the work you do, and I may find my favorite author's latest book intolerably dull. In
    all such arguments it is plainly possible—logically possible—that although the premises
    are true, the conclusions are false. Arguments by analogy are not to be classified as either
    valid or invalid; probability is all that is claimed for them.
    
    In addition to their use in arguments, analogies are very often used nonargumenta-
    tively, for the purpose of lively description. The literary uses of analogy in metaphor and
    simile are tremendously helpful to the writer who strives to create a vivid picture in the
    reader's mind. In the continuing controversy in the United States over immigration, for
    example, one writer expressed his views with a forceful analogy:
    
    I'm a third-generation American. I don't know all the legal details about how my grandparents got here. But
    I do know that they worked very hard, paid their taxes, and raised a son who served his country. Americans
    being against immigration is like a house being against its bricks.
    
    Analogy is also used in explanation, when something that may not be familiar to
    the reader is made somewhat more intelligible by being compared to something else,
    presumably more familiar, to which it has certain similarities. When Eric Lander, the
    director of the Genome Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sought
    to explain the huge eventual impact of the Human Genome Project, analogy was one
    of the devices he used to enhance the understanding of those unfamiliar with genetic
    research:
  - |-
    The genome project is wholly analogous to the creation of the periodic table in chemistry. Just as Mendeleev's arrangement of the chemical elements in the periodic table made coherent a previously unrelated mass of data, so the tens of thousands of genes in present-day organisms will all turn out to be made from combinations of a much smaller number of simpler genetic modules or elements, the primordial genes, so to speak.
    
    Analogies—But No Arguments
    
    Nonargumentative analogies are commonly encountered in the writing of high-school students—and some of these are quite funny. We pause for a chuckle:
    
    1. She grew on him like she was a colony of E. coli and he was room-temperature Canadian beef.
    2. McMurphy fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty bag filled with vegetable soup.
    3. Her hair glistened in the rain, like a nose hair after a sneeze.
    4. Even in his last years, Grandpappy had a mind like a steel trap, only one that had been left out so long it had rusted shut.
    5. He was deeply in love. When she spoke he thought he heard bells, like a garbage truck backing up.
    She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes just before it throws up.
    6. His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants in a dryer without
    Cling Free.
    7. The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when you fry them in hot grease.
    8. The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire
    hydrant.
    9. She walked into my office like a centipede with 98 missing legs.
    
    The use of analogies in description and explanation is not the same as their use in
    argument, though in some cases it may not be easy to decide which use is intended. But
    whether used argumentatively or otherwise, analogy is not difficult to define. To draw
    an analogy between two or more entities is to indicate one or more respects in which
    they are similar.
  - |-
    This definition explains what an analogy is, but there is still the problem of characterizing an argument by analogy. Let us analyze the structure of a particular analogical argument, using a very simple example. Consider the argument that a new car whose purchase I am now contemplating will be very satisfactory because my old car, of the same make and model, has long given very satisfactory service. The two entities that are said to be similar are two cars. Three points of analogy are involved, three respects in which the two entities are said to resemble each other: first, in being cars; second, in being of the same make and model; and third, in serving me well.
    
    The three points of analogy do not play identical roles in the argument, however. The first two occur in the premises, whereas the third occurs both in the premises and in the conclusion. The given argument may be described as having premises that assert, first, that two things are similar in two respects, and second, that one of those things has a further characteristic, from which the conclusion is drawn that the other thing also has that further characteristic.
    
    Analogical argument is one of the most fundamental tools of appellate courts. The inference in a particular case before a court may be shown to be very much like some other inference drawn previously, and if it was clearly correct in that earlier case, it is held to be correct in this one too. In 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court decided unanimously a case requiring the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which gives to every criminal defendant the right "to be confronted with the witnesses against him." Does this forbid the use, at a defendant's trial, of testimony from a witness who is not available for cross-examination, even if the trial judge believes that testimony to be reliable? Yes, said Justice Antonin Scalia, delivering the opinion of the Court, it does.
    
    The right to cross-examine adverse witnesses was firmly established in the English common law at the time our Constitution was adopted. Justice Scalia's subsequent analogy epitomizes the argument of the Court:

    Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation.
    Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with a jury trial
    because a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.®

    A parallel drawn
    between two (or more)
    entities by indicating
    one or more respects in
    which they are similar.
    
    chapter 11 Analogical Reasoning
    
    Analogical
    argument
    
    A kind of inductive
    argument in which,
    from the fact that two
    entities are alike in
    some respect(s), it is
    concluded that they are
    also alike in some other
    respect(s).
    
    Analogical argument is also common in political controversy. Sometimes the analogy
    is effective, sometimes it is far-fetched. The threat of global warming, and the need of our
    country to respond concretely to that threat, was argued heatedly before the Congress of
    the United States, in 2007, by former presidential candidate Al Gore, who described the
    danger as a "planetary emergency." Against those who thought him to be exaggerating
    the dangers, he then argued:
    
    The planet has a fever. If your baby has a fever you go to the doctor. If the doctor says you need to intervene
    here, you don't say "I read a science-fiction novel that says it's not a problem." You take action.'
    
    Not every analogical argument need concern exactly two things or exactly three
    different characteristics, of course. Thus the argument presented earlier, suggesting that
    other planets in our solar system may well be inhabited, draws analogies among six
    things (the then-known planets) in some eight respects. Apart from these numerical dif-
    ferences, however, all analogical arguments have the same general structure or pattern.
    Every analogical argument proceeds from the similarity of two or more things in one or
    more respects to the similarity of those things in some further respect. Schematically, where
    a, b,c, and d are any entities and P, Q, and R are any attributes or "respects," an analogi-
    cal argument may be represented as having the form
    
    a, b, c, d all have the attributes P and Q.
    a, b, c all have the attribute R.
    Therefore d probably has the attribute R.

    **EXERCISES**
    
    All of the following passages contain analogies. Distinguish those passages that contain analogical arguments from those that make nonargumentative uses of analogy.
    
    **Example**
    
    1. A Man ought no more to value himself for being wiser than a Woman, if he owes his Advantage to a better Education, than he ought to boast of his Courage for beating a Man when his hands were bound.
    
    —Mary Astell, *An Essay in Defence of the Female Sex*, 1721
    
    **Solution**
    
    This is an analogical argument. The analogy drawn here is between beating a man when his hands are bound and being wiser than a woman as a consequence of a better education, one party having an enormous advantage in both cases. In the first case, it is plain that one with such an advantage ought not to boast of his courage; in the second case (this argument concludes), it is equally inappropriate for one with such an advantage to boast of his relative wisdom.

    purchase. Some Britons urged that the Marbles be returned to Greece in time for the

    The quest for usable energy from fusion involves the use of interlocked magnetic
    fields to contain very hot (180 million degrees Fahrenheit) and highly compressed
    (to a density 20 times that of lead) electrically charged plasma (a kind of gas) within
    a vacuum chamber. The plasma must never touch the solid walls of its container, for
    if it does it instantly loses its heat and can never be coaxed into undergoing fusion.
    One scientific report put the problem this way:
    
    Everything depends on keeping the plasma's magnetic bottle tightly stoppered . . . [but] confining a dol-

    It is important that we make clear at this point what definition is and what can be
    attained by means of it. It seems frequently to be credited with a creative power; but
    all it accomplishes is that something is marked out in sharp relief and designated by
    a name. Just as the geographer does not create a sea when he draws boundary lines
    and says: the part of the ocean's surface bounded by these lines I am going to call the
    Yellow Sea, so too the mathematician cannot really create anything by his defining.

    Children in school are like children at the doctor's. He can talk himself blue in the
    face about how much good his medicine is going to do them; all they think of is
    how much it will hurt or how bad it will taste. Given their own way, they would
    have none of it.
    
    So the valiant and resolute band of travelers I thought I was leading toward a much
    hoped-for destination turned out instead to be more like convicts in a chain gang,
    forced under threat of punishment to move along a rough path leading nobody
    knew where and down which they could see hardly more than a few steps ahead.
    School feels like this to children: it is a place where they make you go and where
    they tell you to do things and where they try to make your life unpleasant if you
    don't do them or don't do them right.

    ing danger is being pulled tighter and tighter. We're surrounded by darkness and
    danger, and in our desperate search for a way out we keep bumping into each other.
    We look at the fighting down below and the peace and beauty up above. In the
    meantime, we've been cut off by the dark mass of clouds, so that we can go neither
    up nor down. It looms before us like an impenetrable wall, trying to crush us, but not
    yet able to. I can only cry out and implore, "Oh, ring, ring, open wide and let us out!"

    Analogical Reasoning
    
    11.3) Appraising Analogical Arguments
    
    Some analogical arguments are much more cogent than others. Although no argument
    by analogy can be deductively valid, some such arguments yield conclusions that are very
    probably true, whereas others are very weak indeed. Analogical arguments are evaluated
    as better or worse depending on the degree of probability with which, relying on the
    premises they put forward, their conclusions may be affirmed.
    
    Two commonplace examples will help to exhibit the features of analogical argu-
    ments that make them better or worse. Suppose you choose to purchase a given pair of
    shoes because other pairs like it have given you satisfaction in the past; and suppose you
    select a dog of a given breed because other dogs of that same breed have exhibited the
    characteristics that you prize. In both cases, analogical arguments have been relied on. To
    appraise the strength of these sample arguments, and indeed of all analogical arguments,
    six criteria may be distinguished.
    
    1. Number of entities. If my past experience with shoes of a certain kind is limited
    to only one pair that I wore and liked, I will be disappointed although not surprised
    by an apparently similar pair that I find flawed in unexpected ways. But if I have
    repeatedly purchased shoes just like those, I may reasonably suppose that the next
    pair will be as good as the ones worn earlier. Several experiences of the same kind
    with an item of just that sort will support the conclusion—that the purchase will be
    satisfying—much more than will a single instance. Each instance may be thought of
    as an additional entity, and the number of entities is the first criterion in evaluating
    an analogical argument.
  - |-
    As a general rule, the larger the number of entities—that is, cases in our experience—the stronger the argument. However, there is no simple ratio between that number and the probability of the conclusion. Six happy experiences with golden retrievers, intelligent and sweet-tempered dogs, will lead one to conclude that the next golden retriever will also be intelligent and sweet-tempered. However, the conclusion of an analogical argument that has six instances in its premises will not be exactly three times as probable as a similar argument that has two such instances in its premises. Increasing the number of entities is important, but so are other factors.
    
    2. Variety of the instances in the premises. If my previous purchases of those good shoes had been from both a department store and a specialty store, and had been made both in New York and in California, by both mail order and direct sale, I may be confident that it is the shoes themselves and not their seller that accounts for my satisfaction. If my previous golden retrievers were both males and females, acquired both as puppies from breeders and as adults from the humane society, I may be more confident that it is their breed—not their sex or age or source—that accounts for my earlier satisfaction.
    
    We understand this criterion intuitively: The more dissimilar the instances mentioned only in the premises of an analogical argument, the stronger is the argument.
    
    3. Number of similar respects. Among the instances in the premises there may have been various similarities: perhaps the shoes were of the same style, had the same price, were made of the same sort of leather; perhaps the dogs were of the same breed, came from the same breeder at the same age, and so on. All the respects in which the instances in the premises are like one another, and like the instance in the conclusion, increase the probability that the instance in the conclusion will have that further attribute at which the argument is aimed—giving great satisfaction in the case of the new shoes, being of a sweet disposition in the case of a new dog.
    
    This criterion also is rooted in common sense: The greater the number of respects in which the instances in the premises are like one another and like the instance in the conclusion, the stronger is the argument.

    in which the entity in the conclusion is similar to the entities in the premises, the more probable is that conclusion. Again, of course, there is no simple way to decide when the number of similar respects identified is sufficient.
    Relevance. As important as the number of respects shared is the kind of respects in which the instances in the premises are like the instance in the conclusion. If the new pair of shoes, like the previous pairs, is purchased on a Tuesday, that is a likeness that will have no bearing on the satisfaction they give; but if the new pair, like all the previous pairs, had the same manufacturer, that will count heavily. Respects add to the force of the argument when they are relevant (as style of shoe, and price, and material surely are)—and a single highly relevant factor contributes more to the argument than a host of irrelevant similarities.
    
    There will sometimes be disagreement about which attributes really are relevant in establishing the likelihood of our conclusion, but the meaning of relevance itself is not in dispute. One attribute is relevant to another when it is connected to that other, when there is some kind of causal relation between them. That is why identifying causal connections of one kind or another is critical in analogical arguments, and why establishing such connections is often crucial in determining the admissibility of evidence, as relevant or irrelevant, in a court of law.
    
    Analogical arguments can be probable whether they go from cause to effect or from effect to cause. They can even be probable when the attribute in the premise is neither the cause nor the effect of the conclusion's attribute, provided both are the effect of the same cause. A doctor, noting the presence of a certain symptom in her patient, may predict another symptom accurately not because either symptom is the cause of the other, but because they are jointly caused by the same disorder. The color of a manufactured product is most often irrelevant to function, but it may serve as a relevant respect in an argument when that color is very unusual, and shared by the entities in the premises and the conclusion. The color itself may contribute nothing to the function of the product, but it may serve in argument if it is known to be an attribute of the manufacturing process of a unique producer.
    
    The causal connections that are the key to the evaluation of analogical arguments

    can be discovered only empirically, by observation and experiment. The general
    theory of empirical investigation is the central concern of inductive logic, and will
    be discussed at length in the chapters that follow.
    Disanalogies. A disanalogy is a point of difference, a respect in which the case
    we are reasoning about in our conclusion is distinguishable from the cases on which
    the argument is based. Returning to the example of the shoes, if the pair we plan to
    buy looks like those we had owned earlier, but is in fact much cheaper and made by
    a different company, those disanalogies will give us reason to doubt the satisfaction
    they will provide.
    
    What was said earlier about relevance is also important here. Disanalogies
    undermine analogical arguments when the points of difference identified are
    relevant—causally connected to the outcome we are seeking. Investors often pur-
    chase shares of a stock mutual fund on the basis of its successful "track record,"
    
    Disanalogy
    
    In an analogical
    argument, a point of
    difference between
    the cases cited in the
    premises and the case

    conclusion.

    Analogical Reasoning
    
    reasoning that because earlier purchases resulted in capital appreciation, a future
    purchase will do so as well. However, if we learn that the person who managed
    the fund during the period of its profitability has just been replaced, we confront
    a disanalogy that substantially reduces the strength of that analogical argument.
  - |-
    Disanalogies weaken analogical arguments. They are therefore commonly employed  
    in attacking an analogical argument. As critics, we may try to show that the case in  
    the conclusion is different in important ways from the earlier cases, and that what  
    was true of them is not likely to be true of the present case. In the law, where the  
    uses of analogy are pervasive, some earlier case or cases are often offered to a court  
    as a precedent for deciding the case at hand. The argument is analogical. Opposing  
    counsel will seek to distinguish the case at hand from the earlier cases; that is, coun-  
    sel will seek to show that because there is some critical difference between the facts  
    in the case at hand and the facts in those earlier cases, the latter do not serve as  
    good precedents in the present matter. If the differences are great—if the disanalogy  
    is indeed critical—that may demolish the analogical argument that had been put  
    forward.
    
    Because disanalogies are the primary weapon against an analogical argument,  
    whatever can ward off any potential disanalogies will strengthen the argument. This  
    explains why variety among the instances in the premises adds force to an  
    argument. The more the instances in the premises vary from one to another, the  
    less likely it is that a critic will be able to point to some disanalogy between all of  
    them and the conclusion that will weaken the argument. To illustrate, suppose  
    that Kim Kumar comes to a university as a first-year student; ten others from her  
    secondary school have successfully completed studies at the same university. We  
    may argue analogically that in view of her secondary school preparation, she is  
    likely to succeed as well. If all those other students from her school were similar to  
    one another in some respect that bears on college study but differ from Kim in that  
    respect, that disanalogy will undermine the argument for Kim's success. However,  
    if we learn that the ten successful predecessors varied among themselves in many  
    ways—in economic background, in family relations, in religious affiliation, and so  
    on—those differences among them ward off such potential disanalogies. The argu-  
    ment for Kim's success is fortified—as we saw earlier—if the other students from her  
    school serving as instances in the premises of the argument do not resemble each  
    other closely, but exhibit substantial variety.
  - |-
    A confusion must be avoided: The principle that disanalogies weaken analogical arguments is to be contrasted with the principle that differences among the premises strengthen such arguments. In the former, the differences are between the instances in the premises and the instance in the conclusion; in the latter, differences are among the instances in the premises only. A disanalogy is a difference between the cases with which we have experience and the case about which a conclusion is being drawn. That conclusion (we may say in presenting the disanalogy as refutation) is not warranted, because circumstances in the critical case are not similar to circumstances in earlier cases. We say that the analogy is "strained" or that it "does not hold." But when we point to dissimilarities among the premises we are strengthening the argument by saying, in effect, that the analogy has wide force, that it holds in cases like these and in other cases, and that therefore the respects in which the instances in the premises vary are not relevant to the matter with which the conclusion is concerned.
    
    507
    
    11.3. Appraising Analogical Arguments
    
    In summary, disanalogies undermine an analogical argument; dissimilarities among the premises reinforce it. Both considerations are tied to the question of relevance: Disanalogies tend to show that there are relevant respects in which the case in the conclusion differs from those in the premises; dissimilarities among the premises tend to show that other factors, which might have been thought causally relevant to the attribute of interest, are not really relevant at all.
    
    Note that the very first criterion identified, pertaining to the number of entities among which the analogy is said to hold, is also linked to relevance. The greater the number of instances appealed to, the greater is the number of dissimilarities likely to obtain among them. Increasing the number of entities is therefore desirable, but as the number of entities increases, the impact of each additional case is reduced. The dissimilarity it may provide is more likely to have been provided by earlier instances, in which case it will add little or nothing to the protection of the conclusion from damaging disanalogies.
  - |-
    6. The claim made by the conclusion. Every argument makes the claim that its premises give reasons to accept its conclusion. It is easy to see that the more one claims, the greater the burden of sustaining that claim, and that is obviously true for every analogical argument. The modesty of the conclusion relative to the premises is critical in determining the merit of the inference.
    
    If my friend gets 30 miles to the gallon from his new car, I may infer that, were I to acquire a car of the same make and model, I would get at least 20 miles to the gallon; that conclusion is modest and therefore very probable. Were my conclusion much bolder—say, that I would get at least 29 miles to the gallon—it would be less well supported by the evidence I have. The more modest the claim, the less burden is placed on the premises and the stronger the argument; the bolder the claim, the greater is the burden on the premises and the weaker the argument.
    
    An analogical argument is strengthened by reducing the claim made on the basis of the premises affirmed, or by retaining the claim unchanged while supporting it with additional or more powerful premises. Likewise, an analogical argument is weakened if its conclusion is made bolder while its premises remain unchanged, or if the claim remains unchanged while the evidence in its support is found to exhibit greater frailty.

    A. For each of the following arguments by analogy, six additional premises are suggested. For each of these alternative premises, decide whether its addition would make the conclusion of the resulting argument more or less probable. Identify the criterion of appraisal that justifies this judgment, and explain how that criterion applies to the given case.

    plans to purchase stock in an eastern oil company this year, too.

    years, instead of for only five years.

    Solution
    
    a. More probable. Number of similar respects. The change provides an additional respect
    in which the instance in the conclusion is the same as those in the premises.
    b. More probable. Number of entities. With this change the number of entities in the
    premises is substantially increased.
    c. More probable. Claim made by the conclusion. With this change in the premises, the
    conclusion, although unchanged, is now, relatively speaking, substantially more
    modest.
    d. More probable. Variety among the premises. With this change, the dissimilarity
    among the instances in the premises is clearly established.
    e. Less probable. Disanalogy. With this change in the premises, a significant differ-
    ence between the instance in the conclusion and the instances in the premises is
    introduced.
    f. Neither. Relevance. It is unlikely that the dividends paid by tobacco companies would
    have any impact on the profitability of oil companies or the price of their shares.

    Look round the world: contemplate the whole and every part of it: you will find it  
    to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser  
    machines, which again admit of subdivisions, to a degree beyond what human senses  
    and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most  
    minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admi-  
    ration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to  
    ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the produc-  
    tion of human contrivance, of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence.  
    Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of  
    analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of Nature is somewhat  
    similar to the mind of men; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned  
    to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed. By this argument a posteriori,  
    and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his  
    similarity to human mind and intelligence.

    good swimmers, and live in the sea. To the zoologist who examines these animals
    more closely, the shark has gills, cold blood, and scales; the porpoise has lungs, warm
    blood, and hair. The porpoise is fundamentally more like man than like the shark
    and belongs, with man, to the mammals—a group that nurses its young with milk.
    Having decided that the porpoise is a mammal, the zoologist can, without further
    examination, predict that the animal will have a four-chambered heart, bones of a
    particular type, and a certain general pattern of nerves and blood vessels. Without
    using a microscope the zoologist can say with reasonable confidence that the red
    blood cells in the blood of the porpoise will lack nuclei. This ability to generalize
    about animal structure depends upon a system for organizing the vast amount of
    knowledge about animals.

    Good swimmers, and live in the sea. To the zoologist who examines these animals  
    more closely, the shark has gills, cold blood, and scales; the porpoise has lungs, warm  
    blood, and hair. The porpoise is fundamentally more like man than like the shark  
    and belongs, with man, to the mammals—a group that nurses its young with milk.  
    Having decided that the porpoise is a mammal, the zoologist can, without further  
    examination, predict that the animal will have a four-chambered heart, bones of a  
    particular type, and a certain general pattern of nerves and blood vessels. Without  
    using a microscope the zoologist can say with reasonable confidence that the red  
    blood cells in the blood of the porpoise will lack nuclei. This ability to generalize  
    about animal structure depends upon a system for organizing the vast amount of  
    knowledge about animals.

    . The body is the substance of the soul; the soul is the functioning of the body. ...  
    
    The relationship of the soul to its substance is like that of sharpness to a knife, while  
    the relationship of the body to its functioning is like that of a knife to sharpness.  
    What is called sharpness is not the same as the knife, and what is called the knife  
    is not the same as sharpness. Nevertheless, there can be no knife if the sharpness  
    is discarded, nor sharpness if the knife is discarded. I have never heard of sharp-  
    ness surviving if the knife is destroyed, so how can it be admitted that the soul can  
    remain if the body is annihilated?

    electrons one by one in a Geiger counter, as we count the stars one by one on a
    photographic plate. In what sense can an electron be called more unobservable than
    a star? I am not sure whether I ought to say that I have seen an electron; but I have
    just the same doubt whether I have seen a star. If I have seen one, I have seen the
    other. I have seen a small disc of light surrounded by diffraction rings which has not
    the least resemblance to what a star is supposed to be; but the name "star" is given
    to the object in the physical world which some hundreds of years ago started a chain
    of causation which has resulted in this particular light-pattern. Similarly in a Wilson
    expansion chamber I have seen a trail not in the least resembling what an electron
    is supposed to be; but the name "electron" is given to the object in the physical
    world which has caused this trail to appear. How can it possibly be maintained that
    a hypothesis is introduced in one case and not in the other?

    Just as the bottom of a bucket containing water is pressed more heavily by the
    weight of the water when it is full than when it is half empty, and the more heavily
    the deeper the water is, similarly the high places of the earth, such as the summits
    of mountains, are less heavily pressed than the lowlands are by the weight of the
    mass of the air. This is because there is more air above the lowlands than above the
    mountain tops; for all the air along a mountain side presses upon the lowlands but
    not upon the summit, being above the one but below the other.

    Now if we survey the universe, so far as it falls under our knowledge, it bears a great
    resemblance to an animal or organized body and seems actuated with a like principle
    of life and motion. A continual circulation of matter in it produces no disorder: a
    continual waste in every part is incessantly repaired; the closest sympathy is per-
    ceived throughout the entire system: and each part or member, in performing its
    proper offices, operates both to its own preservation and to that of the whole. The
    world, therefore, I infer, is an animal, and the Deity is the soul of the world, actuat-
    ing it, and actuated by it.

    11.4) Refutation by Logical Analogy
    
    "You should say what you mean," [said the March Hare, reproving Alice sharply. ]
    "| do," Alice hastily replied; "at least—at least | mean what | say—that's the same thing, you know."
    "Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter. "Why, you might just as well say that ‘I see what | eat' is the
    same thing as ‘I eat what | see'! "
    
    11.4 Refutation by Logical Analogy
    
    "You might just as well say," added the March Hare, "that ‘I like what | get' is the same thing as ‘I get
    what | like'!"
    "You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, which seemed to be talking in its sleep, "that ‘| breathe
    when | sleep' is the same thing as ‘I sleep when | breathe'! "
    "It is the same thing with you," said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped.
    —Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
  - |-
    The Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse all seek to refute Alice's claim—that meaning what you say is the same as saying what you mean—by using a logical analogy. The form of an argument, as distinct from its particular content, is the most important aspect of that argument from a logical point of view. Therefore, we often seek to demonstrate the weakness of a given argument by stating another argument, known to be erroneous, that has the same logical form.
    
    In the realm of deduction, a refuting analogy for a given argument is an argument that has the same form as the given argument but whose premises are known to be true and whose conclusion is known to be false. The refuting analogy is therefore known to be invalid, and the argument under attack, because it has the same form, is thus shown to be invalid as well. This is the same principle that underlies the testing of categorical syllogisms explained in Section 6.2, and it also underlies the repeated emphasis on the centrality of logical form, as explained in Section 8.5.
    
    In the realm of inductive argument, our present concern, the technique of refutation by logical analogy, can also be used to great effect. Scientific, political, or economic arguments, not purporting to be deductive, may be countered by presenting other arguments that have very similar designs and whose conclusions are known to be false or are generally believed to be improbable. Inductive arguments differ fundamentally from deductive arguments in the character of the support claimed to be given to the conclusion by the premises. All arguments, however, inductive as well as deductive, may be said to have some underlying form or pattern. If, when confronted by an inductive argument we wish to attack, we can present another inductive argument that has essentially the same form but is clearly flawed and whose conclusion is very doubtful, we throw similar doubt on the conclusion of the argument being examined.

    Consider the following illustration. In two highly controversial cases before the U.S.
    Supreme Court in 2007,' the central issue was the constitutionality of the consideration
    of race by school boards in the assignment of students to public schools. In an editorial,
    the New York Times supported the race-conscious systems as fair, and called the objec-
    tions to it "an assault on local school control." A prominent critic of the race-based
    systems wrote a critical response to that editorial, within which appeared the following
    passage:
    
    You argue that the race-based system "is applied to students of all races" and "does not advantage or
    disadvantage any particular racial group." But, of course, the same argument might have been made in
    defense of miscegenation statutes, which forbade blacks from marrying whites as well as whites from
    marrying blacks.°
    
    The technique of refutation by logical analogy is here very keenly exemplified; the focus
    is on the form of the two arguments. The argument under attack has the same form
    as that of another argument whose unsatisfactoriness is now universally understood.
    We surely would not say that miscegenation statutes are acceptable because they apply
    chapter 11
    
    Analogical Reasoning
    
    equally to all races. Some policies involving the use of race by the state are not acceptable
    (the critic argues) even when it is true that no particular racial group is disadvantaged
    by that use. By highlighting such unacceptability in some well-known settings (regula-
    tions governing marriage), he strikes a sharp blow against the argument in this setting
    that relies on the claim that no particular racial group is disadvantaged by the race-based
    policy under attack.
    
    The presentation of a refutation by logical analogy is often signaled by the appear-
    ance of some revealing phrase: "You might just as well say," or some other words having
    that sense. In the example just given, the telltale phrase is "the same argument might
    have been made... ." In another context, the argument that because Islamic culture
    had been brought to the country of Chad from without, it is no more than an Islamic
    overlay, is attacked with the refuting analogy of a scholar who introduces the refutation
    with a slightly different set of words: "One could as sensibly say that France has only a
    Christian overlay."!°
  - |-
    When the point of the refuting analogy is manifest, no introductory phrases may be needed. The former governor of Mississippi, Kirk Fordice, argued that "It is a simple fact that the United States is a Christian nation" because "Christianity is the predominant religion in America." Journalist Michael Kinsley, with whom Fordice was debating on television, responded with these telling analogies: "Women are a majority in this country. Does that make us a female country? Or does it make us a white country because most people in this country are white?"
    
    A careless effort to refute an argument with an analogy can backfire when the allegedly refuting argument differs importantly from the target argument in ways that tend to reinforce the one that is under attack. This is illustrated by a recent exchange on the highly controversial topic of global warming. Newspaper columnist John Tierney raised some serious questions about the wisdom of immediate large-scale efforts to combat an apparent but uncertain climate trend. A critic, Ray Sten, responded in this way:
    
    John Tierney suggests that we not worry much about climate change because its consequences are uncertain and far in the future, and in the meantime somebody may discover a technological quick fix. That's like telling a smoker not to worry because it's not certain whether he'll develop cancer, and besides, a cure may have been found by then. Call me a worry wart, but I'd quit smoking.
    
    The immediate and large-scale steps whose wisdom Tierney questions are thus likened to quitting smoking. There is, however, an important contrast between those two. Quitting has no economic costs (and even some economic benefits), while industrial changes designed to cut greenhouse gases by reducing the use of fossil fuels will probably be very costly. In presenting an analogy intended to refute Tierney, Mr. Sten (whose position on global warming may well be correct) undermines his cause by indirectly calling attention to the costs of the change he seeks to advance.

    | sympathize with their plight. | would also suggest that we change the name of the Pioneers of Ann Arbor
    Pioneer High School. My forefathers were pioneers and I'm sure they would be devastated that a school
    adopted their name as a team mascot. That name and mascot are a direct slap against my people.

    While we are at it, we had better change the names of the Cowboys, Fighting Irish, Celtics, Hoosiers,
    Sooners, Boilermakers, Packers, Aggies, Oilers, Mountaineers, Friars, Patriots, Volunteers and Tar Heels,
    to name a few, because I'm sure those names are equally demeaning and degrading to those groups
    as well....
    
    And here is a rather amusing one from Justice Antonin Scalia:
    
    Justice Scalia argues that we should never, ever, use the word "choate." Scalia wrote: "There is no such word
    as choate. Choate is to inchoate as sult is to insult." '*
    
    To conclude, here is a letter signed by a scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic
    Institution, responding to the claim that there is "plentiful" water on the moon.
    
    No one except William S. Marshall has claimed "large quantities of water" or "plentiful lunar water." The
    chief scientist of the recent lunar mission described the target crater as "probably a little wetter than the
    Atacama desert in Chile." It's as if Martians had targeted the right South African mine, observed a diamond,
    and then proclaimed that "diamonds are plentiful on Earth."
    
    Refutation by analogy, when well designed, can be exceedingly effective. If the argu-
    
    ment presented as a refuting analogy is plainly rotten, and it does indeed have the
    same form as that of the argument under attack, that target argument must be seriously
    wounded.

    Summary
    
    In this chapter we began the analysis of induction. Section 11.1 reviewed the fundamental distinction between deductive arguments, which claim certainty for their conclusions, and inductive arguments, which make no such claim. The terms validity and invalidity do not apply to inductive arguments, whose conclusions can only have some degree of probability of being true.
    
    In Section 11.2 we explained argument by analogy. An analogy is a likeness or comparison; we draw an analogy when we indicate one or more respects in which two or more entities are similar. An argument by analogy is an argument whose premises assert the similarity of two or more entities in one or more respects, and whose conclusion is that those entities are similar in some further respect. Its conclusion, like that of every inductive argument, can be no more than probable.
    
    In Section 11.3 we explained six criteria used in determining whether the premises of an analogical argument render its conclusion more or less probable. These criteria are:
    
    The number of entities among which the analogy is said to hold.
    
    The variety, or degree of dissimilarity, among those entities or instances mentioned only in the premises.
  - |-
    The number of respects in which the entities involved are said to be analogous.
    
    The relevance of the respects mentioned in the premises to the further respect mentioned in the
    conclusion.
    
    5. The number and importance of disanalogies between the instances mentioned only in the premises
    and the instance mentioned in the conclusion.
    
    6. The modesty (or boldness) of the conclusion relative to the premises.
    
    DS
    
    In Section 11.4 we explained refutation by logical analogy. To show that a given argument (whether
    inductive or deductive) is mistaken, one effective method is to present another argument, which is plainly
    mistaken, and whose form is the same as that of the argument under attack.

    12.1) Cause and Effect
  - |-
    Induction goes far beyond analogical arguments. When we know, or think we know, that one thing is the cause of another, or the effect of another, we can reason from cause to effect, or from effect to cause. If the supposed relations between cause and effect have been correctly established, the reasoning based on those relations is very powerful.
    
    Causal reasoning is also of the very greatest practical importance. Our ability to control our environment, to live successfully and to achieve our purposes, depends critically on our knowledge of causal connections. To cure some disease, for example, physicians must know its cause—and of course they must learn the effects (including the side effects) of the drugs they administer.
    
    In every sphere in which we take action and seek to achieve some result, the relation of cause and effect is fundamental. David Hume, one of the keenest of all thinkers in this arena, wrote:
    
    All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the relation of Cause and Effect. By means of that relation alone we can go beyond the evidence of our memory and senses. If you were to ask a man, why he believes any matter of fact, which is absent; for instance, that his friend is in the country, or in France; he would give you a reason; and this reason would be some other fact; as a letter received from him, or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promises. A man finding a watch or any other machine in a desert island, would conclude that there had once been men in that island. All our reasonings concerning fact are of the same nature. .. . If we would satisfy ourselves, therefore, concerning the nature of that evidence, which assures us of matters of fact, we must enquire how we arrive at the knowledge of cause and effect.
  - |-
    The methods by which we arrive at such knowledge are the central concern of this  
    chapter. This matter is complicated, however, by the fact that there are several different  
    meanings of the word "cause." Therefore we begin by distinguishing these meanings  
    from one another.  
    
    Things do not just happen. Events take place under certain conditions, and it is an axiom  
    in the study of nature that to understand the world in which we live we must seek to learn  
    the conditions under which events do or do not happen. It is customary to distinguish  
    between the necessary and the sufficient conditions for the occurrence of an event.  
    
    A necessary condition for the occurrence of a specified event is a circumstance in  
    whose absence the event cannot occur. For example, the presence of oxygen is a necessary  
    condition for combustion to occur. If combustion occurs, then oxygen must have been  
    present, because in the absence of oxygen there can be no combustion.  
    
    A sufficient condition for the occurrence of an event is a circumstance in whose  
    presence the event must occur. The presence of oxygen is a necessary condition for  
    combustion, as we noted, but it is not a sufficient condition for combustion to occur—  
    because it is obvious that oxygen can be present without combustion occurring. For  
    almost any substance, however, there is some range of temperature such that being in  
    that range of temperature in the presence of oxygen is a sufficient condition for the  
    combustion of that substance. So it is clear that for the occurrence of an event there  
    may be several necessary conditions—and all of those necessary conditions must be  
    included in the sufficient condition of that event.  
    
    Now, the word "cause" is used (with respect to some event) sometimes to mean "the  
    necessary condition of that event," and sometimes to mean "the sufficient condition  
    of that event." It is most often used in the sense of necessary condition when the prob-  
    lem at hand is the elimination of some undesirable phenomenon. To eliminate it, one  
    need only find some condition that is necessary to the existence of that phenomenon,  
    and then eliminate that condition. What virus or bacterium is the cause of a certain  
    illness? The physician cures the illness by administering a drug that will destroy those  
    germs. The germs are said to be the cause of the disease in that they are a necessary condi-  
    tion for it—because in their absence the disease cannot occur.
  - |-
    However, the word "cause" is also commonly used to mean sufficient condition—
    especially when we are interested in the production of something desired, rather than
    the elimination of something undesirable. The metallurgist aims to discover what will
    produce greater strength in metal alloys, and when it is found that a certain process of
    mixed heating and cooling has that desired result, we say that such a process is the cause
    of the increased strength of the alloy. It is correct to use the word "cause" in the one
    sense (necessary condition), or in the other (sufficient condition), but one should be clear
    about which of those meanings is intended.
    
    Closely related to sufficient condition is another sense of the word "cause"'—when a
    given phenomenon tends to have a causative role in the production of certain outcomes.
    For example, it is indeed correct to say that "smoking causes lung cancer," even though
    smoking cigarettes may long continue without having cancer as its result. Smoking is
    certainly not a necessary condition of lung cancer, because many such cancers arise in
    the total absence of smoking. But smoking cigarettes, in conjunction with very common
    biological circumstances, so frequently plays a role in the development of lung cancer
    that we think it correct to report that smoking is a "cause" of cancer.
    
    This points to yet another common use of the word "cause"—cause as the one factor
    that was critical in the occurrence of some phenomenon. An insurance company sends
    investigators to determine the cause of a mysterious fire. The investigators are likely to lose
    their jobs if they report that it was the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere that was the
    fire's cause—and yet of course it was (in the sense of necessary condition), for had there
    been no oxygen present there would have been no fire. Nor is the sufficient condition of
    the fire of interest to the company, for if the investigators reported that, although they

    is used when inferences  
    are drawn both from  
    cause to effect and from  
    effect to cause.
    
    Had proof the fire was deliberately ignited by the policyholder, they had not yet been able  
    to learn all the necessary conditions of the fire and therefore had not yet determined its  
    full cause, they would certainly lose their jobs! What the company was seeking to discover  
    was the incident or action that, in the presence of those conditions that usually prevail,  
    made the difference between the occurrence and nonoccurrence of the fire.
    
    In the real world, a huge man, forcibly resisting arrest, died shortly after having been  
    beaten into submission by police officers in Cincinnati, Ohio, in November 2003. The  
    county coroner investigating the death held it to be a "homicide," carefully noting that  
    hostile or malign intent is not implied by that word. "Absent the struggle," the coroner  
    said, "Mr. Jones would not have died at that precise moment in time, and the struggle  
    therefore is the primary cause of his death." This sense of cause as "critical factor" is  
    common and useful.
  - |-
    There are subdivisions of this third sense of cause. When there is a causal sequence—
    a chain of events in which A causes B, B causes C, C causes D, and D causes E—we may
    regard the outcome, E, as the effect of any one of those preceding events. The death
    described above (symbolized by E) was caused by the struggle, the struggle (D) was caused
    by the resistance, the resistance (C) was caused by the arrest, the arrest (B) was caused
    by some violation of law (A), and so on. We distinguish between the remote cause and
    the proximate cause of FE. The proximate cause is the event closest to it in the chain
    of events. The death, E, is the result of the proximate cause of the struggle, D; the other
    causes are remote: A more remote than B, B more remote than C, and so on.
    
    Persons who leave school before the age of 16 are five times more likely than university
    graduates to die from a heart attack; and the death rate within one year of a heart
    attack is 3.5 percent for college graduates but 20 percent for those with fewer than eight
    years of formal schooling. But a college education is not the proximate cause of good
    health, nor is ignorance the proximate cause of disease. A poor education is a link in the
    causal chain, often resulting in a less adequate understanding of the disease process and
    thus a failure to make the lifestyle changes needed to promote better medical outcomes.
    So it is commonly and correctly observed that poverty, affecting education almost universally,
    is one of the "root causes" of poor health—not its proximate cause, of course,
    but a remote cause that needs uprooting.
  - |-
    The several different senses of the word "cause" need to be distinguished. We can legitimately infer cause from effect only when by cause is meant necessary condition. We can infer effect from cause only when by cause is meant sufficient condition. When inferences are drawn both from cause to effect and from effect to cause, the word "cause" must be used in the sense of necessary and sufficient condition—the cause regarded as the sufficient condition of the event and that sufficient condition regarded as the conjunction of all its necessary conditions. No single definition of cause conforms to all the different (and reasonable) uses of that word.
    
    12.2) Causal Laws and the Uniformity of Nature
    
    Every use of the word "cause," whether in everyday life or in science, involves or presupposes the doctrine that cause and effect are uniformly connected. We will allow that some particular circumstance was the cause of some particular effect only if we agree that any other circumstance of that type will (if the attendant circumstances are sufficiently similar) cause another effect of the same kind as the first. In other words, similar causes produce similar effects. As we use the word "cause," part of its meaning is that every occurrence of a cause producing some effect is an instance or example of the general causal law that such circumstances are always accompanied by such phenomena. If it can be shown that in another situation, after an occurrence of that supposed cause, the supposed effect did not occur, we will relinquish the belief that the one is the cause of the other.
    
    Because every assertion that a particular circumstance was the cause of a particular phenomenon implies the existence of some causal law, every assertion of causal connection contains a critical element of generality. A causal law, as we use the term, asserts that a circumstance of such-and-such kind is invariably attended by a phenomenon of a specified kind, no matter where or when it occurs.
  - |-
    How can we come to know such general truths? The causal relation is not purely  
    logical or deductive; as David Hume emphasized, it cannot be discovered by any a priori  
    reasoning.* Causal laws can be discovered only empirically, a posteriori, by an appeal to  
    experience. But our experiences are always of particular circumstances, particular phenom-  
    ena, and particular sequences of them. We may observe several instances of a circumstance  
    (call it C), and every instance that we observe may be accompanied by an instance of a  
    certain kind of phenomenon (call it P). However, we will have experienced only some  
    of the instances of C in the world, and our observations can therefore show us only that  
    some cases of C are attended by P. Yet our aim is to establish a general causal relation.  
    How are we to get from the particulars we experience to the general proposition that all  
    cases of C are attended by P—which is involved in saying that C causes P?
    
    12.3, Induction by Simple Enumeration
    
    When we assert that all cases of C are attended by P—that is, when we affirm a general  
    causal relation—we have gone beyond analogy. The process of arriving at universal  
    propositions from the particular facts of experience is called inductive generaliza-  
    tion. Suppose we dip blue litmus paper into acid and it turns red. Suppose we do this  
    three times, or ten times, always with the same result. What conclusion do we draw?  
    By analogy we may draw a particular conclusion about what will happen to the color  
    of the next piece of litmus paper we dip in acid—the fourth or the eleventh. We may  
    draw a general conclusion about what will happen to every piece of blue litmus paper  
    when it is dipped in acid. If we do the latter, it is with an inductive generalization that  
    our argument concludes.
    
    When the premises of an argument report a number of instances in which two  
    attributes (or circumstances, or phenomena) occur together, we may infer by analogy

    * Hume wrote: "But to convince us that all the laws of nature, and all the operations of bodies without exception,
    are known only by experience, the following reflections may, perhaps, suffice. Were any object presented to us, and
    were we required to pronounce concerning the effect, which will result from it, without consulting past observa-
    tion, after what manner, | beseech you, must the mind proceed in this operation? It must invent or imagine some
    event, which it ascribes to the object as its effect; and it is plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary. The
    mind can never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause, by the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For
    the effect is totally different from the cause, and consequently can never be discovered in it... . A stone or piece
    of metal raised into the air, and left without any support, immediately falls; but to consider the matter a priori, is
    there anything we can discover in this situation which can beget the idea of a downward, rather than an upward,
    or any other motion, in the stone or metal? .. . In vain, therefore, should we pretend to determine any single event,
    or infer any cause or effect, without the assistance of observation and experience." (An Enquiry Concerning Human
    Understanding, 1748, sec. IV).

    Instance 1 of phenomenon E is accompanied by circumstance C.
    Instance 2 of phenomenon E is accompanied by circumstance C.
    Instance 3 of phenomenon E is accompanied by circumstance C.
    Therefore every instance of phenomenon E is accompanied by circumstance C.
    
    is an induction by simple enumeration. An induction by simple enumeration
    is very similar to an argument by analogy, differing only in having a more general
    conclusion.
    
    Simple enumeration is often used in establishing causal connections. Where a num-
    ber of instances of a phenomenon are invariably accompanied by a certain type of cir-
    cumstance, it is only natural to infer the existence of a causal relationship between
    them. Since the circumstance of dipping blue litmus paper in acid is accompanied in
    all observed instances by the phenomenon of the paper turning red, we infer by simple
    enumeration that dipping blue litmus paper in acid is the cause of its turning red. The
    analogical character of such an argument is quite apparent.
    
    Because of the great similarity between argument by simple enumeration and argu-
    ment by analogy, similar criteria for appraisal apply to both. Some arguments by simple
    enumeration may establish their conclusions with a higher degree of probability than
    others. The greater the number of instances appealed to, the greater is the probability of
    the conclusion. The various instances or cases of phenomenon E accompanied by circum-
    stance C are often called confirming instances of the causal law asserting that C causes E.
    The greater the number of confirming instances, the greater is the probability of the causal
    law—other things being equal. Thus the first criterion for analogical arguments also applies
    directly to arguments by simple enumeration.
    
    In a historical report, simple enumeration can provide persuasive grounds for infer-
    ring a causal relationship. To illustrate, legislative acts called "bills of attainder," designed
    to savage some individual or group temporarily out of favor, are known to endanger their
    advocates when the pendulum of political power swings. The accuser today becomes the
    victim tomorrow. Condemning such a bill of attainder (aimed at Thomas Osborne, Earl
    of Danbury) in the British House of Lords, the Earl of Carnarvon drove the point home
    in 1678 with the following enumeration:
  - |-
    My Lords, I understand... not a little of our English history, from which I have learnt the mischiefs of prosecutions such as these, and the ill fate of the prosecutors. I shall go no further back than the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, at which time the Earl of Essex was run down by Sir Walter Raleigh, and your Lordships well know what became of Sir Walter Raleigh. My Lord Bacon, he ran down Sir Walter Raleigh, and your Lordships know what became of my Lord Bacon. The Duke of Buckingham, he ran down my Lord Bacon, and your Lordships know what happened to the Duke of Buckingham. Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, ran down the Duke of Buckingham, and you all know what became of him. Sir Harry Vane, he ran down the Earl of Strafford, and your Lordships know what became of Sir Harry Vane. Chancellor Hyde, he ran down Sir Harry Vane, and your Lordships know what became of the Chancellor. Sir Thomas Osborne, now Earl of Danby, ran down Chancellor Hyde.
    
    What will now become of the Earl of Danby, your Lordships best can tell. But let me see that man that dare run the Earl of Danby down, and we shall soon see what will become of him.
    
    12.4 Methods of Causal Analysis
    
    Rhetorically effective though this recounting of instances may be, it does not provide a trustworthy argument. The conclusion—that there is a causal connection between malicious accusation and subsequent destruction—appeals to six confirming instances, but by the very nature of those instances we cannot distinguish which are confirming instances of a genuine causal law and which are mere historical accidents.
  - |-
    The heart of the difficulty is this: The method of simple enumeration takes no  
    account—can take no account—of exceptions to the causal law being suggested. Any  
    alleged causal law may be overthrown by a single negative case, for any one disconfirming  
    instance shows that what had been proposed as a "law" was not truly general. Exceptions  
    disprove the rule—for an exception (or "negative instance") is either one in which the  
    alleged cause is found and is not followed by the alleged effect (in this historical case,  
    a bill of attainder whose author did not suffer a like fate), or one in which the effect is  
    encountered while the alleged cause is absent—where (using our earlier schema) C is pre-  
    sent without E, or E is present without C. In an argument by simple enumeration there is  
    no place for either of these; the only legitimate premises in such an argument are reports  
    of instances in which both the alleged cause and the alleged effect are present.
    
    Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Bacon, in The Advancement of Learning (1605),  
    clearly identified the shortcomings of induction by simple enumeration. He wrote: "The  
    induction that proceeds by simple enumeration is childish; its conclusions are precari-  
    ous, and exposed to peril from a contradictory instance; and it generally reaches decision  
    on too small a number of facts, and on those only that are on hand."
    
    It is thus a grave weakness of simple enumeration arguments that, if we confine  
    ourselves to them exclusively, we will not look for, and are therefore unlikely even to  
    notice, the negative or disconfirming instances that might otherwise be found. For this  
    reason, despite their fruitfulness and value in suggesting causal laws, inductions by simple  
    enumeration are not at all suitable for testing causal laws. Yet such testing is essential; to  
    accomplish it we must rely upon other types of inductive arguments—and to these we  
    turn now.
    
    12.4, Methods of Causal Analysis
  - |-
    The classic formulation of the methods central to all induction were given in the
    nineteenth century by John Stuart Mill (in A System of Logic, 1843). His systematic
    account of these methods has led logicians to refer to them as Mill's methods of inductive
    inference. The techniques themselves—five are commonly distinguished—were certainly
    not invented by him, nor should they be thought of as merely a product of nineteenth-
    century thought. On the contrary, these are universal tools of scientific investigation.
    The names Mill gave to them are still in use, as are Mill's precise formulations of what
    he called the "canons of induction." These techniques of investigation are permanently
    useful. Present-day accounts of discoveries in the biological, social, and physical sciences
    commonly report the methodology used as one or another variant (or combination) of
    these five techniques of inductive inference called Mill's methods. They are:
    
    1. The method of agreement
    
    2. The method of difference
    
    3. The joint method of agreement and difference
    
    4. The method of residues
    
    5. The method of concomitant variation
    
    Mill's methods
    The five patterns of
    inductive inference,
    analyzed and
    formulated by John
    Stuart Mill, with
    which hypotheses
    are confirmed or
    disconfirmed.
    
    chapter 12 Causal Reasoning
    
    Method of
    agreement
    
    A pattern of inductive
    inference in which
    
    it is concluded that,
    
    if two or more
    instances of a given
    phenomenon have
    only one circumstance
    in common, that one
    common circumstance
    is the cause (or effect)
    of the phenomenon.
    
    We will examine each of these in turn, presenting Mill's classic statement of each (with
    one exception), followed by explication and illustration. These are the techniques on
    which science does and will rely in the search for causal laws.
    
    A. The Method of Agreement
    
    John Stuart Mill wrote:
    
    If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common,
    the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree, is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon.
  - |-
    This method goes beyond simple enumeration in that it seeks not only to discover the repeated conjunction of cause with effect, but also to identify the only circumstance, the one circumstance, that is invariably associated with the effect, or phenomenon, in which we are interested. This is an essential, and exceedingly common, tool of scientific inquiry. In searching for the cause of some deadly epidemic, for example, or in searching for the cause of some geological phenomenon, the epidemiologist or geologist will seek out the special circumstances that in every instance attend that result. In what way, they ask, do apparently differing sets of circumstances agree, where that result is produced?
    
    Imagine, among the residents of some residence hall, a rash of stomach upsets, whose cause we must learn. The first line of inquiry naturally will be: What food or foods were eaten by all those who fell ill? Foods that were eaten by some but not all of those afflicted are not likely to be the cause of the outbreak; we want to know what circumstance can be found to be common to every case of the illness. Of course, what turns out to be common may not be a food; it may be the use of some infected utensil, or proximity to some noxious effluent, or other circumstance. Only when some circumstance is found in which all the cases of the illness agree are we on the way to the solution of the problem.
    
    Schematically, the method of agreement may be represented as follows, where capital letters represent circumstances and lowercase letters denote phenomena:
    
    ABCD occur together with w x y z.  
    AEF G occur together with w tu v.  
    Therefore A is the cause (or the effect) of w.
  - |-
    This method is particularly useful in identifying a kind of phenomenon, or a range of circumstances, whose investigation holds scientific promise. In molecular genetics, for example, the search for the causes of some inherited disease can be greatly narrowed down using the method of agreement. Is there a common factor among families in which some specific disorder is prevalent? By examining the genetic makeup of such families, then closing in on those genetic factors that are found in such families but are not found commonly in others, the chromosome (and sometimes the site on that chromosome) where the inherited defect lies may be identified. This has proved a very effective method in tracing the cause of some diseases.
    
    Similarly, the fluoridation of water in developed areas around the globe was the consequence of the discovery, more than half a century ago, that in cities where the rates of dental decay were unusually low, the one circumstance in common was an unusually high level of fluorine in the water supply. To confirm the causal connection, two cities of comparable size along the Hudson River—Newburgh and Kingston, New York—were closely studied in the 1940s; Newburgh's water was treated with fluoride, Kingston's had no fluoride. The statistics proved remarkable: Children in Newburgh showed a 70 percent reduction in cavities by the time they reached 14 years of age—and yet there were no differences between the two cities in rates of cancer, birth defects, or heart disease. The full explanation of this prevention of cavities could not be given at that time, but enough was known to justify the fluoridation of municipal water systems.

    The method of agreement is widely powerful. A very promising development in the effort to help smokers break their addiction to nicotine was the discovery, reported in Science in 2007, that in a small number of persons who had suffered an injury to a particular region of their brains called the insula, the desire to smoke was immediately lost! Something in the insula appears to be a critical element in addiction. When statistical analyses of the data were completed, said a lead investigator from the University of Southern California, "it turned out that the likelihood of quitting smoking with ease after insula damage was 136 times higher than for damage anywhere else in the brain." A neuroscientist from the National Institute of Drug Abuse was enthusiastic: "To have any kind of variable produce this rate of quitting smoking is remarkable, to have it associated with a particular brain region is fantastic."° Thus, for addiction researchers, who are eager to apply the method of agreement to nicotine addiction, a major question has now become: "Can we learn to de-activate the insula?"®
    
    In short, whenever we find a single circumstance common to all instances of a given phenomenon, we may rightly conclude that we have located at least the region of its cause.
    
    The method of agreement has serious limitations, however. Looking chiefly to confirming instances, the method by itself is often insufficient to identify the cause being sought. The data available are seldom so conveniently arranged as to permit the identification of one circumstance common to all cases. When inquiry reveals more than one circumstance common to all cases, this technique alone cannot evaluate those alternative possibilities.
    
    Although the presence of agreement between circumstance and phenomenon is often inconclusive, the absence of agreement may help us to determine what is not the cause of a phenomenon of interest. The method of agreement is in essence eliminative; it points to the fact that circumstances arising in some of the cases, but not all of the cases, of the phenomenon in which we are interested, are not likely to be its cause. Those who argue against an alleged causal relation, therefore, are likely to call attention to the absence of uniform agreement, inferring that the alleged cause can be neither the sufficient condition nor the necessary condition of that phenomenon.
  - |-
    After we have learned all that the method of agreement can teach, other inductive methods capable of greater refinement in the search for causes are sure to be required.

    1. Contaminated scallions, chopped up raw in salsa that was served free to every table at a Chi-Chi's restaurant in western Pennsylvania, almost certainly caused the large outbreak of hepatitis A in the region, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday. Bunches of scallions (green onions) were stored together in large buckets for five days or more with the ice they had been shipped in from Mexico. As a result, even if only some bunches were tainted with the hepatitis virus when they were delivered, it would have quickly spread to all the other scallions—the ice water in the bucket becoming "hepatitis soup." The scallions were later rinsed, chopped, refrigerated for two more days, and then added to the salsa which was made in 40-quart batches and kept refrigerated for up to three days. The outbreak, which has killed three people and made 575 other Chi-Chi's patrons sick, is the nation's biggest outbreak of hepatitis A from one source. Hepatitis A is spread by fecal matter from infected people, particularly those who fail to wash their hands after using the restroom. The virus does not multiply outside the body, but it can survive in food.
    
    Hepatitis A is a common childhood disease in Mexico, and children commonly work on the scallion farms there; sewage-contaminated water could also have been the culprit, whether used to irrigate the scallions, or wash them, or make the ice used in shipping. How the scallions became contaminated is not known.

    . Researchers at the University of California at Irvine have theorized that listening to music can reduce stress and anxiety in patients undergoing medical procedures. They conducted a study where 200 participants were randomly assigned to either listen to music during their medical procedure or not. The researchers measured the level of stress and anxiety before, during, and after the procedure. They found that participants who listened to music had significantly lower levels of stress and anxiety compared to those who did not. The researchers concluded that listening to music can be an effective way to reduce stress and anxiety in patients undergoing medical procedures.
    
    Discuss how the method of agreement is manifested in this study, and what limitations might apply to using the method of agreement in this context.

    Mozart's piano music significantly improves performance on intelligence tests. Dr.
    Frances H. Rauscher and her colleagues reported:
    
    We performed an experiment in which students were each given three sets of standard IQ spatial reasoning
    tasks; each task was preceded by 10 minutes of
    
    1. listening to Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 488; or
    2. listening to a relaxation tape; or
    3. silence.
    
    Performance was improved for those tasks immediately following the first condition compared to the
    second two.
    
    Test scores rose an average of 8 or 9 points following the Mozart sonata. Some of the students had reported
    that they liked Mozart, and some that they did not, but there were no measurable differences attributable to
    varying tastes. "We are testing a neurobiological model of brain function with these experiments," Dr. Rauscher
    said, "and we hypothesize that these patterns may be common in certain activities—chess, mathematics, and
    certain kinds of music... . Listening to such music may stimulate neural pathways important to cognition."

    3. Medical researchers have concluded not only that the timing of sexual intercourse
    
    in relation to ovulation strongly influences the chance of conception, but that con-
    ception occurs only when intercourse takes place during a specifiable period in the
    menstrual cycle. The researchers summarized their findings thus:
    
    We recruited 221 healthy women who were planning to become pregnant. At the same time the women
    stopped using birth control methods, they began collecting daily urine specimens and keeping daily records
    of whether they had sexual intercourse. We measured estrogen and progesterone metabolites in urine to
    estimate the day of ovulation.
    
    In a total of 625 menstrual cycles for which the dates of ovulation could be esti-
    mated, 192 pregnancies were initiated. . . . Two-thirds (n = 129) ended in live births.
    
    12.4 Methods of Causal Analysis
    
    Conception occurred only when intercourse took place during a six-day period that
    ended on the estimated day of ovulation. The probability of conception ranged from
    0.10 when intercourse occurred five days before ovulation to 0.33 when it occurred
    on the day of ovulation itself.
  - |-
    Conclusion: Among healthy women trying to conceive, nearly all pregnancies can  
    be attributed to intercourse during a six-day period ending on the day of ovulation.

    A large extended family in the town of Cartago, Costa Rica, has long suffered an unusual affliction—an incurable form of genetically caused deafness. Children born into the family have a 50 percent chance of developing the disease, and learn their fate at about the age of ten, when those who have inherited a genetic mutation find that they are beginning to lose their hearing. Scientists from the University of Washington have recently traced the cause of the family's affliction to a previously unknown gene, named the diaphanous gene, that helps operate the delicate hair cells in the inner ear that respond to sound vibrations.  
    
    This gene has a single mutation appearing in the Costa Rican family, whose founder arrived in Cartago from Spain in 1713, and who suffered from this form of deafness—as have half his descendants in the eight generations since. Many in the family remain in Cartago because the family's hereditary deafness is well known and accepted there. With only a single family to be studied, and thus very few genetic differences to work with, pinpointing the gene took six years. The critical mutation involved just one of  
    the 3,800 chemical letters that constitute the gene's DNA.

    Researchers from the National Cancer Institute announced that they have found a  
    number of genetic markers shared by gay brothers, indicating that homosexuality has  
    genetic roots. The investigators, reporting in Science, 16 July 1993, have found that  
    out of 40 pairs of gay brothers examined in their study, 33 pairs shared certain DNA  
    sequences on their X chromosome, the chromosome men inherit only from their  
    mothers. The implicit reasoning of this report is that, if brothers who have specific  
    DNA sequences in common are both gay, these sequences can be considered genetic  
    markers for homosexuality.

    The relation between male circumcision and HIV infection has been a concern of the British medical journal, The Lancet, for many years. Before the turn of this century investigators studying that relation wrote, in The Lancet, that studies going back as far as 1989 showed a very greatly increased risk of HIV-1 infection for men who are not circumcised. The epidemiological and biological evidence that links the two, they later wrote, "has become compelling." Very recent studies in Kenya and Uganda have produced evidence that is even more compelling. In 2006, trials in those countries conducted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health were stopped because the results were so clear! It appeared that circumcision reduces a man's risk of contracting AIDS from heterosexual sex by about half, and therefore U.S. officials concluded that it would have been unethical to continue without offering circumcision to all 8,000 men in the trials. The final figures, reevaluated and published in The Lancet on 23 February 2007, are even more striking. They suggest that circumcision reduces a man's risk of contracting AIDS by as much as 65 percent. Dr. Anthony Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was emphatic: "Look. This is a one-time, permanent intervention that's safe when done under appropriate medical conditions. If we had an AIDS vaccine that was performing as well as this, it would be the talk of the town."
    
    Method of Difference
    
    A pattern of inductive inference in which, when cases in which a given phenomenon occurs differ in only one circumstance from cases in which the phenomenon does not occur, that circumstance is inferred to be causally connected to the phenomenon.
    
    B. The Method of Difference
    
    John Stuart Mill wrote:
    
    If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance in common save one, that one occurring only in the former, the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable part of the cause, of the phenomenon.
  - |-
    This pattern focuses not on what is common among those cases in which the effect is produced, but on what is different between those cases in which the effect is produced and those in which it is not. If we had learned, when investigating that rash of stomach upsets described earlier, that all those who had become ill had eaten the canned pears for dessert, but that the pears had been eaten by none of those who did not become ill, we would be fairly confident that the cause of the illness had been identified.
    
    The difference between the method of difference and the method of agreement is highlighted in a recent report about the role of the hormone testosterone in the aggressive conduct of males.
    
    Among many species, testes are mothballed most of the year, kicking into action and pouring out testosterone only during a very circumscribed mating season—precisely the time when male-male aggression soars. Impressive though they seem, these data are only correlative—[reporting only] testosterone found on the scene repeatedly when aggression has occurred.
    
    The proof comes with the knife, the performance of what is euphemistically known as a subtraction experiment. Remove the source of the testosterone in species after species, and levels of aggression plummet. Reinstate normal testosterone levels afterward with injections of synthetic testosterone and aggression returns.
    
    The subtraction and replacement paradigm gives damning proof that this hormone is involved in aggression.'
    
    Testosterone makes the critical difference, clearly, but the author of this report is careful not to assert that testosterone is the cause of male aggression. More accurately, the report states that testosterone is surely involved in aggression. As Mill would put it, the hormone is an indispensable part of the cause of male aggression. Wherever we can identify a single factor that makes the critical difference when all else remains normal—the factor that eliminates the phenomenon in question when we remove it, or the factor that produces the phenomenon in question when we introduce it—we will pretty surely have identified the cause, or an indispensable part of the cause, of the phenomenon we are investigating.
    
    Schematically, where again capital letters denote circumstances and lowercase letters denote phenomena, the method of difference may be represented as follows:
  - |-
    ABCD occur together with w x y z.
    BCD occur together with x y z.
    Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or an indispensable part of the cause of w.
    
    12.4 Methods of Causal Analysis
    
    The method of difference is of central importance in scientific investigations of
    almost every kind. One vivid illustration of its use is the ongoing investigation by medi-
    cal researchers into the effects of particular proteins suspected of being implicated in the
    development of certain diseases. Whether the substance under investigation really is the
    cause (or an indispensable part of the cause) can only be determined when we create an
    experimental environment in which that substance has been eliminated. Investigators
    sometimes are able to do just that—not in humans, of course, but in mice which are
    subject to the same disease and from which the gene that is known to produce the sus-
    pect protein is deleted. Animals so treated are then inbred, creating populations of what
    are called "knockout mice," precious in the world of contemporary medical research, in
    which the process relevant to the disease in question can be studied in an animal exactly
    like other animals subject to that disease, except for the critical difference created by the
    knockout, the absence of the substance hypothesized as cause. Such studies have resulted
    in some remarkable medical advances.
    
    To illustrate: Using knockout mice, scientists have been able to identify the gene
    that causes inflammation—swelling, redness, and pain. The gene MIP-1 alpha, present
    in mice and in humans, was suspected of producing the protein that begins the process
    of inflammation. Pathologists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill bred
    mice that lacked the gene MIP-1 alpha, and then infected those mice, as well as a control
    group of normal mice, with viruses known to cause influenza and other diseases. The
    normal mice did develop extreme inflammation as expected, but mice lacking the MIP-1
    alpha gene had only slight inflammation. This is one big step toward the development
    of drugs that will allow humans to fight viral infections without painful and damaging
    inflammation.
  - |-
    A famous and very dramatic illustration of the method of difference is provided by
    the following account of experiments confirming the true cause of yellow fever, long one
    of the great plagues of humankind. The experiments described here were conducted by
    U.S. Army doctors Walter Reed, James Carroll, and Jesse W. Lazear. Shortly before those
    experiments Dr. Carroll had contracted yellow fever by deliberately allowing himself to
    be bitten by an infected mosquito in a different experiment. Shortly after these experi-
    ments Dr. Lazear died of yellow fever; the camp in which the experiments took place
    was named for him.
    
    Experiments were devised to show that yellow fever was transmitted by the mosquito alone, all other reason-
    able opportunities for being infected being excluded. A small building was erected, all windows and doors and
    every other possible opening being absolutely mosquito-proof. A wire mosquito screen divided the room into
    two spaces. In one of these spaces fifteen mosquitoes, which had fed on yellow fever patients, were liberated.
    A nonimmune volunteer entered the room with the mosquitoes and was bitten by seven mosquitoes. Four
    days later, he suffered an attack of yellow fever. Two other nonimmune men slept for thirteen nights in the
    mosquito-free room without disturbances of any sort.
    
    To show that the disease was transmitted by the mosquito and not through the excreta of yellow fever
    patients or anything which had come in contact with them, another house was constructed and made
    mosquito-proof. For 20 days, this house was occupied by three nonimmunes, after the clothing, bedding and
    eating utensils and other vessels soiled with the discharge, blood and vomitus of yellow fever patients had
    been placed in it. The bed clothing which they used had been brought from the beds of the patients who
    had died of yellow fever, without being subjected to washing or any other treatment to remove anything
    with which it might have been soiled. The experiment was twice repeated by other nonimmune volunteers.
    During the entire period all the men who occupied the house were strictly quarantined and protected from
    mosquitoes. None of those exposed to these experiments contracted yellow fever. That they were not immune
    was subsequently shown, since four of them became infected either by mosquito bites or the injection of
    blood from yellow fever patients.

    That portion of the experiment described in the first paragraph above very deliberately created a single important difference between the subjects in the two carefully enclosed spaces: the presence of mosquitoes that had fed on yellow fever patients in the one space, the absence of such mosquitoes in the other. That portion of the experiment described in the second paragraph above deliberately created a second use of the method of difference, in which the only significant difference between two groups of subjects, both of whom had submitted to very close contact with items that had been used by victims of yellow fever, was the exposure of some of them to infected mosquito bites or infected blood. Absent that circumstance, no infection arose.
    
    Science seeks causal laws. In the never-ending efforts to confirm or to disconfirm hypothesized causal connections, the method of difference is pervasive and powerful.

    1. How critical is sleep to memory? Researchers at two universities, separately, conducted experiments in 2003 designed to determine how sleep affects our ability to remember. College-age people were trained to perform certain tasks and then tested to see how much they recalled in confronting such tasks after either a night's sleep or several hours awake. "We all have the experience of going to sleep with a question and waking up with the solution," observed one of the investigators, Prof. Daniel Margoliash, of the University of Chicago. But does the sleep really help?
    
    It does, markedly. Not just as a matter of re-charge, but, the investigators found, because sleep rescues memories by storing and consolidating them deep in the brain's circuitry. At the University of Chicago, subjects trained to understand murky speech on a voice synthesizer could regularly understand more words after a night of sleep than matched counterparts who were tested just hours after the training with no intervening sleep. And at the Harvard Medical School, one hundred subjects were trained to perform certain finger-tapping sequences that they were later asked, at various intervals, to repeat. The process of memory consolidation required one or two nights of sleep—after which the performance of the subjects improved substantially.

    2. The heavy use of salt is widely suspected by experts to be the cause of an epidemic of high blood pressure and many deaths from heart disease around the world. But how to prove that salt is the culprit? There are "natural experiments" in which isolated jungle or farming communities are introduced to modern civilization, move to cities, adopt high-salt diets, and commonly develop high blood pressure. But such evidence is inconclusive because many important factors change together; new stresses and many dietary changes accompany the increase in salt. How can the causal effects of salt by itself be tested?
      
    12.4 Methods of Causal Analysis
    
    Dr. Derek Denton, of the University of Melbourne, selected a group of normal chimpanzees, a species biologically very close to humans, in which to conduct the needed trials. A group of chimpanzees in Gabon, with normal blood pressure, were first studied in their natural state. The group was then divided in half, with one half receiving gradually increasing amounts of salt in their diet for twenty months. Normal blood pressure in a chimpanzee is 110/70. In Dr. Denton's experiment, the animals' blood pressure commonly rose as high as 150/90, and in some individuals much higher. But among animals in the control group, who received no additional salt, blood pressure did not rise. Six months after the extra salt was withdrawn from their diet, all the chimpanzees in the experimental group had the same low blood pressure they had enjoyed before the experiment. Because there was no other change in the lifestyle of those animals, the investigators concluded that changes in salt consumption caused the changes in blood pressure.

    Does Louisiana hot sauce, the principal ingredient of the spicy New Orleans cocktail sauce commonly served with raw shellfish, kill certain bacteria found in raw oysters and clams? The answer appears to be yes. Bacteria of an infectious and sometimes fatal kind—Vibrio vulnificus—are found in 5 to 10 percent of raw shellfish on the market. Dr. Charles V. Sanders and his research team, from Louisiana State University Medical Center in New Orleans, added Louisiana hot sauce to cultures of Vibrio growing in test tubes; the sauce, even when greatly diluted, killed V. vulnificus in five minutes or less. "I couldn't believe what happened," Dr. Sanders said. He admits that he still eats raw oysters, "but only with plenty of hot sauce."

    In Lithuania, rear-end auto collisions happen as they do in the rest of the world; bumpers crumple, tempers flare. But drivers there do not seem to suffer the complaints so common in the United States, the headaches and lingering neck pains known as "whiplash syndrome." Dr. Harald Schrader and colleagues from University Hospital in Trondheim, Norway, without disclosing the purpose of their study, gave health questionnaires to 202 Lithuanian drivers whose cars had been struck from behind one to three years earlier in accidents of varying severity. The drivers' reports of their symptoms were compared to the reports of a control group (of the same size, same ages, and same home towns) of drivers who had not been in an accident. Thirty-five percent of the accident victims reported neck pain, but so did 33 percent of the controls; 53 percent of those who had been in an accident had headaches, but so did 50 percent of those in the control group. The researchers concluded: "No one in the study group had disabling or persistent symptoms as a result of the car accident."
  - |-
    What, then, can account for the explosion of whiplash cases elsewhere in the
    world? Drivers in the Lithuanian study did not carry personal injury insurance at the
    time of the study, and people there very infrequently sue one another. Most medical
    bills are paid by the government, and at the time of the study there were no claims to
    be filed, no money to be won, and nothing to be gained from a diagnosis of chronic
    whiplash. Chronic whiplash syndrome, the Norwegian researchers concluded, "has
    little validity."

    5. To determine the role of specific genes, mice are bred in which certain genes have
    been deleted. Such mice are called "knockout mice." When normal mice are placed
    in a lighted room, with dark corners, they go immediately to the dark. In one recent
    experiment the mice, upon entering the dark, encounter a mild electric shock, and very
    quickly learn to stay away from those dark regions. Mice who lack a gene called Ras-
    GRF learn to be wary just as quickly as do normal mice. But, unlike normal mice, the
    knockout mice throw caution to the winds the next day, and chance the dark corners
    again and yet again. It appears that the Ras-GRF gene—probably very much like the
    analogous gene in humans—plays a critical role in the ability of the mice to remember
    fear. This gene is almost certainly crucial for the survival of mammals.

    . Here is some reassuring news for those whose career plans are slightly behind sched-
    
    ule: It turns out that peaking too early may kill you. That's the finding of Stuart J. H.
    McCann, a professor of psychology at the University College of Cape Breton in Nova
    Scotia.
  - |-
    McCann's research concerns what he calls the "precocity-longevity hypothesis."
    McCann analyzed the lives of 1,672 U.S. governors who served between 1789 and
    1978 and found that those who were elected at relatively tender ages generally died
    earlier than their less precocious counterparts. Even when he controlled for the year
    that the governors were born, or how long they served, and what state they gov-
    erned, the pattern held. No matter how he sliced the data, or ran the regressions, or
    accounted for various statistical biases, the story remained the same: governors elected
    to office at younger ages tended to have shorter lives.
    
    And what holds for state executives seems also to hold for other young achievers.
    McCann also analyzed smaller but more diverse sets of accomplished people—including
    American and French presidents, Canadian and British prime ministers, Nobel
    Laureates, signers of the Declaration of Independence, Academy Award winners, and
    seven centuries of Roman Catholic pontiffs. Again he found that "those who climb to
    the loftiest peaks in the shortest time also die younger. For the eminent, and perhaps
    for all, an early rise may lead to an early fall."

    . Cholera, caused by a water-borne bacterium ingested by drinking contaminated
  - |-
    Water, is a dreadful disease; pandemics of cholera in the 19th century killed tens of
    thousands. The accepted view, that it was caused by breathing a filthy miasma, was
    doubted by John Snow, a founding member of the London Epidemiological Society.
    When a terrible cholera epidemic struck London in 1848-49, Snow hypothesized
    that bad water, from urban wells and from the Thames River, was the villain. Some
    water companies drew their water from within the tidal section of the Thames, where
    the city's sewage was also dumped, thus providing their customers with excrement-
    contaminated drinking water. It stank, so some of the intake pipes were shifted to points
    above the tideway. In 1854 cholera returned with even greater horror. Snow identified
    two water companies, one of which had moved its intake to a point above the tidal
    region of the river, the other still supplying a fecal cocktail; his data from these two
    districts showed a strong connection between cholera mortality and water source.
    Snow also identified a particular well, on Broad Street, and plotted cholera mortality
    house by house in the area of that well—the number of dead increasing sharply with
    proximity to the Broad Street pump—while a few streets away on Warwick Street there
    
    12.4 Methods of Causal Analysis
    
    were no cholera deaths at all. Just across from the Broad Street pump was the Poland
    Street Workhouse, whose wretched inmates remained healthy—the workhouse had its

    C. The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference
    
    Although Mill believed that the joint method of agreement and difference was
    an additional and separate technique, it is best understood as the combined use of the
    method of agreement and the method of difference in the same investigation. It can be
    represented schematically (capital letters again denoting circumstances, lowercase letters
    denoting phenomena) as follows:

    ABC—xyz. ABC—xyz.
    ADE—xtw. BC—yz.
    Therefore A is the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable part of the cause, of x.
    
    Because each of the two methods (agreement schematized above on the left, difference schematized on the right) affords some probability to the conclusion, their joint use affords a higher probability to that conclusion. In many scientific investigations this combination serves as an extremely powerful pattern of inductive inference.
    
    A notable advance in medicine provides an illustration of the power of the joint method. Hepatitis A is a liver infection that afflicted tens of thousands of Americans; it spread widely among children, chiefly through contaminated food or water, and was sometimes deadly. How might it be prevented? The ideal solution, of course, would be an effective vaccine. However, an enormous difficulty faced those who would test any vaccine for hepatitis A: It was very hard to predict where outbreaks of the infection would occur, and therefore it was usually not possible to select experimental subjects in ways that would yield reliable results. This difficulty was finally overcome in the following way.
    
    A potential vaccine was tested in a community of Hasidic Jews, Kiryas Joel, in Orange County, New York, a community that was highly unusual in that it was plagued by yearly epidemics of this infection. Almost no one escaped hepatitis A in Kiryas Joel, and nearly 70 percent of the community members had been infected by the time they were nineteen years old. Dr. Alan Werzberger, of the Kiryas Joel Institute of Medicine, and his colleagues recruited 1,037 children in that community, ages two to sixteen, who had not been exposed to the hepatitis A virus, as determined by a lack of antibodies to the virus in their blood. Half of them (519) received a single dose of the new vaccine, and among those vaccinated children not a single case of hepatitis A was reported. Of the 518 children who received dummy injections, 25 became infected with hepatitis A soon after. The vaccine for hepatitis A had been found.!®
    
    Liver specialists in Boston and Washington greeted this study with admiration, calling it "a great breakthrough" and a "major medical advance." What is the pattern of inference?

     on which this achievement relied? Both the method of agreement and the method of difference were employed, as is common in medical investigations. Among all those young residents of the community who became immune to hepatitis A, there was only one relevant circumstance in common: All the immunes had received the new vaccine. By itself, this strongly tended to show that the vaccine did cause that immunity. The method of difference supported this conclusion overwhelmingly: The circumstances of those who did become immune and those who did not were essentially alike in every respect except one, the administration of the vaccine to the immune residents.
      
     The testing of new drugs or procedures is often conducted in what are called "double-arm" trials, one group receiving the new treatment while the other group does not, after which (in suitable cases) there may be a carefully executed crossover, in a second phase, in which those who originally did not receive the treatment do so, and those who originally did receive the treatment do not. The application of the joint method of agreement and difference underlies such investigations, which are common and exceedingly productive.

    One family in northern Pakistan has several such members. One, a ten-year old
    boy, became famous for giving street performances in which he put knives through
    his arms and walked on hot coals. Tissue damage would result, but no discomfort.
    Geneticist C. G. Woods of Cambridge University searched for the cause of this remark-
    able inability to feel pain. Eventually he zeroed in on mutations in a gene, SCN9IA,
    that codes for the channel through which sodium enters pain-sensing cells, critical to
    the pain signal. Testing with electric current, he could open and close sodium chan-
    nels on some cells—but he could not open the sodium channels on those mutant
    cells. Said Woods, "This shows that rare diseases can still be of great importance
    because of the insights they give into biological processes."
    
    A Yale University neurologist, Stephen Waxman, observes that if researchers could
    craft a drug that can make these channels inactive, as they are in the Pakistani fam-
    ily members, millions of people worldwide who suffer from chronic pain would be
    wonderfully served.

    gene that makes two of those subunits results in the instability of the protein, its

    misfolding, and eventually in death. That this is indeed the cause of the ailments was
    shown by the fact that a liver transplant, providing a healthy version of the critical
    gene, can result in cure—but often that correction comes too late to stymie the mis-
    folding that did the damage.
  - |-
    A strange twist of nature, reported in Science in January 2003 by Dr. Jeffrey Kelly, of the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, provided the clues to a therapy that can thwart the misfolding process. Because diseases of this kind are quite common in Portugal, families there are screened to see who has the mutated gene and is therefore at risk. One very large family was identified whose members had the mutated gene and yet never did contract the disease. It turned out that in this family, a second gene that made the other two subunits of the protein had undergone its own mutation, suppressing or reversing the disease process. Members of that family carried a cure to an inherited disease in their own genes.
    
    Dr. Kelly found that as a result of this further mutation the disease was prevented by the erection of a kind of barrier between the normal and the abnormal protein states. Then, by screening libraries of small molecules, he located several that, already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for other purposes, could mimic the effect of the second mutation, successfully reversing the misfolded protein in animals.
    
    Sixteen-year-old David Merrill, of Suffolk, Virginia, hypothesized that the loud sounds of hard-rock music have a bad effect on its devoted fans. He tested the theory on mice. Seventy-two mice were divided into three groups of 24, the first to be exposed to hard-rock music, the second to music by Mozart, and the third to no music at all.
    
    After allowing the mice to become accustomed to their environments, but before exposing them to the music, Merrill tested all of them in a maze, which took the mice an average of 10 minutes to complete. Then the groups were exposed to the music for 10 hours a day.
    
    With repeated testing the control-group mice reduced their time in the maze by an average of 5 minutes. Those exposed to Mozart reduced their time by 8.5 minutes. The hard-rock mice increased their time in the maze by 20 minutes.
    
    Merrill also reported that when, in an earlier attempt, he had allowed all the mice to live together, the project had to be cut short because, unlike the Mozart-listening mice, the hard-rock-listening mice killed other mice.

    Scientists have long known that severely restricting the number of calories that mice and other organisms consume lengthens their life span. Animals on low-calorie diets typically have abnormally cool body temperatures. Does low temperature, in itself, result in longer life? The answer is yes.
    
    Bruno Conti, of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, genetically engineered mice to have a faulty sense of body temperature. The alteration reduced the animals' temperatures by 0.03 to 0.05°C below normal; they were given as much food as they wanted, maintaining their normal weight. The low-temperature mice lived about 15 percent longer than normal mice did.

At a social gathering of eighty-five faculty members, graduate students, and staff workers in the Department of Food Science at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, the partygoers served themselves ice cream. They did not know they were also the subjects of an experiment. Half the participants were given 17-ounce bowls, and half 34-ounce bowls. In addition, half were given 2-ounce spoons to scoop out their ice cream, and half were given 3-ounce serving spoons.
    
    With larger spoons, people served themselves 14.5 percent more, and with a larger bowl they heaped on 31 percent more. With both large spoon and large bowl these nutrition experts helped themselves to 56.8 percent more ice cream than those who used the smaller utensils. And all but three ate every bit of the ice cream they took. Smaller platters and smaller utensils may be the key to a successful diet.

    Method of residues
    A pattern of inductive inference in which, when some portions of a given phenomenon are known to be the effects of certain identified antecedents, we conclude that the remaining portion of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents.
    
    D. The Method of Residues
    
    John Stuart Mill wrote:
  - |-
    Subduct from any phenomenon such part as is known by previous inductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents.
    
    The first three methods seem to suppose that we can eliminate or produce the cause (or effect) of some phenomenon in its entirety, as indeed we sometimes can. In many contexts, however, we can only deduce the causal effect of some phenomenon by observing the change that it makes in a set of circumstances whose cause is already understood in part.
    
    This method, focusing on residues, is well illustrated by the very simple device used to weigh truck cargos. The weight of the truck when empty is known. To determine the weight of the cargo, the entire truck is weighed with its cargo—and the weight of the cargo is then known to be the weight of the whole minus the weight of the truck. The known "antecedent," in Mill's phrase, is the recorded weight of the empty truck that must be subtracted from the reading on the scale; the cause of the difference between that reading and the known antecedent is obviously attributable to the remaining "antecedents"—that is, to the cargo itself.
    
    Schematically, the method of residues can be represented as follows:
    
    ABC—xyz.
    
    B is known to be the cause of y.
    C is known to be the cause of z.
    Therefore A is the cause of x.
    
    A splendid illustration of the effectiveness of the method of residues is provided by one of the great chapters in the history of astronomy, the discovery of the planet Neptune:
    
    In 1821, Bouvard of Paris published tables of the motions of a number of planets, including Uranus. In preparing the latter he had found great difficulty in making an orbit calculated on the basis of positions obtained in the years after 1800 agree with one calculated from observations taken in the years immediately following discovery. He finally disregarded the older observations entirely and based his tables on the newer observations. In a few years, however, the positions calculated from the tables disagreed with
  - |-
    The observed positions of the planet and by 1844 the discrepancy amounted to 2 minutes of arc. Since all
    the other known planets agreed in their motions with those calculated for them, the discrepancy in the
    case of Uranus aroused much discussion.
    
    In 1845, Leverrier, then a young man, attacked the problem. He checked Bouvard's calculations and
    found them essentially correct. Thereupon he felt that the only satisfactory explanation of the trouble lay
    in the presence of a planet somewhere beyond Uranus which was disturbing its motion. By the middle of
    1846 he had finished his calculations. In September he wrote to Galle at Berlin and requested the latter
    to look for a new planet in a certain region of the sky for which some new star charts had just been pre-
    pared in Germany but of which Leverrier apparently had not as yet obtained copies. On the twenty-third
    of September Galle started the search and in less than an hour he found an object which was not on the
    chart. By the next night it had moved appreciably and the new planet, subsequently named Neptune, was
    discovered within 1° of the predicted place. This discovery ranks among the greatest achievements of
    mathematical astronomy."
    
    The phenomenon under investigation here is the movement of Uranus. A great part
    of that phenomenon, the orbit of Uranus around the sun, was well understood at the
    time. Observations of Uranus approximated this calculated orbit but exhibited a puz-
    zling residue, some perturbation of what had been calculated, for which further explana-
    tion was needed. An additional "antecedent"—that is, an additional existing factor that
    would account for the perturbation—was hypothesized to be another (undiscovered)
    planet whose gravity would, together with what was already known about the orbit of
    Uranus, explain that residue. Once hypothesized, that new planet, Neptune, was very
    quickly found.
  - |-
    The method of residues differs from the other methods in that it can be used with the examination of only one case, whereas the others require the examination of at least two cases. The method of residues, unlike the others, appears to depend on antecedently established causal laws, while the other methods (as Mill formulated them) do not. The method of residues is nevertheless an inductive, not a deductive, method (as some have suggested), because it yields conclusions that are only probable and cannot be validly deduced from their premises. An additional premise or two might transform an inference by the method of residues into a valid deductive argument, but that can be said for other inductive methods as well.
    
    **EXERCISES**
    
    Analyze each of the following arguments in terms of "antecedents" and "phenomena" to show how they follow the pattern of the method of residues:
    
    1. For nineteen years space scientists, astronomers, and physicists have been puzzled by what appears to be a mysterious force pulling spacecraft in the direction of the sun. It was first noticed when the trajectories of two outward bound and very distant spacecraft (Pioneer 10 and 11, launched in 1972 and 1973) were carefully analyzed. The trajectories of two later probes (Galileo, launched toward Jupiter in 1989, and Ulysses, launched into polar orbit around the sun) have exhibited the same peculiarities: They give evidence of a weak force that perturbs their directions and velocities. This force was discovered by adding up the effects of all other known forces acting on the spacecraft and finding that something unexplained was left over.
    
    This force is apparently slowing the outward progress of the spacecraft speeding away from or around the sun—but in contrast to the force of gravity, the strength of this mystery force does not decline proportionally to the inverse square of a spacecraft's distance from the sun, but instead at a linear rate, which makes it very unlikely that the mystery force is a gravitational effect of the sun.

    Calculations were made using two independent methods, and data of different types, taking into account possible errors in the software and the hardware used in the measurements. A host of other possible errors were investigated and accounted for—and after ruling all of these out, a team of physicists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory announced that the mystery remained. This means that some hitherto unknown phenomenon may be at work—what physicists excitedly call "new physics."

    . In H. Davies' experiments on the decomposition of water by galvanism, it was found that besides the two components of water, oxygen and hydrogen, an acid and an alkali were developed at opposite poles of the machine. Since the theory of the analysis of water did not give reason to expect these products, their presence constituted a problem. Some chemists thought that electricity had the power of producing these substances of itself. Davies conjectured that there might be some hidden cause for this part of the effect—the glass might suffer decomposition, or some foreign matter might be in the water. He then proceeded to investigate whether or not the diminution or total elimination of possible causes would change or eliminate the effect in question. Substituting gold vessels for glass ones, he found no change in the effect and concluded that glass was not the cause. Using distilled water, he found a decrease in the quantity of acid and alkali involved, yet enough remained to show that the cause was still in operation. He inferred that impurity of the water was not the sole cause, but was a concurrent cause. He then suspected that perspiration from the hands might be the cause, as it would contain salt which would decompose into acid and alkali under electricity. By avoiding such contact, he reduced the quantity of the effect still further, till only slight traces remained. These might be due to some impurity of the atmosphere decomposed by the electricity. An experiment determined this to be the case. The machine was put under an exhaust receiver and when it was thus secured from atmospheric influences, no acid or alkali was produced.

    . Satellite observations collected between 1992 and 2001 suggest that the upper surface of the Earth's atmosphere has been changing in ways that are not yet fully understood. These changes include variations in the density of the atmosphere, shifts in the distribution of charged particles, and other phenomena that may indicate a complex interaction between natural processes and external influences. Scientists continue to study these observations in an effort to better understand the dynamics of the upper atmosphere and its relationship with other systems in the Earth's environment.

    of the Larsen C ice shelf, in Antarctica, dropped as much as 27 cm per year during
    that period. About a quarter of that shrinkage, or 7 cm, may have resulted from snow
    packing down into denser material called firn. Uncertainties about such factors as the
    height of the ocean tides, and the salinity of water beneath the ice shelf would account
    for no more than a small fraction of the remaining loss of height above water.
    
    Therefore, concluded Andrew Shepherd, a glaciologist at the University of Cambridge
    in England, as much as 20 cm per year of the upper surface's drop must stem from
    melting. Nine-tenths of any mass of floating ice lies below the water's surface, suggest-
    ing that the Larsen C ice shelf is thinning by as much as 2 m each year.
    
    The likely cause of this thinning is relatively warm water beneath the shelf. Even
    a very small temperature increase in the water below an ice shelf can make a big dif-
    ference in the melting rate of the overlying ice. Larsen C is stable, and isn't shedding
    icebergs than normal, Shepherd reported, but at its current rate of thinning,
    Larsen C could reach 200 m in thickness (the thickness at which other ice shelves
    have disintegrated) and therefore be susceptible to disintegration in 70 years—but
    if the waters in the region continue to warm, the demise of Larsen C could occur
    even sooner.

    4. Analyzing more than forty years of weather data, climatologists at the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado, recently found that
    the daily temperature range—the difference between the daytime maximum and the
    nighttime minimum temperatures—at 660 weather stations in the continental United
    States fluctuates in a very puzzling manner: the variation of the temperature range
    over the course of a week, in some regions, does not line up with any natural cycles
    that can be detected.
  - |-
    The average temperature range for the weekends (Saturday, Sunday, and Monday)  
    varied from the average temperature range for weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday,  
    Thursday, and Friday)! Fluctuations in the daily range can be caused by natural factors;  
    storm systems moving across an area, for example, can cause such fluctuation—but  
    there are no natural factors known to fall consistently on certain days of the week.
    
    The precise cause of this extraordinary pattern is not clear. However, contend the  
    researchers (Piers M. de F. Forster and Susan Solomon), the only possible explanation  
    for this weekend/weekday disparity is human activity and the atmospheric pollutants  
    activity creates.

    a balloon is heavier when inflated than when empty, which is proof enough. For if  
    the air were light, the more the balloon was inflated, the lighter the whole would be,  
    since there would be more air in it. But since, on the contrary, when more air is put  
    in, the whole becomes heavier, it follows that each part has a weight of its own, and  
    consequently that the air has weight.

    E. The Method of Concomitant Variation
    
    The four methods discussed so far are all eliminative in nature. By eliminating some pos-  
    sible cause or causes of a given phenomenon, they support some other causal account  
    hypothesized. The method of agreement eliminates as possible causes those circum-  
    stances in whose absence the phenomenon can nevertheless occur; the method of dif-  
    ference permits the elimination of some possible causes by removing an antecedent  
    factor shown to be critical; the joint method is eliminative in both of these ways; and  
    the method of residues seeks to eliminate as possible causes those circumstances whose  
    effects have already been established by previous inductions.
    
    However, in many situations, no one of these methods is applicable, because they  
    involve circumstances that cannot possibly be eliminated. This is often the case in  
    chapter 12 Causal Reasoning
    
    Method of  
    concomitant  
    variation
  - |-
    A pattern of inductive inference in which it is concluded that, when one phenomenon varies consistently with some other phenomenon in some manner, there is some causal relation between the two phenomena.
    
    In economics, in physics, in medicine, and wherever the general increase or decrease of one factor results in a concomitant increase or decrease of another—the complete elimination of either factor not being feasible.
    
    John Stuart Mill wrote:
    
    "Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon varies in some particular manner is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon or is connected with it through some fact of causation."
    
    Concomitant variation is critical to the study of the causal impact of certain foods, for example. We cannot eliminate disease, no matter the diet; we can rarely eliminate foods of certain kinds from the diets of large populations. But we can note the effect of increasing or decreasing the intake of certain foods on the frequency of certain diseases in specified populations. One investigation of this kind examined the frequency of heart attacks compared to the frequency with which fish had been eaten by those in the study. The inductive conclusion was striking: Eating one fish meal a week reduced the risk of heart attack by 50 percent; eating just two fish meals a month reduced the risk of heart attack by 30 percent. Within some limits there appears to be a marked concomitant variation between cardiac arrests and the use of fish in the diet.'
    
    Using plus and minus signs to indicate the greater or lesser degree to which a varying phenomenon is present in a given situation, the method of concomitant variation can be schematized as:
    
    ABC—xyz.
    A+ BC—x+yzZ.
    Therefore A and x are causally connected.
    
    This method is very widely used. A farmer establishes that there is a causal connection between the application of fertilizer to the soil and the size of the crop by applying different amounts to different parts of a field, then noting the concomitant variation between the amounts of the additive and the yield. A merchant seeks to verify the efficacy of advertising of different kinds by running varied advertisements at varying intervals, then noting the concomitant increase or decrease of business during some of those periods.
  - |-
    Concomitant variation is exemplified in the search for the causes of divorce and of other important decisions among families. Of course the cause of any particular divorce will lie in the special circumstances of that marriage and that family, but there are conditions that tend generally to contribute to the breakup of families, and concomitant variation is useful in learning what these are. Analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals that, in every decade since the 1940s, and in every region of the country, couples who were the parents of only girls divorced more often than couples who were the parents of only boys. It happened among whites and among blacks, among those with only high school diplomas and among those with college degrees. Parents with an only child who is a girl are 6 percent more likely to split up than parents of a single boy. The gap rises to 8 percent for parents of two girls versus parents of two boys, 10 percent for families with three girls, and 13 percent if there are four girls. Thousands upon thousands of U.S. divorces appear to stem partly from the number of girls in the family.
    
    The age-old favoring of boys, overt and common in China, India, and other developing countries, is more subtle in the United States, but it remains a widespread factor in the dynamics of U.S. family life. Parents invest more in their sons, spending, when their families include a boy, an average of an additional $600 a year on housing. Fathers increase their workweeks after the birth of the first family child of either sex—but increase it by more than two hours if the child is a boy, less than one hour if it is a girl. These patterns of concomitant variation make it plain that parents have a preference for boys—a preference that will have increasingly important consequences when the technology for the selection of the sex of a baby, already known and reliable, becomes more widely available.
  - |-
    When the increase of one phenomenon parallels the increase of another, we say  
    that the phenomena vary directly with each other. However, the method permits the  
    use of variation "in any manner," and we may also infer a causal connection when the  
    phenomena vary inversely—the increase of one leading to the decrease of another. Thus  
    economists often say that, other things remaining roughly stable, in an unregulated  
    market an increase of the supply of some good (say, crude oil) will result in a concomi-  
    tant decrease in its price. That relation does appear to be genuinely concomitant: When  
    international tension threatens to reduce the available supply of crude oil, we note that  
    the price of the oil almost invariably rises.
    
    Some concomitant variations are entirely coincidental, of course. Care must be  
    taken not to infer a causal connection from patterns of occurrence that are wholly for-  
    tuitous. But some variations that appear to be coincidental, or are otherwise puzzling,  
    may have an obscure causal explanation. It has been shown that there is a high correla-  
    tion between the number of storks found nesting in English villages and the number of  
    babies born in each of those villages—the more storks, the more babies. Surely it is not  
    possible that ... No, it's not. Villages with high birth rates have more newly married  
    couples, and therefore have more newly constructed houses. Storks, it turns out, prefer  
    to nest beside chimneys that have not been used previously by other storks."* Tracing the  
    causal chains of phenomena that vary concomitantly, we may find links in common,  
    which is what Mill meant when he said that the phenomena may be "connected .. .  
    through some fact of causation."
    
    Because the method of concomitant variation permits us to adduce, as evidence,  
    changes in the degree to which circumstances and phenomena are present, it greatly  
    strengthens our set of inductive techniques. It is a quantitative method of inductive  
    inference, those earlier discussed being essentially qualitative. The use of concomitant  
    variation therefore presupposes the existence of some method of measuring or estimat-  
    ing, even if only roughly, the degrees to which phenomena vary.

The method of concomitant variation is a type of causal reasoning where a change in one variable (the cause) is associated with a change in another variable (the effect), and the relationship between them is observed over time or under different conditions.
    
    1. The notion that poverty and mental illness are intertwined is not new—but finding evidence that one begets the other has often proved difficult. New research, which coincided with the opening of a new gambling casino on an Indian reservation, appears to strengthen that link, strongly suggesting that lifting children out of poverty (as casino income did in many cases) tends to diminish some (but not all) psychiatric symptoms.
    
    Analysis:
    This argument follows the pattern of the method of concomitant variation. The phenomenon here is the relationship between poverty and mental illness. As the casino opened, which increased income (thus reducing poverty), there was a corresponding decrease in psychiatric symptoms among children who had risen out of poverty. The key point is that the change in one variable (economic improvement leading to less poverty) is associated with a change in another variable (reduction in psychiatric symptoms). The study shows that when poverty is lifted, there is a decrease in mental illness symptoms. However, this effect is not universal—some children still experience psychiatric symptoms even when lifted out of poverty. This variation in the effect supports the method of concomitant variation, as it shows that while there is a general trend, not all cases are affected equally.
    
    The study also provides a controlled comparison: children whose families rose above the poverty threshold showed a 40 percent decrease in behavioral symptoms, while those who remained in poverty or were never poor did not show the same effect. This variation in the outcome based on the change in the cause (poverty) supports the method of concomitant variation.
    
    2. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October 2003 tracked 1,420 children, ages 9 to 13, in rural North Carolina, very many of whom lived on a Cherokee Indian reservation. During the study a casino that had been opened on the reservation began distributing some of its profits to tribal families, the payments reaching about $6,000 per year by 2001. The researchers found that the rate of psychiatric symptoms among the children who had risen from poverty dropped steadily; those children were less inclined to temper tantrums, stealing, bullying, and vandalism—common symptoms of oppositional defiant disorders.
    
    Children whose families rose above the poverty threshold showed a 40 percent decrease in behavioral symptoms. The rate of such behaviors, after four years, dropped to the same levels found among children whose families had never been poor. But the casino payments had no effect on children whose families were nevertheless unable to rise from poverty, or on those children whose families had not been poor to begin with.
    
    The economic change had a significant effect on only a fraction of the children followed. This, it was hypothesized, was a consequence of the fact that, although all the families that received the payment received the same amount of money, the payments resulted in lifting only 14 percent of those families above the poverty line which, in 2002, was $14,348 for a family of three. The study suggests, said Dr. Arline Geronimus, of the University of Michigan, that poverty puts stress on families, which can increase the likelihood that children will develop behavioral problems.
    
    Analysis:
    This argument follows the pattern of the method of concomitant variation. The phenomenon here is the relationship between economic conditions (poverty) and children's behavioral symptoms. As the casino opened, which increased income (thus reducing poverty), there was a corresponding decrease in behavioral symptoms among children who had risen out of poverty. The key point is that the change in one variable (economic improvement leading to less poverty) is associated with a change in another variable (reduction in behavioral symptoms). The study shows that when poverty is lifted, there is a decrease in behavioral problems. However, this effect is not universal—some children still experience behavioral issues even when lifted out of poverty. This variation in the effect based on the change in the cause (poverty) supports the method of concomitant variation.
    
    The study also provides a controlled comparison: children whose families rose above the poverty threshold showed a 40 percent decrease in behavioral symptoms, while those who remained in poverty or were never poor did not show the same effect. This variation in the outcome based on the change in the cause (poverty) supports the method of concomitant variation.
    
    3. In Finland, heart attacks occur more frequently in the eastern part of the country.
    
    Analysis:
    This argument follows the pattern of the method of concomitant variation. The phenomenon here is the relationship between geographic location (eastern vs. western Finland) and the occurrence of heart attacks. The argument suggests that there is a variation in the number of heart attacks based on location, which implies a possible causal link. The method of concomitant variation is applied here by observing that as one variable (location) changes, another variable (frequency of heart attacks) also changes. This variation in the outcome based on the change in the cause (location) supports the method of concomitant variation. However, this argument is incomplete as it does not provide additional data or context to fully support the causal relationship between location and heart attacks. More information would be needed to confirm this pattern of concomitant variation.

    than in the western and southern parts. Researchers seeking to explain these dif-
    ferences concluded that they "cannot be explained by individual lifestyle or by
    genetic factors." How, then, can they be explained? A study led by Dr. Anne Kousa,
    of the Geological Survey of Finland, examined heart attacks that occurred in 18,946
    men, ages 35 to 74, in three different years. The researchers then correlated the
    incidence of heart attack in these populations with the level of water hardness—as
    measured by the presence of minerals in the water—in their communities. The
    study found that the degree of water hardness correlated directly with a lowered risk
    of heart attack. Drinking water rich in minerals appears to play a role in reducing
    heart disease.

    . When it comes to love, sex, and friendship, do birds of a feather flock together? Or is
    
    it more important that opposites attract? Dr. Claus Wedekind, of Bern University in
    Switzerland, hypothesized that body odor might signal that its owner had desirable
    immune genes—called MHC genes—that would help offspring to fight off diseases.
    He devised an experiment to see if human body odor correlated with MHC genes and
    if people could tell.
    
    He and his team collected DNA samples for 49 female and 44 male university stu-
    dents. He asked the men to wear cotton T-shirts on two successive nights, to keep the
    shirt in a plastic bag, to use perfume-free detergents and soaps, and to avoid smelly
    rooms, smell-producing foods, and activities like smoking and sex that create odors.
    Meanwhile, the women were given a nasal spray to protect their nasal membranes
    from infection, and each received a copy of the Patrick Susskind novel Perfume to
    make them more conscious of odors.
    
    When the T-shirts were collected, the women were asked to give ratings, for inten-
    sity, pleasantness, and sexiness, to three T-shirts from men whose MHC genes were
    similar to those of the women, and three from men whose MHC genes were dissimilar,
    not knowing which were which.

    Women who were dissimilar to a particular male's MHC perceived his odor as more
    pleasant than did women whose MHC was similar to that of the test man. Odors of
    men with dissimilar MHC reminded the women of their own mates or former mates
    twice as often as did the odors of men with similar MHC.
    
    However, if a woman was taking oral contraceptives, which partly mimic pregnancy,
    this predilection was reversed, and they gave higher ratings to men with similar MHC.
    "The Pill effect really surprised me," said Dr. Wedekind.

    . Stanley Coren sought to plumb the connections between sleeplessness and accidents. To do that he focused on the yearly shift to daylight time in eastern North
    America, when (because clocks are moved forward one hour) most people lose an
    hour of sleep. He compared the number of accidents then with the number on nor-
    mal days, and found that on the day after the time change, in Canada, there was an
    8 percent increase in accidents. Then, examining the day after the return to stand-
    ard time, when people gain an hour of sleep, he found a corresponding decrease in
    accidents. "What we're looking at," says the Director of the Human Chronobiology
    Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, commenting upon Soren's results, "is
    national jet lag."

    . Prof. Kathleen Vohs reports that two groups of college students were asked to read
    out loud from "a boring book on the biographies of scientists." One of the groups
    was obliged to wear fake expressions of delight and interest, while the other group
    was allowed to read the same texts naturally. Each group was afterward given a sum
    of money to spend on an assortment of goods, or to save. Those who had been fak-
    ing delight spent 62 percent more than those who had not. Similarly, a group of
    students writing down their thoughts without restraint spent very much less than
    a similar group obliged while writing to avoid all thoughts about white bears. The
    more self-restraint that a person expends to control one impulse, it appears, the less
    self-restraint is available to control others.

    . Whenever the U.S. says things that make a military conflict with Iran seem more
    likely, the price of oil rises, strengthening Iran's regime rather than weakening it. The
    more we talk about curbing Iranian power, the more difficult it gets. .. . So cooling
    down the martial rhetoric, even if we plan to take military action eventually, would
    likely bring oil prices down, making Iran weaker. . . . Lower oil prices won't, by them-
    selves, topple the mullahs in Iran. But it's significant that, historically, when oil prices
    have been low, Iranian reformers have been ascendant and radicals relatively subdued,
    and vice versa when prices have been high. Talking tough may look like a good way
    of demonstrating U.S. resolve, but when tough talk makes our opponent richer and
    stronger we may accomplish more by saying less.

    Five Methods of Inductive Inference
    
    1. The method of agreement. The one factor or circumstance that is common to all the cases of the phenomenon under investigation is likely to be the cause (or effect) of that phenomenon.
    
    . The method of difference. The one factor or circumstance whose absence or presence distinguishes all cases in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs from those cases in which it does not occur, is likely to be the cause, or part of the cause, of that phenomenon.
  - |-
    The joint method of agreement and difference. Although perhaps not a separate method, the combination, in the same investigation, of the method of agreement and the method of difference gives substantial probability to the inductive conclusion.
    
    The method of residues. When some portion of the phenomenon under examination is known to be the consequence of well-understood antecedent circumstances, we may infer that the remainder of that phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents.
    
    The method of concomitant variation. When the variations in one phenomenon are highly correlated with the variations in another phenomenon, one of the two is likely to be the cause of the other, or they may be related as the products of some third factor causing both.
    
    These are the inductive methods frequently called Mill's methods, most commonly used by scientists in their investigation of causal laws.
    
    12.5 Limitations of Inductive Techniques
    
    What do the methods explained in the preceding sections actually do for us? John Stuart Mill believed that they were instruments with which we may discover causal connections; also that they were canons with which causal connections may be proved. On both counts he overestimated their power. Inductive techniques are indeed of very great importance, but their role in science is more limited than Mill supposed.
    
    One substantial difficulty arises from the fact that, in formulating these methods, Mill made the assumption that one can identify cases "having only one circumstance in common" or other cases "having every circumstance in common save one." But these expressions must not be taken literally; any two objects will have many circumstances in common, however different they may appear; and no two things can ever differ in only one respect—one will be farther to the north, one will be closer to the sun, and so on. Nor could we even examine all possible circumstances to determine if they differ in only one way. What the scientist has in mind as he or she applies these techniques are not all circumstances, but the sets of relevant circumstances—whether there is only one relevant circumstance in common, or all relevant circumstances save one in common. That is, we apply the methods to the circumstances that have some bearing on the causal connection in question.
    
    John Stuart Mill
  - |-
    John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), one of the most prominent philosophers and logicians of the nineteenth century, was the beneficiary of an extraordinary education, which he recounts in detail in his famous Autobiography (1873). He did not attend school, but studied intensively with his father, James Mill, a very learned man and a philosopher himself. The young John Stuart was taught to read before he was two; he studied Greek at the age of three and Latin at the age of eight. Before he was fourteen he had read most of the Greek and Latin classics, had pursued extensive studies in logic and mathematics, and had been writing essays in economic theory under the direction of his father, whose guidance was demanding but also loving. James was one of a small group of brilliant liberal intellectuals, radical reformers who were at once moral thinkers and economists, led by the great English legislative reformer, Jeremy Bentham. While still a boy Mill interacted with these powerful intellects in his own living room; eventually he himself became a leader of nineteenth-century English liberalism.
    
    At the age of seventeen Mill followed his father as an employee of the East India Company, which was the de facto government of much of India during those years. Mill rose through the ranks to become, when he was 50, Chief Examiner for that company. After his retirement he was elected to Parliament, where he served with great distinction.
    
    Mill's philosophical views remain highly relevant in the twenty-first century. His early feminism (The Subjection of Women, 1869) was courageous; his advocacy of self-government (Considerations on Representative Government, 1861) was profound; his moral views brought utilitarian thinking to the highest point it had reached in his time (Utilitarianism, 1861); his defense of free speech and expression (On Liberty, 1959) has made him, to this day, an intellectual hero around the globe.
  - |-
    His philosophical reputation was first established in his thir-
    ties, when he published his System of Logic (1843). In that work he
    explained why formal deductive logic, or syllogistics, cannot really
    add to our knowledge, although it certainly can help us to reason con-
    sistently on the basis of what we do already know. On the other hand,
    inductive logic—the logic of science—can provide, he argued, rules and
    guidelines for the discovery of new truths. Refining the old Baconian rules of inference,
    Mill formulated and explained the principles of inductive logic as no one had before him.
    Since the premises of any syllogism must be established or assumed before ratiocination
    can begin, Mill contended that induction must precede deduction and is necessarily more
    fundamental. In the realm of inductive logic his work was incisive and original.
    
    John Stuart Mill was, overall, an effective and honest reformer, universally respected.
    He was a loving husband, an admired scholar, and a legislator of unquestioned integrity.
    His philosophical reasoning on a wide range of issues was subtle, his sentiments always
    humane. He was the most influential English-speaking philosopher and logician of the
    nineteenth century.
    
    Biography
    
     chapter 12 Causal Reasoning
    
    Which are those circumstances? We cannot learn which factors are relevant using
    the methods alone. In order to use the methods we must come to the context in which
    they are to be applied with some analysis of causal factors already in mind. The carica-
    ture of the "scientific drinker" illustrates this difficulty: He drinks Scotch and soda one
    night, bourbon and soda the next night, and on the following nights brandy and soda,
    then rum and soda, then gin and soda. What is the cause of his intoxication? Repeatedly
    inebriated, he swears never to touch soda again!
    
    This scientific drinker did apply the method of agreement in accordance with the
    rules—but his doing so was to no avail because the factors that really are relevant in
    those antecedent circumstances had not been identified and therefore could not be
    manipulated. Had alcohol been specified as one of the factors common to all the cases,
    it would have been possible to eliminate soda very quickly, of course, using the method
    of difference.
  - |-
    The heroic investigation of the causes of yellow fever, discussed earlier in connection  
    with the method of difference, confirmed the conclusion that the fever is spread by the  
    bite of an infected mosquito. We know that now, just as we know now that it is alcohol and  
    not soda that causes drunkenness. But the yellow fever experiments required insight and  
    imagination as well as courage; the notion that the fever was spread by mosquitoes was  
    originally thought to be silly, or absurd, or was not thought of at all. Circumstances in the  
    real world do not come wearing tags marked "relevant" or "irrelevant." The testing of mos-  
    quito bites as cause required some earlier sorting of possibly relevant factors, to which the  
    inductive methods might then be applied. With that prior analysis in hand, the methods  
    can prove exceedingly helpful—but the methods by themselves, without some hypotheses  
    in the background, are not sufficient instruments for scientific discovery.

    Nor can the methods by themselves constitute rules for proof. Their application proceeds always on the basis of some antecedent hypotheses about causal factors, as noted just above, and because all circumstances cannot have been considered, attention will be confined to those believed to be the possible causes in question. However, this judgment regarding which circumstances are to be investigated may prove to have been in error. Medical scientists, for a very long time, did not consider dirty hands even as possible agents of infection, and so could not identify such dirtiness as the cause of disease. The failure of physicians to wash their hands (because they did not understand how infectious diseases were spread) resulted in untold misery and uncounted deaths over centuries, especially from puerperal (or childbed) fever, which was carried on the hands of doctors from mother to mother, until the proof of that disastrous causal connection was given by the Hungarian physician Ignac Semmelweis, in the middle of the nineteenth century. Investigation is stymied when the investigators fail to break down the circumstances before them into the appropriate elements, elements that cannot be known in advance. Because the analyses presupposed by the application of the methods may be incorrect, or inadequate, the inferences based on those analyses may also prove to be mistaken. This dependence of induction on the merit of the underlying hypotheses shows that inductive techniques cannot by themselves provide the proof of causation that Mill had hoped for.
    
    Yet another problem should be borne in mind: The application of inductive methods always depends on observed correlations, and even when the observations have been made accurately, they may be incomplete and therefore deceptive. The greater the number of observations, the greater is the likelihood that the correlation we observe is the manifestation of a genuine causal law—but no matter how great that number
    
    is, we cannot infer with certainty a causal connection among instances that have not yet been observed.

    These limitations illuminate once again the great gulf between deduction and induction. A valid deductive inference constitutes a proof, or demonstration, but every inductive inference is, at best, highly probable and never demonstrative. Therefore Mill's claim that his canons are "methods of proof" must be rejected, along with the claim that they are "the methods of discovery."
    
    Nevertheless, the techniques explained in this chapter are central in much of science and are very powerful. Because it is impossible for investigators to take all circumstances into account, the application of the methods must always suppose one or more causal hypotheses about the circumstances under investigation. Being unsure which factor(s) are the cause(s) of the phenomenon under investigation, we often formulate alternative hypotheses and subject each to testing. What the five methods of induction, being mainly eliminative in nature, enable us to determine is this: [fsome specified analysis of the antecedent circumstances is correct, one of these factors cannot be (or must be) the cause (or part of the cause) of the phenomenon in question. This may be deduced, and the deduction may be valid, but the soundness of that argument will always depend on the correctness of the antecedent analysis that had been supposed.
    
    The methods of induction are splendid, but they can yield reliable results only when the hypothesis that they seek to confirm (or falsify) does identify correctly the circumstances that are causally relevant. The methods permit the deduction of those results only when that hypothesis has been assumed as a premise in the argument. The nature of the power these methods give us may now be seen. They are not paths for discovery; they are not rules for proof. They are instruments for testing hypotheses. The statements of these inductive techniques, taken together, describe the general method of controlled experiment, which is a common and indispensable tool in all of modern science.
    
    So important is the role of hypotheses in systematic empirical investigations that the enterprise of devising and testing hypotheses may be regarded as the method of science—to which we turn in the next chapter.

    1. Teens who lose their virginity earlier than their peers are more likely to shoplift, destroy property, or sell drugs than their virgin counterparts, according to a recent national study of 7,000 teenagers. Those who had sex early were 20 percent more likely to engage in delinquent acts one year later compared to those whose first sexual experience occurred at the average age for their school. Those who waited longer than average to have sex had delinquency rates 50 percent lower a year later compared to average teens. Waiting appears to have a protective effect. "We're not finding that sex itself leads to delinquency; sex itself is not always a problem behavior," writes co-author and Ohio State sociologist Stacy Armour. However, "the timing of sexual initiation does matter. Kids go off on a different trajectory if they're having sex early."

    women from the inner city of Camden, N.J., to determine the influence of dietary
    and supplementary consumption of folic acid. "We found that the women who con-
    sumed less than 240 micrograms per day of folic acid had about a two- to threefold
    greater risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight," she said. She reported that
    even small increases in the women's serum folic acid concentrations by the 28th week
    decreased the odds of preterm delivery as well as the chance of having a baby of low
    birth weight. Of the 219 women in the low-folic-acid category (receiving less than
    240 micrograms a day), 44 had preterm, low-birth-weight infants. "The risks declined
    in direct relationship to increased serum levels of folic acid, showing that low intake
    is a risk factor throughout pregnancy," Dr. Scholl concluded.

    The sequence of DNA units in the genome of humans and in that of chimpanzees is
    98.8 percent identical; humans and chimps shared a joint ancestor as recently as five
    million years ago. Relatively few genes, therefore, must define the essence of human-
    ity, and biologists have long supposed that if they could identify genes that have
    changed in the evolutionary advance leading from that joint ancestor, they would
    better understand the genetic basis of how people differ from chimpanzees, and hence
    what makes humans human.
    
    This project received a significant boost in 2001 when a large London family with
    barely intelligible speech was found to have mutations in a gene called FOXP2.
    Chimpanzees also have an FOXP2 gene, but theirs is significantly different from ours.
    The human version shows signs of accelerated evolutionary change in the last 100,000
    years, which suggests that the gene acquired a new function that helped to make
    human speech possible.

    A simple, inexpensive and surprisingly powerful combination of treatments that all but wiped out malaria in a group of HIV-positive children in a recent study in Uganda was described at a very recent medical conference in Los Angeles. The combination—taking one inexpensive antibiotic pill each day and sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net—reduced the incidence of malaria by 97 percent compared with a control group. The study, conducted by Dr. Anne Gasasira of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, found that among 561 healthy children who were not HIV-infected and who did not take the antibiotic or sleep under bed nets, there were 356 episodes of malaria. This compared with 4 episodes among 300 children who were known to be HIV-infected and received both treatments. "The findings were shockingly dramatic," said Dr. Elaine Abrams, a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Columbia University.

    5. Some theories arise from anecdotal evidence that is difficult to confirm. In The Left-Hander Syndrome (New York: Bantam Books, 1992), Stanley Coren sought to evaluate the common belief that left-handed persons die sooner than right-handers. But death certificates and other public records very rarely mention the hand preferred by the deceased. What could serve as a reliable data source with which that hypothesis could be tested? Coren searched baseball records, noting which hand baseball pitchers threw with, and then recording their ages at death. Right-handed pitchers, he found, lived on average nine months longer than lefties. Then, in a follow-up study, he and a colleague telephoned the relatives of people named on death certificates in two California counties, to ask which hand the deceased favored. Right-handed people (that study found) lived an average of nine years longer than lefties.

    6. It has long been recognized that taller adults hold jobs of higher status and, on
    average, earn more than other workers. A large number of hypotheses have been
    put forward to explain the association between height and earnings. In developed
    countries, researchers have emphasized factors such as self esteem, social dominance,
    and discrimination. In this paper, we offer a simpler explanation: On average, taller
    people earn more because they are smarter. As early as age 3—before schooling has
    had a chance to play a role—and throughout childhood, taller children perform sig-
    nificantly better on cognitive tests. The correlation between height in childhood and
    adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women, so that tall children are
    much more likely to become tall adults. As adults, taller individuals are more likely to
    select into higher-paying occupations that require more advanced verbal and numeri-
    cal skills and greater intelligence, for which they earn handsome returns. Using four
    data sets from the US and the UK, we find that the height premium in adult earnings
    can be explained by childhood scores on cognitive tests. Furthermore, we show that
    taller adults select into occupations that have higher cognitive skill requirements and
    lower physical skill demands.

    out from the body and with the arm held at the side. They found that the position
    of the arm had a bigger effect on the readings than the position of the body. When
    the arm was parallel to the body, readings were higher by as much as 14 millimeters
    of mercury. Dr. David A. Guss, one of the authors of the study, said that no single
    position was more accurate, "the most important thing is to use a consistent position
    from measurement to measurement."

    8. Near the end of the Middle Ages, a few theologians (the "scientists" of that time) persuaded a king of France to give them permission for an experiment that had been forbidden by the Roman Catholic Church. They were allowed to weigh the soul of a criminal by measuring him both before and after his hanging. As usually happens with academics, they came up with a definite result: the soul weighed about an ounce and a half.

    . Undoubtedly the outstanding point of departure of industrial social psychology was the series of studies performed in the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company, starting in 1927. These were conducted by three Harvard professors, Elton Mayo, F. J. Roethlisberger, and T. N. Whitehead, and by W. J. Dickson of Western Electric. The original aim of the studies was to obtain concrete data on the effects of illumination, temperature, rest periods, hours of work, wage rate, etc., upon production. A group of six girls, average workers, were chosen for the experiment; their task was the assembly of telephone relays. Almost from the beginning, unexpected results appeared: The production rate kept going up whether rest periods and hours were increased or decreased! In each experimental period, whatever its conditions, output was higher than in the preceding one. The answer seemed to lie in a number of subtle social factors.
    
    ...As Homans summarizes it, the increase in the girls' output rate "could not be related to any change in their conditions of work, whether experimentally induced or not. It could, however, be related to what can only be spoken of as the development of an organized social group in a peculiar and effective relation with its supervisors."

    Does noise have an adverse effect on those subjected involuntarily to it? When the airport at Munich, Germany, moved, researchers from the University of Hamburg, the University of Gavle in Sweden, and Cornell University took that rare opportunity to conduct a prospective study on the effects of noise, measuring the performance of students near the old airport and near the new one, before and after the move. The reading skills of students in both groups were tested, along with short-term and long-term memory, as reported in the journal Psychological Science, in October 2002. After the move, improvements in memory and reading were found among students near the old airport, while among students living near the new airport, reading skills and memory performance declined.
    
    High levels of noise do interfere with learning and development, those researchers concluded—but the brighter side of their findings was this: Most of the learning damage done by noise appeared to reverse itself when the noise was removed.
    
    The mood changes that many people experience during the shorter days of winter have a physiological basis in the brain, according to a study reported in the British medical journal, The Lancet, in January 2003. One hundred healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 79, allowed researchers to draw blood samples, at different times of the year, from their jugular veins, to get blood as close to the brain as possible. The researchers then correlated levels of brain chemicals, especially serotonin, with the weather data—temperature, air pressure, rainfall, and sunlight—at the times of

"Our findings [the researchers wrote] are further evidence for the notion that changes in release of serotonin by the brain underlie mood seasonality and seasonal affective disorder."
    Prof. Norbert Schwartz, of the University of Michigan, conducted the following experiment. He tested the attitudes of people who had just used a University of Michigan copying machine in which, for some subjects, he had planted a dime (which they found), while for others there was no windfall dime. After using the copier, subjects were asked how happy they were about life. Those who had found a dime were consistently more upbeat about "their lives as a whole," and about the economy and many other matters. "We found," said Prof. Schwartz, "that a dime can make you happy for about twenty minutes. Then the mood wears off."

    The largest and longest-running study of American child care has found that keeping a preschooler in a day care center for a year or more increased the likelihood that the child would become disruptive in class—and that this effect persisted through the sixth grade. Every year spent in such centers for at least 10 hours per week was associated with a 1 percent higher score on a standardized assessment of problem behaviors completed by teachers. Parents' guidance, and their genes, had the strongest influence on how children behaved—but this finding about the impact of day care centers held up regardless of the child's sex, or family income, and regardless of the quality of the day care center.

    Speed kills. A report from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, issued in
    November of 2003, concluded that increased speed limits on Interstate highways
    led to nearly 1,900 additional deaths in 22 states from 1996 to 1999. The report is
    based, oddly, on a study by the Transport Safety Authority of New Zealand, working
    in the United States, which showed that, when the Federal cap on speed limits was
    placed at 65 mph, the number of deaths on U.S. highways decreased. But almost
    immediately after the repeal of that Federal cap on speed limits the number of deaths
    in the states that did not retain the 65 mph limit increased markedly, while the
    number of deaths in those states that retained the 65 mph limit did not increase.
    Drivers in states with higher speed limits, the study showed, drive faster, and where
    the driving is faster the number of traffic fatalities goes up.

    A 16-year study followed 8,867 non-smoking male professionals with normal body
    weight who participated in vigorous daily exercise and ate a healthy diet. Those
    who drank one-half to two normal servings of wine, beer, or hard liquor a day had
    a 41 to 62 percent reduction of heart attack risk compared with those who drank no
    alcohol at all. It seems clear that in moderate quantities alcoholic drinks reduce the
    likelihood of heart attack. This effect is found not only in those with heart disease.

    lower risk associated with moderate drinking."

    For heart patients, "noetic" intervention—such as prayer and MIT (therapy relying on music, imagery, and touch)—is defined as "an intangible healing influence brought about without the use of a drug, device, or surgical procedure." 748 patients with coronary heart disease who were to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (a type of stenting procedure), or elective cardiac catheterization, were enrolled at one of nine study sites between 1999 and 2002. To test the efficacy of noetic intervention, patients were randomized into four groups: one group (189 patients) received both offsite intercessory prayer and MIT therapy; a second group (182 patients) received intercessory prayer only; a third group (185 patients) received MIT therapy only; the fourth group (192 patients) received neither the intercessory prayer nor the MIT therapy. The interventional heart procedures were conducted according to each institution's standard practices, with a six-month period of follow-up. The prayer portion was double blinded, meaning that the patients and their care team did not know which patients were receiving intercessory prayer. The prayer groups for the study were located throughout the world and included Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish and many Christian denominations. 89 percent of the patients in this study also knew of someone praying for them outside of the study protocol.
    
    As reported by the Duke University Medical Center, the researchers found no significant difference among the four treatment groups. Distant prayer and the bedside use of music, imagery and touch did not have a significant effect upon the primary clinical outcome of these patients undergoing medical interventions.

    The impulse to share does not come naturally to one who is thinking about money.
    Psychologists found that subconscious reminders of money prompted people to
    become more independent in their work, and less likely to seek help from others
    or to provide it. In one experiment 52 undergraduates unscrambled sets of jumbled
    phrases; one group untangled phrases that were often about money, like "high salary
    paying," while another solved word puzzles that did not refer to money. Researchers
    then had the students work on a difficult abstract puzzle and offered to give help if
    they wanted it. Those who had been thinking about money worked on the problem
    by themselves an average of more than 70 percent longer than the others. Students
    "primed" to have money on their minds, while clearly self-reliant, were less likely
    than peers who had not been so primed to lend assistance, twice as slow to help
    another confused student, and about twice as stingy when asked to donate money
    to help needy students.

    12.5 Limitations of Inductive Techniques
    
    aak-)e)i-)a04 Summary
    
    In this chapter we have examined the concept of cause, the nature of causal connections, and the meth-
    ods used to establish causal laws.
    
    In Section 12.1, we examined various meanings of "cause."
    
    In Section 12.2, we explained the supposition of the uniformity of nature, and the generality of
    causal laws.
    
    In Section 12.3, we discussed induction by simple enumeration.
    
    In Section 12.4, we recounted and illustrated the principal techniques of inductive inference, called
    Mill's methods, explaining their essentially eliminative nature. These five methods are:
    
    The method of agreement
    
    The method of difference
    
    The joint method of agreement and difference
    The method of residues
    
    The method of concomitant variation.

    In Section 12.5, we explained the limitations and the strengths of these inductive techniques,
    concluding that, although they cannot do all that John Stuart Mill had claimed for them, they are
    profoundly important as the intellectual instruments with which scientific hypotheses are confirmed
    or disconfirmed.

    Science and Hypothesis
    
    Scientific  
    explanation  
    
    A theoretical account  
    of some fact or event,  
    predicated upon  
    empirical evidence  
    and subject to revision  
    in the light of new  
    information.

    13.4 Classification as Hypothesis  
    
    13.1) Scientific Explanation  
    
    To learn the truth about the world, the world must be studied scientifically. However,  
    individual truths do not take us very far; a mere collection of facts no more constitutes a  
    science than a collection of stones constitutes a house. The aim of science is to discover  
    general truths (chiefly in the form of causal connections like those discussed in the pre-  
    ceding chapter) with which the facts we encounter can be explained.
    
    What is an explanation? Every explanation gives an account, a set of statements  
    from which the thing to be explained can be logically inferred. The best account will  
    be the one that most reduces the problematic aspects of what was to be explained. Such  
    an account will comprise a coherent set of general truths, or a theory. To explain some  
    serious disease, for example, we need a coherent account of what causes that disease  
    and how it can be treated. Is the presence or absence of some particular substance the  
    Key to the disorder? The theory explaining diabetes, for example, is a coherent account  
    of the use of sugars by the human body and the central role, in that use, of a protein  
    hormone called insulin, produced by certain special cells within the body. According to  
    this theory, it is a deficiency of insulin (or the inability of the body to use the insulin  
    it produces) that explains the resulting disorder in the absorption of sugars from the  
    blood. An account of this kind (here greatly oversimplified, of course) gives a scien-  
    tific explanation of this serious disease. Patients suffer from diabetes because of their  
    insulin deficiency.
  - |-
    When we say "Q because P," that may express either an explanation or an argument.
    It expresses an argument when we are inferring the conclusion, Q, from the premises,
    P. It expresses an explanation when, facing the fact of Q, our reasoning moves back
    from that fact to discover the circumstances that led to it. Diabetes—excess sugar in the
    blood—is a cruel fact in the lives of many patients. We explain their diabetes by calling
    attention to the insulin deficiency that has that result. The account of the interrelated
    set of circumstances in which the insulin deficiency, P, accounts for the sugar excess, Q,
    is thus an explanation of that disease.
    557
    
    13.1
    
    A good explanation must offer truths that are relevant to the fact explained. If I seek
    to explain my being late to work on some occasion by calling attention to the rising
    birth rate in Brazil, the fact thus introduced may be correct, but it is not relevant, and
    it therefore cannot be a satisfactory explanation of my absence, the event in question.
    In this trivial example, an explanation is sought for a single event. In science we seek
    explanations that are not only true and relevant, but also general. The explanations we
    aim for will provide an understanding of all the events of some given kind—say, all the
    occurrences of diabetes, for example.
    
    The more facts for which a scientific theory accounts, the more powerful it is. Some
    theories are magnificent in their range and power. Here, for example, is a short statement
    of Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation:
    
    Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly propor-
    tional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
    between them.
    
    An explanation may be relevant and general, and yet not scientific. The regu-
    lar motions of the planets were long thought to be accounted for by the "intelli-
    gence" that was held to reside in each planet. In some cultures, disease is "explained"
    as the work of an evil spirit that has invaded the body. These are certainly unscien-
    tific accounts, although the explanations they offer are general and are relevant to
    the facts of interest. What, then, distinguishes genuinely scientific from unscientific
    explanations?
  - |-
    There are two chief differences. The first is attitude. An unscientific explanation
    is presented dogmatically; the account that it gives is regarded as being unquestionably
    true and not improvable. The opinions of Aristotle were accepted for centuries as the ulti-
    mate authority on matters of fact. Aristotle himself appears to have been open-minded,
    but his views were adopted by some medieval scholars in a rigid and unscientific spirit.
    One of the scholars to whom Galileo offered his telescope to view the newly discovered
    moons of Jupiter declined to look, expressing his certainty that no real moons could
    possibly be seen because no mention of them could be found in Aristotle's treatise on
    astronomy! In contrast, the attitude of a serious scientist is undogmatic; explanations
    are put forward provisionally; hypotheses may be thought highly probable, but they are
    regarded as subject to alteration in the light of the evidence.
    
    The vocabulary of science is sometimes misleading on this point. When what is
    first suggested as a "hypothesis" is well confirmed, its status may be elevated to that
    of a "theory"; after universal acceptance, it may be further elevated to that of a "law."
    However, the use of these terms is not consistent. Newton's discovery is still called the
    "law of gravitation," while Einstein's contribution, which improved and superseded it, is
    referred to as the "theory of relativity." Whatever the terms used, the attitude of genuine
    scientists is not dogmatic. The general propositions of science are all in essence hypoth-
    eses, never absolutely certain.
    
    In everyday speech the word theory is often used to refer to a hunch, or a mere
    opinion. Scientists use the word differently. In physics and chemistry we refer—not
    dogmatically, but nevertheless with great confidence—to "quantum theory" and to
    the "molecular theory of matter"; in biology we rightly rely upon the "cellular theory"
    and the "germ theory of disease." These are sets of very well-established truths, not

    and regarded as

  - |-
    Ungrounded speculations. Evolution—the "theory of evolution"—is also an established fact; doubts about evolution expressed because it is "only a theory" are the result of this semantic misunderstanding.
    
    The second difference concerns the basis for accepting the account in question. In science a hypothesis is worthy of acceptance only to the extent that there is good evidence for it. An unscientific belief may be held independently of what we should regard as evidence in its favor; the explanation is taken as simply true—perhaps because "everyone knows" that it is so, or perhaps because it is thought to have been revealed from on high. There is no reliable test of such claims, whereas in genuine science the claims for truth can be tested, and those tests lie in our experience. Thus we say that genuine science is empirical.
    
    To say that a hypothesis is testable is at least to say that some prediction made on the basis of that hypothesis may confirm or disconfirm it. Science demands evidence. But, of course, the evidence accumulated that could confirm the hypothesis in question can never be complete, as we have earlier emphasized; all the evidence is never in hand. Therefore, even when that supporting evidence is very strong, some doubt must remain, and certainty is unattainable. On the negative side, however, if the evidence shows indisputably that the predictions made on the basis of that hypothesis are false, our confidence that the hypothesis must be rejected may be total. Although we cannot complete the verification of a hypothesis, we can, with closure, establish that it has been falsified. For reasons of this kind, some philosophers have held that to say of a scientific hypothesis that it is testable is also to say that it is, at least in principle, falsifiable.
  - |-
    The test of truth may be direct or indirect. To determine whether it is raining outside, I need only glance out the window. In general, however, the propositions offered as explanatory hypotheses are not directly testable. If my lateness at work had been explained by my claim about some traffic accident, my employer, if suspicious, might test that explanation indirectly by seeking the police accident report. An indirect test deduces, from the proposition to be tested (for example, that I was involved in an accident), some other proposition (for example, that an accident report had been submitted) capable of being tested directly. If that deduced proposition is false, the explanation that implied it is very likely to be false. If the deduced proposition is true, that provides some evidence (but not conclusive evidence) that the explanation is true, having been indirectly confirmed.
    
    Indirect testing is never certain. It always relies on some additional premises, such as the premise that accidents of the sort I described to my employer are invariably reported to the police. But the accident report that should have been submitted in my case may not have been, so its absence does not prove my explanation false. Even the truth of some added premises does not render my explanation certain—although the successful testing of the conclusion deduced (the reality of the accident report, in this example) does corroborate the premises from which it was deduced.
    
    Even an unscientific explanation has some evidence in its favor, namely, the very fact it is held to explain. The unscientific theory that the planets are inhabited by "intelligences" that cause them to move in their observed orbits can claim, as evidence, the fact that the planets do move in those orbits. However, the great difference between that hypothesis and the reliable astronomical explanation of planetary movement lies in this: For the unscientific hypothesis there is no other directly testable proposition that can be deduced from it. Any scientific explanation of a given phenomenon, on the other

    hand, will have directly testable propositions deducible from it other than the proposition
    stating the fact to be explained. This is what we mean when we say that an explanation
    is empirically verifiable, and such verifiability is the most essential mark of a scientific
    explanation.*
    
    Scientific Inquiry: Hypothesis
    and Confirmation
    
    We seek scientific explanations that are correct, and whose correctness may be empiri-
    cally verified. How can we obtain these explanations? No formulas for doing science
    can be given, but there are stages, or distinct phases, in most scientific investigations.
    By identifying and describing seven such stages we may come to understand more fully
    how good science advances.
    
    A. Identifying the Problem
    
    Scientific investigation begins with a problem of some kind. By problem is meant only
    some fact, or group of facts, for which no acceptable explanation is at that time avail-
    able. The sociologist confronts a puzzling trend in work or play; what accounts for
    it? The medical investigator confronts a puzzling disease; what causes it? The econo-
    mist observes different patterns of spending or saving; what explains the variations?
    Some problems are quite sharply identified, as when a detective confronts a specific
    crime and asks: Who is the perpetrator? Some problems may arise from a gap in cur-
    rent understanding. Eratosthenes, librarian at Alexandria in the third century B.C.,
    believed correctly that the Earth was a sphere, but its size was unknown. His problem
    was to determine the circumference of the sphere we call Earth. Reflective thinking—
    whether in sociology or medicine or law enforcement or physics, or any other realm—
    is problem-solving activity, as John Dewey and other modern philosophers have
    repeatedly emphasized. The recognition of some problem is the trigger for the science
    that ensues.
    
    B. Devising Preliminary Hypotheses
  - |-
    Preliminary speculation is the second step—some very tentative explanation of the problem identified. Long before a full solution is in sight, some theorizing is needed to indicate the kind of evidence needed, and perhaps to indicate where such evidence might best be sought. The detective examines the scene of the crime, interviews suspects, seeks clues. The physician examines the patient, records data, notes irregularities. Bare facts are accumulated; they become usable clues or revealing symptoms only when they are fitted into some coherent pattern, even if that pattern is speculative and incomplete. To illustrate: Thomas Malthus had shown, in "An Essay on the Principle of Population" (1798), that the tendency of a population to grow faster than the food
    
    * This general conception of "scientific explanation" rightly applies outside the realm of what is normally thought of as
    the sciences, such as physics or psychology. Thus, the explanation of an event such as my lateness to work as a consequence of a traffic accident, in being indirectly testable in various ways, is in this wide sense "scientific."
      
    Chapter 13 Science and Hypothesis
    
    supply keeps most people at the edge of starvation. Charles Darwin, reading this while speculating about the origin of species many years later, hit upon an exceedingly fruitful notion. He wrote:
    
    It at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and
    unfavourable ones to be destroyed... . Here then | had at last got a theory by which to work.
    (Autobiography, 1881)
    
    There are too many possibly relevant facts—too much data in the world—for the scientist to collect them all. The most thorough investigator must select some facts for further study and put other facts aside as not relevant. If the Earth is a sphere, the rays of the sun will fall (at any given time) upon different points of that sphere at different angles. Might geometry help us to calculate the size of the Earth? The outline of a theory is essential because, without that, the investigator cannot decide which facts to select and pursue from the totality of facts. However incomplete or tentative, a preliminary hypothesis of some kind is needed before serious inquiry can get under way.
    
    C. Collecting Additional Facts
  - |-
    The preliminary hypothesis serves to guide the search for relevant facts. As a prelimi-
    nary matter, the patient is thought to have some infection, and that hypothesis puts the
    physician on the trail of certain kinds of data that are normally associated with infec-
    tion: temperature irregularities, patterns of inflammation, and the like. The preliminary
    supposition that the crime was committed by a member of the household will cause the
    detective to inquire into the conduct of persons residing there, and so on. If the angle at
    which the sun's rays strike the Earth must differ at different points on the Earth's surface,
    one must seek, in order to apply geometric principles, at least one point at which the sun
    is known to be directly overhead at a given time. Where might that be?
    
    The second and third steps are not fully separable, of course; in real life they are inter-
    connected and mutually suggestive. New facts found may cause an adjustment of the
    preliminary hypothesis; that adjustment may lead to facts earlier not noted. The process
    of gathering evidence by using the preliminary hypothesis merges with the process of
    refining that hypothesis, leading to new findings, and so on and on.
    
    D. Formulating the Explanatory Hypothesis
    
    Eventually, the investigator—the scientist, or detective, or ordinary person—may come
    to believe that all the facts needed for solving the original problem are in hand. The
    task then becomes that of assembling the pieces of the puzzle in a way that makes sense
    of the whole. If that synthesis is successful, a hypothesis will emerge that accounts for all
    the data—the original set of facts that gave rise to the problem, as well as the additional
    facts to which earlier hypotheses had pointed. A surge in unemployment is explained
    by some larger theory of the labor market. The patient is found to be suffering from an
    identifiable infectious agent known to cause the symptoms noted in this patient's condi-
    tion. An identifiable member of the household is charged by the state as the perpetrator
    of the crime and the case against him is formulated.
    
    There is no mechanical way to find some overarching theory. The actual discovery,
    or invention, of a successful explanatory hypothesis is a process of creation, in which

    imagination as well as knowledge is involved. That is why those who make important scientific discoveries are so widely honored and so much admired.
    
    What is the circumference of the globe? Eratosthenes learned that in the Egyptian town of Syene (now called Aswan), the sun's rays shine directly down a deep well at a given time on a particular day each year. At that same time he could measure the sun's shadows (and therefore the angle of its rays) in Alexandria; he found that the rays there deviated from the vertical by 7°. That is about one-fiftieth of the 360° of the sphere's circumference. The distance between Syene and Alexandria was known. The circumference of the entire sphere of Earth must therefore be about fifty times that distance. Eratosthenes' subsequent calculation of the Earth's circumference ("250,000 stadia") is believed (we are unsure of the length of a stadium) to have an error of less than 5 percent. He had no way to confirm that calculation, but it was impressive science for his time. Truly great scientists—such as Einstein or Newton—are understandably viewed as creative geniuses.
    
    E. Deducing Further Consequences
    
    A good explanatory hypothesis will be fruitful; that is, it will explain not only the facts that provoked the inquiry but many other facts as well. It is likely to suggest some facts that had not even been thought of earlier. Verification of these additional facts may strongly confirm (but, of course, cannot prove with certainty) the hypothesis that led to them.
  - |-
    To illustrate, the cosmological theory known as the Big Bang hypothesizes that the present universe began with one singular explosive event. The initial fireball would have been smooth and homogeneous, lacking structure. But the universe today exhibits a great deal of structure; its visible matter is clumped into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and so on. If the Big Bang theory is correct, the seeds of the present structure of the universe must in principle be identifiable. We need to be able to look back in time—and by observing the most distant objects in an expanding universe, astronomers actually can, in effect, look back in time, since the light being received must have left its sources billions of years ago. If, in these observations, early structures were not detectable by the most sensitive instruments, the Big Bang theory would be seriously undermined. But if such structure were detectable, the Big Bang theory would be significantly confirmed.
    
    F. Testing the Consequences
    
    Critical for the evaluation of every explanatory hypothesis is the accuracy of its predic-
    tions. Can the facts to which the theory points be ascertained? Often they can. If there
    was structure in the universe early in its expansion, as the Big Bang theory predicts, there
    would have to be irregularities, unevenness, that may be found in background radiation
    and traced to that early time. Happily, it is possible to measure that background radia-
    tion and thus to determine now, indirectly, that there were structural irregularities very
    shortly after the supposed Big Bang. To detect those predicted radiation irregularities,
    a special satellite was designed—the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). Using this
    satellite, the predicted irregularities have indeed been detected, giving very important
    confirmatory evidence for the truth of the Big Bang hypothesis.
    
    Consider prediction in another context. In biology we may come to formulate the
    hypothesis that a particular protein is produced in mammals as a reaction to a particular
    enzyme, and that that enzyme is produced under the direction of a specifically identified
    gene. From this hypothesis we may deduce the further consequence that when that gene
    is absent there will be an absence, or a deficiency, of the protein in question.
  - |-
    To test that hypothesis we construct an experiment in which the effect of the  
    identified gene may be measured. This can sometimes be done by breeding mice in  
    which the critical gene has been deleted—"knockout mice." If, in such mice, the  
    enzyme in question and the protein associated with it are indeed also absent, our  
    hypothesis will have been strongly confirmed.* Much information that proves very  
    valuable in medicine is acquired in just this way. We devise the experiment to deter-  
    mine whether what we thought to be true (if such-and-such were the case) really  
    is true. To do that we must often construct the very special circumstances in which  
    such-and-such has been made the case. "An experiment," as the great physicist Max  
    Planck said, "is a question that science poses to Nature; a measurement is the record-  
    ing of Nature's answer."
    
    It is not always feasible to construct the circumstances needed to perform a test.  
    We must then seek the circumstances needed for testing in some natural setting. That  
    was the case in the effort to test the general theory of relativity.} Einstein's theory  
    proposed that gravitation is not a force (as Newton had thought) but a curved field in  
    the space-time continuum, created by the presence of mass. This might be proved (or  
    disproved), Einstein suggested, by measuring the deflection of starlight as it traveled  
    close by the mass of the sun; the starlight needed would be visible only during a  
    total eclipse of the sun. The testing of this prediction had to await the solar eclipse of  
    1919, when the sun would be silhouetted against the Hyades star cluster, for which  
    the positions were known exactly. During that eclipse, physicist Sir Arthur Eddington  
    stationed himself on an island off the western coast of Africa; another group of British  
    scientists went to Brazil. The two teams measured accurately the apparent position of  
    several of the stars in the cluster; their measurements plainly showed that light from  
    these stars was indeed bent as it grazed the sun, and that it was bent by the exact  
    amount of Einstein's prediction. The general theory of relativity had been very solidly  
    confirmed.
  - |-
    This theory showed that space, time, and gravity are so entwined that to speak sensibly about one there must be reference to the others. Einstein struggled to go further, to develop a theory in which all of nature's forces are merged into one single, overarching theory. In this effort he did not succeed, and neither has anyone else so far.
    
    String theory is a contemporary attempt to construct a complete and unified theory of nature's four known forces (i.e., the electromagnetic force, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity) and nature's known matter particles (e.g., electron, neutrino, quark) and force-carrier particles (e.g., photon, gluon, W and Z bosons). It offers a theoretical account that may unify Quantum Mechanics and the General Theory of Relativity, explain particles and their interactions by means of a fundamental vibrational string, and solve some earlier mathematical problems as well. Although string theory has much to recommend it theoretically, including freedom from mathematical contradictions, it has not yet been confirmed.
    
    What predictions does string theory make that might confirm it by experimental test? It may become possible to confirm the theory's predictions regarding new kinds of particles; it may become possible to test the prediction that highly energetic particle collisions will produce microscopic black holes. Physicists hope that with the help of
    
    * Testing of this kind relies on what we called the method of difference in Chapter 12. The many methods discussed there (Mill's methods) are intellectual tools used to confirm (or disconfirm) hypotheses.

    Evolutionary theory, as presented by Darwin in *The Origin of Species* (1859) and by very many of his successors, is now almost universally accepted as a correct explanation of the development of species of animals and plants. Predictions that can test this theory prospectively (rather than retrospectively) are difficult to devise because the natural selection hypothesized seems to require the passage of many generations. In 2006, a Harvard professor of evolutionary biology, Jonathan Losos, devised an experiment that makes speedy testing feasible. On some tiny cays in the Bahamas, where the brown lizard *Anolis sagrei* lives free of predators and reproduces rapidly, he introduced a predator whose activity would quickly result in the development (in those islands as compared to other, similar islands left unperturbed) of a lizard population with longer legs, much better suited to running away. Selective forces operated as expected; long legs came to dominate. However, when continually preyed upon, the *Anolis* lizard climbs into trees and bushes, where short legs are much more advantageous. The further prediction was that natural selection would produce a reversal and that short legs would eventually dominate—and six months later that prediction also was confirmed. Evolution has been first manipulated and then deliberately reversed. Said Prof. Losos:
    
    "Evolutionary biology is often caricatured as incompatible with controlled experimentation. Recent work has shown, however, that evolutionary biology can be studied on short time scales and that predictions about it can be tested experimentally. We predicted, and then demonstrated, a reversal in the direction of natural selection acting on limb length in a population of lizards. We did a controlled, replicable experiment in nature. It illustrates that evolutionary biology at its heart is no different from any other science."
    
    G. Applying the Theory
  - |-
    When a phenomenon is encountered, one goal is to explain it; however, people also strive
    to control those phenomena to their advantage. Not only do the theories of Newton and
    Einstein and their successors play a central role in our understanding of celestial phe-
    nomena, but they are also critical in our actual exploration of the solar system, and outer
    space beyond. Nuclear fusion is now well understood as a process; we seek to apply this
    understanding in producing energy on a scale we can control. Disease and disorder are
    understood as never before, incorporating the well-tested explanations of genetic theory
    and our grasp of the human genome; now we seek to put this understanding to use in
    clinical medicine by eliminating genetic disorders, and even by regenerating organic tis-
    sue. In this twenty-first century it is probably biological science, more than any other field,
    whose explanations will enhance the quality and the length of ordinary human lives.
    Good practice in every sphere must be guided by good theory. Good theory must pass
    the test of empirical verification. Theory and practice are not two realms; they are equally
    critical aspects of every genuinely scientific undertaking. More than two centuries ago,
    Immanuel Kant wrote an incisive little book explaining why it makes no good sense to
    
    * Some scientists contend that string theory makes no predictions whose testing will truly confirm or disconfirm it. See L.
    Smolin, The Trouble with Physics (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006); and P. Woit, Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String
    Theory (New York: Basic Books, 2006). It may be that the theory makes predictions that are testable in principle, but
    not testable in practice given current technological limitations. This heated controversy Is likely to continue.
    
    chapter 13 Science and Hypothesis
    
    say, "that may be right in theory but it won't work in practice."? What is right in theory
    does work in practice, and for everything that does work in practice we may reasonably
    hope to discover the explanatory theory that underlies its success.
    
    13.3 Evaluating Competing Scientific Explanations
  - |-
    The same phenomenon may receive different explanations, all scientific in the sense  
    we have described, and yet some of them may not be true. Conflicting explanations of  
    some physical or economic phenomenon may be offered. In a criminal investigation we  
    may hypothesize that the perpetrator was X, or was Y. More than one hypothesis may  
    account for the facts neatly, but not all can be true. How shall we choose among alterna-  
    tive scientific explanations?
    
    Let us assume that all the alternatives are relevant and testable. How ought we  
    determine which of the available hypotheses is the best? There are standards—going  
    beyond relevance and testability—to which acceptable hypotheses may be expected to  
    conform. Three criteria are most commonly used in judging the merit of competing  
    hypotheses.
    
    1. Compatibility with previously well-established hypotheses. Science aims  
    at achieving a system of explanatory hypotheses. A satisfactory system must be  
    internally consistent, of course. A satisfactory explanatory system cannot contain  
    contradictory elements; if it did, the full set of propositions could not possibly be  
    true. We progress by gradually expanding hypotheses to comprehend more and  
    more facts, but each new hypothesis brought into the set must be compatible with  
    those already confirmed.
    
    Sometimes the expansion involves only one new hypothesis, as when the aberra-  
    tions in the orbit of Uranus were explained by the hypothesis that there was some  
    other planet, uncharted at that time, whose mass was creating the aberrations. That supposition was perfectly consistent with the main body of astronomical  
    theory at the time. A search for the mysterious object resulted in the discovery  
    of the planet Neptune in 1846. The theory that led to that discovery fit very nicely  
    with all the other theories concerning planetary movements generally accepted  
    at that time.
  - |-
    Although theoretical knowledge grows gradually, it does not always grow by adding just one new hypothesis after another in orderly fashion. Clumps of theory may be introduced; new hypotheses that are flatly inconsistent with older theories sometimes replace their predecessors outright, rather than being fitted in with them. Einstein's theory of relativity was of that sort: It shattered many of the preconceptions of the older, Newtonian theory of gravitation. In another branch of physics, it was discovered that radium atoms undergo spontaneous disintegration, and this well-confirmed fact was simply inconsistent with an older principle that matter could neither be created nor destroyed. To maintain a consistent set of hypotheses, the older principle had to be relinquished.
    
    The consistency of the set of scientific theories in a given field is thus achieved in different ways. However, apart from those cases in which some revolutionary theory upsets long-established principles, the first criterion for an acceptable new hypothesis is that it retain the existing consistency, be compatible with what is already known, or be reasonably believed.
    
    13.3. Evaluating Competing Scientific Explanations
    
    When old and new collide, the established scientific theories will not be abandoned quickly in favor of some that are shinier or more trendy. The older body of theory will be adjusted to accommodate the new if that is possible. Large-scale change will be resisted. Einstein himself always insisted that his own work was a modification of Newton's, not a rejection of it. The principle of the conservation of matter was modified by being absorbed into the more comprehensive principle of the conservation of mass-energy. An established theory has the support that it does because it explains a considerable mass of data, so it cannot be dethroned by some new hypothesis unless the new hypothesis accounts for the same facts as well as (or better than) the older one, and accounts for other known facts also.
    
    Science advances as its theories give more comprehensive explanations, more

    adequate accounts of the world we encounter. When inconsistencies arise, the
    greater age of one hypothesis does not automatically prove it correct. If the older
    view has been extensively confirmed, presumption will support it. When the newer,
    competing view has also received extensive confirmation, mere age and priority
    cease to be relevant. We must then decide between the competitors on the basis
    of something we learn about the observable facts. The ultimate court of appeal is
    always experience.
    Predictive power. As we have seen, every scientific hypothesis must be testable,
    and testability requires that some observable fact or facts be deducible from it.
    Alternative hypotheses will differ in the nature and extent of their predictions, and
    we seek the theoretical explanation that has the greater predictive power.
    
    To illustrate: The behavior of bodies near the surface of the Earth was explained by
    Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) with his laws of falling bodies. The behavior of bodies far
    off in the solar system was explained at about that same time by the German astrono-
    mer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), who formulated the laws of planetary motion.
    Using the data that had been collected by Denmark's Tycho Brahe, Kepler could
    account for the motions of the planets on the basis of the elliptical orbits they travel
    around the sun. Galileo gave a theoretically powerful account of the various phenom-
    ena of terrestrial mechanics. Kepler gave a theoretically powerful account of celestial
    mechanics. But the two accounts were isolated from one another. Their unification
    was needed; it came with Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation, and his three
    laws of motion. All the phenomena explained by Galileo and by Kepler, and many
    more facts besides, were explained by Newton's account of universal gravitation.
    
    A fact that can be deduced from a given hypothesis is said to be explained by
    it, and may also be said to be predicted by it. Newton's theories had enormous
    predictive power. The greater the predictive power of any hypothesis, the better it
    contributes to our understanding of the phenomena with which it is concerned.
  - |-
    Earlier we described the great predictive power of Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounts for the admiration given to it and to its creator. We also pointed out that his enterprise—the development of an overarching theory of natural forces—is held by some to approach success now in the form of what is called string theory; some predictions of great interest are claimed to be deducible from this theory. If those predictions are one day confirmed, the predictive power of string theory will elevate it to a position of the very first importance in physics and cosmology.
    
    However, the criterion of predictive power also has a negative side. If the hypothesis predicts what does not take place, or is in some other way shown to be inconsistent with well-attested observations, that hypothesis has been falsified and must be rejected. A meaningful scientific hypothesis must be at least falsifiable—that is, we must know what would or might show it to be false. If there is no set of observable outcomes that will lead us to conclude that the hypothesis is false, we may seriously doubt if the hypothesis has any predictive power whatever.
    
    Suppose we confront two different hypotheses, both of which fully explain some set of facts, both of which are testable, and both of which are compatible with the body of already established scientific theory. In such a case, it may be possible to devise a crucial experiment to decide between the conflicting theories. If the first hypothesis entails that, under a given set of circumstances, a specified result will occur, and the second entails that it will not, we may decide between the competitors by observing the presence or absence of that predicted result. Its appearance falsifies the second hypothesis; its nonappearance falsifies the first.
    
    The experiment described earlier, in which the general theory of relativity was

    tested by making exact measurements of the starlight that passed closely by the
    mass of sun, was crucial in just this way. The theory of Newton and the theory
    of Einstein cannot both be correct. If the bending of the light is as Einstein's the-
    ory predicted, the Newtonian view is disconfirmed; if the bending of light is not
    observed, the general theory of relativity is disconfirmed. With good cameras, very
    careful observers, and a solar eclipse in which the three bodies (Sun, Moon, and
    Earth) were correctly lined up, the crucial experiment might be made. Those ideal
    circumstances arose on 29 May 1919. Photographs proved that Einstein was right;
    we do live in a curved, four-dimensional space-time continuum. Einstein became
    a worldwide sensation overnight.
    Simplicity. Two rival hypotheses may fit equally well with established theory, and
    they may also have predictive power that is roughly equal. In such circumstances
    we are likely to favor the simpler of the two. The conflict between the Ptolemaic
    (Earth-centered) and the Copernican (sun-centered) theories of celestial motion was
    like that. Both fit well with earlier theory, and they predicted celestial movements
    about equally well. Both hypotheses relied on a clumsy (and, as we now know,
    mistaken) device, hypothesized epicycles (smaller circles of movement on the larger
    orbits), in order to explain some well-established astronomical observations. But the
    Copernican system relied on many fewer such epicycles and was therefore much
    simpler. This greater simplicity contributed substantially to its acceptance by later
    astronomers.
    
    Simplicity seems to be a "natural" criterion to invoke. In ordinary life also, we
    are inclined to accept the simplest theory that fits all the facts. Two theories about
    a crime may be presented at a trial; the verdict is likely to be given—perhaps ought
    to be given—in favor of the hypothesis that seems simpler, more natural.
  - |-
    "Simplicity," however, is a tricky notion. That one of the competing theories will involve a smaller number of some troubling entity (such as the epicycles in the case of Copernican astronomy) is a rare situation. Each of two theories may be simpler than the other in different ways. One may rely on a smaller number of entities, while the other may rely on simpler mathematical equations. Even "naturalness" may prove to be deceptive. Many find it more "natural" to believe that the Earth, which does not seem to be moving, really is not moving, and that the Sun, which appears to move around us, is doing just that. The lesson here is that simplicity is a criterion that is difficult to formulate and not always easy to apply.
    
    Progress in science is never easy and rarely straightforward. No one supposes that simply by applying the seven steps of the hypothetico-deductive method (recounted in 13.2) to some problem will find its solution. Correct explanatory hypotheses are often obscure and may require very elaborate theoretical machinery. Devising a final, presumably correct theory may be exceedingly difficult. Far from being mechanical, the process commonly requires, in addition to laborious observation and measurement, insight and creative imagination.
    
    When some hypothesis already in hand is widely believed to explain the phenomena in question, a replacement for it encounters very high hurdles. The new hypothesis is likely to encounter ridicule and disdain. The new hypothesis is very probably inconsistent with the previously accepted theory, and the established view always has the upper hand. A crucial experiment, of the sort described earlier in the case of the general theory of relativity, is possible only in rare circumstances.
  - |-
    Contemporary physics faces a major conflict of just this kind. Between its two most  
    powerful general theories there is an apparent conflict that cannot presently be resolved.  
    The general theory of relativity is well confirmed. From its laws (describing gravity and  
    how it shapes space and time), it is an apparently inevitable consequence that some col-  
    lapsing, massive stars will form "black holes" from which escape would require a speed  
    faster than light, which is impossible. The laws of quantum mechanics are also well  
    confirmed, and they entail that information cannot ever be permanently lost, even if  
    drawn into a black hole. Therefore, either there is some property of space and time, not  
    now understood, that can account for the retention of that information, or there is some  
    lawlessness in physics that can account for the permanent loss of that information. One  
    of the two theories must need at least an amendment, but we do not yet know which  
    one, and we do not have the means to construct an experiment that would enable us to  
    decide between them.*
    
    Confronted by such conflicts we will seek to apply the criteria of good scientific  
    explanations we set forth earlier: Which of the competing theories is simpler? Which of  
    the two has greater compatibility with previously established hypotheses? Finally, above  
    all, which has the greater explanatory or predictive power? So long as definitive answers to  
    these questions are lacking, the intellectual controversy is likely to continue unresolved.
    
    It does happen in the history of scientific progress that such conflicts are sometimes  
    resolved. There is no better way to exhibit the methods of science, and to exemplify the  
    application of the criteria described here, than by recounting the observational confir-  
    mation by Galileo of the heliocentric account of the solar system—and the resulting  
    replacement of the geocentric account that had been accepted as true for more than a  
    thousand years.
    
    By the early 1600s, the movement of the planets against the backdrop of the fixed  
    stars had been so carefully studied that their apparent movements were quite accurately  
    predictable. The Moon, also much studied, was believed by theologians to be a perfect  
    sphere. The heavenly bodies, deemed flawless in shape and movement, were widely  
    believed to travel in perfect circles around the Earth, which was the center of the world
  - |-
    * A hypothetical experiment has been proposed: Throw a volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica into a black hole. Will
    the information it contains be forever lost? Is such a total loss impossible? A wager, light-hearted but serious, between
    two distinguished Caltech physicists has been placed on the outcome. Prof. Kip Thorne bets on relativity, whose equa-
    tions describe space and time and predict that from the singularity of a black hole there could never be any recovery.
    Prof. John Preskill bets on quantum mechanics, whose equations precisely describe the lives of minuscule elementary
    particles and predict that the information can never be totally lost. The stakes of the wager are a set of encyclopedias.
    Payoff is unlikely to come soon. Says their equally distinguished colleague, Prof. Stephen Hawking of Cambridge Uni-
    versity, who originally was in on the bet, "In my opinion it could go either way." Hawking, but not Thorne, conceded
    the bet in 2004. [Science News, 25 September 2004]
    
    chapter 13 Science and Hypothesis
    
    God had created. By 1609, Galileo had devised a telescope with 20-power magnification,
    its chief uses being thought at first to be maritime, or as a spyglass that could provide
    military advantage. With this instrument he observed the heavens, almost by accident,
    in January 1610. On the 7th of that month he began a long letter, reporting in detail his
    observations of the Moon and other bodies. He wrote:
    
    "I have observed with one of my telescopes .. . the face of the Moon, which I have been able to see very
    near... . [W]hat is there can be discerned with great distinctness, and in fact it is seen that the Moon is most
    evidently not at all of an even, smooth and regular surface, as a great many people believe of it and of the
    other heavenly bodies, but on the contrary it is rough and unequal. In short, it is shown to be such that sane
    reasoning cannot conclude otherwise than that it is full of prominences and cavities similar, but much larger,
    to the mountains and valleys spread over the Earth's surface.'"
  - |-
    To save the hypothesis that the Moon was indeed a perfect sphere, and thus to retain the coherence of the theological account of the heavenly bodies of which that perfection was one element, some of Galileo's critics later proposed the hypothesis—outrageously ad hoc—that the apparent cavities and irregularities on the surface of the Moon were, in fact, filled in by a celestial substance that was flawless and crystalline, and thus invisible through Galileo's telescope!
    
    More than the Moon was examined by Galileo. His letter continued:
    
    And besides the observations of the Moon... many fixed stars are seen with the telescope that are not [otherwise] discerned; and only this evening | have seen Jupiter accompanied by three fixed stars, totally invisible [to the naked eye] by their smallness, and the configuration was in this form:4
    
    At that point Galileo inserted a sketch that appears here as Figure 13-1, showing the three stars in a straight line, two to the east and one to the west of Jupiter; he reported that they did not extend more than one degree of longitude, but since at that time he supposed them to be fixed stars, their distances from Jupiter and from one another were indicated only very roughly.
    
    On the following day, 8 January 1610, "led by I know not what," Galileo happened to observe Jupiter once again; the earlier positions of those "fixed stars" had fortunately been written down. His letter remained unsent; at the bottom of the sheet he wrote the following note:
    
    On the 8th thus: [He inserts a sketch showing Jupiter and three stars now closer to one another and nearly equidistant from one another, and all three to the west of Jupiter!
    
    This created a serious theoretical problem for Galileo, because at this time the assumption that the newly discovered stars were fixed had not been seriously doubted. Therefore their appearance on the other side of Jupiter had to be accounted for by Jupiter's movements. On the 8th he added the note:
    
    It [Jupiter's movement] was therefore direct and not retrograde.

    If, on the 8th, Jupiter was to the east of all three stars, and the day before Jupiter had been to the west of two of them, Jupiter must have moved, and moved in a way that was contrary to reliable astronomical calculations! One can imagine Galileo's agitation as he waited for the observations of the following night; could his direct observations and his calculations remain so sharply inconsistent? On the 9th it was too cloudy to observe, but he was able to resume his observations the following night and to record the new pattern. On 11 January a similar pattern was observed, but on this night Galileo later wrote:
    
    The star nearer Jupiter was half the size of the other, and very close to the other, whereas the other evenings all three of the said stars appeared of equal size and equally far apart.
    
    On the 12th, Jupiter apparently had moved back to the west, and two of the new "stars" were again observed to the east of the planet! Clearly, something had to give.
    From the accepted theories and beliefs a prediction confidently could be drawn, a deduction concerning the movements of Jupiter, which—if those three new stars were fixed, and Galileo's observations were accurate—did not take place. One could save the belief that those new stars were fixed by somehow revamping the entire set of astronomical calculations, but these were not in serious doubt; or, one could challenge the accuracy of Galileo's observations—which is what some of his critics later sought to do, calling his telescope an instrument of the devil. Galileo himself had no doubt about what he had seen, and he grasped quickly which element in the set of accepted hypotheses had to be relinquished, to the great distress of his dogmatic opponents. His note on the observation of the 11th continued:

    ... from which it appears that around Jupiter there are three moving stars invisible to everyone to
    this time.
    
    And these three moving stars, he later wrote,
    ... revolved round Jupiter in the same manner as Venus and Mercury revolved round the sun.
    
    The observations of the following nights confirmed this revolutionary conclusion,
    which, together with his earlier observations of the Moon, cast serious doubt on the
    account of celestial bodies that had been widely and dogmatically affirmed for many
    centuries.
  - |-
    On 13 January 1610, Galileo observed a fourth "star," and the four major satellites of Jupiter had been discovered. These observations provided very strong confirmation of the Copernican hypothesis—an account of the celestial bodies that was difficult to reconcile with the established theological doctrine of Galileo's time. Many moons of Jupiter have been discovered since, but these four moons—Ganymede, Io, Europa, and Callisto—are appropriately called "the Galilean satellites." On a clear night, when Jupiter is visible in the sky, the revolutions of the Galilean satellites around the planet may be readily confirmed with no more than an ordinary pair of binoculars.
    
    The ultimate success of the Copernican account of the solar system was due not merely to its greater simplicity, but to its correctness, made manifest in the much larger body of facts it was able to account for, and the remarkable predictions deducible from the theory that were very soon confirmed beyond reasonable doubt.
    
    13.4) Classification as Hypothesis
    
    It is a mistake to suppose that hypotheses are important only in the advanced sciences, such as physics and chemistry, but play no role in the so-called descriptive sciences, such as botany or history. In fact, description itself is based on, or embodies, hypotheses. Hypotheses are as critical to the various systems of classification in biology as they are to interpretation in history, and as they are to all knowledge in the social sciences.
    
    In the science of history the importance of hypotheses is easily shown. Many historians seek explanations of past events that can account for them and that can be confirmed by other recorded events. For some it is some larger purpose or pattern, religious or naturalistic, that explains the entire course of recorded history. For others, who reject such cosmic designs, the study of the past nevertheless reveals some historical laws that explain some past sequences and can then be used to predict some future events. Both of these two groups conceive of history as a theoretical science, not one that is merely descriptive; for both the role of hypothesis is central to the historian's enterprise.
  - |-
    A third group sets a more modest goal. For them the task of historians is simply to chronicle the past, to present an accurate description of past events in chronological order. Their concern is with the facts themselves, rather than with theories about the facts, so it might seem that they have no need of hypotheses.
    
    However, past events are not so easily chronicled as this view would have us believe. The past itself simply is not available for this kind of bare description. What is available are records of the past and traces of the past. We have government archives, epic poems, the writings of earlier historians, the artifacts unearthed by archaeological excavations, and so on. It is from a great variety of facts like these that historians must infer the nature of the past events they aim to describe. They cannot do this without some hypotheses. Not all hypotheses are general; some are particular, and with particular hypotheses historians seek to convert the data at hand into evidence for their account of the events in question.
    
    Historians are detectives on a grand scale. Their methods are the same, and their difficulties too. The evidence is scanty, and much of it has been destroyed by intervening wars or natural disasters. False or misleading clues throw detectives off the scent, and similarly, many existing "records" are falsifications of the past, perhaps unintentional, such as the writings of earlier, uncritical historians. The methods of science must be used by good detectives and good historians both, and even those historians who seek to limit themselves to the bare description of past events must work from some hypotheses. They are theorists in spite of themselves.
  - |-
    Biologists are in a more favorable position. The facts with which they deal are present and available for inspection. To describe the flora and fauna of a region, biologists are not obliged to draw elaborate inferences, as historians are, because they can perceive the data directly. Their descriptions are not casual or random, but highly systematic. They classify plants and animals, and do not merely describe them. But classification and description are, at bottom, the same process. To describe an animal as carnivorous is to classify it as a carnivore; to classify it as a reptile is to describe it as reptilian. To describe any object as having a certain attribute is to classify it as a member of the class of objects having that attribute.
    
    Scientific classification involves not merely a single division of objects into groups, but further subdivision of each group into subgroups and subclasses, and so on. Classification is also the tool of our inquiry when we play "Twenty Questions"—but it is a nearly universal tool, because it answers an almost universal need. Primitive people needed to sort the poisonous from the edible, the dangerous from the harmless, and so forth. We all draw distinctions, and we do so more meticulously with respect to the matters that chiefly concern us. The farmer's vegetables he will classify with greatest care, while treating all the flowers, in which he has no interest, as weeds. The florist will give delicate care to the classification of flowers, but may treat all the farmer's crops merely as "produce."
    
    Two basic motives lead us to classify things. One is practical, the other theoretical. In any library, with many thousands of volumes, books could not be found if they were not shelved according to some system of classification. The larger the number of objects with which we deal, the greater is the need to classify them. In museums, libraries, large department stores, this practical need is plain.
  - |-
    The theoretical object of classification is less obvious. Alternative schemes of classification are neither true nor false. Objects may be described in different ways, from different points of view. The system of classification adopted will depend on the purpose or interest of the classifier. A librarian will classify books according to their subject matter; a bookbinder according to the material of their leaves and bindings; a bibliophile by date of publication and perhaps by rarity; a shipper by weight and size—and there will be other schemes of classification as well.
    
    What is the special interest of scientists, leading them to prefer one scheme of classification over another? The scientist seeks knowledge, not merely of this or that particular fact, but of the general laws to which the facts conform, and of their causal interrelations. One scheme of classification is better than another, from the scientific point of view, to the extent that it is more fruitful in suggesting scientific laws, and more helpful in the formulation of explanatory hypotheses.
    
    The theoretical, or scientific, motivation for classifying objects is the desire to increase our knowledge of them, to achieve insight into their attributes, their similarities and differences, and their interrelations. Classification with a narrowly practical purpose—dangerous and harmless, or flying and swimming—will not much advance that understanding. The rattlesnake and the wild boar will go into one class, the grass snake and the domestic pig into the other; the bats and the birds will go into one class, the whales and the fishes into another. However, snakes and boars are profoundly different, whereas whales and bats are profoundly like one another. Being warm-blooded or not, bearing young alive or laying eggs, are much more important characteristics than dangerousness on which to base a system of classification.
  - |-
    A characteristic is important when it indicates the presence of other characteristics. When an attribute is causally connected with many other attributes, it can serve in the framing of a greater number of causal laws and of more general explanatory hypotheses. That classification scheme is best which is based on the most important characteristics of the objects to be classified. We cannot know in advance which these are, because we cannot know in advance the causal connections we aim to learn. So scientists classify hypothetically. Different classification schemes are tried, with the understanding that later they may be improved on or rejected. Later investigations may reveal other characteristics that are involved in a greater number of causal laws and explanatory hypotheses, and we will then revise the classification scheme so as to base our categories on it.
    
    It is true that classification tends to be more important in the early or less developed stages of a science, but it need not diminish in importance as that science develops. Taxonomy is a legitimate, important, and still growing branch of biology, in which earlier systems of classification have been abandoned in favor of others that prove more productive. Some classificatory tools—such as the periodic table of the elements—remain valuable to the chemist.
  - |-
    Hypotheses in history are illuminated by these biological considerations. Historians,
    too, focus on what they find to be most important in increasing our understanding of
    past events. Life is too short to permit the description of past events in complete detail,
    so every description by a historian must be selective, recording only some features. How
    may that selection be made? Of course historians want to focus on what is important,
    ignoring the insignificant. Historians, like biologists and other scientists, regard those
    aspects of events as important that enter most widely into the formulation of causal
    laws and explanatory hypotheses—always subject to correction in the light of further
    research, of course. Early historians emphasized the political and military aspects of
    events, ignoring other attributes we now think to be important. The turn to economic
    and social attributes brought enormous changes in the work and the products of his-
    torians; today we go beyond economic and social issues to attend to cultural and other
    characteristics that are now thought to be causally related to a maximum number of
    others. So the decision to focus on one rather than another set of attributes embodies
    some hypothesis about which characteristics really are important. Some such hypotheses
    are required before historians can even begin to do any systematic describing of the past.
    It is this hypothetical character of classification and description that leads us to regard
    hypothesis as the all-pervasive method of scientific inquiry.

    In an unusual logjam of contradictory claims, a revolutionary new model
    of the universe, as a soccer ball, arrived on astronomers' desks in October of
    2003—at least slightly deflated.
    
    Based on an analysis of maps of the Big Bang, Dr. Jeffrey Weeks and colleagues,
    from Canton, NY, suggest that space is a kind of 12-sided hall of mirrors, in
    which the illusion of infinity is created by looking out and seeing multiple
    copies of the same stars.

    If his model is correct, Dr. Weeks said, it would rule out one variant of the
    Big Bang theory that asserts that our own observable universe is just a bubble
    among others in a realm of vastly larger extent. "It means we can just about
    see the whole universe now," Dr. Weeks said.
    
    Other astronomers, led by Dr. David Spergel of Princeton, said that their
    analysis of the same data had probably already ruled out the soccer ball
    universe. The two groups of scientists, who have been in intense communication in recent days, disagree about whether the soccer ball universe has been refuted. But they all agree that what is amazing about this debate is that the controversy will actually be settled soon, underscoring the
    power of modern data to resolve issues that were once considered almost
    metaphysical.
    
    In the scientific journal Nature Dr. Weeks wrote: "Since antiquity our ancestors have wondered whether our universe is finite or infinite. Now, after more than two millennia of speculation, observational data might finally settle this ancient question."
    
    Dr. Weeks and his colleagues propose that the universe is 12-sided, a dodecahedron. The waves appearing in a radio map of the universe when it was very young indicate, he argues, that if you go far enough in one direction you would find yourself back where you started, like a cursor disappearing off the left side of a computer screen and reappearing on the right. Thus when cosmic radiation intersects the edges of the universe it would make identical circles on opposite sides of the sky—six pairs of circles, 35 degrees in diameter, in the case of Dr. Weeks's dodecahedron.
    
    Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania, observed:
    "What's nice is that this is so testable. It's the truth or it's dead. The data are
    actually already out there; it's just a question of sifting through them. We
    ought to have seen those circles." So far the circles have not showed up. "Is
    space infinite or is it not?" Dr. Tegmark asked. "This is what got Giordano
    Bruno burned at the stake!"

    Population clusters—groups of persons who are found to buy the same things,
    get their entertainment from the same sources, exhibit similar voting patterns,
    and generally behave in quite similar ways—are of growing interest. Michael J.
    Weiss has distinguished some 62 of these clusters, which he calls "distinctive
    lifestyle types." He also names them and highlights some of their peculiarities.
    
    In the Towns and Gowns cluster, for example, tequila is far more popular than
    elsewhere, and twice as many people watch the soap opera "Another World"
    there than do people elsewhere. In the Military Quarters cluster people are four
    times as likely to watch the TV show "Hard Copy" as the average American.
    Among the young, middle-class Americans in suburbia, furniture refinishing,
    downhill skiing, and cats are abnormally popular, while chess and tractor pulls
    are abnormally unpopular.
    
    Lifestyle clusters are found useful by businesses seeking customers, by can-
    didates seeking votes, by nonprofit organizations seeking new contributors,
    and so on. What may appear trivial can be very revealing. In Washington, DC,
    Weiss observes, "there is a fault line between the fans of Brie cheese, who tend
    to hold down executive jobs and write the laws, and those of Kraft Velveeta,
    who maintain the service economy." He asks: "What prompts some of us to
    eat Brie and others to devour Velveeta cheese?"

    Monkeypox, a viral disease related to smallpox but less infectious and less
    deadly, was detected for the first time in the Americas in 2003. At least 20
    cases have been reported, in three Midwestern states, Wisconsin, Illinois and
    Indiana, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

    The patients ranged in age from 4 to 48, and became ill between 15 May and
    3 June, 2003. All had direct or close contact with ill prairie dogs, which have
    become common household pets, and which might have caught monkey-
    pox from another species, possibly Gambian giant pouched rats, which are
    imported as pets from West or Central Africa, where the disease had long
    occurred. Monkeypox in Africa is carried mainly by squirrels but is named after
    monkeys because it often kills them.
    
    Several patients in the American outbreak work for veterinarians or pet stores
    that sold prairie dogs and Gambian rats. By quickly identifying the animals
    that can be infected with monkeypox, health officials hope to eliminate them
    before the disease becomes endemic in the Americas.

    A small study of heart-disease patients testing a hypothesis so improbable that
    its principal investigator says he gave it a one-in-10,000 chance of succeeding
    has found that just a few treatments with an experimental drug, developed
    by Esperion Therapeutics of Ann Arbor, Michigan, reversed what may be the
    equivalent of years' worth of plaque in coronary arteries.
    
    Forty-seven heart attack patients were randomly assigned to be infused with
    either a concentration of a substance that mimics high density lipoprotein (or
    HDL, the substance that removes cholesterol from arteries) or to be infused
    with an inactive saline solution, which served as a control.

    After 5 weekly infusions those who got the experimental drug had a 4.2-
    percent decrease in the volume of plaque in their coronary arteries, while those
    who had saline infusions had, if anything, a slight increase in their plaque.
    
    "Until now," said Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic
    who directed the study, "the paradigm has been to prevent disease by lowering
    bad cholesterol (LDL). If you get the bad cholesterol low enough, the plaques
    don't build up in the artery walls. This experiment says you can also remove
    the disease in the wall of the artery."

    Boy babies tend to be about 100 grams heavier on average than girl babies,  
    but it has never been explained, until recently, why that is so. Investigators  
    were unsure whether the increased weight was to be explained by the fact that  
    mothers of boys took in more energy, or because (when the fetus was male) those mothers used the energy taken in more efficiently.  
    
    Dr. Rulla M. Tamimi, of the Harvard School of Public Health, sought to resolve  
    this uncertainty by measuring the intake of calories. During the second trimes-  
    ter of their pregnancy, 244 women in Boston were asked to record their dietary  
    intake in full detail. The data collected were later correlated with the resultant  
    births. Women carrying boys, Dr. Tamimi found, took in (as carbohydrates, fats, or proteins) about 10 percent more calories than women carrying girls. It is intake, and not efficiency of use, that makes the difference.  
    
    But what accounts for that difference of intake? Dr. Tamimi speculated that  
    it may be triggered by some signal from the testosterone given off by the male  
    fetuses.

    Humans, apes, and dolphins are highly social animals with large brains; they  
    have been shown to be aware of themselves by recognizing themselves in a  
    mirror. Most animals pay very little attention to their reflections in a mirror.  
    Elephants are like humans in being large-brained and empathic, but they don't  
    share a relatively recent common ancestor with humans, like apes do. Might  
    they also recognize an image of themselves?  
    
    Yes, they do. Elephants at the Bronx Zoo, in New York City, inspected them-  
    selves with their trunks while staring at their reflections in a huge mirror. One  
    of the elephants (but only one) completed the highest level of self-recognition,  
    called the "mark test." Researchers placed a white X above one eye of each

    she saw in the mirror was indeed herself.

    The Nobel Prize for Chemistry for 2003 was shared by Dr. Peter Agre, who encountered a new protein by serendipity. He had been studying a particular protein found in blood when he found another protein contaminating his sample. Trying to develop an antibody that would hook on to the protein he was studying, Dr. Agre found that the antibody hooked on to the contaminating protein instead—which turned out to be one of the most abundant proteins found in blood samples, although no one had identified it before.
    
    But what did it do? He looked for similar proteins and found some—whose functions also were not known—in the roots of plants. The situation grew "curiouser and curiouser," Dr. Agre said. Finally he tried testing whether the new protein could be a water channel. That such channels might exist had been suggested long ago—but diffusion had then seemed to explain water movement, and specific channels had never been discovered.
    
    To test the water channel hypothesis, Dr. Agre added the gene that produced the mystery protein to the eggs of frogs. The modified eggs, placed in fresh water, quickly swelled and burst, strongly confirming that theory. "The eggs exploded like popcorn," Dr. Agre said. The newly discovered proteins, called "aquaporins," have a channel just a little wider than a water molecule, and have recently been found also in human kidneys, where water is extracted from urine and recycled.
    
    "This really fell into our laps," Dr. Agre said when his Nobel Prize was announced. "Being lucky is an important ingredient in scientific success."

    8. Early in the eighteenth century Edmund Halley asked: "Why is the sky dark at night?" This apparently naive question is not easy to answer, because if the universe had the simplest imaginable structure on the largest possible scale, the background radiation of the sky would be intense. Imagine a static infinite universe—that is, a universe of infinite size in which the stars and galaxies are stationary with respect to one another. A line of sight in any direction will ultimately cross the surface of a star, and the sky should appear to be made up of overlapping stellar disks. The apparent brightness of a star's surface is independent of its distance, so that everywhere the sky should be as bright as the surface of an average star. Since the sun is an average star, the entire sky, day and night, should be about as bright as the surface of the sun. The fact that it is not was later characterized as Olbers' paradox (after the eighteenth-century German astronomer Heinrich Olbers). The paradox applies not only to starlight but also to all other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It indicates that there is something fundamentally wrong with the model of a static infinite universe, but it does not specify what.

    9. Swedish researchers, collaborating with colleagues in South Africa, found that dung beetles active during the day detect polarity patterns in sunlight and rely on those patterns to find their way out of great masses of elephant dung. Dr. Marie Dacke, of the University of Lund, noticed subsequently that on moonlit nights one beetle species worked (rolling dung) particularly late. Could they have been relying upon the polarization of moonlight?
    
    Researchers set up polarizing filters to shift the moonbeams—and sure enough, the African beetle, Scarabaeus zambesianus, changed direction to compensate. When the polarization of the moonlight under the filter was rotated by 90 degrees, they found that beetles under that filter deviated from their
    
    13.4 Classification as Hypothesis
  - |-
    course by almost exactly 90 degrees. "This is the first proof," writes Dr. Dacke
    in her report in Nature of 3 July 2003, "that any animal can use polarized
    moonlight for orientation."
    
    10. For centuries (since the 1500s in Scandinavia) people have puzzled over lem-
    mings, northern rodents whose populations surge and crash so quickly and so
    regularly that they inspired an enduring myth: that lemmings commit mass
    suicide when their numbers grow too large, pitching themselves off cliffs to
    their deaths in a foamy sea.
    
    Scientists debunked that notion decades ago, but have never been certain
    what causes the rapid boom-and-bust population cycles—a mystery in ecol-
    ogy that has been hotly debated. "There have been several dozen hypotheses,"
    said Dr. Oliver Gilg, an ecologist at the University of Helsinki in Finland, "and
    scientists were sticking so closely to their hypotheses that they were almost
    killing each other." But Dr. Gilg, the author of a recent study published in the
    journal Science, provides a single hypothesis that his team of researchers claims
    provides the entire explanation.
    
    The rapid population cycles have nothing to do with self-annihilation,
    they contend, but everything to do with hungry predators. After 15 years of
    research they have discovered that the actions of four predator species—snowy
    owls, arctic foxes, seabirds called long-tailed skuas, and the weasel-like stoats—
    account for the four-year cycles during which lemming populations rapidly
    explode and then nearly disappear. After creating a model based only on those
    four predators, they found that the model predicted precisely the numerical
    fluctuation of lemming populations in nature.

    This letter, dated 7 January 1610, apparently was written over a period of many days. It, and
    other notes taken by Galileo during these momentous days, are discussed in detail in Jean
    Meeus, "Galileo's First Records of Jupiter's Satellites," Sky and Telescope, February 1964; in Still-
    man Drake, "Galileo's First Telescopic Observations," Journal of the History of Astronomy, 1976,
    p. 153; and in Dale P. Cruikshank and David Morrison, "The Galilean Satellites of Jupiter,"
    Scientific American, May 1976. A photocopy of the original sketch Galileo made to record his
    observations, his notes appearing on it in Italian, is reproduced in Figure 13-1, through the

    That Galileo began this letter on 7 January 1610 is clear; the exact days of that month on which
    he continued it, with sketches and notes, are a matter about which scholars disagree.

    Probability is the central evaluative concept in all inductive logic. The theory of probabil-
    ity, as the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce put it, "is simply the science of
    logic quantitatively treated." The mathematical applications of this theory go far beyond
    the concerns of this book, but it is fitting to conclude our treatment of inductive logic with
    an analysis of the concept of probability and a brief account of its practical applications.
    Scientific theories, and the causal laws that they encompass, can be no more than
    probable. Inductive arguments, even at their very best, fall short of the certainty that
    attaches to valid deductive arguments. We assign to theories, or to hypotheses of any
    sort, a degree of probability expressed discursively. As one example, we may assert, on the
    evidence we now have, that it is "highly probable" that Einstein's theory of relativity is
    correct. As another example, although we cannot be certain that there is no life on other
    planets in our solar system, we can say that the probability of any theory that entails such
    life, in the light of what we know about these planets, is very low. We do not normally
    assign a numerical value to the probability of theories in this sense.
    However, we can and do assign numbers to the probability of events in many con-
    texts. The number we assign to the probability of an event is called the numerical ‘"umerical
    coefficient of probability, and that number may be very useful. How can such num- coefficient of
    probability
    bers be reliably assigned? To answer this question we must distinguish two additional A number that describes

    an American woman of age 25 will live at least one additional year is .971. Games of

    chapter 14 Probability
    
    A priori theory of
    probability
    
    A theory in which the
    probability ascribed
    
    to a simple event is a
    fraction between
    
    0 and 1, of which the
    denominator is the
    number of equipossible
    outcomes, and the
    numerator is the
    number of outcomes
    in which the event
    
    in question occurs.
    Thus on the a priori
    theory, the probability
    of drawing a spade at
    random from a deck of
    playing cards is 13/52.
    
    and the uses of mortality statistics gave rise to the investigation of probability in the
    second sense,* in both cases during the seventeenth century. The calculations in the two
    cases were of different kinds, leading eventually to the two different interpretations of
    the coefficient of probability. Both are important.
    
    The @ priori theory of probability asks, in effect, what a rational person ought
    to believe about some event under consideration, and assigns a number between 0 and 1
    to represent the degree of belief that is rational. If we are completely convinced that
    the event will take place, we assign the number 1. If we believe that the event cannot
    possibly happen, our belief that it will happen is assigned the number 0. When we are
    unsure, the number assigned will be between 0 and 1. Probability is predicated of an
    event according to the degree to which one rationally believes that that event will occur.
    Probability is predicated of a proposition according to the degree to which a completely
    rational person would believe it.
  - |-
    How (in this theory) do we determine rationally, when we are unsure, what number between 0 and 1 ought to be assigned? We are unsure, in the classical view, because our knowledge is partial; if we knew everything about a coin being flipped, we could confidently predict its trajectory and its final resting position. However, there is an enormous amount about that coin and its flip that we do not and cannot know. What we mainly know is this: The coin has two sides, and we have no reason to believe it more likely that it will come to rest on one side than on the other. So we consider all the possible outcomes that are (so far as we know) equally probable; in the case of a flipped coin there are two—heads and tails. Of the two, heads is only one. The probability of heads is therefore one over two, 0.5, and this number, .5, is said to be the probability of the event in question.
    
    Similarly, when a deck of randomly shuffled cards is about to be dealt, they will come off the deck in exactly the sequence they are in, determined by the outcome of the preceding shuffle, which we do not know. We know only that there are 13 cards of each suit (out of a total of 52 in the deck) and therefore the probability that the first card dealt will be a spade is 13/52, or exactly 0.25.
    
    This is called the a priori theory of probability because we make the numerical assignment, 0.25, before we run any trials with that deck of cards. If the deck is regular and the shuffle was fair, we think it is not necessary to take a sample, but only to consider the antecedent conditions: 13 spades, 52 cards, and an honest deal. Any one card (as far as we know) has as much chance as any other of being dealt first.
  - |-
    To compute the probability of an event's occurring in given circumstances, we divide  
    the number of ways it can occur by the total number of possible outcomes of those cir-  
    cumstances, provided that there is no reason to believe that any one of those possible  
    outcomes is more likely than any other. The probability of an event, in the a priori theory  
    of probability, is thus expressed by a fraction, whose denominator is the number of equi-  
    possible outcomes and whose numerator is the number of outcomes that will successfully  
    yield the event in question. Such numerical assignments ("successes over possibilities")  
    are rational, convenient, and very useful.
    
    There is an alternative view of probability. In this view the probability assigned to an  
    event must depend on the relative frequency with which the event takes place. Earlier we  
    
    * Captain John Graunt published (in 1662) calculations concerning what could be inferred from death records that had  
    been kept in London from 1592.  
    14.1  
    
    suggested that the probability of a 25-year-old American woman living at least one addi-  
    tional year is .971. This can be learned only by examining the entire class of 25-year-old  
    American women, and determining how many of them do indeed live, or have lived, at  
    least one additional year. Only after we learn the mortality rates for that class of women  
    can we make the numerical assignment.
  - |-
    We distinguish, in this theory, the reference class (25-year-old American women, in the example given) and the attribute of interest (living at least one additional year, in this example). The probability assigned is the measure of the relative frequency with which the members of the class exhibit the attribute in question. In this theory also, probability is expressed as a fraction (and often expressed in decimal form), but the denominator is in this case the number of members in the reference class and the numerator is the number of class members that have the attribute of interest. If the number of male automobile drivers in California between the ages of 16 and 24 is y, and the number of such drivers who are involved in an automobile accident in the course of a year is x, the probability of an accident among such drivers in any given year we assign as x/y. The reference class here is the set of drivers described in certain ways, and the attribute is the fact of involvement in an automobile accident within some specified period. "Rational belief" is not at issue here. In the relative frequency theory of probability, probability is defined as the relative frequency with which members of a class exhibit a specified attribute.
    
    Note that in both theories the probabilities assigned are relative to the evidence available. For the relative frequency theory this is obvious: The probability of a given attribute must vary with the reference class chosen for the computation. If the male automobile drivers in the reference class are between the ages of 36 and 44, the relative frequency of accidents will be lower; drivers in that range have fewer accidents, and hence the computed probability of an accident will be lower. If the reference class consisted of females rather than males, that would again change the coefficient of probability. Probability is relative to the evidence.
  - |-
    This is also true in the a priori theory of probability. An event can be assigned a prob-
    ability only on the basis of the evidence available to the person making the assignment.
    After all, a person's "rational belief" may change with changes in the knowledge that
    person possesses. For example, suppose that two people are watching a deck of cards
    being shuffled, and because of the dealer's slip, one of them happens to see that the
    top card is black, but cannot see the card's suit. The second observer sees nothing but
    the shuffle. If asked to estimate the probability of the first card's being a spade, the first
    observer will assign the probability 1/2, because he knows that there are 26 black cards,
    of which half are spades. The second observer will assign the probability 1/4, because
    he knows only that there are 13 spades in the deck of 52 cards. Different probabilities
    are assigned by the two observers to the same event. Neither has made a mistake; both
    have assigned the correct probability relative to the evidence available to each—even
    if the card turns out to be a club. No event has any probability in and of itself, in this
    view, and therefore, with different sets of evidence, the probabilities may well vary.
    
    These two accounts of probability—the relative frequency account and the a priori
    account—are in fundamental agreement in holding that probability is relative to the evi-
    dence. They are also in agreement in holding that a numerical assignment of probability
    can usually be made for a given event. It is possible to reinterpret the number assigned on
    the a priori theory as being a "shortcut" estimate of relative frequency. Thus the probabil-
    ity that a flipped coin, if it is fair, will show heads when it comes to rest may be calculated
    as a relative frequency; it will be the relative frequency with which the coin does show

    When it is randomly flipped a thousand, or ten thousand times. As the number
    of random flips increases (supposing the coin truly balanced), the fraction representing
    the relative frequency of heads will continue to approach .5 more closely. We may call .5
    the limit of the relative frequency of that event. In the light of such possible reinterpretation
    of numerical assignments, some theorists hold that the relative frequency theory is the
    more fundamental of the two. It is also true, however, that in a great many contexts the
    a priori theory is the simpler and more convenient theory to employ; we will rely chiefly
    on the latter as we go forward.
    
    14.2) The Probability Calculus
    
    The probability of single events, as we have seen, can often be determined. Knowing (or
    assuming) these, we can go on to calculate the probability of some complex event—an
    event that may be regarded as a whole of which its component single events are parts.
    To illustrate, the probability of drawing a spade from a shuffled deck of cards is 1/4, as we
    have seen, relying on the a priori theory of probability. What, then, is the probability of
    drawing two spades in succession from a deck of playing cards? Drawing the first spade
    is the first component; drawing the second spade is the second; drawing two spades in
    succession is the complex event whose probability we may want to calculate. When it
    is known how the component events are related to each other, the probabilities of the
    complex event can be calculated from the probabilities of its components.
    
    The calculus of probability is the branch of mathematics that permits such cal-
    culation. Here we explore only its elementary outline. Knowing the likelihood of certain
    outcomes in our everyday lives can be important; application of the probability calculus,
    therefore, can be extremely helpful. Mastery of its basic theorems is one of the most use-
    ful products of the study of logic.
  - |-
    The probability calculus can be most easily explained in terms of games of chance—
    dice, cards, and the like—because the artificially restricted universe created by the rules
    of such games makes possible the straightforward application of probability theorems.
    In this exposition, the a priori theory of probability is used, but all of these results can,
    with a minimum of reinterpretation, be expressed and justified in terms of the relative
    frequency theory as well.
    
    Two elementary theorems will be discussed.
    
    A. With the first we can calculate the probability of a complex event consisting of the
    joint occurrences of its components: the probability of two events both happening,
    or of all the events of a specified set happening.
    
    B. With the second we can calculate the probability of a complex event consisting of
    alternative occurrences: the probability that at least one (that is, one or more) of a
    given set of alternative events will occur. We take these in turn.
    
    A. Probability of Joint Occurrences
    
    Suppose we wish to learn the probability of getting two heads in two flips of a coin. Call
    these two components a and b; there is a very simple theorem that enables us to com-
    pute the probability of both a and b. It is called the product theorem, and it involves
    merely multiplying the two fractions representing the probabilities of the component
    events. There are four distinct possible outcomes when two coins are tossed. These may
    be shown most clearly in a table:
    
    First Coin Second Coin
    H H
    H T
    T H
    T T
    
    There is no reason to expect any one of these four cases more than another, so we regard
    them as equipossible. The case (two heads) about which we are asking occurs in only one
    of the four equipossible events, so the probability of getting two heads in two flips of a
    coin is 1/4. We can calculate this directly: The joint occurrence of two heads is equal to the
    probability of getting a head on the first flip (1/2) multiplied by the probability of getting a
    head on the second flip (1/2), or 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. However, this simple multiplication succeeds
    only when the two events are independent events—that is, when the occurrence of
    the one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other.
  - |-
    The product theorem for independent events asserts that the probability of the joint  
    occurrence of two independent events is equal to the product of their separate prob-  
    abilities. It is written as  
    
    $$ P(a \text{ and } b) = P(a) \times P(b) $$
    
    where $ P(a) $ and $ P(b) $ are the separate probabilities of the two events, and $ P(a \text{ and } b) $ des-  
    ignates the probability of their joint occurrence.
    
    Applied to another case, what is the probability of getting 12 when rolling two dice?  
    Two dice will show twelve points only if each of them shows six points. Each die has  
    six sides, any one of which is as likely to be face up after a roll as any other. When a is  
    the event of the first die showing 6, $ P(a) = \frac{1}{6} $. And when b is the event of the second die  
    showing 6, $ P(b) = \frac{1}{6} $. The complex event of the two dice showing 12 is constituted by the  
    joint occurrence of a and b. By the product theorem, $ P(a \text{ and } b) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36} $, which is  
    the probability of getting a 12 on one roll of two dice. The same result is shown if we lay  
    out, in a table, all the separate equipossible outcomes of the roll of two dice. There are  
    36 possible outcomes, and only one of them is favorable to getting 12.
    
    We do not need to restrict ourselves to two components. The product theorem may be  
    generalized to cover the joint occurrence of any number of independent events. If we draw  
    a card from a shuffled deck, replace it and draw again, replace it again and draw a third  
    time, the likelihood of getting a spade in each drawing is not affected by success or failure  
    in the other drawings. (We assume that the replacement of a card is followed immediately  
    by a reshuffling of the deck.) The probability of getting a spade in any one drawing is $ \frac{1}{4} $, or 0.25. The probability of getting three spades in three drawings, if the card is replaced after  
    each drawing, is $ \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{64} $. The general product theorem thus allows us to compute  
    the probability of the joint occurrence of any number of independent events.
  - |-
    But what happens if the events are not independent? What happens if success in  
    one case has an effect on the probability of success in another case? The examples thus  
    far need take no account of any relationship among the component events, and yet  
    
    Independent  
    events  
    
    In probability theory,  
    events so related that  
    the occurrence or  
    nonoccurrence of one  
    has no effect upon  
    the occurrence or  
    nonoccurrence of the  
    other.  
    
    chapter 14 Probability  
    
    component events may be related in ways that require more careful calculation. Consider  
    a revised version of the example just given. Suppose we seek the probability of drawing  
    three successive spades from a shuffled deck, but the cards withdrawn are not replaced. It  
    each card drawn is not returned to the deck before the next drawing, the outcomes of  
    the earlier drawings do have an effect on the outcomes of the later drawings.  
    
    If the first card drawn is a spade, then for the second draw there are only 12 spades  
    left among a total of 51 cards, whereas if the first card is not a spade, then there are 13  
    spades left among 51 cards. Where a is the event of drawing a spade from the deck and  
    not replacing it, and D is the event of drawing another spade from among the remaining  
    cards, the probability of b, that is, P(D if a), is 12/51, or 47. If both a and b occur, the third  
    draw will be made from a deck of 50 cards containing only 11 spades. If c is this last  
    event, then P(c if both a and b) is 11/50. Thus, the probability that all three are spades, if  
    three cards are drawn from a deck and not replaced, is, according to the product theorem,  
    13/52 x 12/51 x 11/50, or 1.287%. This is less than the probability of getting three spades in three  
    draws when the cards drawn are replaced before drawing again, which was to be expected,  
    because replacing a spade increases the probability of getting a spade on the next draw.
  - |-
    The general product theorem can be applied to real-world problems of consequence,
    as in the following true account. A California teenager, afflicted with chronic leukemia
    that would soon kill her if untreated, could be saved only if a donor with matching bone
    marrow were found. When all efforts to locate such a donor failed, her parents decided to
    try to have another child, hoping that a successful bone-marrow transplant might then
    be possible. But the girl's father first had to have his vasectomy reversed, for which there
    was only a 50 percent (.5) chance of success. Even if that were successful, the mother,
    45 years old at the time, would have only a .73 chance of becoming pregnant, and if
    she did become pregnant, there was only a one-in-four chance (.25) that the baby's mar-
    row would match that of the afflicted daughter. Even if there were such a match, there
    would still be only a .7 chance that the leukemia patient would live through the needed
    chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplant.
    
    The probability of a successful outcome was seen at the outset to be low, but not
    hopelessly low. The vasectomy was successfully reversed, and the mother did become
    pregnant—after which prospects improved. It turned out that the baby did possess
    matching bone marrow. Then, in 1992, the arduous bone-marrow transplant procedure
    was begun. It proved to be a complete success.* What was the probability of this happy
    outcome at the time of the parents' original decision to pursue it?

    A. If each card drawn is replaced before the next drawing is made?
    B. If the cards drawn are not replaced?
    
    * Anissa Ayala, the patient, was married a year after the successful transplant; the sister who saved her life, Marissa
    Ayala, was a flower girl at her wedding. Details of this case were reported in Life magazine, December 1993.
    
    Solution
  - |-
    A. If each card drawn is replaced before the next drawing is made, the component events have absolutely no effect on one another and are therefore independent. In this case, P(a and b and c) = P(a) x P(b) x P(c). There are 52 cards in the deck, of which four are aces. So the probability of drawing the first ace, P(a), is 4/52, or 3. The probability of drawing the second ace, P(b), is likewise 4/52, as is the probability of drawing the third ace, P(c). So the probability of the joint occurrence of a and b and c is (4/52) x (4/52) x (4/52), or 64/140,608.
    
    B. If the cards drawn are not replaced, the component events are dependent, not independent. The formula is P(a and b and c) = P(a) x P(b if a) x P(c if a and b).
    
    In this case, the probability of drawing the first ace, P(a), remains 4/52, or 1/13. But the probability of drawing a second ace if the first card drawn was an ace, P(b if a), is 3/51, or 1/17. And the probability of drawing a third ace if the first two cards drawn were aces, P(c if a and b), is 2/50, or 1/25. The probability of the joint occurrence of these three dependent events is therefore (4/52) x (3/51) x (2/50), or 24/132,600.
    
    The probability of getting three successive aces in the second case is much lower than in the first, as one might expect, because without replacement the chances of getting an ace in each successive drawing are reduced by success in the preceding drawing.

    Addition theorem
    In the calculus of
    probability, a theorem
    used to determine the
    probability of a complex
    event consisting of one
    or more alternative
    occurrences of
    
    simple events whose
    probabilities are known.
    The theorem applies
    only to mutually
    exclusive alternatives.
    
    Mutually exclusive
    events
    
    Events of such a nature
    that, if one occurs, the
    other(s) cannot occur
    at the same time.
    Thus, in a coin flip, the
    outcomes "heads" and
    "tails" are mutually
    exclusive events.
    
    B. Probability of Alternative Occurrences
    
    Sometimes we ask: What is the probability of the occurrence of at least one of some set
    of events—their alternative occurrence? This we can calculate if we know or can esti-
    mate the probability of each of the component events. The theorem we use is called the
    addition theorem.

    For example, one might ask: What is the probability of drawing, from a shuffled deck of cards, either a spade or a club? Of course the probability of getting either of these out- comes will be greater than the probability of getting one of them, and certainly greater than the probability of getting the two of them jointly. In many cases, like this one, the probability of their alternative occurrence is simply the sum of the probabilities of the com- ponents. The probability of drawing a spade is 4; the probability of drawing a club is 4; the probability of drawing either a spade or a club is 4 + "4= 4%. When the question concerns joint occurrence, we multiply; when the question concerns alternative occurrence, we add.
    
    In the example just above, the two component events are mutually exclusive; if one of them happens, the other cannot. Drawing a spade necessarily entails the fact that a club was not drawn, and vice versa. So the addition theorem, when events are mutually exclusive, is straightforward and simple:
    
    P(a or b) = P(a) + P(b)
    587
    
    14.2 The Probability Calculus
    
    This may be generalized to any number of alternatives, a or b or c... If all the alternatives are mutually exclusive, the probability of one or another of them taking place is the sum of the probabilities of all of them.
    
    Sometimes we may need to apply both the addition theorem and the product theorem. To illustrate, in the game of poker, a flush (five cards of the same suit) is a very strong hand. What is the probability of such a draw? We calculate first the probability of getting five cards in one given suit—say, spades. That is a joint occurrence, five component events that are certainly not independent, because each spade dealt reduces the probability of getting the next spade. Using the product theorem for dependent probabilities, we get
    
    13, 12 1 10 /. — 33
    Fo X 1% x Ko X Yo X Zig = 46,640
  - |-
    The same probability applies to a flush in hearts, or diamonds, or clubs. These four different flushes are mutually exclusive alternatives, so the probability of being dealt any flush is the sum of them: 33/66,640 + 33/66,640 + 33/66,640 + 33/66,640 = 33/16,660, a little less than .002. No wonder a flush is usually a winning hand.
    
    Alternative events are often not mutually exclusive, and when they are not, the calculation becomes more complicated. Consider first an easy case: What is the probability of getting at least one head in two flips of a coin? The two components (getting a head on the first flip, or getting one on the second flip) are certainly not mutually exclusive; both could happen. If we simply add their probabilities, we get 4% + 4% = 1, or certainty—and we know that the outcome we are interested in is not certain! This shows that the addition theorem is not directly applicable when the component events are not mutually exclusive. But we can use it indirectly, in either of two ways.
    
    First, we can break down the set of favorable cases into mutually exclusive events and then simply add those probabilities. In the coin example, there are three favorable events: head-tail, tail-head, and head-head. The probability of each (calculated using the product theorem) is 4%. The probability of getting one of those three mutually exclusive events (using the addition theorem) is the sum of the three: 4%, or .75.
    
    There is another way to reach the same result. We know that no outcome can be both favorable and unfavorable. Therefore the probability of the alternative complex we are asking about will be equal to the probability that not one of the component alternatives occurs, subtracted from 1. In the coin example, the only unfavorable outcome is tail-tail. The probability of tail-tail is 4%; hence the probability of a head on at least one flip is 1 - 4% = 75%, or .75, again. Using the notation $ \bar{a} $ to designate an event that is unfavorable to $ a $, we can formulate the theorem for alternative events, where the component events are not mutually exclusive, in this way:
    
    $$ P(a) = 1 - P(\bar{a}) $$
  - |-
    The probability of an event's occurrence is equal to 1, minus the probability that that
    event will not occur.*
    
    Sometimes the first method is simpler, sometimes the second. The two methods
    may be compared using the following illustration: Suppose we have two urns, the first
    
    * The reasoning that underlies this formulation of the theorem for alternative occurrences is as follows: The probability
    coefficient assigned to an event that is certain to occur is 1. For every event it is certain that either it occurs or it does
    not; either a or 4 must be true. Therefore, Pla or a). Obviously, a and 4 are mutually exclusive, so the probability of one
    or the other is equal to the sum of their probabilities; that is, Pla or a) = Pla) + P(a) = 1. So Pla) + P(a) = 1. By moving P(a)
    
    to the other side of the equation and changing its sign, we get Pla) = 1 — P(a)

    containing two white balls and four black balls, the second containing three white balls
    and nine black balls. If one ball is drawn at random from each urn, what is the probability
    of drawing at least one white ball? Using the first method we divide the favorable cases
    into three mutually exclusive alternatives and then add the probabilities: (1) a white ball
    from the first urn and a black ball from the second (% x %2 = %); (2) a black ball from the
    first urn and a white ball from the second (% x %2 = %); and (3) a white ball from both
    urns (% x %2 = %2). These being mutually exclusive we can simply add 4+K+o= hs.
    That sum is the probability of drawing at least one white ball. Using the second method
    we determine the probability of failing, which is the probability of drawing a black ball
    from both urns (% x %2) and subtract that from 1. Thus we get 1- ¥% = ¥. The two meth-
    ods yield the same result, of course.

    Application of the probability calculus sometimes leads to a result that, although correct, differs from what we might anticipate after a casual consideration of the facts given. Such a result is called counterintuitive. When a problem's solution is counterintuitive, one may be led to judge probability mistakenly, and such "natural" mistakes encourage, at carnivals and elsewhere, the following wager: Three dice are to be thrown; the operator of the gambling booth offers to bet you even money (risk one dollar, and get that dollar back plus one more if you win) that no one of the three dice will show a one. There are six faces on each of the dice, each with a different number; you get three chances for an ace; superficially, this looks like a fair game.
    
    In fact it is not a fair game, and hefty profits are reaped by swindlers who capitalize on that counterintuitive reality. The game would be fair only if the appearance of any given number on one of the three dice precluded its appearance on either of the other two dice. That is plainly not true. The unwary player is misled by mistakenly (and subconsciously) supposing mutual exclusivity. Of course, the numbers are not mutually exclusive; some throws will result in the same number appearing on two or three of the dice. The attempt to identify and count all possible outcomes, and then to count the outcomes in which at least one ace appears, quickly becomes frustrating. Because the appearance of any given number does not exclude the appearance of that same number on the remaining dice, the game truly is a swindle—and this becomes evident when the chances of winning are calculated by first determining the probability of losing and subtracting that from 1. The probability of any single non-ace (a 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6) showing up is 5/6. The probability of losing is that of getting three non-aces, which (because the dice are independent of one another) is 5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6, which equals 125/216, or .579. The probability of the player throwing at least one ace, therefore, is 1 - 125/216 = 91/216, which is .421. This is a gambling game to pass up.

    Let us now attempt to work out a moderately complicated problem in probability.  
    The game of craps is played with two dice. The shooter, who rolls the dice, wins if a 7 or  
    an 11 turns up on the first roll, but loses if a 2, or 3, or 12 turns up on the first roll. If  
    one of the remaining numbers, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, turns up on the first roll, the shooter  
    continues to roll the dice until either that number turns up again, in which case the  
    shooter wins, or a 7 appears, in which case the shooter loses. Craps is widely believed to  
    be a "fair" game—that is, a game in which the shooter has an even chance of winning.  
    Is this true? Let us calculate the probability that the shooter will win at craps.
    
    To do this, we must first obtain the probabilities that the various numbers will occur.  
    There are 36 different equipossible ways for two dice to fall. Only one of these ways will  
    show a 2, so the probability here is 1/36. Only one of these ways will show a 12, so here the  
    probability is also 1/36. There are two ways to throw a 3: 1-2 and 2-1, so the probability of  
    a 3 is 2/36. Similarly, the probability of getting an 11 is 2/36. There are three ways to throw  
    4: 1-3, 2-2, and 3-1; five ways to throw a 5: 1-4, 2-3, 3-2, 4-1; six ways to throw a 6:  
    1-5, 2-4, 3-3, 4-2, 5-1; five ways to throw a 8: 3-5, 4-4, 5-3; four ways to throw a 9:  
    4-5, 5-4; and three ways to throw a 10: 4-6, 5-5, 6-4.  
    
    Therefore, the probabilities for each number on the first roll are as follows:  
    - 2: 1/36  
    - 3: 2/36  
    - 4: 3/36  
    - 5: 5/36  
    - 6: 6/36  
    - 8: 5/36  
    - 9: 4/36  
    - 10: 3/36  
    
    The probabilities for a win on the first roll (7 or 11) are:  
    - 7: 6/36  
    - 11: 2/36  
    
    The probabilities for a loss on the first roll (2, 3, or 12) are:  
    - 2: 1/36  
    - 3: 2/36  
    - 12: 1/36  
    
    The probabilities for continuing the game (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10) are:  
    - 4: 3/36  
    - 5: 5/36  
    - 6: 6/36  
    - 8: 5/36  
    - 9: 4/36  
    - 10: 3/36  
    
    Let us now calculate the probability that the shooter will win.  
    The shooter wins immediately on the first roll if a 7 or an 11 is rolled. The probability of this is:  
    P(win on first roll) = P(7) + P(11) = 6/36 + 2/36 = 8/36 = 2/9  
    
    The shooter loses immediately on the first roll if a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled. The probability of this is:  
    P(lose on first roll) = P(2) + P(3) + P(12) = 1/36 + 2/36 + 1/36 = 4/36 = 1/9  
    
    If the shooter rolls a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first roll, the game continues. Let us calculate the probability of winning in this case for each number:  
    
    For a 4:  
    The shooter wins if a 4 is rolled again before a 7. The probability of rolling a 4 is 3/36, and the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36.  
    The probability that the shooter wins with a 4 is:  
    P(win | 4) = (3/36) / (3/36 + 6/36) = 3/9 = 1/3  
    
    For a 5:  
    The probability of rolling a 5 is 5/36, and the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36.  
    The probability that the shooter wins with a 5 is:  
    P(win | 5) = (5/36) / (5/36 + 6/36) = 5/11  
    
    For a 6:  
    The probability of rolling a 6 is 6/36, and the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36.  
    The probability that the shooter wins with a 6 is:  
    P(win | 6) = (6/36) / (6/36 + 6/36) = 6/12 = 1/2  
    
    For a 8:  
    The probability of rolling an 8 is 5/36, and the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36.  
    The probability that the shooter wins with an 8 is:  
    P(win | 8) = (5/36) / (5/36 + 6/36) = 5/11  
    
    For a 9:  
    The probability of rolling a 9 is 4/36, and the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36.  
    The probability that the shooter wins with a 9 is:  
    P(win | 9) = (4/36) / (4/36 + 6/36) = 4/10 = 2/5  
    
    For a 10:  
    The probability of rolling a 10 is 3/36, and the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36.  
    The probability that the shooter wins with a 10 is:  
    P(win | 10) = (3/36) / (3/36 + 6/36) = 3/9 = 1/3  
    
    Now, we can calculate the total probability of winning by summing up the probabilities for each case:  
    
    P(win) = P(win on first roll) + [P(4) * P(win | 4)] + [P(5) * P(win | 5)] + [P(6) * P(win | 6)] + [P(8) * P(win | 8)] + [P(9) * P(win | 9)] + [P(10) * P(win | 10)]  
    
    Substituting the values:  
    P(win) = (2/9) + [(3/36)(1/3)] + [(5/36)(5/11)] + [(6/36)(1/2)] + [(5/36)(5/11)] + [(4/36)(2/5)] + [(3/36)(1/3)]  
    
    Let's calculate each term:  
    - (3/36)(1/3) = 3/(36*3) = 3/108  
    - (5/36)(5/11) = 25/(36*11) = 25/396  
    - (6/36)(1/2) = 6/(36*2) = 6/72  
    - (5/36)(5/11) = 25/396  
    - (4/36)(2/5) = 8/(36*5) = 8/180  
    - (3/36)(1/3) = 3/108  
    
    Now, let's add these up:  
    P(win) = (2/9) + 3/108 + 25/396 + 6/72 + 25/396 + 8/180 + 3/108  
    
    Let's convert all fractions to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9, 108, 396, 72, 180 is 396.  
    Convert each term to have a denominator of 396:  
    
    - 2/9 = (2*44)/396 = 88/396  
    - 3/108 = (3*3.666...)/396 = 11/396  
    - 25/396 = 25/396  
    - 6/72 = (6*5.5)/396 = 33/396  
    - 25/396 = 25/396  
    - 8/180 = (8*2.2)/396 = 17.6/396 ≈ 18/396  
    - 3/108 = 11/396  
    
    Adding them up:  
    P(win) = 88 + 11 + 25 + 33 + 25 + 18 + 11 = 201/396  
    
    Simplify:  
    P(win) = 201/396 ≈ 0.5079  
    
    Therefore, the probability that the shooter will win at craps is approximately 0.5079, which is slightly more than 1/2. This means that the game of craps is not entirely fair; the shooter has a slightly higher chance of winning.

    a 4: 1-3, 2-2, and 3-1, so the probability of a 4 is "6. Similarly, the probability of getting a 10 is % . There are four ways to roll a 5 (1-4, 2-3, 3-2, and 4-1), so its probability is ¥,,, and this is also the probability of getting a 9. A 6 can be obtained in any one of five ways (1-5, 2-4, 3-3, 4-2, and 5-1), so the probability of getting a 6 is %6, and the same probability exists for an 8. There are six different combinations that yield 7 (1-6, 2-5, 3-4, 4-3, 5-2, 6-1), so the probability of rolling a 7 is %g.
  - |-
    The probability that the shooter will win on the first roll is the sum of the probability that a 7 will turn up and the probability that an 11 will turn up, which is $ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3} $, or $ 33\% $. The probability of losing on the first roll is the sum of the probabilities of getting a 2, a 3, and a 12, which is $ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} $, or $ 50\% $. The shooter is twice as likely to win on the first roll as to lose on the first roll; however, the shooter is most likely not to do either on the first roll, but to get a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10. If one of these six numbers is thrown, the shooter is obliged to continue rolling the dice until that number is rolled again, in which case the shooter wins, or until a 7 comes up, which is a losing case. Those cases in which neither the number first thrown nor a 7 occurs can be ignored, for they are not decisive. Suppose the shooter gets a 4 on the first roll. The next decisive roll will show either a 4 or a 7. In a decisive roll, the equipossible cases are the three combinations that make up a 4 (1-3, 2-2, 3-1) and the six combinations that make up a 7. The probability of throwing a second 4 in the next decisive roll is therefore $ \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} $. The probability of getting a 4 on the first roll was $ \frac{1}{6} $, so the probability of winning by throwing a 4 on the first roll and then getting another 4 before a 7 occurs is $ \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{18} $. Similarly, the probability of the shooter winning by throwing a 10 on the first roll and then getting another 10 before a 7 occurs is also $ \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{18} $.
  - |-
    By the same line of reasoning, we can find the probability of the shooter winning by
    throwing a 5 on the first roll and then getting another 5 before throwing a 7. In this case,
    there are 10 equally possible cases for the decisive roll: the four ways to make a 5 (1-4, 2-3,
    3-2, 4-1) and the six ways to make a 7. The probability of winning with a 5 is therefore
    7X Ho = %s . The probability of winning with a 9 is also "5. The number 6 is still more
    likely to occur on the first roll, its probability being %.. and it is more likely than the
    others mentioned to occur a second time before a 7 appears, the probability here being
    %1- So the probability of winning with a 6 is %6 x Ai + = 7%oe- And again, likewise, the
    probability of winning with an 8 is 7/96.
    
    There are eight different ways for the shooter to win: if a 7 or 11 is thrown on the first
    roll, or if one of the six numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is thrown on the first roll and again
    before a 7. These ways are all exclusive; so the total probability of the shooter's winning
    is the sum of the probabilities of the alternative ways in which winning is possible, and
    this is %o + Ae + Ao + As + *%oe + *%oe + Has + Ao = *Zos. Expressed as a decimal fraction
    this is .493. This shows that in a craps game the shooter has less than an even chance of
    winning—only slightly less, to be sure, but still less than .5.

    14.3) Probability in Everyday Life
    
    In placing bets or making investments, it is important to consider not only the probability of winning or receiving a return, but also how much can be won on the bet or returned on the investment. These two considerations, safety and productivity, often clash; greater potential returns usually entail greater risks. The safest investment may not be the best one to make, nor may the investment that promises the greatest return if it succeeds. The need to reconcile safety and maximum return confronts us not only in gambling and investing, but also in choosing among alternatives in education, employment, and other spheres of life. We would like to know whether the investment—of money or of time and energy—is "worth it"—that is, whether that wager on the future is wise, all things considered. The future cannot be known, but the probabilities may be estimated.
    
    When one is attempting to compare investments, or bets, or "chancy" decisions of any kind, the concept of expectation value is a powerful tool to use.
    
    Expectation value can best be explained in the context of wagers whose outcomes have known probabilities. Any bet—say, an even-money bet of $1 that heads will appear

    Expectation value
    
    In probability theory, the
    value of a wager or an
    investment; determined
    by multiplying each of
    the mutually exclusive
    possible returns from
    that wager by the
    
    probability of the return,
    
    and summing those
    products.
    
    on the toss of a coin—should be thought of as a purchase; the money is spent when the
    bet has been made. The dollar wagered is the price of the purchase; it buys some expecta-
    tion. If heads appears, the bettor receives a return of two dollars (one his own, the other
    his winnings); if tails appears, the bettor receives a $0 return. There are only two possible
    outcomes of this wager, a head or a tail; the probability of each is known to be 4%; and
    there is a specified return ($2 or $0) associated with each outcome. We multiply the return
    yielded on each possible outcome by the probability of that outcome being realized; the
    sum of all such products is the expectation value of the bet or investment. The expec-
    tation value of a one-dollar bet that heads will turn up when a fair coin is tossed is thus
    equal to (1/2 x $2) + (1/2 x $0), which is $1. In this case, as we know, the "odds" are even—
    which means that the expectation value of the purchase was equal to the purchase price.
    
    This is not always the case. We seek investments in which the expectation value
    purchased will prove greater than the cost of our investment. We want the odds to be
    in our favor. Yet often we are tempted by wagers for which the expectation value is less,
    sometimes much less, than the price of the gamble.
  - |-
    The disparity between the price and the expectation value of a bet can be readily seen in a raffle, in which the purchase of a ticket offers a small chance at a large return. How much the raffle ticket is really worth depends on how small the chance is and how large the return is. Suppose that the return, if we win it, is an automobile worth $20,000, and the price of the raffle ticket is $1. If 20,000 raffle tickets are sold, of which we buy one, the probability of our winning is 1/20,000. The chances of winning are thus very small, but the return if we win is very large. In this hypothetical case, the expectation value of the raffle ticket is (1/20,000 x $20,000) + (19,999/20,000 x $0), or precisely $1, the purchase price of the ticket. The usual purpose of a raffle, however, is to raise money for some worthy cause, and that can happen only if more money is collected from ticket sales than is paid out in prizes. Therefore many more than 20,000 tickets—perhaps 40,000 or 80,000 or 100,000—will be sold. Suppose that 40,000 tickets are sold. The expectation value of our $1 ticket then will be (1/40,000 x $20,000) + (39,999/40,000 x $0), or 50 cents. If 80,000 tickets are sold, the expectation value of the $1 ticket will be reduced to 25 cents, and so on. We may be confident that the expectation value of any raffle ticket we are asked to buy will be substantially less than the amount we are asked to pay for it.
    
    Lotteries are very popular because of the very large prizes that may be won. States and countries conduct lotteries because every ticket purchased buys an expectation value equal to only a fraction of the ticket's price; those who run the lottery retain the difference, reaping huge profits.
  - |-
    The Michigan lottery, played by more than two-thirds of the citizens of that state, is
    typical. Different bets are offered. In one game, called the "Daily 3," the player may choose
    (in a "straight bet") any three-digit number from 000 to 999. After all bets are placed, a
    number is drawn at random and announced by the state; a player who has purchased a
    $1 straight-bet ticket on that winning number wins a prize of $500. The probability that
    the correct three digits in the correct order have been selected is 1 in 1,000; the expecta-
    tion value of a $1 "Daily 3" straight-bet ticket is therefore (1/1000 x $500) + (999/1000 x $0),
    or 50 cents.*
    
    * However imprudent a wager on the "Daily 3" may be, it is a very popular lottery—so popular that it is now run twice a
    day, midday and evening. One may infer that either those who purchase such lottery tickets have not thought through
    the expected value of their wagers, or that such wagering offers them satisfactions independent of the money value
    of their bets.

    Lotteries and raffles are examples of great disparity between the price and the expectation value of the gambler's purchase. Sometimes the disparity is small, but the number of purchasers nevertheless ensures the profitability of the sale, as in gambling casinos, where every normal bet is one in which the purchase price is greater than the expectation value bought. In the preceding section we determined, using the product theorem and the addition theorem of the calculus of probability, that the dice game called craps is one in which the shooter's chance of winning is .493—just a little less than even. But that game is widely and mistakenly believed to offer the shooting player an even chance. Betting on the shooter in craps, at even money, is therefore a leading attraction in gambling casinos. Every such bet of $1 is a purchase of expectation value equal to (.493 x $2) + (.507 x $0), which is 98.6 cents. The difference of approximately a penny and a half may seem trivial, but because casinos receive that advantage (and other even greater advantages on other wagers) in thousands of bets made each day on the dice tables, they are very profitable enterprises. In the gambling fraternity, those who regularly bet on the shooter to win at craps are called paradoxically "right bettors," and among professional gamblers it is commonly said that "all right bettors die broke."

    The concept of expectation value is of practical use in helping to decide how to save (or invest) money most wisely. Banks pay differing rates of interest on accounts of different kinds. Let us assume that the alternative bank accounts among which we choose are all government-insured, and that therefore there is no chance of a loss of the principal. At the end of a full year, the expectation value of each $1,000 savings investment, at 5 percent simple interest, is ($1,000 [the principal that we know will be returned]) + (.05 x $1,000), or $1,050 in all. To complete the calculation, this return must be multiplied by the probability of our getting it—but here we assume, because the account is insured, that our getting it is certain, so we merely multiply by 1, or 100%. If the rate of interest is 6 percent, the insured return will be $1,060, and so on. The expectation value purchased in such savings accounts is indeed greater than the deposit, the purchase price, but to get that interest income we must give up the use of our money for some period of time. The bank pays us for its use during that time because, of course, it plans to invest that money at yet higher rates of return.
  - |-
    Safety and productivity are considerations that are always in tension. If we are prepared to sacrifice a very small degree of safety for our savings, we may achieve a modest increase in the rate of return. For example, with that $1,000 we may purchase a corporate bond, perhaps paying 8 or even 10 percent interest, in effect lending our money to the company issuing the bond. The yield on our corporate bond may be double that of a bank savings account, but we will be running the risk—small but real—that the corporation issuing the bond will be unable to make payment when the loan we made to them falls due. In calculating the expectation value of such a bond, say at 10 percent, the amount to be returned to the investor of $1,000 is determined in precisely the same way in which we calculated the yield on a savings account. First we calculate the return, if we get it: ($1,000 [the principal]) + (10% x $1,000 [the inter- est]), or $1,100 total return. But in this case the probability of our getting that return is not %oo; it may be very high, but it is not 1. The fraction by which that $1,100 return therefore must be multiplied is the probability, as best we can estimate it, that the corporation will be financially sound when its bond is due for payment. If we think this probability is very high—say, .99—we may conclude that the purchase of the cor- porate bond at 10 percent offers an expectation value ($1,089) greater than that of the insured bank account at 5 percent ($1,050), and is therefore a wiser investment. Here is the comparison in detail:
    
    Insured bank account at 5 percent simple interest for 1 year:
    
    Return = (principal + interest) = ($1,000 + $50) = $1,050
    
    Probability of return (assumed)= 1.0
    
    Expectation value of investment in this bank account:
    
    ($1,050 x 1 = $1,050) + $0 x O =$0) or $1,050 total
    
    Corporate bond at 10 percent interest, at the end of 1 year:

    Return if we get it = (principal + interest) = ($1,000 + $100) = $1,100  
    Probability of return (estimated) = .99  
    
    Expectation value of investment in this corporate bond:  
    ($1,100 x .99 = $1,089) + ($0 x .01 = $0) or $1,089 total  
    
    However, if we conclude that the company to which we would be lending the money is  
    not absolutely reliable, our estimated probability of ultimate return will drop, say, to .95,  
    and the expectation value will also drop:  
    
    Corporate bond at 10 percent interest, at the end of 1 year:  
    Return if we get it = (principal + interest) = ($1,000 + $100) = $1,100  
    Probability of return (new estimate) = .95  
    
    Expectation value of investment in this corporate bond:  
    ($1,100 x .95 = $1,045) + ($0 x .05 = $0) or $1,045 total  
    
    If this last estimate reflects our evaluation of the company selling the bond, then we  
    will judge the bank account, paying a lower rate of interest with much greater safety,  
    the wiser investment.  
    
    Interest rates on bonds or on bank accounts fluctuate, of course, depending on the  
    current rate of inflation and other factors, but the interest paid on a commercial bond  
    is always higher than that paid on an insured bank account because the risk of the  
    bond is greater; that is, the probability of its anticipated return is lower. The greater the  
    known risk, the higher the interest rate must go to attract investors. Expectation value,  
    in financial markets as everywhere, must take into consideration both probability (risk)  
    and outcome (return).  
    
    When the soundness of a company enters our calculation of the expectation value of  
    an investment in it, we must make some probability assumptions. Explicitly or implicitly,  
    we estimate the fractions that we then think best represent the likelihoods of the possible  
    outcomes foreseen. These are the fractions by which the returns that we anticipate in  
    the event of these outcomes must be multiplied, before we sum the products. All such  
    predictions are necessarily speculative, and all the outcomes calculated are therefore  
    uncertain, of course.
  - |-
    When we can determine the approximate value of a given return if we achieve it,
    calculations of the kind here described enable us to determine what probability those out-
    comes need to have (given present evidence) so that our investment now will prove worth-
    while. Many decisions in financial matters, and many choices in ordinary life, depend (if
    they are to be rational) on such estimates of probability and the resultant expected value.
    The calculus of probability may have application whenever we must gamble on the future.
    
    There is no gambling system that can evade the rigor of the probability calculus. It
    is sometimes argued, for example, that in a game in which there are even-money stakes
    to be awarded on the basis of approximately equiprobable alternatives (such as tossing a
    coin, or betting black versus red on a roulette wheel), one can be sure to win by making
    the same bet consistently—always heads, or always the same color—and doubling the
    amount of money wagered after each loss. Thus, if I bet $1 on heads, and tails shows,
    then I should bet $2 on heads the next time, and if tails shows again, my third bet, also
    on heads, should be $4, and so on. One cannot fail to win by following this procedure,
    some suppose, because extended runs (of tails, or of the color I don't bet on) are highly
    improbable.* Anyway, it is said, the longest run must sometime end, and when it does,
    the person who has regularly doubled the bet will always be money ahead.
  - |-
    Wonderful! Why need anyone work for a living, when we can all adopt this apparently foolproof system of winning at the gaming table? Let us ignore the fact that most gaming houses put an upper limit on the size of the wager they will accept, a limit that may block the application of the doubling system. What is the real fallacy contained in this doubling prescription? A long run of tails, say, is almost certain to end sooner or later, but it may end later rather than sooner. So an adverse run may last long enough to exhaust any finite amount of money the bettor has to wager. To be certain of being able to continue doubling the bet each time, no matter how long the adverse run may continue or how large the losses are that the run has imposed, the bettor would have to begin with an infinite amount of money. Of course, a player with an infinite amount of money could not possibly win—in the sense of increasing his wealth.
    
    Finally, there is a dangerous fallacy, in wagering or in investing, that an understanding of the calculus of probability may help us to avoid. The inevitable failure of the doubling technique underscores the truth that the probability of getting a head (or a tail) on the next toss of a fair coin cannot be affected by the outcomes of preceding tosses; each toss is an independent event. Therefore it is a foolish mistake to conclude, in flipping a coin, that because heads have appeared ten times in a row, tails is "due"—or to suppose that because certain digits have appeared frequently among winning lottery numbers that those digits are "hot." One who bets, or invests, on the supposition that some future event is made more probable, or less probable, by the frequency of the occurrence of independent events that have preceded it commits a blunder so common that it has been given a mocking name: "the gambler's fallacy."
  - |-
    On the other hand, if some mechanical device produces certain outcomes more frequently than others in a long-repeated pattern, one might conclude that the device is not designed (or is not functioning) as one supposed to yield outcomes that are equi-possible. The dice may be loaded, or a roulette wheel (if the ball very frequently stops at the same section of the wheel) may not be balanced properly. The a priori theory of probability ("successes over outcomes") is rationally applied when we are confident that the set represented by the denominator of the fraction—the set of all outcomes—is a set of genuinely equipossible events. However, accumulated evidence may eventually cause one to conclude that the members of that set are not equipossible. At that point we may be well advised to revert to the frequency theory of probability, reasoning that the likelihood of certain outcomes is the fraction that represents the limit of the frequency with which that smaller set of outcomes has appeared. Whether we ought to apply the a priori theory or the relative frequency theory must depend on the evidence we have gathered and on our understanding of the calculus of probability as applied to that context.
    
    * In fact, a long random sequence of heads and tails (or reds and blacks on a roulette wheel, etc.) will include extended runs of one result (tails, or reds, etc.) with much greater frequency than is commonly supposed. A run of a dozen heads in a row—requiring a bet of $2,048 on the 12th bet if one wagers steadily on tails in a doubling series that began with $1—is very far from rare. And after a run of twelve, of course, the chance of a thirteenth tail is 50%!

    *10. The probability of the shooter winning in craps is .493, slightly less than even, as we proved in the preceding section. In casinos, a bet that the shooter will win is a bet on what is called the "Pass" line. We could all become rich, it would seem, if only we bet consistently against the shooter, on the "Don't Pass" line. But of course there is no such line; one cannot simply bet against the shooter, because the house will not take so unprofitable a bet. Yet usually one can place a bet called "Don't Pass—Bar 3," which wins if the shooter loses, unless the shooter loses by rolling a 3, in which case this bet loses also.

    Summary
    
    In all inductive arguments the conclusion is supported by the premises with only some degree of probability, and it is usually described simply as "more" or "less" probable in the case of scientific hypotheses. We explained in this chapter how a quantitative measure of probability, stated as a fraction between 0 and 1, can be assigned to many inductive conclusions.
    
    Two alternative conceptions of probability, both permitting this quantitative assignment, were presented in Section 14.1.
    
    e The relative frequency theory, according to which probability is defined as the relative frequency with which members of a class exhibit a specified attribute.
    
    Chapter 14 Probability
    
    e The a priori theory, according to which the probability of an event occurring is determined by dividing the number of ways in which the event can occur by the number of equipossible outcomes.
    
    Both theories accommodate the development of a calculus of probability, introduced in Section 14.2, with which the probability of a complex event can be computed if the probability of its component events can be determined. Two basic theorems, the product theorem and the addition theorem, are used in this probability calculus.

    If the complex event of interest is a joint occurrence, the probability of two or more components
    both occurring, the product theorem is applied. The product theorem asserts that if the component
    events are independent, the probability of their joint occurrence is equal to the product of their sepa-
    rate probabilities. However, if the component events are not independent, the general product theorem
    applies, in which the probability of (a and b) is equal to the probability of (a) multiplied by the prob-
    ability of (b if a).
    
    If the complex event of interest is an alternative occurrence (the probability of at least one of two
    or more events), the addition theorem is applied. The addition theorem asserts that if the component
    events are mutually exclusive, their probabilities are summed to determine their alternative occurrence.
    But if the component events are not mutually exclusive, the probability of their alternative occurrence
    may be computed either:
    
    e by analyzing the favorable cases into mutually exclusive events and summing the probabilities of those
    successes; or
    
    e by determining the probability that the alternative occurrence will not occur and subtracting that
    fraction from 1.
    
    In Section 14.3 we explained how the calculus of probability can be put to use in everyday life, allow-
    ing us to calculate the relative merits of alternative investments or wagers. We must consider both the
    probability of each of the various possible outcomes of an investment and the return received in the
    event of each. For each outcome, the anticipated return is multiplied by the fraction that represents
    the probability of that outcome occurring; those products are then summed to calculate the expecta-
    tion value of that investment.

    Round 1: Argumentative Versus
    
    j;LUCHA LIBRE! ,
    Nonargumentative Use of Analogy
    
    Lucha libre ("free wrestling") is a form of profes-
    sional wrestling popular in Mexico and many other
    countries. The fighters, or luchadores, wear colorful
    masks and adopt intriguing stage names, such as Mil
    Mascaras, "Man of a Thousand Masks."
    
    In an unprecedented move, two rival luchadores,
    El Profesor Belicoso (B) and El Filosofo Enojado, (G) have
    decided to settle their disputes with inductive argu-
    ments rather than body presses, headbutts, and aerial
    power moves.

    Your mother is like an iceberg for five reasons: She is
    large, she is cold, she sank the Titanic in 1912, she
    helps polar bears travel from place to place, and global
    warming is melting her!
    
    That is a nonargumentative use of analogy!
    
    jEstupido! Then you try!
    
    jSi, sefior! Four months ago, the entire Hoyle fam-
    ily of Chiapas was preemptively imprisoned because
    they had been making suspicious maps and stockpiling
    supplies from the local match factory. Two weeks later,
    police searched the Hoyle family's iPads and found
    plans for a huge explosion! Since everyone who is
    related to you has been making suspicious maps and
    stockpiling supplies from the local match factory, your
    whole family should be jailed!
    
    That is a mere personal attack, not an argumentative
    use of analogy! ;EI Profesor esta belicoso!

    of argumentative versus nonargumentative
    analogies to decide who is correct and wins

    Round 2: Refutation by
    Logical Analogy
    
    My divorce is a travesty! The judge has ordered me to
    give half of my assets to my ex-wife, saying that, by
    being my spotter in the gym, videotaping and analyzing
    the playbacks on all my fights, and making me high-
    protein meals for the last fifteen years, she gets half the
    credit for my success. However, my ex-wife and I also
    contributed 50/50 to our son Anolfo and the judge does
    not propose that we split him down the middle!
    
    Your refutation by logical analogy does not share
    the same form as the argument you are trying to refute!
    
    Oh yes it does, sefior!
    
    And besides, there are very important differences
    between your assets and your son Anolfo. Assets can
    be split down the middle, whereas a child cannot. And
    Anolfo has his own interests that must be taken into
    account, whereas your assets do not.
    
    I defy you!
  - |-
    You Be the Referee: El Profesor has made  
    two charges against El Fil6sofo—that his refu-  
    tation does not share the same form as the  
    argument he is trying to refute, and that  
    the analogy is weak because of differences  
    between the two things being compared. Use  
    your knowledge of refutation by logical anal-  
    ogy to decide who wins the point!
    
    Round 3: Match the Induction with  
    the Method Being Used
    
    If a man lights a match, calls his mother on the phone,  
    and adopts a shelter dog, and then receives a care  
    package in the mail, and then scratches his elbow,  
    calls his mother on the phone, and buys illegal fire-  
    works, and then receives a care package in the mail,  
    
    and we conclude that the man's calling his mother on  
    the phone is the cause of receiving the care package,  
    which of John Stuart Mill's five techniques of induc-  
    tive inference have we just used?!
    
    Er... that is the method of difference! Okay, my  
    turn!
    
    If a luchador eats more tomatoes, begins exercis-  
    ing his pinky toe flexors, and adopts Vedic meditation  
    practices, and then discovers that his fighting and his  
    digestive health have improved, and then he increases  
    his Vedic meditation and his digestive health improves  
    to such a glorious extent that his lower body feels like  
    that of a new, solid-gold-plated man, and we infer  
    that the meditation has caused the enhanced diges-  
    tive health, which of John Stuart Mill's five techniques  
    of inductive inference have we just used?!
    
    The method of concomitant variation!
    
    Oh, really? Then what kind of variation is it, direct  
    or inverse?
    
    Um, direct!
    
    Okay, my turn! If we know that Spandex gives  
    you a rash and then you put on a Spandex bodysuit  
    and I bodyslam you, and you both get a rash and get a  
    big bruise on your stupid chest, and I conclude, since  
    I know the bodysuit caused the rash, that my body-  
    slamming caused the bruise, which of John Stuart  
    Mill's five techniques of inductive inference have  
    I just used?
    
    That would never happen! But it is the method  
    of residues!

    You Be the Referee: Each luchador has answered two questions. Tally up the right versus wrong answers (refer to section 12.4 in your textbook for a review of Mill's techniques) to decide who wins the point!
    
    Round 4: Scientific Method Quiz
    
    True or False: The first step in scientific investigation is formulating the explanatory hypothesis.
    
    True!
    
    False! The first step is identifying the problem!
    
    True or False: Compatibility with previously well-established hypotheses is a justifiable way of evaluating scientific explanations.
    
    True!
    
    Ridiculous. The point of hypotheses is to help us find out new things.
    
    Chapter 14 Probability
    
    True or False: When two rival hypotheses fit equally well with established theory and have roughly equal predictive power, we are likely to favor the more intricate of the two.
    
    True! And fancy!
    
    False! We want the simpler of the two. The simplest theory that fits the facts is likely to involve the smallest number of unjustified assumptions.
    
    You Be the Referee: Use your knowledge of the scientific method (Chapter 13) to decide who is correct and wins the point!
    
    Round 5: The Probability Calculus
    
    If there is a 1/10 chance that you will ever win a match against a luchador over five feet tall, what is the probability that you will win five matches against five different luchadores all over five feet tall?
    
    Lies! But if I only had a 1/10 chance of winning, which is totally false, then the answer is 5/10, or 1/2!
    
    Here is one for you: If there is a 1/5 chance you can eat a taco without getting salsa all over your costume, what is the probability that you can eat three tacos without getting salsa all over your costume?
    
    I will avenge my honor! But the answer is 1/125.
    
    A question: If you have a bag of eggs and 8 of them are rotten and 2 of them are good because all your chickens are sickly, and you reach into the bag to pull out one egg, and then another egg, what are your miserable chances of getting two good eggs?
  - |-
    How dare you malign my chickens! But the  
    answer is 1/25.
    
    One more question: If the probability of your  
    passing an eye test is 0.65, and the probability of your  
    showing up to a match on time is 50 percent, and  
    the probability of your rash clearing up is 3/8, and if  
    all those things are necessary—but not sufficient—  
    conditions for you to win a match, and even after  
    all of that, you still only have a one-in-four chance  
    of victory, what is the probability of your winning a  
    match? You may use a calculator, fool!
    
    I do not know! I will crush you!
    
    I have crushed you already—with my mind!
    
    You Be the Referee: Each luchador has  
    answered (or failed to answer) two questions.  
    Calculate the answer to each question for  
    yourself, and award the point to the competi-  
    tor who performed better overall.
    
    Who wins the five-round battle?
    
    SOLUTIONS
    
    Because Part II of your textbook dealt with inductive,  
    rather than deductive, arguments, some difference of  
    opinion is reasonable here.
    
    Round 1
    
    The Profesor gives five reasons why El Fildsofo's mother  
    is like an iceberg. While he puts great effort into con-  
    structing an analogy, he neglects to use the analogy to  
    make an argument; that is, there is no conclusion other  
    than the analogy itself. A fully developed analogical  
    argument would then say something else about an ice-  
    berg that could then be applied to El Filosofo's mother.
    
    The Profesor attempts to write off El Filosofo's argu-  
    ment as a mere personal attack, but the argument is  
    actually a well-developed analogical argument: It lays  
    out the ways in which The Profesor's family is like the  
    Hoyle family, and then it makes an argument that the  
    way the Hoyle family was treated is how The Profesor's  
    family should be treated. Regardless of the truth of  
    the premises, El Filosofo has in fact made an argumen-  
    tative use of analogy.
    
    Point to El Filosofo!

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    EI Profesor alleges that El Filosofo's refutation by logical analogy does not share the same form as the argument he is trying to refute. This is not true. The argument he is trying to refute is as follows: Because El Fildsofo and his ex-wife each contributed to his career, the proceeds should be split. EJ Filosofo makes an argument that shares the same form: He and his ex-wife each contributed to Anolfo, but the conclusion that Anolfo should be split is absurd.
    
    However, El Profesor's second claim certainly has merit. Anolfo is different from E/ Filosofo's assets in many important ways.
    
    EI Filosofo has made a flawed argument. El Profesor has made two criticisms of it, only one of which was correct.
    
    A referee might reasonably award the point to El Profesor or might declare a draw.
    
    Round 3
    
    If a man does A, B, and C, and then receives a care package in the mail; and then does X, B, and Y, and again receives a care package in the mail; and we conclude that B was the cause of receiving the care package, we have not used the method of difference, but rather the method of agreement. El Profesor is ahead.
    
    If a luchador does A, B, and C, and then discovers that his fighting and his digestive health have improved, and then he increases C and his digestive health improves even more, and we infer that C has caused the enhanced digestive health, we have indeed used the method of concomitant variation. El Profesor is also correct that this is an instance of direct variation—when one thing increases, so does the other thing.
    
    If A and C result in X and Y, and we know that A causes X, so we "subtract out" A and X to conclude that C caused Y, we have indeed used the method of residues. Score one for El Filosofo.
    
    El Profesor has wiped the floor with El Filosofo in this round.
    
    Round 4
    
    1. El Filosofo is correct—the first step is identifying the problem (p. 559).
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    2. El Profesor is correct—while it is true that the point of the scientific method is to be open to new information and ideas, it is also true that science aims at compiling a system of hypotheses that work together (p. 564).
    
    3. El Filosofo is correct—the simpler theory is preferred (p. 566). The principle of Ockham's Razor may also be invoked (Google it!)
    
    Point to El Filosofo!
    
    Round 5
    
    El Filosofo asks about the chance of winning five matches if the chance of winning each one is 1/10. El Profesor answers 5/10, or 1/2. However, this answer is not sensible—how could the probability of winning all five matches be greater than the probability of winning one of them? El Profesor has made the common mistake of adding instead of multiplying. The correct answer is 1/100,000.
    
    El Profesor asks, "If there is a 1/5 chance you can eat a taco without getting salsa all over your costume, what is the probability that you can eat three tacos without getting salsa all over your costume?" El Filosofo has correctly multiplied the probabilities of three independent events: 1/5 x 1/5 x 1/5 = 1/125. El Filosofo is most definitely ahead.
  - |-
    EI Filosofo gives a scenario with 8 rotten and 2 good eggs, and asks for the probability of selecting the two good eggs. El Profesor seems to have correctly determined that the probability of selecting a good egg on the first pick is 2/10, or 1/5, but then he incorrectly assumes that the probability is the same on the second pick. He then erroneously multiplies 1/5 x 1/5 to get 1/25. However, after the first good egg has been selected, the chance of picking another good egg is no longer 2 out of 10 because there are only 9 eggs left and only 1 of them is good. The chance of getting a good egg the second time around is 1/9. The correct answer is 1/5 x 1/9 = 1/45. El Filosofo is still ahead.
    
    Finally, El Profesor gives a complicated and insulting scenario with a variety of probabilities. In order to win, El Filosofo would have to pass an eye test (P = 0.65), show up on time (0.5), have his rash clear up (3/8 or 0.375), and then actually beat his opponent (0.25). While this sounds complicated, all that is necessary is simply to plug 0.65 x 0.5 x 0.375 x 0.25 into a calculator. The answer is 0.03046875, or about 3 percent. El Filosofo neglected to attempt this question, so score one for El Profesor.
    
    However, El Filosofo is the only one to have answered a question correctly in round 5, so he gets the point.
    
    El Filosofo is the clear winner in three of five rounds and wins overall! He will be receiving an extremely heavy belt as a prize. El Profesor has already challenged him to a rematch on the topic of seventeenth-century French poetry.

    Appendices
  - |-
    The following three appendices (A-C) supplement Section 9.9, The Shorter Truth-Table Technique, and especially Section 9.9 (D), by providing additional instruction for cases in which a conclusion is false in multiple ways.
    
    In some of these cases, the STTT is most efficiently applied using the P-Sequence (Appendix A). In some cases, because the conclusion is false in multiple ways and the premises are true in multiple ways, one must calculate the numbers of these truth-value combinations to determine whether to use the C-Sequence or the P-Sequence for a multiple-line truth table (Appendix B). And in some cases, when an argument is invalid, one must systematically employ Maxims III, IV, and V to construct a truth-value combination in which the premises are all true and the conclusion is false (Appendix C).
    
    Appendix A: The Efficiency of the STTT: Selecting the Most Efficient Sequence
    of STTT Steps shows how Step 1 and the P-Sequence make the STTT much more efficient
    than if one invariably uses the C-Sequence and first makes the conclusion false. An
    argument that would take nine lines using the C-Sequence is proved valid in a one-line
    truth table using the P-Sequence. The shorter truth table for a similar, but invalid, argu-
    ment is also given.
    
    Appendix B: Step 1 Calculations for Multiple-Line Shorter Truth Tables shows how
    to calculate the number of ways in which a statement is true or false, which is essen-
    tial in determining whether to use the C-Sequence or the P-Sequence in constructing a
    multiple-line shorter truth table.
    
    Appendix C: Unforced Truth-Value Assignments, Invalid Arguments, and Maxims III-V
    demonstrates, for three arguments, how to prove an argument invalid by systematically
    employing Maxims III, IV, and V to construct a shorter truth table with all true premises
    and a false conclusion.
    
    APPENDIX A: The Efficiency
    of the STTT: Selecting the
    
    Most Efficient Sequence
    of STTT Steps
    
    To appreciate the efficiency of properly employing the C-Sequence or the P-Sequence of the
    STTT, consider the following argument.
    
    (P,): A DG
    
    (P,): BV A
    
    (P,): ~B

    (P,): H

    STEP 1: Determine Whether Any Premise Is True in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion Is False
    
    The conclusion of this argument is the following disjunction.  
    (G-A)V-S))
    
    Though this disjunction is false only if both disjuncts are false, since each disjunct is itself a conjunction, each disjunct can be false in three ways (e.g., the left disjunct, G - H, is false in three ways: T - F, F- T, F - F), from which it follows that there are nine ways for this disjunction to be false. Applying Maxim V, we generate the following nine-line shorter truth table by holding the truth-value assignment to G - H constant (i.e., T - F) and enumerating each of the three ways that I - J is false (i.e., T- F F- T, and F - F), and then doing the same for the other two ways in which G - H is false (i.e., F-T, andF.- F).

    If the foregoing argument is valid, one would have to show, using Steps 2,, 3,, and 4 (i.e., the C-sequence), that the premises cannot all be true for each of these nine combinations of truth values for these four simple statements. We are no better off with the Complete Truth-Table Method (CTTM), since a complete truth table for this argument would require 64 lines.
  - |-
    Fortunately, in Step 1 we always ask: Is any premise true in fewer ways than the
    conclusion is false? We see immediately that Premise 3 is true only if B is false, and that
    Premise 4 is true only if H is true. For this reason, we execute Steps 2, 3, and 4 (i.e., the
    P-sequence), and construct a one-line shorter truth table.
    
    STEP 2:: Make the Premises All True
    
    First, applying Maxim II, we begin by making forced truth-value assignments to prem-
    ises that are simple statements or the negations of simple statements. Since there are
    two such forced truth-value assignments, in Premise 3 and in Premise 4, we apply
    Maxim IV and first make the left-most premise of these two premises, Premise 3, true
    by making B false.
    
    Applying these truth values to B and H wherever else they occur, we get the
    following:
    
    Appendix A
    
    Since B is false, A must be true in Premise 2.
    
    Fo T T T F T TO T OT
    
    STEP 3,: Make the Conclusion False
    
    Given that G - His true in the conclusion, the left disjunct of the disjunctive conclusion
    is true, which makes the conclusion true. This means, obviously, that we cannot possibly
    make the conclusion false.
    
    F oT T T F T T T TO OT
    
    STEP 4: Test for Validity
    
    This proves that the argument is valid, for the only truth values that make Premises 3
    and 4 true, force truth values to A and G to make Premises 1 and 2 true, which makes
    the conclusion true. Since the argument cannot have all true premises and a false con-
    clusion, it is valid.
  - |-
    Again, if we proceeded in accordance with Steps 2., 3., and 4, we would need to
    execute a nine-line shorter truth table to prove that the argument is valid. What this
    example shows is that executing Steps 2., 3., and 4 can be far more efficient than executing
    Steps 2., 3., and 4.
    
    The reader may have already noticed that, for this particular argument, we can exe-
    cute a proof in only four inferences, by means of D.S., M.P., Conj., and Add.
    But compare the foregoing argument with the somewhat similar argument, below.
    
    (P,): A DG
    
    (P,): BV A
    
    (P,): B
    
    (P,): H
    .(G-AVU-S/)
    
    The only difference between this argument and the previous argument is that Premise 3
    is B here and ~B in the previous argument. If one looks for a proof of this argument,
    however, one will look in vain. And if one employs Step 2, one may need to complete
    a nine-line shorter truth table. As in the previous argument, however, we can apply
    Steps 2., 3., and 4, and prove that this argument is invalid in just three lines.

    This argument is given as Exercise 10 of Section 9.9, on page 411, and the step-by-

    Appendix A
    
    APPENDIX B: Step 1 Calculations
    for Multiple-Line Shorter
    Truth Tables
    
    Arguments whose conclusion is false in multiple ways often have premises that are all
    true in multiple ways. In such cases, to determine whether to use the C-Sequence or the
    P-Sequence, we must first determine, in Step 1, whether any premise is true in fewer ways
    than the ways in which the conclusion is false.
    
    Step 1 for Multiple-Line Shorter Truth Tables
  - |-
    To be able to calculate the number of combinations of truth values on which a statement is false (i.e., a conclusion) or true (i.e., a premise), and to execute the appropriate Sequence of Steps and construct multiple-line shorter truth tables, we must:
    
    (i) Determine the main logical operator of each compound statement (i.e., each compound premise and a compound conclusion) and its statement type.
    
    (ii) Make the main logical operator false (or true).
    
    (iii) Construct each combination of truth values in which the conclusion is false (or the premise is true), and create a separate line for each such combination by assigning a truth value to each constituent statement, from those with greatest scope (the entire statement) to those with the least scope (simple statements).
    
    (iv) Determine whether any premise is true in fewer ways than the ways in which the conclusion is false.
    
    Step 1 (i): Determine the Main Logical Operator
    
    The main logical operator of a compound statement is the logical operator with the greatest scope—i.e., the logical operator whose scope is the entire statement in question. Consider the following four compound statements.
    
    ~GVH
  - |-
    (AV B)-(C=D)]DE  
    ~[(AVB)-(C=D)]VE  
    ~{[(A V B) -(C =D)] > £}  
    
    We can see in these examples that a compound statement either contains parentheses (and possibly brackets and braces), or it does not contain parentheses. When a compound statement contains a logical connective and does not contain parentheses, such as in the first statement, ~G V H, the logical connective (i.e., the wedge: V) is the main logical operator. When a compound statement does contain parentheses (and possibly brackets and braces), either (a) there is a logical connective outside all of the parentheses, brackets, and braces, or (b) there is no logical connective outside all of the parentheses, brackets, and braces. If (a) there is a logical connective outside all of the parentheses, brackets, and braces, that logical connective is the main logical operator. If (b) there is no logical connective outside all of the parentheses, brackets and braces, there must be a tilde outside all of the parentheses, brackets, and braces, in which case the negation operator is the main logical operator.  
    
    Since the second compound statement above, namely  
    
    (AV B)-(C=D)]DE  
    
    has a logical connective, namely the horseshoe (>), outside all of its parentheses and brackets, the horseshoe is its main logical operator, and the statement is a conditional. The third compound statement above, namely  
    
    ~[(AVB)-(C=D)]VE  
    
    also has a logical connective, namely the wedge (V), outside all of its parentheses and brackets; so the wedge is its main logical operator, and the statement is a disjunction. Although the negation operator is outside all of the parentheses and brackets, the negation operator is not a logical connective; the tilde operates only on the statement to its immediate right, the conjunction (A V B) -(C =D), not on the entire compound statement (i.e., the disjunction). This is why in all such cases the logical connective, which operates on the entire compound statement, is the statement's main logical operator.  
    
    The fourth compound statement above, namely  
    
    ~{[(A V B)-(C =D)] > EF}

    must therefore have, as it does, a negation operator outside all of its parentheses, brack-
    ets, and braces; this negation operator is the main logical operator of this compound
    statement.
    
    Step 1 (ii): Assign a Truth Value to the
    Main Logical Operator
    
    Consider the second compound statement above.
    (AV B)-(C=D)]DE
    
    We determined above that because the horseshoe is outside all of its parentheses and
    brackets, the horseshoe is the main logical operator of this statement, and the statement
    
    Appendix B
    
    Appendix B
    
    is a conditional. If this conditional were the conclusion of an argument, we would begin
    the STTT by placing an F under the horseshoe.
    
    [(A V B) (C = D)] =) E
    
    Step 1 (iii): Construct Each Combination of
    Truth Values in which the Conclusion Is
    False (or the Premise Is True)
    
    To construct the combinations of truth values for simple statements in which this con-
    ditional statement is false, we need to know the definitional truth table (or the rule of
    thumb) for the conditional. Recall that a conditional is false only when its antecedent is
    true and its consequent is false. Thus, to make this conditional false, we must first make
    its consequent, simple statement E, false.
    
    [(A V B) (C = D)] =) E
    
    Now we must make the antecedent of this conditional true. What is the antecedent
    of this conditional? What kind of compound statement is the antecedent of the entire
    conditional? To answer this question, we must identify the main logical operator of the
    bracketed compound statement to the left of the horseshoe. As before, when we ascer-
    tained the main logical operator of a complex compound statement, we must here ascer-
    tain the main logical connective inside the brackets and outside the parentheses. In this
    statement, the logical connective inside the brackets and outside all of the parentheses
    is the dot of conjunction. Thus, the antecedent of the conditional is a conjunction, and
    the dot is its main logical operator; so we place a T under the dot.
    
    [(A V B) (C = D)] =) E

    In general, we work outside-inward—from the logical operator with the greatest scope
    to the logical operators with the least scope, to simple statements. In the case of a conclu-
    sion, we make the main logical operator false, and then, working inward, we assign truth
    values to logical operators of decreasing scope and, finally, to simple statements. In this
    case, the antecedent is a conjunction, so we need to recall the definitional truth table (or
    rule of thumb) for conjunction. A conjunction is true only when both of its conjuncts
    are true. Given that the conjunction, (A V B) -(C =D), is true, both of its conjuncts must
    be true. The left conjunct is the statement inside the parentheses to the left of the dot
    (i.e., A V B); the right conjunct is the statement inside the parentheses to the right of the
    dot (i.e., C= D). The main logical operator of the left conjunct is the wedge, so we place
    a T under the wedge of the disjunction, A V B.

    The main logical operator of the right conjunct is the tribar, so we place a T under

    Continuing inward, and applying Maxim V, we next determine the ways in which
    the left conjunct, the disjunction A V B, is true. Since the disjunction A V B is not true for
    FV F, we know A V Bis true in three distinct ways: T V T, TV F, and F V T. We enumerate
    the truth-value combinations for the two conjuncts, A V B and C = D, by making A V B
    true in the first way, namely T V T, and enumerating each of the two ways that C = D is
    true. Thus, when A V Bis TV T, C=D can be T=T (line 1) or F= F (line 2).

    Next, we make A V B true as T V F, and enumerate C = D as T =T (line 3) and
    F = F (line 4).
    
    [(A V B) G = D)] | » E
    1 T T T T T T T F |
    2 T T T T | T | F |
    3 T T | T T T T F |
    4 T T | T | T | F |
    
    Lastly, we make A V B true as F V T, and enumerate C = D as T =T (line 5) and
    F = F (line 6).
    
    [(A V B) (C = D)] =) E
    1 T T T T T T T F F

    4 T T F T F T F F F
    5 F T T T T T T F F
    6 F T T T F T F F F
    
    Since for each of the three ways in which A V B is true there are two ways in which
    C = D is true, this truth table requires 3 x 2 or 6 rows. Thus, there are six different
    combinations of truth values for the constituent simple statements of this conditional,
    namely [(A V B) -(C = D)] 5 E, on which the conditional is false. This means that if
    we applied the STTT C-Sequence to an argument with this conditional as its conclu-
    sion, we might need to check all six lines of its shorter truth table (i.e., if the argument
    were valid, we would need to check all six combinations of truth values for the simple
    statements to prove that on no such combination are all of the premises true and the
    conclusion false).
    
    Appendix B
    
    Step 1 (iv): Determine Whether Any Premise Is True
    in Fewer Ways than the Conclusion Is False
  - |-
    To determine whether to follow the C-Sequence or the P-Sequence, Step 1 (i-iii) must be
    executed for at least one, and possibly every, multiply true premise. The aim is to deter-
    mine whether any premise is true in fewer ways than the conclusion is false. If at least
    one premise is true in fewer ways than the conclusion is false, execute the P-Sequence;
    if not, execute the C-Sequence.
    
    Whether the C-Sequence or the P-Sequence is indicated by Step 1 (i-iv), the most
    important point to note is that only for a valid argument do we necessarily have to check
    every combination of truth values on which the conclusion is false or the premises are
    all true, for the only way to prove that an argument cannot have all true premises and
    a false conclusion is to show that it does not have all true premises and a false conclu-
    sion for every combination of truth values on which its conclusion is false (or its premises
    are all true).
    
    This is not necessarily the case for an invalid argument whose conclusion is false in
    multiple ways and whose premises are true in multiple ways. If an argument is invalid,
    we may be able to demonstrate this for the first false conclusion or the first set of all true
    premises we consider. Or, the first false conclusion may not have all true premises, but
    the second false conclusion may. Or it might be the case that only the last false conclu-
    sion has all true premises. If an argument is invalid, we won't prove it invalid until we
    have demonstrated that for some combination of truth values for the simple statements
    on which the conclusion is false (or the premises are all true), the premises are all true
    (or the conclusion is false).
    
    End Note
    
    1 When a compound statement does not contain a logical connective and does not contain
    parentheses (e.g., ~G), the tilde is the main logical operator.
    
    APPENDIX C: Unforced Truth-
    Value Assignments, Invalid
    Arguments, and Maxims III-V
  - |-
    To prove an argument with a multiply false conclusion valid using Steps 2, 3, and 4,
    one must show that for each false conclusion there is at least one false premise. If a valid
    argument has consistent premises, the falsity of at least one premise will be forced by
    each truth-value combination that makes the conclusion false.' If a valid argument has
    inconsistent premises, at least one premise will be forced false by the inconsistency of
    the premises. Thus, whether the premises are consistent or not, at least one premise will
    be forced false for (but not necessarily by) each false conclusion.
    
    To prove an argument valid using Steps 2, 3, and 4, one makes a premise true in all
    possible ways. Either the conclusion will be forced true for each way in which the prem-
    ises are all true, or at least one premise will be false for each such truth-value combination
    (i.e., the premises are inconsistent).
    
    Thus, even when the STTT requires multiple lines, the validity of a valid argument
    will be proved by forced truth-value assignments.
    
    How does one prove an argument with a multiply false conclusion to be invalid?
    
    The invalidity of an argument with consistent premises is proved if, for any false con-
    clusion, no premise is forced to be false by truth-value assignments that make the conclu-
    sion false."
    
    But this does not prove the invalidity of an argument, for the truth-value assignments
    that make the conclusion false may not force any premise to be false if a valid argument
    has inconsistent premises. For example, we can make the conclusion of the following argu-
    ment (see Sections 9.10 and 9.13) false
    
    (P,): S
    (P,): ~S
    
    and this will not force a premise to be false. And yet the argument is valid.
    
    Thus, the only way to prove invalidity is to actually construct a truth-table line in
    which all of the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
    
    When an invalid argument has a conclusion that is false in multiple ways and all of
    its premises are true in multiple ways, we make unforced truth-value assignments to con-
    struct all false conclusions (i.e., the C-Sequence) or all true premises (i.e., the P-Sequence).

    In such a case, we need to set up for a multiple-line shorter truth table. To construct a
    truth-value combination on which the premises are all true and the conclusion is false,
    we apply Maxims II], IV, and V in a systematic way.
    
    The following three examples show the difference between cases in which forced
    truth-value assignments yield an answer (Example 1) and cases in which forced truth-
    value assignments do not yield an answer (Examples 2 and 3).
    
    The third example also shows that one may reach a point where no false premise
    is forced and where there are no more forced truth-value assignments. In such a case, one
    must first employ Maxim IV and make the left-most premise true. To do so, one employs
    Maxim V and works out the ways in which that premise can be true, and one begins with
    the first such truth-value combination. If the first such truth-value combination does not
    make all of the premises true, one must try the second such truth-value combination, and so on.
    
    Example 1
    Consider, first, the following argument.
    
    (P,): MD (ND O)
    (P,): ND (M2 O)
    ~(MVN)DO
    
    STEP 1: Determine Whether Any Premise Is True in
    Fewer Ways than the Conclusion Is False
    
    The conclusion is a conditional, which is false only if its antecedent is true and its con-
    sequent is false. Its antecedent, however, is a disjunction of simple statements, which
    can be true in three ways: T V F, FV T, and F V FE. Thus, the conclusion can be false in
    three ways. Considering now the premises, the first premise is true if its antecedent
    is false, and it is also true if its antecedent is true and its consequent is true. Since its
    consequent can be true in three ways (i.e., FD T, FD F, T 5 T), the entire premise can
    be true in four ways. Premise 2, whose structure is similar to Premise 1, can also be
    true in four ways. Since the conclusion is false in only three ways and both premises
    are true in four ways, we begin by making the conclusion false in the three aforemen-
    tioned ways.
    
    STEP 2:: Make the Conclusion False
  - |-
    STEP 3.: Make as Many Premises True as Possible
    
    The truth-value assignments in line 1 immediately yield all true premises and a false
    conclusion.
    
    STEP 4: Test for Validity
    
    The fact that the premises are all true and the conclusion false for this set of truth-value
    assignments proves that this argument can have all true premises and a false conclusion,
    thereby proving that the argument is invalid in just one line!
    
    In cases with multiply false conclusions and multiply true premises, we are not
    always so lucky! The following two examples illustrate the STTT and the employment of
    Maxims III, IV, and V when we do not establish invalidity in the first line of a multiple-
    line truth table.
    
    Example 2
    
    (P.): (LD H)-(-QDS8)
    (LV Q)D (HVS)
    
    STEP 1: Determine Whether Any Premise Is True in
    Fewer Ways than the Conclusion Is False
    
    The conclusion of this argument is a conditional, so it is false only if its antecedent is
    true and its consequent is false. Its consequent, the disjunction H V S, is false in only one
    way (i.e., FV F), but its antecedent, the disjunction L V Q, is true in three ways (i.e., T V T,
    TV E andFV T). Thus, this conditional conclusion is false in three ways. The one premise
    is a conjunction of two conditionals, and each conditional is true in three ways. Since
    the premise is not true in fewer ways than the conclusion is false, we begin with Step 2,
    and make the conclusion false in the aforementioned three ways.
    
    STEP 2.: Make the Conclusion False

    In the first line of this shorter truth table, L is true and Q is true. Given, however, that
    H is false, L D H is false. It follows that the left conjunct of the conjunctive premise
    (LD H)- (~Q 2D S) is false, which means that the conjunctive premise is false.

    In line 2, both conjuncts of Premise 1, namely L D Hand ~Q 2 S, are false, which means
    that the premise is false.

    L is false and Q is true.

    Since L is false, L D His true. And since Q is true, ~ Q is false, which means that ~Q D Sis
    true. Thus, the premise is true because both of its conjuncts are true. We have made the
    premise true and the conclusion false, which demonstrates that this argument is invalid.
    
    Good students will notice that because H and S both must be false, to make the two
    conditionals of the premise true, we are forced to make Q true and L false. They will
    think, as a result, that this invalid argument only takes one line. Though there is some
    merit to this line of thinking, and to this way of proceeding, this is not a systematic
    method that will work in every case, and therefore it cannot be generalized to an STTT
    decision procedure.
  - |-
    The following case makes this clear.
    
    Example 3: The Conclusion Is a Biconditional of Two
    Simple Statements (Section 9.9, Exercise 24, p. 412)
    
    In the previous example, although we could not make all of the premises true on the first
    or second false conclusion, we were able to do so on the third false conclusion. In fact,
    on the third false conclusion, we executed Step 3, and made the premise true on forced
    truth-value assignments.
    
    It is not always the case, however, that some false conclusion will force all of the
    premises to be true. In this next case, we will see (a) that the premises are not all true on
    the first false conclusion, (b) that the second false conclusion does not force truth-value
    assignments to any other simple statements, and (c) that by following Maxims III-V in
    such a case we succeed in determining that the argument is invalid in an orderly and
    systematic manner.
    
    The following argument has a multiply false conclusion and multiply true premises.
    
    (P1): AD (BD ~C)
    (P2): (DD B)- (EDA)
    (P3): FV C
    
    (P4): GD ~H
    
    (P5): JD G)- (HD J)
    (P6): [=~D
    
    (P7): (BD A) -(~HDD)
    
    The complete truth table for this argument, which contains ten distinct simple state-
    ments, would have 2^10 or 1,024 rows. The STTT is executed for this argument, below, in
    three lines.
    
    STEP 1: Determine Whether Any Premise Is True in
    Fewer Ways than the Conclusion Is False
    
    There are two ways for the conclusion to be false: T = F and F = T. Since each premise is
    true in at least two ways, we start with Step 2...
    
    STEP 2: Make the Conclusion False
    
    Applying Maxim V, we first try the false conclusion, T = F.
    
    STEP 3: Make as Many Premises True as Possible
  - |-
    In the first line the conclusion is T = F: E is true and F is false. E is therefore true in
    Premise 2, and F is false in Premise 3. Given that E is true in Premise 2, the consequent
    of E > A, simple statement A, must be true for E 5 A to be true, for the conjunction that
    is Premise 2 to be true. If A is true in Premise 1, the consequent of Premise 1, B 5 ~C,
    must be true for Premise 1 to be true. The falsity of F in Premise 3 forces C to be true.
    However, if C is true in Premise 1, ~C is false, and so if B D ~C is to be true to make
    Premise 1 true, B must be false. Continuing, if B is false in Premise 2, D must be false
    in the left conjunct of Premise 2, making D > B, true. If D is false in Premise 6, J must
    be true in Premise 6. If J is true in J > G in Premise 5, G must be true. Since G is true in
    Premise 4, ~H must be true, which means H is false. Given that H is false, in Premise 7
    ~H is true and D is false, so ~H D D is false, and Premise 7, (B D H) - (~H D D), is false.
    This proves that when E is true and F is false, the premises cannot all be true, since
    Premise 7 is forced to be false.

    This does not prove that the argument is valid. It only shows that when E is true and
    F is false, the premises cannot all be true. It does not show that the premises cannot all
    
    Appendix C

    be true for any false conclusion. We must, therefore, check the second (and last) false
    conclusion, F = T.

    Since F is true in the conclusion, F is true in Premise 3, which makes Premise 3 true.
    Given that E is false in the conclusion, E D A is true in Premise 2.

    There are now no other truth-value assignments forced by the truth values in the conclusion.*
    
    Thus, to determine whether or not the argument is invalid, we must now system-
    atically use Maxim III: If there are no more forced truth-value assignments, select the
    premise that is true in the fewest ways, and execute the STTT following Maxims IV and V.
    
    It is easy to see that Premise 6, J = ~ D, is true in only two ways: I is true and D is
    false, and J is false and D is true. So we create lines 2 and 3 for the combination of the
    second false conclusion (i.e., when E is false and F is true) and the two ways in which
    I= ~D is true. In line 2, [= ~D is true because J is true and D is false; in line 3, [=~D
    is true because I is false and D is true.

    D in Premise 7 false, and it makes D D B true in Premise 2. Given that E is false, ED A is
    true, and Premise 2 is true.

    There are now two equally forced truth-value assignments: the truth of G forces us to make ~#H true in Premise 4, and the falsity of D forces us to make ~H false in Premises 7. Following Maxim IV, we make the left-most forced truth-value assignment first: we make ~H true in Premise 4, which makes H false in Premise 4, and also in Premise 7 and Premise 5.

    On these forced truth-value assignments, Premises 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are true, but
    Premise 7 is forced to be false. This means that when the conclusion is false on F=T, and
    = ~D is true because / is true and D is false, we cannot make all of the premises true.
    
    This brings us to the second and /ast way in which Premise 6 is true for a F = T con-
    clusion: I is false and D is true. We begin, of course, by making E false in Premise 2 and
    F true in Premise 3 (i.e., the second way the conclusion can be false). If E is false, E> A
    is true, and if F is true, F V C is true. Since J is true in Premise 5, JD Gis true. And since
    Dis true in Premise 7, ~H D D is true.

    The truth of D forces us to make B true in Premise 2, in order to make D D B true.
    This makes Premise 2 true. And since B is true in Premise 2, B must be true in Premise 1.

    The truth of H in the left conjunct of Premise 7 forces the truth of H in the right conjunct of Premise 7, which makes ~H false. Since H is true, H must be true in Premise 5, which forces J to be true, which in turn makes Premise 5 true.

    At this juncture, Premises 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are all true. We have not had to assign forced truth-values to A or to C. We must therefore make unforced truth-value assignments to make Premise 1 true. Following Maxim IV and Maxim V, we start with the left-most statement, statement A, and make it true. To make Premise 1 true, given the truth of B, we must make ~C true, which makes C false in Premise 1 and Premise 3.

    STEP 4: Test for Validity
    
    We are done! We have made all of the premises true and the conclusion false. This proves that the argument is invalid.
    
    Summary of This Exercise
    
    First Line: Conclusion: T = F. All other truth-value assignments are forced. Premise 7 is forced to be false.
    
    Second Line: Conclusion: F = T. Premise 6, [ = ~D, is made true in the first of two ways: I is true and D is false. This forces Premise 7 to be false.
  - |-
    Third Line: Conclusion: F = T. Premise 6, J = ~D, is made true in the second of two
    ways: I is false and D is true. Forced truth-value assignments make Premises 2-7 true.
    We then apply Maxim IV and Maxim V, and make the left-most statement of Premise 1,
    statement A, true. We are able to make Premise 1 true, given the truth of B, by making
    ~C true (and C false). This makes all of the premises true and the conclusion false, prov-
    ing the argument to be invalid.
    
    The reader may ascertain that the following three sets of truth-value combinations
    make all of the premises true and the conclusion false.
    
    A B C D E F G H | J
    T T F T F T F T F T
    F T T T F T F T F T
    F T F T F T F T F T
    The first of these is the solution arrived at via the STTT.
    
    A B C D E F G H | J
    T T F T F T F T F T
    
    If Maxims IV and V are followed carefully, the STTT procedure will not yield the sec-
    ond and third solutions. Maxim IV instructs us to try to make Premise 1, A D (BD ~C),
    true beginning with A and the truth value true. We next assign the truth value true to C,
    but this makes A 5 (B 5 ~C) false given that B is true. Following Maxim V, we next make
    A true and C false, which succeeds in making Premise 1 true. If, therefore, we execute the
    STTT carefully and correctly, we will not need to consider the truth-value combinations
    FTT or FTF for A, B, and C in Premise 1. Obviously, a student can get these solutions by
    trying other ways to make Premise 1 true. In the authors' opinion, if a student does not
    know how to execute the STTT decision procedure systematically, checking each truth-
    value combination systematically, the student may not learn how to find a proof of
    invalidity (or validity) for more difficult arguments.
    
    End Notes
  - |-
    1 Interestingly, if one determines, using the STTT, that a false conclusion does not force at least
    one premise to be false, it follows that the argument is unsound and nondemonstrative. This is
    because, if no premise is forced to be false by a false conclusion, either the argument is invalid
    (and unsound) or the argument is valid because of inconsistent premises (in which case the
    argument is unsound).
    
    2 If an argument has a tautological conclusion and all tautological premises, no premise will
    be forced to be false, but in that case the conclusion cannot be false, which already proves
    that the argument is valid. See Section 9.13: Sound Arguments and Demonstrative Arguments
    Distinguished.
    
    3 This proves that either the argument is invalid or it is valid because its premises are inconsistent. Please
    see Section 9.13 for a discussion of inconsistent premises, tautological conclusions, validity,
    soundness, and demonstrativeness. If one applies the STTT Step 1(a) and makes a contingent
    conclusion false, and no premise is forced false, one thereby proves that the argument is unsound
    and, therefore, nondemonstrative.

    Admission Tests
    
    A number of high-level tests of cognitive aptitude rely upon some of the opera-
    tions covered in this book. The GRE (Graduate Record Examination), the LSAT (Law
    School Admission Test), the MAT (Miller Analogies Test), and the GMAT (Graduate
    Management Admission Test), as well as several IQ tests, rely heavily upon the ability
    to process information in ways that have been detailed herein.
    
    Guide to the Graduate Record
    Examination (GRE)
    
    The GRE is a test of great complexity. It consists of a verbal and a quantitative section,
    as well as analytical writing. The verbal section includes tests of reading comprehension,
    sentence completion, vocabulary (usually tested by identifying synonyms and anto-
    nyms), and analogies. The quantitative section tests the ability to solve problems of a
    basic mathematical nature. The only section that concerns us here is the verbal section,
    and in that, the analogies subtest. Analogies were covered at length in Chapter 11.
    
    In analogy tests, the basic structure is made explicit, making it easy to isolate and
    identify relationships. The various types of analogies given include:

    The structure is of the form A:B::C:D, which is read "A is to B as C is to D." To solve problems of these sorts, the relationship between the first pair of words has to be identified. Then, among the options provided, the pair of words exhibiting the analogous relationship has to be identified. All options should be read; if more than one seems plausible, look for the one that most precisely expresses the relationship sought. More than the meanings of the individual words is involved: connotations, nuances, secondary meanings, and contextual information may be significant. For example, "right" can mean direction, or a political concept, or an ethical judgment. "Embroider" could relate to fabric, or could be used metaphorically, to suggest exaggeration.

    The LSAT consists of tests of reading comprehension, as well as tests of the ability to  
    perceive and analyze complex relationships. Moreover, these tests purport to assess  
    one's ability to think critically, detect fallacies, identify analogical relationships, rea-  
    son logically, and evaluate the evidence adduced in support of the conclusions of an  
    argument.  
    
    Some of what is classified under "Logical Reasoning" involves constructing hypo-  
    thetical deductive arguments in conjunction with recombinations of the provided infor-  
    mation. This type of problem was analyzed in Section 2.4 in this book.  
    
    The following examples are from the Logical Reasoning Practice Tests, available  
    online at www.testprepreview.com  
    
    A chess tournament is occurring in the local community school, and the players  
    at all four of the tables are engaged in their fourth game against their respective  
    opponents.  
    
    The players with white pieces are: David, Gerry, Lenny and Terry  
    
    The players with black pieces are: Don, Mike, Ritchie and Stephen  
    
    The scores are 3:0, 2.5:0.5, 2:1, 1.5:1.5  
    
    [note: tied games result in a score of 0.5 points for each player]  
    
    Lenny is playing at the table to the right of Stephen, who has lost all of his games  
    until now.  
    
    Gerry is playing against Mike.

    Many of the Analytical Reasoning subtests entail determining which statement
    would strengthen (render more probable) or weaken (render less probable) an inductive
    argument. Others involve selecting, from a set of possible choices, a conclusion that
    can be validly deduced from the premises embedded in a short paragraph. Still others
    require identification of those tacit assumptions underlying a given argument's conclu-
    sion, while others require interpretation of conclusions provided.

    What is the assumption made by this ad?
    
    a. It's not hard to tell domestic water from imported water based on its flavor.  
    The majority of spring water is bottled at its source.

    Passage for Question 1
    
    A medical clinic has a staff of five doctors—Drs. Albert, Burns, Calogero, Defeo, and
    Evans. The national medical society sponsors exactly five conferences, which the clinic's
    doctors attend, subject to the following constraints:
    If Dr. Albert attends a conference, then Dr. Defeo does not attend it.
    
    If Dr. Burns attends a conference, then either Dr. Calogero or Dr. Defeo, but not both,
    attends it.
    
    If Dr. Calogero attends a conference, then Dr. Evans does not attend it.
    
    If Dr. Evans attends a conference, then either Dr. Albert or Dr. Burns, but not both,
    attends it.
    
    Question 1
    
    If Dr. Burns attends one of the conferences, then which one of the following could be
    a complete and accurate list of the other members of the clinic who also attend that
    conference?

    Drs. Albert and Defeo
    Drs. Albert and Evans
    Drs. Calogero and Deteo

    Explanation for Question 1
    
    This question requires you to determine, from the conditions given, which doctors can
    attend the same conferences. The question tells us that "Dr. Burns attends one of the
    conferences," and we are asked to choose the response that could be a list of only those
    doctors who attend the conference with Dr. Burns. Since we are asked what could be a
    "complete and accurate list" of those doctors who attend the conference with Dr. Burns,
    we can eliminate as incorrect those responses that are either inaccurate (that is, cannot
    be true) or incomplete (that is, do not include everyone who must accompany one or
    more of the doctors going to the conference). This can be determined easily without the
    use of a diagram.

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    Response (a) states that, along with Dr. Burns, Drs. Albert and Defeo also attend the
    conference. But the first condition tells us that "if Dr. Albert attends a conference,
    then Dr. Defeo does not attend it." So, Drs. Burns, Albert, and Defeo cannot all
    attend the same conference. Response (a), then, is incorrect.
    
    Response (b) is incorrect for a similar reason. The fourth condition tells us what
    must be true if Dr. Evans attends a conference, namely, that "either Dr. Albert or
    Dr. Burns, but not both, attends it." Since we know that Dr. Burns attends the con-
    ference, we know that it cannot be true that both Drs. Albert and Evans also attend
    that conference.
    
    Response (c) is also incorrect. The second condition tells us what must be true if
    Dr. Burns attends a conference. Since we know that Dr. Burns does attend the confer-
    ence, we also know that "either Dr. Calogero or Dr. Defeo, but not both, attends it."
    
    Responses (d) and (e) must be evaluated slightly differently. No condition rules out
    Dr. Burns's and Dr. Defeo's going to the same conference—response (d)—and no
    condition forbids Dr. Evans's going with Dr. Burns to a conference—response (e).
    But recall that the question asks for what could be a "complete and accurate list"
    of the doctors who attend the conference with Dr. Burns. We know from the sec-
    ond condition that at least one other person must accompany Dr. Burns, and that
    
    Appendix D
    
    Appendix D
    
    among those who accompany Dr. Burns is either Dr. Calogero or Dr. Defeo. Since
    the conditions do not require anyone to accompany Dr. Defeo, it is possible that
    Dr. Defeo is the only person to accompany Dr. Burns. Thus, response (d) is an
    accurate response, in that it is possible that Drs. Burns and Defeo attend the same
    conference, and it is a complete response, in that Drs. Burns and Defeo could be the
    only doctors of the five to attend the conference. So response (d) is correct.

     Response (e) is incorrect because we know that if Dr. Burns goes, someone other than
    Dr. Evans must also go. Response (e) then is incomplete. It fails to list at least one
    doctor who we know must also accompany Dr. Burns.
    
    This is a question of "moderate difficulty"; 60 percent of those who took the LSAT
    on which it appeared answered it correctly. The most common error was selecting
    response (b) (chosen by 17 percent).

    As with many problems involving relative rank or order, the test taker should attempt to
    diagram the various relationships given in the stimulus.
    
    In what follows, each partner's name is abbreviated by its first letter, and the symbol ">"
    indicates that the person whose initial appears to the left of the sign has a greater salary
    than that of the person whose initial is to the right of the sign. So, for instance, "K > L"
    means "Kohn's salary is greater than Lopez's."
    
    The conditions indicate the following eight relative orderings of salary:
    
    1. K > I
    2. K > L
    3. L > N
    4. I > F
    5. F > M
    6. M > G
    7. G > J
    8. J > H
    
    It should be obvious that if person A's salary is greater than person B's and if person
    B's salary is greater than person C's, then person A's salary is also greater than person C's.
    Using this principle, we may combine and condense several of the above orderings into
    two separate "chains" of relative order:
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    9. K > I > F > M > G > J > H (This combines [1], and [4] through [8].)  
    10. K > L > N (This combines [2] and [3].)
    
    We are now in a position to determine the correct response for the question. The  
    test taker is asked to determine the minimum number of partners whose salaries must  
    be lower than that of Lopez, if Malloy and Nassar earn the same salary. Assuming that  
    Malloy's and Nassar's salaries are equal allows us to infer from chains (9) and (10) the  
    following chain of relative ordering:
    
    11. K > L > (N, M) > G > J > H.
    
    Chain (11) shows that since M and N have the same salary, anyone whose salary is  
    less than M's also has a salary that is less than N's, and therefore also less than L's. So,  
    at least Malloy, Nassar, Glassen, Jacoby, and Hae must have lower salaries than Lopez.  
    This shows that response options (a) and (b) are both incorrect. If we can now show that  
    no partner other than these five must have lower salaries than Lopez, then we will have  
    shown that (c) is the correct response.
    
    To see that there could be fewer than six partners with lower salaries than Lopez, one  
    need merely look at (9) and (10) above to see that as long as Inman and Fox have lower  
    salaries than Kohn, they could have salaries equal to or higher than Lopez's. This allows  
    us to construct the following possible complete chain of relative order:
    
    12. K > I > F > L > (N, M) > G > J > H.
    
    In this possible case no more than five partners have lower salaries than Lopez, and  
    since there must be at least five such partners, five is the minimum number of such  
    partners. (c) is therefore the correct response. This is considered an item of "middle  
    difficulty."

    Questions of this type are essentially mathematical in nature, involving the use of
    such relations as "greater than" and "less than." This and the previous test item come
    under the heading of "analytical reasoning," but the type of analyses required is not very
    sophisticated. No semantic or linguistic analysis is involved, no analysis of the meaning
    of concepts is involved, no causal analysis is called for, and the logical operations tend to
    be mechanically combinatorial in nature. Such items are easier to design and score, but
    require little in the way of deep understanding of abstract concepts or original thought
    processes, and do not even assess the types of analyses or reasoning performed by scien-
    tists and philosophers, let alone people in most other professions.

    Guide to the Miller Analogies Test (MAT)
    
    The Miller's Analogies Test or MAT is a test comprising 120 analogies (only 100 of which
    are scored) which are administered during a 60-minute time period. The MAT website
    provides the following description: "The MAT tests high-level mental ability by requiring
    those taking the test to solve problems stated as analogies."
    
    Psychologists who study human intelligence and reasoning have found that a per-
    son's performance on an analogies test represents one of the best measures of their verbal
    comprehension and analytical thinking. Since analytical thinking is critical for success in
    both graduate school and professional life, performance on the MAT can provide insight
    into a candidate's aptitude in these areas.
    
    The test contains analogies with content from various academic subjects. MAT scores
    help graduate schools identify candidates whose knowledge and abilities go beyond the
    mere memorization and recitation of information.
    
    You will find some similarities between what was covered in the analogies section of
    the GRE, above, with what is found on the MAT.
    
    Examples (from Kaplan Miller Analogies Test, 3rd Edition):
    
    BOLOGNA:COLD CUT::PARFAIT: (a. banana, b. dessert, c. pastrami, d. entree)
    
    As bologna is a type of cold cut, and a parfait is a type of dessert, the correct
    response is b.
    However, in
    
    RENEGADE:INTROVERT::LOYAL: (a. gregarious, b. steadfast, c. treacherous,
    d. withdrawn)
  - |-
    The relationship sought is between "renegade" and "loyal," which are antonyms; hence,
    the antonymous relationship between "introvert" and the choices offered is with
    "gregarious."
    
    Finally, the absent word need not be the last in the sentence. It could be any word.
    
    1. FRAGILE: (a. brittle, b. spoiled, c. sturdy, d. malleable) ::BREAK:MOLD
    Answer: d.

    Guide to the Graduate Management
    Admission Test (GMAT)
    
    The GMAT consists of an analytical writing assignment, a quantitative section, and a
    verbal section. The first two sections are not within our purview here. The verbal section
    consists of sentence correction, which is grammatical-linguistic in character; reading
    comprehension, which is self-explanatory; and critical reasoning. It is with critical rea-
    soning that we are concerned.
    
    There are several different types of test items. These include:
    
    1. Assumption questions
    2. Strengthen or Weaken questions
    3. Inference questions
    
    In assumption questions, the reader is asked to state what tacit premise, or what miss-
    ing conclusion, is being assumed in a given passage. This was addressed in Section 7.5 on
    enthymemes.
    
    In "Strengthen or Weaken" questions, just as in the LSAT discussed above, the task is
    to determine which statement would render an inductive argument more or less probable.
    
    Other items assess the ability to detect fallacies. This was addressed in Chapter 4.
    
    Finally, items are provided that test one's ability to identify as inductive or deductive
    the arguments presented, and to identify the methods of inference. These include Mill's
    methods and parallel argument forms.
    
    Examples (from the Kaplan GMAT Test):
    
    Directions: Select the best answer for each question.
    
    1. In Los Angeles, a political candidate who buys saturation radio advertising will get
    maximum name recognition.
    The statement above logically conveys which of the following?
    
    a. Radio advertising is the most important factor in political campaigns in Los
    Angeles.
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    b. Maximum name recognition in Los Angeles will help a candidate win a higher percentage of votes cast in the city.
    
    c. Saturation radio advertising reaches every geographically distinct sector of the voting population in Los Angeles.
    
    d. For maximum name recognition, a candidate need not spend on media channels other than radio advertising.
    
    e. A candidate's record of achievement in the Los Angeles area will do little to affect his or her name recognition there.
    
    Answer: d. From the statement given, it follows that such advertising is sufficient for maximum name recognition without spending on other media. We cannot infer from that premise any of the other statements provided.
    
    2. The extent to which a society is really free can be gauged by its attitude toward artistic expression. Freedom of expression can easily be violated in even the most outwardly democratic of societies. When a government arts council withholds funding from a dance performance that its members deem "obscene," the voices of a few bureaucrats have in fact censored the work of the choreographer, thereby committing the real obscenity of repression.
    
    Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument above?
    
    a. Members of government arts councils are screened to ensure that their beliefs reflect those of the majority.
    
    b. The term "obscenity" has several different definitions that should not be used interchangeably for rhetorical effect.
    
    Appendix D
    
    c. Failing to provide financial support for a performance is not the same as actually preventing or inhibiting it.
    
    d. The council's decision could be reversed if the performance were altered to conform to public standards of appropriateness.
    
    e. The definition of obscenity is something on which most members of society can agree.
    
    Answer: c. The passage equates the withholding of funding with censorship. (c) denies that equation, which destroys the argument. (a) is irrelevant—the definition offered by the passage is not contingent upon what anyone thinks. (b) challenges the use of the word "obscenity," but the term under consideration is "censorship." (d) misses the point entirely, and reaffirms the author's position. (e) also invokes majority opinion, but this is beside the point.

    3. Ronald is a runner on the track team and is a great hurdler. All runners on the track  
    team are either sprinters or long-distance runners, but a few long-distance runners  
    do not run the sprint because they are not fast enough. Hurdlers never run long  
    distance because they lack the necessary endurance. Therefore, Ronald must be fast.
    
    For the conclusion drawn above to be logically correct, which of the following  
    must be true?
    
    Sprinters are faster than hurdlers.  
    All runners on the track team who run hurdles also run long distance.  
    Hurdling requires more endurance than running long distance.  
    All sprinters are fast.  
    Every runner on the track team who is fast is a sprinter.
    
    Answer: d. We are given that Ronald is a hurdler, and that all runners are either sprint-  
    ers or long-distance runners. No hurdlers are long-distance runners. Therefore Ronald  
    must be a sprinter, and if all sprinters are fast, Ronald must be fast.
    
    (a) makes no sense because we know all hurdlers are sprinters; (b), (c), and (e) all  
    contradict propositions in the argument.
    
    IQ Tests
    
    Various tests of intelligence employ deductive inference and/or analogical reasoning as  
    part of their content.
    
    The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, among many other such tests, includes anal-  
    ogy items among its subtests, as well as opposite analogies and reasoning items.
    
    The Concept Mastery Test, written by Lewis Terman to assess extremely high levels  
    of cognitive ability, includes 75 analogy problems.
    
    The Cattell Test of Crystallized Intelligence used by Mensa contains figure analogies  
    and reasoning items. And the Cattell test of fluid intelligence (the Culture Fair, Scales 2  
    and 3), while nonverbal, relies upon the ability to infer the correct response to problems  
    based upon perceived patterns of relationships.
    
    In sum, reasoning, of one sort or another, lies at the core of aptitude and intelligence  
    testing.

    Step (1) to step (2) is invalid: (1) asserts the falsehood of an I proposition;  
    (2) asserts the truth of its corresponding O proposition. In the traditional interpretation, corresponding I and O propositions are subcontraries and cannot both be false. Therefore, if the I proposition in (1) is false, the O proposition in (2) would have to be true, in that interpretation. But because both I and O propositions do have existential import, both can be false (in the Boolean interpretation) if the subject class is empty. The subject class is empty in this case, because there are no mermaids. Hence the inference from the falsehood of (1) to the truth of (2) is invalid. Corresponding I and O propositions are not subcontraries in the Boolean interpretation, but the inference from (1) to (2) assumes that they are.

    Minor premise: Some Republicans are not conservatives.  
    
    This syllogism, written in standard form:  
    All advocates of high tariff rates are Republicans. Some Republicans are not conservatives.  
    
    Therefore some conservatives are not advocates of high tariff rates.  
    
    The three propositions of this syllogism are, in order: A, O, O. The middle term, "Republicans," is the predicate term of the major premise and the subject term of the minor premise, so the syllogism is in the fourth figure. Thus its mood and figure are AOO-4.

    Plainly this is possible in the first figure, where AII-1, which is valid, has only
    one term distributed, and that term only once. It also is possible in the third
    figure, where AII-3 (as well as IAI-3) are valid and also have only one term dis-
    tributed, and distributed only once. It also is possible in the fourth figure, where
    IAI-4, which is valid, has only one term distributed, and distributed only once.
    But where the middle term is the predicate term of both premises, in the second
    figure, it is not possible. Consider: To avoid breaking Rule 2, which requires that
    the middle term be distributed in at least one premise, one of the premises in
    this figure must be negative. But then, by Rule 5, the conclusion would have
    to be negative and would distribute its predicate. Thus, if only one term can be
    distributed only once, in the second figure that would have to be in the conclu-
    sion; but if the distributed term can be distributed only once, that would break
    Rule 3, because if it is distributed in the conclusion it must be distributed in the
    premises.

    None. If the middle term were distributed in both premises, then, in the first figure, the minor premise would have to be negative, whence (by Rule 5) the conclusion would have to be negative, so by Rule 3 the major premise would have to be negative, in violation of Rule 4. In the second figure, both premises would have to be negative, in violation of Rule 4. In the third figure both premises would have to be universal, so the minor premise would have to be negative by Rule 3, and by Rule 5 the conclusion would be negative—so by Rule 3 the major premise would also have to be negative, in violation of Rule 4. In the fourth figure the major premise would have to be negative. Therefore (by Rule 5) the conclusion would have to be negative (E or O) and it would distribute its major term, which means (by Rule 3) that the major premise would also have to distribute its major term and would therefore be universal (an E proposition). The minor premise also must be universal, since it distributes the middle term, and by Rule 4 it cannot be negative, so it must be the A proposition: All M is S. Now Rule 6 precludes the possibility of an O proposition in the conclusion, and Rule 3 precludes the possibility of an E.

    Very easy to go between the horns here. Plausible to grasp by either horn.
    Impossible to go between the horns. It is plausible to grasp it by either horn,
    arguing either (a) that when desiring to preserve we may be motivated simply
    by inertia and seek to rest in the status quo, even while admitting that a change
    would not be worse and might even be better—but just "not worth the trouble
    of changing" or (b) that when desiring to change we may be motivated simply
    by boredom with the status quo, and seek a change even while admitting that
    a change might not be better and might even be worse—but "let's have a little

    variety." These are psychological rather than political or moral considerations,
    but the original dilemma appears to be itself psychological. The usual rebutting
    counterdilemma could be used here: When desiring to preserve, we do not wish to
    bring about something better; when desiring to change, we do not wish to prevent
    a change to the worse. It is a question, however, how plausible this is.
    
    There were in theory a number of ways to go between the horns here: Between
    defiance and obedience to the Court decision there are many degrees of par-
    tial compliance that fall short of full obedience but do not constitute outright
    defiance. Either horn could be grasped, at least in theory: An emergency situa-
    tion in the international sphere might prevent defiance from being followed by
    impeachment; and it is logically possible that the evidence produced by obedi-
    ence to the order might not have been sufficient to persuade the Congress to
    impeach.
  - |-
    This is a rather informal version of Pascal's argument, which has been much discussed for more than three hundred years. If it is interpreted as having the disjunctive premise that either God exists or God does not exist, then it is obviously impossible to go between the horns. But each of the horns can be grasped to refute the given argument. It might be argued that if you live a life of conspicuous virtue even though you are not a believer, you will be condemned to spend eternity in the flames of Hell. Or it might be argued that if you live as a believer you will suffer the loss of all those earthly pleasures that you might otherwise have enjoyed, and that that is a very grave penalty indeed.

    The conclusion I is false. Premise 3, E, is true. Since E is true, E V F is true, which
    means that Premise 1 is true only if G- H is true. That forces G to be true and H to be
    true. In turn, this makes G V H true, which, given the falsity of I, makes Premise 2 false.
    The argument is valid.
    
    5. This Example is in the Introduction of the Section 9.9 and is tested using the CTTM
    in Section 8.7 of Chapter 8.

    If we replace statement variables p, g, rand s in the foregoing argument form with simple
    statements T, U, V and W, respectively, we get the following argument.
    
    (P,): TD U- V)
    (P,): (UV V) DW
    . TOW
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any premise is true in fewer ways than the conclusion is
    false.
    
    The conclusion is the conditional T > W, which is false in only one way, when T is
    true and W is false. Since no premise can be true in fewer ways, we proceed with Steps 2,
    3, and 4...
    
    STEP 2: Make the conclusion false.
    
    The conclusion is the conditional, T > W, so we begin by placing an F under the
    horseshoe in TD W.
    
    Solutions to Selected Exercises
    
    The conclusion, T > W, can be false in only one way: its antecedent T is true and its
    consequent W is false. We must, therefore, make these forced truth-value assignments
    to T and W in the conclusion.
    
    (U - Vv) , (JU V V)
    
    As soon as we make T true and W false in the conclusion, we must make the same consistent
    truth-value assignments to T and to W wherever else they occur. T occurs in Premise 1 and
    W occurs in Premise 2.
    
    STEP 3: Make As Many Premises True as Possible.
    
    Following Maxim I, are there any other forced truth-value assignments?
  - |-
    Yes, there are two such forced truth-value assignments: (1) given that the consequent of Premise 2 is false, Premise 2 can only be true if its antecedent is false; and (2) given the antecedent of Premise 1 is true, Premise 1 can only be true if its consequent is true. Given that these are equally forced truth-value assignments, we apply Maxim III and make the left-most forced truth-value assignment, to U - V, first.
    
    (U - vv), (JU V V)
    
    If the conjunction U - V in Premise 1 is true, both U and V must be true, so we make them true in Premise 1.
    
    As always, we must make the same truth-value assignments to U and V wherever else they occur. They both occur in Premise 2.
    
    These truth-value assignments to U and V in Premise 2 make the disjunction, UV V, in Premise 2 true.
    
    And if UV V is true and W is false, Premise 2 is false.

    Solutions to Selected Exercises
    
    STEP 4: Test for Validity.
    
    In making forced truth-value assignments to T and W in the conclusion, then to U and V in Premise 1, and then to U and V in Premise 2, we are able to make the conclusion false and Premise 1 true, but Premise 2 is false. Given that these are the only truth-value assignments on which the conclusion is false and Premise 1 is true, we have proved that the argument cannot have all true premises and a false conclusion, which proves that the argument is valid.
    
    10. The STTT for a Conclusion that is False on Numerous Truth-Value Assignments
    Contrast the following argument with the argument of Appendix A.
    
    (P,): ADG
    
    (P,): BVA
    
    (P,): B
    
    (P,): H
    .(G-AVU-S)
    
    As with the similar-looking argument in Appendix A, this argument would require a complete truth table of 64 lines. And if we incorrectly apply Step 2. and make the conclusion false first, the STTT would require nine lines if the argument is valid. Unlike the argument of Appendix A, however, we cannot easily see a way to prove this argument valid.

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    STEP 1: Determine whether any premise is true in fewer ways than the conclusion
    is false.
    
    As with the argument of Appendix A, we first determine that Premise 3 (i.e., B)
    and Premise 4 (i.e., H) are each true for only one combination of truth values for their
    constituent simple statement(s), and so, following Step 2, and Maxims II and III, we
    first make a forced truth-value assignment to simple statement B and then to simple
    statement H.
    
    STEP 2: Make all of the premises true.
    
    In this case, we have chosen to first make all of the premises true because we know
    that there are two forced truth-value assignments to simple statements in the premises:
    Premise 3 is true only if B is true and Premise 4 is true only if H is true.
    
    The truth of B in Premise 2, makes Premise 2, the disjunction B V A, true.
    
    Solutions to Selected Exercises
    
    At this juncture, are there any more forced truth-value assignments? No. For that reason,
    we make the left-most truth-value assignment first, making Premise 1, A → G, true. Since
    there are three ways for A → G to be true (T → T, F → T, and F → P), we apply Maxim IV
    and first make A true and G true.
    
    This makes all four premises true, but the truth of G makes G → H true, which makes the
    conclusion true.
    
    T T T O T T T T T T T T T T O T
    
    Thus, we must create a second line and, applying Maxim IV once more, we make
    Premise 1 true in the second way, namely by making A false and G true.

    Now all four premises are true. Since G is true in Premise 1, G must be made true in the
    conclusion, which makes G → H true, and the conclusion, (G → H) V (¬J), true.

    Again, we have failed to make all of the premises true and the conclusion false. Does  
    this prove that the argument is valid? No, for we have not yet checked every truth-value  
    combination that makes all of the premises true. We must once more apply Maxim IV  
    to Premise 1, and try the last truth-value combination on which Premise 1 is true: A is  
    false and G is false.
    
    Solutions to Selected Exercises
    
    Since G is false in Premise 1, G must be made false in the conclusion, which makes  
    G - H false.
    
    STEP 3: Make the Conclusion False.
    
    We have managed to make all of the premises true and the left disjunct of the con-  
    clusion false! If we can make the right disjunct of the conclusion false, we will thereby  
    prove that the argument is invalid.
    
    There are, of course, three ways to make the right disjunct of the conclusion,  
    I. J, false, and given that neither J nor J occurs elsewhere in the argument, we proceed  
    according to Maxim IV and make the first truth-value assignment that makes I - J false,  
    namely T- F.
    
    Now, finally, given that both disjuncts, G - H and I. J, are false, the conclusion,  
    (G-H)V (-J), is false.
    
    STEP 4: Test for validity.
    
    We are done. We made forced truth-value assignments to B and to H, and then to  
    make Premise 1 true, we applied Maxim IV and, on our third attempt, we made all four  
    premises true and the left disjunct of the conclusion false. It was then an easy matter to  
    make the right disjunct of the conclusion false, thereby making the conclusion false. Our  
    three-line shorter truth table has all true premises and a false conclusion, which  
    proves that this argument is invalid.
    
    By first making all of the premises true in this argument, the STTT is far more efficient  
    that the CTTM with 64 lines and it is much more efficient than making the conclusion  
    false first (Step 2..), which might require a nine-line shorter truth table (although the  
    invalidity of this argument would be revealed in line 2).
    
    15. (P,): AVD DU: (K- DI  
    (P,): 1
  - |-
    The conclusion is a conjunction, which is false in three ways. Premise 2 is simple statement J, which is true in one way. Therefore, we follow Step 2,: The truth of I forces J, K, and L to be true in Premise 1, which forces the conclusion to be true.
    
    This proves that the argument is valid.
    
    20. The Conclusion is a Complex Conjunction of One Simple Statement and a Complex
    Disjunction.
    
    (P,): [H- UV J] Vv [H- (KD ~D)|
    ~A-[UIV JV (KD ~D]
    
    The conclusion is false in three ways: T- F, F- T, and F- EF.
    The premise is true in three ways: T V T, TV F, and F V T. In each of these three ways,
    H must be true. But the right conjuncts of each disjunct can be false in multiple ways.
    
    So we apply Step 2...
    V . H
    T F F F F F T F T FO FT T F F F F F T F FT
    F F F FF T
    F oF F F F F F F T FO FT F oF F F F F T F FT
    
    For each false conclusion, T - F, F- T, and F - F, the premise is false. This proves that the
    argument is valid.

    The component events here are not independent, but in this case each success
    (in reaching the right house) increases rather than decreases the probability of
    the next success, because the number of available houses is fixed. After three
    men reach the correct house, the fourth (having to go to a different house)
    must succeed!
    
    The probability that all four students will identify the same tire may be cal-
    culated in two different ways—just as the solution to Exercise 6 in this same
    set may be reached in two different ways.

    Suppose that the first student, A, names the front left tire. The probability of his doing so, after having done so, is 1. Now the probability of the second student, B, naming that tire is 4, there being four tires all (from B's point of view) equipossibly the one that A had named. The same is true of student C, and of student D. Therefore, regardless of which tire A does happen to name (front left, or any other), the probability that all four students will name the same tire is 1 x 4 x 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16 or .016.
    
    The same result could be achieved by first specifying a particular tire (say, the front left tire) and asking: What is the probability of all four students naming that specified tire? This would be 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/4 = .004. But the condition specified in the problem, that all four name the same tire, would be satisfied if all named the front left, or if all named the front right, or if all named the rear left, or if all named the rear right tire. So, if we were to approach the problem in this way, we also would need to inquire as to the probability of either the one or the other of these four outcomes—a calculation requiring the addition theorem, explained in Section 14.2B, for alternative outcomes. Because the four successful outcomes are mutually exclusive, we can simply sum the four probabilities: .004 + .004 + .004 + .004 = .016. The two ways of approaching the problem must yield exactly the same result, of course.
    
    This dual analysis applies likewise to the three patients arriving at a building with five entrances, in Exercise 6. One may calculate 1 x 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16; or (using the addition theorem discussed in Section 14.2B,) one may calculate 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/5 = 1/80 and then add 1/80 + 1/80 + 1/80 + 1/80 + 1/80 = 5/80 = 1/16.

    Sum of the probabilities of the exclusive ways of the shooter's losing is *°'/9s  
    So the shooter's chance of winning is 1— *5'495 = ?*#/9s or .493.  
    
    Yes. You lose the bet only if you throw a 2, or a 3, or a 4, or a 5, on both rolls  
    of the die. On each throw, the chance of getting one of those four numbers  
    is "% or *4. The chance of losing the bet is therefore *4 x *4, or *. Your chance  
    of winning the bet, therefore, is 1-4 = %4 = .556.  
    
    Challenge to the Reader  
    
    This problem, which has been the focus of some controversy, may be analyzed  
    in two different ways.

    Solutions to Selected Exercises  
    
    First analysis:  
    
    a. There are 28 possible pairs in the abbreviated deck consisting of four kings  
    and four aces. Of these 28 possible pairs, only seven (equipossible) pairs  
    contain the ace of spades. Of these seven pairs, three contain two aces. If  
    we know that the pair drawn contains the ace of spades, the probability  
    that this pair contains two aces is */.  
    
    b. However, if we know only that one of the cards in the pair is an ace, we  
    know only that the pair drawn is one of the 22 (equipossible) pairs that  
    contain at least one ace. Of these 22 pairs, six contain two aces. Therefore,  
    if we know only that the pair contains an ace, the probability that the pair  
    drawn contains two aces is °/2 or "1.
  - |-
    In this first analysis, the probabilities in the two cases are different.
    
    Second analysis:
    
    a. If one of the cards of the pair drawn is known to be the ace of spades, there
    are seven other possible cards with which the pair may be completed. Of
    these seven, three are aces. Therefore, if we know that one of the cards
    drawn is the ace of spades, the probability that this pair contains two
    aces is 3/7.
    
    b. If we know only that one of the cards drawn is an ace, we know that it
    is either the ace of spades, or the ace of hearts, or the ace of diamonds,
    or the ace of clubs. If it is the ace of spades, the analysis immediately
    preceding applies, and the probability that this pair contains two aces
    is again 3/7.
    
    If the ace is the ace of hearts, the same analysis applies; as it does if the
    card drawn is the ace of diamonds, or the ace of clubs. Therefore, even if
    we know only that an ace is one of the cards drawn, the probability that
    the pair contains two aces remains 3/7.
    
    In this second analysis, the probabilities in the two cases are the same.
    Which of these two analyses do you believe to be correct? Why?

    But note: This was a very unusual set of circumstances!
    This problem requires only a straightforward use of the product theorem.
    The probability of selecting, at random, just those two cows out of four
    is the probability of selecting one of that pair on the first choosing (4),
    times the probability of selecting the other one of that pair on the second
    choosing, where the first already had been selected ('4). So the calculation
    is x'th=%,
    The calculation of the bettor's chances of winning on the "Don't Pass-Bar
    3" line is the probability of the player's losing when the game is played
    according to the normal rules, with the provision that he does not lose if he gets
    a 3 on the first roll. The probability of a 3 on the first roll is ?/6 or .056. The
    probability of the player losing on the normal rules is .507, as was shown in
    Section 14.2B. Therefore the probability of the player losing, barring the loss
    on a first-roll 3, is 507 — .056 = .451. Because this is the probability of the
    player's losing if he cannot lose by getting a 3 on the first roll, it is the prob-
    ability of the bettor winning on the "Don't Pass-Bar 3" line. So the expected
    value of a $100 bet on the "Don't Pass-Bar 3" line is .451 x $200 = $90.20.
    
    Note that this bet, which the house will gladly accept, is substantially less
    favorable to the bettor than simply betting on the pass line—that is, sim-
    ply betting on the player to win. The expected value of such a $100 wager
    (i.e., on the player to win according to normal rules) is .493 x $200 = $98.60.
    
    1 If, e.g., the antecedent of Premise 2 were a simple statement, we would make the forced truth-
    value assignment of true to the consequent of Premise 1 first, because that would force two truth-
    value assignments to simple statements U and V.

    Absorption: A rule of inference; one of nine elementary valid
    argument forms. If p implies q, absorption permits the
    inference that p implies both p and q. Symbolized as: p → q,
    therefore p → (p ∧ q), 337
    
    Abusive ad hominem argument, 107-09
    
    Accent: An informal fallacy, committed when a term or phrase
    has a meaning in the conclusion of an argument different
    from its meaning in one of the premises, the difference
    arising chiefly from a change in emphasis given to the words
    used, 132-34

    Accident: An informal fallacy, committed when a generalization  
    is applied to individual cases that it does not properly govern,  
    125. See also Converse accident

    inappropriate appeal to force is used to support the truth of  
    some conclusion, 110-11  
    
    Addition (Add.): A rule of logical inference, one of nine  
    elementary valid argument forms. Given any proposition p,  
    addition permits the inference that p or q. Also called "logical  
    addition," 338-39  
    
    Addition theorem: In the calculus of probability, a theorem  
    used to determine the probability of a complex event

    Ad hoc: A term with several meanings, used to characterize  
    hypotheses. It may mean only that the hypothesis was  
    constructed after the facts it purports to explain; it may  
    mean that the hypothesis is merely descriptive. Most  
    commonly, "ad hoc" is used pejoratively, describing a  
    hypothesis that serves to explain only the facts it was  
    invented to explain and has no other testable consequences,  
    568  
    
    Ad hominem (argument against the person): An informal  
    fallacy in which the object of attack is not the merits of some  
    position, but the person who takes that position, 107-10;  
    abusive, 107-09; circumstantial, 108-10  
    
    Ad ignorantiam (argument from ignorance): An informal  
    fallacy in which a conclusion is supported by an illegitimate  
    appeal to ignorance, as when it is supposed that something  
    is likely to be true because we cannot prove that it is false,  
    118-20  
    
    Ad misericordiam (appeal to pity): An informal fallacy  
    in which the support given for some conclusion is an  
    inappropriate appeal to the mercy or altruism of the  
    audience, 104-05

    Exceptive proposition: A proposition that asserts that all
    members of some class, with the exception of the members
    of one of its subclasses, are members of some other class.
    Exceptive propositions are in reality compound, because they
    assert both a relation of class inclusion, and a relation of
    class exclusion. Example: "All persons except employees are
    eligible" is an exceptive proposition in which it is asserted
    both that "All nonemployees are eligible," and that "No
    employees are eligible," 233-34, 261, 483-84, 489
    
    Excluded middle, Principle of: The principle that asserts that
    any statement is either true or false; sometimes called one of
    the laws of thought, 327-28, 330
    
    Exclusive disjunction or strong disjunction: A logical
    relation meaning "or," that may connect two component
    statements. A compound statement asserting exclusive
    disjunction says that at least one of the disjuncts is true and
    that at least one of the disjuncts is false. It is contrasted with
    an "inclusive" (or "weak") disjunction, which says that at
    least one of the disjuncts is true and that they may both be
    true, 269-70, 272, 277, 282
    
    Exclusive premises, Fallacy of: The formal fallacy that is
    committed when both premises in a syllogism are negative
    propositions (E or O), 207, 209, 223
    
    Exclusive propositions: Propositions that assert that the
    predicate applies exclusively to the subject named. Example:
    "None but generals wear stars" asserts that the predicate,
    "wearing stars," applies only to generals, 232
    
    Existential fallacy: Any mistake in reasoning that arises from
    assuming illegitimately that some class has members. It is a
    formal fallacy when, in a standard-form categorical syllogism,
    a particular conclusion is inferred from two universal
    premises, 178, 208-09

    Existential Generalization (E.G.): A rule of inference in the theory of quantification that says that from any true substitution instance of a propositional function we may validly infer the existential quantification of the propositional function, 473, 475, 489.
    
    Existential import: An attribute of those propositions that normally assert the existence of objects of some specified kind. Particular propositions (I and O propositions) always have existential import; thus the proposition "Some dogs are obedient" asserts that there are dogs. Whether universal propositions (A and E propositions) have existential import is an issue on which the Aristotelian and Boolean interpretations of propositions differ, 171-79, 186.
    
    Existential Instantiation (E.I.): A rule of inference in the theory of quantification that says that we may (with some restrictions) validly infer from the existential quantification of a propositional function the truth of its substitution instance with respect to any individual constant that does not occur earlier in that context, 473-74, 489.
    
    Existential presupposition: In Aristotelian logic, the blanket presupposition that all classes referred to in a proposition have members, 175-77.
    
    Existential quantifier: A symbol (∃) in modern quantification theory that indicates that any propositional function immediately following it has some true substitution instance; "∃x Fx" means "there exists an x such that F is true of it," 455, 457.
    
    Expectation value: In probability theory, the value of a wager or an investment; determined by multiplying each of the mutually exclusive possible returns from that wager by the probability of the return, and summing those products, 591-98.
    
    Explanation: A group of statements from which some event (or thing) to be explained can logically be inferred and whose acceptance removes or diminishes the problematic character of that event (or thing), 17-22; scientific vs. unscientific, 556-59, See also Scientific explanation.
    
    Exportation (Exp): The name of a rule of inference; an expression of logical equivalence that permits the mutual replacement of statements of the form (p → q) → r by statements of the form p → (q → r), 356, 358.

    Indirect proof: A proof that assumes, for the sake of the proof,
    the negation (e.g., ~ p) of the statement (e.g., p) that is to be
    proved, and then derives a contradiction from that assumption
    alone or from the conjunction of that assumption and
    premises. When a contradiction is deduced, the assumption is
    discharged and the negation of the assumption is deductively
    inferred. For example, if ~ p is assumed on its own scope line,
    then a contradiction of the form q - ~ g is deduced; then the
    assumption is discharged, and the negation of the original
    assumption, namely p, is deduced, 434-44

    Induction: One of the two major types of argument
    traditionally distinguished, the other being deduction. An
    inductive argument claims that its premises give only some
    degree of probability, but not certainty, to its conclusion,
    23-26; argument by analogy and, 497-503; defective, fallacies
    of, 118-24; distinction between deduction and, 23-27,

    Induction by simple enumeration: A type of inductive
    generalization, much criticized, where the premises are
    instances in which phenomena of two kinds repeatedly

    Justification Ledger: a column to the right of the statement column in a formal proof. For each statement in the statement column that is inferred, we write in the justification ledger the number(s) of the line or lines of the statements from which the statement is inferred, and the abbreviation of the rule of inference used to make the inference (e.g., "M.P." for Modus Ponens). If the statement is an assumption for a conditional proof or an indirect proof, we write, e.g., "/.. Q (Assumption C.P.)" in the justification ledger to indicate the statement to be inferred at the end of that subproof and the type of subproof to be executed (i.e., either "C.P." or "I.P."), 334, 342, 363, 420-21, 426, 438

    Two statements are materially equivalent when they are
    both true, or when they are both false—that is, when they
    have the same truth value. Materially equivalent statements
    always materially imply one another. "Material Equivalence"

    **Logic Overview I—Syllogistic Terms (see Chapter 6)**
    
    Every standard-form categorical syllogism has exactly three terms, to wit:
    
    - The major term is the predicate term of the conclusion (P).
    - The minor term is the subject term of the conclusion (S).
    - The middle term is the term appearing in both premises but not in the conclusion (M).
    
    The premise in which the major term appears is the major premise.
    
    The premise in which the minor term appears is the minor premise.
    
    A syllogism is in standard form when its three propositions are in exactly this order:
    major premise, minor premise, conclusion.
    
    Every proposition in a categorical syllogism must be one of the following four:
    
    - An A proposition—universal affirmative (e.g., All politicians are liars.)
  - |-
    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    An E proposition—universal negative (e.g., No politicians are liars.)
    
    An I proposition—particular affirmative (e.g., Some politicians are liars.)
    
    An O proposition—particular negative (e.g., Some politicians are not liars.)
    
    The mood of a syllogism is determined by the types of its three propositions, AAA, EIO, etc. The figure of a standard-form syllogism is determined by the position of its middle term:
    
    M P  
    P M  
    M P  
    P M  
    
    \ | | /  
    S M S M  
    first figure second figure third figure fourth figure
    
    1st: Middle term is the subject of the major premise and the predicate of the minor premise.
    2nd: Middle term is the predicate of both premises.
    3rd: Middle term is the subject of both premises.
    4th: Middle term is the predicate of the major premise and the subject of the minor premises.
    
    Logic Overview III—Valid Forms of the Categorical Syllogism
    
    (see Chapter 6)
    
    Any syllogistic form is completely determined by the combination of its mood and figure. There are exactly
    15 valid forms of the categorical syllogism, each with a unique name:
    
    In the first figure: In the second figure: In the third figure: In the fourth figure:
    AAA-1 Barbara  AEE-2 Camestres AII-3 Datisi AEE-4 Camenes
    EAE-1 Celarent EAE-2 Cesare IAI-3 Disamis AI-4 Dimaris
    AII-1 Darii AOO-2 Baroko EIO-3 Ferison EIO-4 Fresison
    
    EIO-1 Ferio EIO-2 Festino OAO-3 Bokardo
    
    ---
    
    Logic Overviews
    
    Rules governing every valid categorical syllogism:
    
    The syllogism must contain exactly three terms, used consistently.
    
    The middle term of the syllogism must be distributed in at least one premise.*
    
    If either term is distributed in the conclusion, it must be distributed in the premises.*
    A valid syllogism cannot have two negative premises.
    
    If either premise of the syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be negative.
    
    From two universal premises no particular conclusion may be drawn.

    *(Note: A term is distributed when the proposition in which the term appears refers to all members of the class to which the term refers. Thus, in the proposition "All humans are mortal" the term "humans" is distributed, but the term "mortal" is not.)

    1. **The Method of Agreement**: The one factor or circumstance that is common to all the cases of the phenomenon under investigation is likely to be the cause (or effect) of that phenomenon.
    
       - ABCD occur together with w x yz.  
       - AEF G occur together with wt u v.
    
    2. **The Method of Difference**: The one factor or circumstance whose absence or presence distinguishes all cases in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs from those cases in which it does not occur, is likely to be the cause, or part of the cause, of that phenomenon.
    
    ---
    
    **Logic Overviews**
    
    - ABCD occur together with w x y z.  
    - B C D occur together with x y z.  
    - Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or an indispensable part of the cause of w.
    
    3. **The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference**: The combination, in the same investigation, of the Method of Agreement and the Method of Difference.
    
    - ABC-xyz.  
    - ABC-xyz.  
    - ADE-xtw.  
    - BC-yz.  
    - Therefore A is the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable part of the cause, of x.

    4. The Method of Residues: When some portion of the phenomenon under examination is known to be the consequence of well-understood antecedent circumstances, we may infer that the remainder of that phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents.
    
    ABC-xyz.
    
    B is known to be the cause of y.

    5. The Method of Concomitant Variation: When the variations in one phenomenon are highly correlated with the variation in another phenomenon, one of the two is likely to be the cause of the other, or they may be related as the products of some third factor causing both.
    
    ABC-xyz.
    A+BC + yz.
    Therefore A and x are causally connected.

    Logic Overview Vill—Probability Calculations (see Chapter 14)
    
    To calculate the probability of the joint occurrence of two or more events:
    
    (A) If the events (say, a and b) are independent, the probability of their joint occurrence is the simple product of their probabilities: P(a and b) = P(a) x P(b).
    
    (B) If the events (say, a and b and c) are not independent, the probability of their joint occurrence is the probability of the first event, times the probability of the second event if the first occurred, times the probability of the third event if the second occurred, and so on: P(a and b and c) = P(a) x P(b if a) x P(c if both a and b).

    To calculate the probability of the alternative occurrence of two or more events:
    
    (A) If the events (say, a or b) are mutually exclusive, the probability of at least one of them occurring is the simple sum of their probabilities: P(a or b) = P(a) + P(b).
    
    (B) If the events (say, a or b or c) are not mutually exclusive, the probability of at least one of them occurring may be determined by either:
  - |-
    (1) analyzing the favorable cases into mutually exclusive events and summing the probabilities of those successful events; or
    
    (2) determining the probability that none of the alternative events will occur and subtracting that probability from 1.
