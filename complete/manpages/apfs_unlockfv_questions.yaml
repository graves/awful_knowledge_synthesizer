(This volume must have the System role, and\n     must be in a volume group with a locked Data volume.)  If path is not\n     provided, apfs_unlockfv will attempt to unlock the data volume paired to\n     the system volume at / .\n\n     Upon invocation, apfs_unlockfv will prompt the user for a password.  This\n     password can be for any user on the volume being unlocked, including the\n     Disk user.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n\t   -h\t   Print a usage message.\n\n\t   -W\t   Unlock with empty password.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     apfs_unlockfv exits with 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\tIf the\n     volume was already unlocked, apfs_unlockfv also exits with 0."
