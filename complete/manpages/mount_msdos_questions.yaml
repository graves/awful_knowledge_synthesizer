This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot\n     time, but can be used by any user to mount an MS-DOS file system on any\n     directory that they own (provided, of course, that they have appropriate\n     access to the device that contains the file system).\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -o options\n\t     Use the specified mount options, as described in mount(8).\n\n     -u uid  Set the owner of the files in the file system to uid.  The\n\t     default owner is the owner of the directory on which the file\n\t     system is being mounted.\n\n     -g gid  Set the group of the files in the file system to gid.  The\n\t     default group is the group of the directory on which the file\n\t     system is being mounted."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mount_msdos`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-m mask\n\t     Specify the maximum file permissions for files in the file\n\t     system.  (For example, a mask of 755 specifies that, by default,\n\t     the owner should have read, write, and execute permissions for\n\t     files, but others should only have read and execute permissions.\n\t     See chmod(1) for more information about octal file modes.)

Cluster sizes larger than 16K are unavoidable\n     for file system sizes larger than 1G, and also occur when filesystems\n     larger than 1G are shrunk to smaller than 1G using FIPS.\n\nHISTORY\n     The mount_msdos utility first appeared in FreeBSD 2.0.  Its predecessor,\n     the mount_pcfs utility appeared in FreeBSD 1.0, and was abandoned in\n     favor of the more aptly-named mount_msdos."
