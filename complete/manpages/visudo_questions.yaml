If the sudoers file is currently being\n       edited you will receive a message to try again later.\n\n       visudo parses the sudoers file after editing and will not save the\n       changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding an error, visudo will\n       print a message stating the line number(s) where the error occurred and\n       the user will receive the “What now?” prompt.  At this point the user\n       may enter ‘e’ to re-edit the sudoers file, ‘x’ to exit without saving\n       the changes, or ‘Q’ to quit and save changes.  The ‘Q’ option should be\n       used with extreme caution because if visudo believes there to be a\n       syntax error, so will sudo.  If ‘e’ is typed to edit the sudoers file\n       after a syntax error has been detected, the cursor will be placed on\n       the line where the error occurred (if the editor supports this\n       feature)."

An\n\t\t   alternative is to place a colon-separated list of “safe”\n\t\t   editors in the editor variable.  visudo will then only use\n\t\t   SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, or EDITOR if they match a value\n\t\t   specified in editor.  If the env_reset flag is enabled, the\n\t\t   SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and/or EDITOR environment variables\n\t\t   must be present in the env_keep list for the env_editor\n\t\t   flag to function when visudo is invoked via sudo.
