Its intended audience are users of the package wishing to\n       refresh their memory.  Newcomers should read the Diagram Language\n       Tutorial first.\tDevelopers wishing to work on the internals of the\n       package and its supporting packages should look at section Diagram\n       Classes first, and then the comments in the sources of the packages\n       itself."

While we speak of them as commands, and provide a syntax,\n       they are not truly available as actual commands, but only as part of\n       the arguments for an element command.\n\n       Note that some of the attribute names are overloaded, i.e. have\n       multiple, different, definitions. During processing of attributes for\n       an element the actual definition used is chosen based on the type of\n       the element the processing is for.\n\n       Further, as a catch-all clause, any attribute which could not be\n       processed according to the definitions below will be treated as the\n       argument of an implicit text attribute.\n\n       anchor name\n\n       ljust\n\n       rjust\n\n       above\n\n       below  IMAGE: figure-22-text-anchoring-3 Specifies the anchor of the\n\t      text which is to be placed at the element's center, by name.\n\t      I.e. this attribute defines the text's position relative to the\n\t      element's center.  The value is ignored if no text was specified\n\t      for the element.\tIf not specified the system falls back to the\n\t      value taken from the language variable anchor, which itself\n\t      defaults to center.  The legal values are all those accepted by\n\t      Tk_GetAnchor [http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetAnchor.htm].\n\t      The commands without arguments are all shorthands with the\n\t      anchor implied. Note that they do not combine, only the last is\n\t      used. For comined directions the main attribute command, anchor\n\t      has to be used.\n\n\t      ljust  \"anchor west\"\n\n\t      rjust  \"anchor east\"\n\n\t      above  \"anchor south\"\n\n\t      below  \"anchor north\"\n\n       arrowhead spec\n\t      IMAGE: figure-19-style-arrowheads Specifies where to draw\n\t      arrowheads on the line element, at the beginning or end, at both\n\t      ends, or none.  If not specified the system falls back to the\n\t      value taken from the language variable arrowhead, which itself\n\t      defaults to none.

A missing\n\t      specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are\n\t      required.\n\n\t      If the aspect is specified, and one of the attributes width or\n\t      height, then the missing attribute is calculated from the two\n\t      which are specified. No defaults are required for these cases\n\t      either.\n\n\t      If only one of the attributes width or height is specified then\n\t      the system uses a fallback for the aspect, the value taken from\n\t      the language variable diamondaspect, which itselfs defaults to\n\t      2.\n\n\t      If none of of the attributes width or height is specified then\n\t      the system uses a fallback for the width, the value taken from\n\t      the language variable boxwidth, which itselfs defaults to the\n\t      pixel equivalent of 2 cm. For the aspect it uses either the\n\t      user-specified value or the default taken as described in the\n\t      previous paragraph.\n\n       aspect number\n\t      Specifies the aspect ratio, i.e ratio of width to height, of the\n\t      ellipses which are used to draw the top and bottom of the drum\n\t      element.\tIf not specified the system falls back to the value\n\t      taken from the language variable drumaspect, which itself\n\t      defaults to 0.35.\n\n       at location\n\t      Specifies the location of the element's corner named by the\n\t      attribute with.  Defaults to the current location as maintained\n\t      by the layouting system.\n\n       at location\n\t      Line elements are normally positioned absolutely, using the\n\t      locations specified through the attributes from, then, and to.\n\t      If at is specified however then these positions are translated a\n\t      last time, moving the line's corner named by the attribute with\n\t      to the location given by this attribute.\n\n       chop ?length?\n\t      Specifies the length of the line element to remove from the\n\t      beginning and/or end.  Defaults to nothing.  If specified once\n\t      the chopping applies to both beginning and end of the line.  If\n\t      specified twice or more the last two specifications are used,\n\t      and applied to beginning and end of the line, in this order.\n\t      Whenever the attribute is specified without an explicit length,\n\t      the system falls back to the value taken from the language\n\t      variable circleradius, which itself defaults to the pixel\n\t      equivalent of 1 cm\n\n       clockwise\n\n       cw     Specifies the direction of the arc element, here going\n\t      clockwise.  The complementary attribute is counterclockwise.

The complementary attribute is clockwise.  If not\n\t      specified the system falls back to the value taken from the\n\t      language variable clockwise, which itself defaults to false, for\n\t      counter-clockwise direction.\n\n       diameter length\n\n       diam length\n\t      Specifies the diameter of the circle element, as an alternative\n\t      way to specify its radius.  Effective if and only if the radius\n\t      was not specified. I.e. if both diameter and radius are\n\t      specified then the radius infomration has precendence.  This\n\t      attribute has no default, because the defaults are taken from\n\t      the radius.\n\n       fillcolor spec\n\t      IMAGE: figure-21-style-colors Specifies the color used to draw\n\t      the inside of the element.  If not specified the system falls\n\t      back to the value taken from the language variable fillcolor,\n\t      which itself defaults to the empty string, signaling \"no\n\t      filling\".\n\n       from location\n\t      Specifies the location where the line element begins.

If not specified the\n\t      system falls back to the value taken from the language variable\n\t      boxheight, which itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of 2\n\t      cm.\n\n       height length\n\t      Specifies the height of the diamond element.  The manner in\n\t      which a default is calculated when not specified also depends on\n\t      the specifications of the attributes aspect and width, if any.\n\n\t      If both width, and height are specified then any specification\n\t      of aspect is ignored, as it is implicitly defined in the width\n\t      and height as well, and this takes precedence.

For the aspect it uses either the\n\t      user-specified value or the default taken as described in the\n\t      previous paragraph.\n\n       height length\n\t      Specifies the height of the text element.  Defaults to the\n\t      natural height of its text.\n\n       justify left|center|right\n\t      Specifies how multi-line text associated with the element is\n\t      positioned within its box.  The value is ignored if no text was\n\t      specified for the element.  If not specified the system falls\n\t      back to the value taken from the language variable justify,\n\t      which itself defaults to left.  The legal values are left,\n\t      right, and center.\n\n       noturn Specifies that the direction of line element at its end is not\n\t      propagated to the layout management.  If not specified the\n\t      direction of the line becomes the new direction the layout.\n\n       radius length\n\n       rad length\n\t      Specifies the radius of the circle element.

If\n\t      not specified lines are drawn exactly through the specified\n\t      waypoints, without any smooth curves.\n\n       stroke width\n\t      IMAGE: figure-20-style-stroke Specifies the width of the lines\n\t      drawn for the the element, in pixels.  If not specified the\n\t      system falls back to the value taken from the language variable\n\t      linewidth, which itself defaults to 1.\n\n       style spec\n\t      IMAGE: figure-18-style-dash Specifies the style used to draw the\n\t      lines of the element.  If not specified the system falls back to\n\t      the value taken from the language variable linestyle, which\n\t      itself defaults to solid lines.

This\n\t      attribute has no default. The default is handled by the\n\t      attribute then, which makes it appear as if to has a default\n\t      when not specified.\n\n       to location\n\t      Specifies the location where the arc element ends.  Defaults to\n\t      a location such that a 90-degree arc is drawn in the chosen\n\t      direction, starting at from.\n\n       width length\n\n       wid length\n\t      Specifies the width of the element.
