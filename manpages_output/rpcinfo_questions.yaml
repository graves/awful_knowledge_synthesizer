With no or only generic options, call the rpcbind dump\n     procedure on the specified host or “localhost” if host is not specified\n     and display the results.  For versions 3 and 4 display the program\n     number, the version, the “netid”, the universal address that the services\n     is listening on, symbolic name of the program if known, and then the\n     owner that registered the ⟨program, version, netid, address⟩ tuple.  For\n     version 2 of the protocol list the program, version, protocol, port, and\n     symbolic program name.  See the option below for a typically more useful\n     output. rpcbind defaults the netid to “tcp” for the dump procedure."

    Manpage text:

    The program argument can be either a name or a number.

         If a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the
         specified program.  Otherwise, if the version is optional rpcinfo
         attempts to find all the registered version numbers for the specified
         program by calling version 0 (which is presumed not to exist; if it does
         exist, rpcinfo attempts to obtain this information by calling an
         extremely high version number instead) and attempts to call each
         registered version.

         A required transport option is needed for the second and third lines of
         the synopsis which is used to ping, i.e., call the null procedure of the
         specified program and version. The results will be displayed on stdout.
         If version is not specified each valid version found as described above
         will be called.  The third synopsis will use the supplied universal
         address over the transport specified by netid to call the null procedure
         of the specified program in the same manner as above. In addition the
         last two lines of the synopsis can “ping” the server as described in the
         Legacy Options section below.
