Usage has three\n     intents: add server config, remove server config, or display help.\n\n     Options list and their descriptions:\n\n     -f       Bindings will be established or dropped in conjunction with the\n\t      addition or removal of the LDAP server configuration.\n\n     -v       This enables the logging to stdout of the details of the\n\t      operations. This can be redirected to a file.\n\n     -i       You will be prompted for a password to use in conjunction with a\n\t      specified username.\n\n     -s       This ensures that no clear text passwords will be sent to the\n\t      LDAP server during authentication.  This will only be enabled if\n\t      the server supports non-cleartext methods.\n\n     -e       This ensures that if the server is capable of supporting\n\t      encryption methods (i.e., SSL or Kerberos) that encryption will\n\t      be enforced at all times via policy."
