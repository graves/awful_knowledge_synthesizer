Or whatever else...\n\n       It is NOT designed as a general-purpose backend that uses RDBMS instead\n       of BerkeleyDB (as the standard BDB backend does), though it can be used\n       as such with several limitations.  You can take a look at\n       http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=378 (OpenLDAP\n       FAQ-O-Matic/General LDAP FAQ/Directories vs. conventional databases) to\n       find out more on this point.\n\n       The idea (detailed below) is to use some meta-information to translate\n       LDAP queries to SQL queries, leaving relational schema untouched, so\n       that old applications can continue using it without any modifications.\n       This allows SQL and LDAP applications to inter-operate without\n       replication, and exchange data as needed.\n\n       The SQL backend is designed to be tunable to virtually any relational\n       schema without having to change source (through that meta-information\n       mentioned).  Also, it uses ODBC to connect to RDBMSes, and is highly\n       configurable for SQL dialects RDBMSes may use, so it may be used for\n       integration and distribution of data on different RDBMSes, OSes, hosts\n       etc., in other words, in highly heterogeneous environment.\n\n       This backend is experimental.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       These slapd.conf options apply to the SQL backend database, which means\n       that they must follow a \"database sql\" line and come before any\n       subsequent \"backend\" or \"database\" lines.  Other database options not\n       specific to this backend are described in the slapd.conf(5) manual\n       page.\n\nDATA SOURCE CONFIGURATION\n       dbname <datasource name>\n\t      The name of the ODBC datasource to use.\n\n       dbhost <hostname>\n       dbpasswd <password>\n       dbuser <username>\n\t      The three above options are generally unneeded, because this\n\t      information is taken from the datasource specified by the dbname\n\t      directive.  They allow to override datasource settings.  Also,\n\t      several RDBMS' drivers tend to require explicit passing of\n\t      user/password, even if those are given in datasource (Note:\n\t      dbhost is currently ignored).\n\nSCOPING CONFIGURATION\n       These options specify SQL query templates for scoping searches."

Any relational\n       schema, no matter how normalized it is, was designed after some model\n       of your application's domain (for instance, accounts, services etc. in\n       ISP), and is used in terms of its entities, not just tables of\n       normalized schema.  It means that for every attribute of every such\n       instance there is an effective SQL query that loads its values.\n\n       Also you might want your object classes to conform to some of the\n       standard schemas like inetOrgPerson etc.\n\n       Nevertheless, when you think it out, we must define a way to translate\n       LDAP operation requests to (a series of) SQL queries.  Let us deal with\n       the SEARCH operation.\n\n       Example: Let's suppose that we store information about persons working\n       in our organization in two tables:\n\n\t PERSONS\t      PHONES\n\t ----------\t      -------------\n\t id integer\t      id integer\n\t first_name varchar   pers_id integer references persons(id)\n\t last_name varchar    phone\n\t middle_name varchar\n\t ...\n\n       (PHONES contains telephone numbers associated with persons).  A person\n       can have several numbers, then PHONES contains several records with\n       corresponding pers_id, or no numbers (and no records in PHONES with\n       such pers_id).  An LDAP objectclass to present such information could\n       look like this:\n\n\t person\n\t -------\n\t MUST cn\n\t MAY telephoneNumber $ firstName $ lastName\n\t ...\n\n       To fetch all values for cn attribute given person ID, we construct the\n       query:\n\n\t SELECT CONCAT(persons.first_name,' ',persons.last_name)\n\t     AS cn FROM persons WHERE persons.id=?\n\n       for telephoneNumber we can use:\n\n\t SELECT phones.phone AS telephoneNumber FROM persons,phones\n\t     WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id AND persons.id=?\n\n       If we wanted to service LDAP requests with filters like\n       (telephoneNumber=123*), we would construct something like:\n\n\t SELECT ... FROM persons,phones\n\t     WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id\n\t\t AND persons.id=?\n\t\t AND phones.phone like '%1%2%3%'\n\n       (note how the telephoneNumber match is expanded in multiple wildcards\n       to account for interspersed ininfluential chars like spaces, dashes and\n       so; this occurs by design because telephoneNumber is defined after a\n       specially recognized syntax).  So, if we had information about what\n       tables contain values for each attribute, how to join these tables and\n       arrange these values, we could try to automatically generate such\n       statements, and translate search filters to SQL WHERE clauses.\n\n       To store such information, we add three more tables to our schema and\n       fill it with data (see samples):\n\n\t ldap_oc_mappings (some columns are not listed for clarity)\n\t ---------------\n\t id=1\n\t name=\"person\"\n\t keytbl=\"persons\"\n\t keycol=\"id\"\n\n       This table defines a mapping between objectclass (its name held in the\n       \"name\" column), and a table that holds the primary key for\n       corresponding entities.\tFor instance, in our example, the person\n       entity, which we are trying to present as \"person\" objectclass, resides\n       in two tables (persons and phones), and is identified by the persons.id\n       column (that we will call the primary key for this entity).  Keytbl and\n       keycol thus contain \"persons\" (name of the table), and \"id\" (name of\n       the column).\n\n\t ldap_attr_mappings (some columns are not listed for clarity)\n\t -----------\n\t id=1\n\t oc_map_id=1\n\t name=\"cn\"\n\t sel_expr=\"CONCAT(persons.first_name,' ',persons.last_name)\"\n\t from_tbls=\"persons\"\n\t join_where=NULL\n\t ************\n\t id=<n>\n\t oc_map_id=1\n\t name=\"telephoneNumber\"\n\t sel_expr=\"phones.phone\"\n\t from_tbls=\"persons,phones\"\n\t join_where=\"phones.pers_id=persons.id\"\n\n       This table defines mappings between LDAP attributes and SQL queries\n       that load their values.\tNote that, unlike LDAP schema, these are not\n       attribute types - the attribute \"cn\" for \"person\" objectclass can have\n       its values in different tables than \"cn\" for some other objectclass, so\n       attribute mappings depend on objectclass mappings (unlike attribute\n       types in LDAP schema, which are indifferent to objectclasses).  Thus,\n       we have oc_map_id column with link to oc_mappings table.\n\n       Now we cut the SQL query that loads values for a given attribute into 3\n       parts.  First goes into sel_expr column - this is the expression we had\n       between SELECT and FROM keywords, which defines WHAT to load.  Next is\n       table list - text between FROM and WHERE keywords.  It may contain\n       aliases for convenience (see examples).\tThe last is part of the where\n       clause, which (if it exists at all) expresses the condition for joining\n       the table containing values with the table containing the primary key\n       (foreign key equality and such).  If values are in the same table as\n       the primary key, then this column is left NULL (as for cn attribute\n       above).\n\n       Having this information in parts, we are able to not only construct\n       queries that load attribute values by id of entry (for this we could\n       store SQL query as a whole), but to construct queries that load id's of\n       objects that correspond to a given search filter (or at least part of\n       it).  See below for examples.\n\n\t ldap_entries\n\t ------------\n\t id=1\n\t dn=<dn you choose>\n\t oc_map_id=...\n\t parent=<parent record id>\n\t keyval=<value of primary key>\n\n       This table defines mappings between DNs of entries in your LDAP tree,\n       and values of primary keys for corresponding relational data.  It has\n       recursive structure (parent column references id column of the same\n       table), which allows you to add any tree structure(s) to your flat\n       relational data.  Having id of objectclass mapping, we can determine\n       table and column for primary key, and keyval stores value of it, thus\n       defining the exact tuple corresponding to the LDAP entry with this DN.\n\n       Note that such design (see exact SQL table creation query) implies one\n       important constraint - the key must be an integer.  But all that I know\n       about well-designed schemas makes me think that it's not very narrow ;)\n       If anyone needs support for different types for keys - he may want to\n       write a patch, and submit it to OpenLDAP ITS, then I'll include it.\n\n       Also, several users complained that they don't really need very\n       structured trees, and they don't want to update one more table every\n       time they add or delete an instance in the relational schema.  Those\n       people can use a view instead of a real table for ldap_entries,\n       something like this (by Robin Elfrink):\n\n\t CREATE VIEW ldap_entries (id, dn, oc_map_id, parent, keyval)\n\t     AS\n\t\t SELECT 0, UPPER('o=MyCompany,c=NL'),\n\t\t     3, 0, 'baseObject' FROM unixusers WHERE userid='root'\n\t     UNION\n\t\t SELECT (1000000000+userid),\n\t\t     UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT('cn=',gecos),',o=MyCompany,c=NL')),\n\t\t     1, 0, userid FROM unixusers\n\t     UNION\n\t\t SELECT (2000000000+groupnummer),\n\t\t     UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT('cn=',groupnaam),',o=MyCompany,c=NL')),\n\t\t     2, 0, groupnummer FROM groups;"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `slapd-sql`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf your RDBMS does not support unions in views, only one objectClass\n       can be mapped in ldap_entries, and the baseObject cannot be created; in\n       this case, see the baseObject directive for a possible workaround.\n\n\nTYPICAL SQL BACKEND OPERATION\n       Having meta-information loaded, the SQL backend uses these tables to\n       determine a set of primary keys of candidates (depending on search\n       scope and filter).  It tries to do it for each objectclass registered\n       in ldap_objclasses.\n\n       Example: for our query with filter (telephoneNumber=123*) we would get\n       the following query generated (which loads candidate IDs)\n\n\t SELECT ldap_entries.id,persons.id, 'person' AS objectClass,\n\t\tldap_entries.dn AS dn\n\t   FROM ldap_entries,persons,phones\n\t  WHERE persons.id=ldap_entries.keyval\n\t    AND ldap_entries.objclass=?\n\t    AND ldap_entries.parent=?\n\t    AND phones.pers_id=persons.id\n\t    AND (phones.phone LIKE '%1%2%3%')\n\n       (for ONELEVEL search) or \"... AND dn=?\" (for BASE search) or \"... AND\n       dn LIKE '%?'\" (for SUBTREE)\n\n       Then, for each candidate, we load the requested attributes using per-\n       attribute queries like\n\n\t SELECT phones.phone AS telephoneNumber\n\t   FROM persons,phones\n\t  WHERE persons.id=? AND phones.pers_id=persons.id\n\n       Then, we use test_filter() from the frontend API to test the entry for\n       a full LDAP search filter match (since we cannot effectively make sense\n       of SYNTAX of corresponding LDAP schema attribute, we translate the\n       filter into the most relaxed SQL condition to filter candidates), and\n       send it to the user.\n\n       ADD, DELETE, MODIFY and MODRDN operations are also performed on per-\n       attribute meta-information (add_proc etc.).  In those fields one can\n       specify an SQL statement or stored procedure call which can add, or\n       delete given values of a given attribute, using the given entry keyval\n       (see examples -- mostly PostgreSQL, ORACLE and MSSQL - since as of this\n       writing there are no stored procs in MySQL).\n\n       We just add more columns to ldap_oc_mappings and ldap_attr_mappings,\n       holding statements to execute (like create_proc, add_proc, del_proc\n       etc.), and flags governing the order of parameters passed to those\n       statements.  Please see samples to find out what are the parameters\n       passed, and other information on this matter - they are self-\n       explanatory for those familiar with the concepts expressed above.\n\nCOMMON TECHNIQUES\n       First of all, let's recall that among other major differences to the\n       complete LDAP data model, the above illustrated concept does not\n       directly support such features as multiple objectclasses per entry, and\n       referrals.  Fortunately, they are easy to adopt in this scheme.\tThe\n       SQL backend requires that one more table is added to the schema:\n       ldap_entry_objectclasses(entry_id,oc_name).\n\n       That table contains any number of objectclass names that corresponding\n       entries will possess, in addition to that mentioned in mapping.\tThe\n       SQL backend automatically adds attribute mapping for the \"objectclass\"\n       attribute to each objectclass mapping that loads values from this\n       table.  So, you may, for instance, have a mapping for inetOrgPerson,\n       and use it for queries for \"person\" objectclass...\n\n       Referrals used to be implemented in a loose manner by adding an extra\n       table that allowed any entry to host a \"ref\" attribute, along with a\n       \"referral\" extra objectClass in table ldap_entry_objclasses.  In the\n       current implementation, referrals are treated like any other user-\n       defined schema, since \"referral\" is a structural objectclass.  The\n       suggested practice is to define a \"referral\" entry in ldap_oc_mappings,\n       holding a naming attribute, e.g. \"ou\" or \"cn\", a \"ref\" attribute,\n       containing the url; in case multiple referrals per entry are needed, a\n       separate table for urls can be created, where urls are mapped to the\n       respective entries.  The use of the naming attribute usually requires\n       to add an \"extensibleObject\" value to ldap_entry_objclasses."

    CAVEATS
           As previously stated, this backend should not be considered a
           replacement of other data storage backends, but rather a gateway to
           existing RDBMS storages that need to be published in LDAP form.

           The hasSubordintes operational attribute is honored by back-sql in
           search results and in compare operations; it is partially honored also
           in filtering.  Owing to design limitations, a (brain-dead?) filter of
           the form (!(hasSubordinates=TRUE)) will give no results instead of
           returning all the leaf entries, because it actually expands into ...
           AND NOT (1=1).  If you need to find all the leaf entries, please use
           (hasSubordinates=FALSE) instead.

           A directoryString value of the form "__First___Last_" (where
           underscores mean spaces, ASCII 0x20 char) corresponds to its prettified
           counterpart "First_Last"; this is not currently honored by back-sql if
           non-prettified data is written via RDBMS; when non-prettified data is
           written through back-sql, the prettified values are actually used
           instead.
