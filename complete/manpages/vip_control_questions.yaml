Virtual IPs may\n       be helpful for applications needing access to the primary MDC when\n       running in an HA configuration.\tChanges made to VIPs are not\n       automatically copied over to an MDC's HA peer.  As such, any changes\n       that are made to the VIP configuration need to be done on both HA MDCs.\n       vip_control does not update firewall rules.  Changes to VIP\n       configurations may require additional changes to the firewall rules of\n       the system.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -h     Display help\n\n       -a     Activate all configured VIPs\n\n       -d     Deactivate all configured VIPs\n\n       -i     Show VIP status along with physical NIC status"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `vip_control`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-l     Show configured VIPs in a compact format\n\n       -u vip_str\n\t      Update the VIP configuration with the vip_str string.  This\n\t      replaces the contents of the VIP configuration file.  The format\n\t      of vip_str is as follows:\n\n\t\t MAC address, IPV4 VIP, netmask, IPV6 VIP, prefix length\n\n       Each field in a VIP entry is separated by a comma, and each VIP entry\n       can be separated by either a newline or a semicolon.  Typically, the\n       semicolon is used.\n\n       The following is an example of setting up two VIPs:\n\n\t  # vip_control -u \"0030482D38F6,10.0.0.2,255.255.255.0,,;0030482d38f7,10.1.0.2,255.255.255.0,,;\"\n\nNOTES\n       When changing the ha_vip.txt on Quantum Appliance you also need to make\n       sure that the iptables rules are updated to reflect the new\n       information. You can use the following command to reset the VIP\n\n\t  # /opt/DXi/scripts/netcfg.sh --reset_snvip\n\nFILES\n       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_vip.txt /opt/DXi/scripts/netcfg.sh\n\nLIMITATIONS\n       Only the Linux platform is supported with vip_control since it requires\n       an HA pair."
