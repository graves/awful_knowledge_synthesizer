This metadata describes the owner, name,\n     and so forth.\n\n     When -create is used, the -msize argument can specify the size of\n     metadata area; the default is 128Kbytes.  The default size unit is bytes,\n     but the following suffixes may be used to multiply by the given factor:\n     ``b'' (512), ``k'' (1024), ``m'' (1048576), and ``g'' (1073741824)."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the disklabel command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the disklabel command to create an Apple Label partition with a metadata size of 256KB?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the disklabel command to display the current status of a disk device?

If\n     it cannot find the names, and the values are not given as numbers, it\n     will print an error, and not store the key/value pairs in the metadata.\n\n     The owner-mode property may be given in decimal, or in octal by using a\n     preceding ``0'' (e.g., ``0666'').\n\n     Any property may be forced to be treated as a string by enclosing it in\n     double-quotation marks; bear in mind that shell escapes will probably be\n     necessary in this sitation."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you set the owner of a device to a specific user (e.g., 'john') using the disklabel command?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the correct way to specify octal permissions (e.g., 0666) for the owner-mode property in disklabel?
