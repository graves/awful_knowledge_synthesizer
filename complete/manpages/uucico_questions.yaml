It is started when uucp or uux is run (unless they are\n       given the -r option).  It is also typically started periodically using\n       entries in the crontab table(s).\n\n       When invoked with -r1, --master, -s, --system, or -S, the daemon will\n       place a call to a remote system, running in master mode.  Otherwise the\n       daemon will start in slave mode, accepting a call from a remote system.\n       Typically a special login name will be set up for UUCP which\n       automatically invokes uucico when a call is made.\n\n       When uucico terminates, it invokes the uuxqt (8) daemon, unless the -q\n       or --nouuxqt option is given; uuxqt (8) executes any work orders\n       created by uux (1) on a remote system, and any work orders created\n       locally which have received remote files for which they were waiting."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `uucico`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf a call fails, uucico will normally refuse to retry the call until a\n       certain (configurable) amount of time has passed.  This may be\n       overriden by the -f, --force, or -S option.\n\n       The -l, --prompt, -e, or --loop options may be used to force uucico to\n       produce its own prompts of \"login: \" and \"Password:\".  When another\n       daemon calls in, it will see these prompts and log in as usual.\tThe\n       login name and password will normally be checked against a separate\n       list kept specially for uucico rather than the /etc/passwd file; it is\n       possible on some systems to direct uucico to use the /etc/passwd file.\n       The -l or --prompt option will prompt once and then exit; in this mode\n       the UUCP administrator or the superuser may use the -u or --login\n       option to force a login name, in which case uucico will not prompt for\n       one.  The -e or --loop option will prompt again after the first session\n       is over; in this mode uucico will permanently control a port."
