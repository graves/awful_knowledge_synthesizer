The format is a character string which\n     contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply\n     copied to standard output, character escape sequences which are converted\n     and copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of\n     which causes printing of the next successive argument.\n\n     The arguments after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding\n     format is either c, b or s; otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant,\n     with the following extensions:\n\n\t   •   A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.\n\t   •   If the leading character is a single or double quote, the value\n\t       is the character code of the next character.\n\n     The format string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the\n     arguments.  Any extra format specifications are evaluated with zero or\n     the null string."
