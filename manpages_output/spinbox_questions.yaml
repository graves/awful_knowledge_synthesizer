[-buttoncursor buttonCursor] The cursor to be\n       used when over the spin buttons.  If this is empty (the default), a\n       default cursor will be used.  [-buttondownrelief buttonDownRelief] The\n       relief to be used for the upper spin button.\n       [-buttonuprelief buttonUpRelief] The relief to be used for the lower\n       spin button.  [-command command] Specifies a Tcl command to invoke\n       whenever a spinbutton is invoked.  The command recognizes several\n       percent substitutions: %W for the widget path, %s for the current value\n       of the widget, and %d for the direction of the button pressed (up or\n       down).  [-disabledbackground disabledBackground] Specifies the\n       background color to use when the spinbox is disabled.  If this option\n       is the empty string, the normal background color is used.\n       [-disabledforeground disabledForeground] Specifies the foreground color\n       to use when the spinbox is disabled.  If this option is the empty\n       string, the normal foreground color is used.  [-format format]\n       Specifies an alternate format to use when setting the string value when\n       using the -from and -to range.  This must be a format specifier of the\n       form %<pad>.<pad>f, as it will format a floating-point number.\n       [-from from] A floating-point value corresponding to the lowest value\n       for a spinbox, to be used in conjunction with -to and -increment.  When\n       all are specified correctly, the spinbox will use these values to\n       control its contents.  This value must be less than the -to option.  If\n       -values is specified, it supercedes this option.  [-invalidcommand or\n       -invcmd invalidCommand] Specifies a script to eval when validateCommand\n       returns 0.  Setting it to an empty string disables this feature (the\n       default).  The best use of this option is to set it to bell.  See\n       Validation below for more information.  [-increment increment] A\n       floating-point value specifying the increment.  When used with -from\n       and -to, the value in the widget will be adjusted by -increment when a\n       spin button is pressed (up adds the value, down subtracts the value).\n       [-readonlybackground readonlyBackground] Specifies the background color\n       to use when the spinbox is readonly.  If this option is the empty\n       string, the normal background color is used.  [-state state] Specifies\n       one of three states for the spinbox:  normal, disabled, or readonly.\n       If the spinbox is readonly, then the value may not be changed using\n       widget commands and no insertion cursor will be displayed, even if the\n       input focus is in the widget; the contents of the widget may still be\n       selected.  If the spinbox is disabled, the value may not be changed, no\n       insertion cursor will be displayed, the contents will not be\n       selectable, and the spinbox may be displayed in a different color,\n       depending on the values of the -disabledforeground and\n       -disabledbackground options.  [-to to] A floating-point value\n       corresponding to the highest value for the spinbox, to be used in\n       conjunction with -from and -increment.  When all are specified\n       correctly, the spinbox will use these values to control its contents.\n       This value must be greater than the -from option.  If -values is\n       specified, it supercedes this option.  [-validate validate] Specifies\n       the mode in which validation should operate: none, focus, focusin,\n       focusout, key, or all.  It defaults to none.  When you want validation,\n       you must explicitly state which mode you wish to use.  See Validation\n       below for more.\t[-validatecommand or -vcmd validateCommand] Specifies\n       a script to evaluate when you want to validate the input in the widget.\n       Setting it to an empty string disables this feature (the default).\n       Validation occurs according to the value of -validate.  This command\n       must return a valid Tcl boolean value.  If it returns 0 (or the valid\n       Tcl boolean equivalent) then the value of the widget will not change\n       and the invalidCommand will be evaluated if it is set.  If it returns\n       1, then value will be changed.  See Validation below for more\n       information.  [-values values] Must be a proper list value.  If\n       specified, the spinbox will use these values as to control its\n       contents, starting with the first value.  This option has precedence\n       over the -from and -to range.  [-width width] Specifies an integer\n       value indicating the desired width of the spinbox window, in average-\n       size characters of the widget's font.  If the value is less than or\n       equal to zero, the widget picks a size just large enough to hold its\n       current text.  [-wrap wrap] Must be a proper boolean value.  If on, the\n       spinbox will wrap around the values of data in the widget.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `spinbox`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The spinbox command creates a new window (given by the pathName\n       argument) and makes it into a spinbox widget.  Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the spinbox such as its colors, font,\n       and relief.  The spinbox command returns its pathName argument.\tAt the\n       time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named\n       pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A spinbox is an extended entry widget that allows he user to move, or\n       spin, through a fixed set of ascending or descending values such as\n       times or dates in addition to editing the value as in an entry.\tWhen\n       first created, a spinbox's string is empty.  A portion of the spinbox\n       may be selected as described below.  If a spinbox is exporting its\n       selection (see the exportSelection option), then it will observe the\n       standard protocols for handling the selection;  spinbox selections are\n       available as type STRING.  Spinboxes also observe the standard Tk rules\n       for dealing with the input focus.  When a spinbox has the input focus\n       it displays an insertion cursor to indicate where new characters will\n       be inserted.\n\n       Spinboxes are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit\n       entirely within the widget's window.  In this case, only a portion of\n       the string will be displayed; commands described below may be used to\n       change the view in the window.  Spinboxes use the standard\n       xScrollCommand mechanism for interacting with scrollbars (see the\n       description of the xScrollCommand option for details).  They also\n       support scanning, as described below.\n\nVALIDATION\n       Validation works by setting the validateCommand option to a script\n       which will be evaluated according to the validate option as follows:\n\n       none\t Default.  This means no validation will occur.\n\n       focus\t validateCommand will be called when the spinbox receives or\n\t\t loses focus.\n\n       focusin\t validateCommand will be called when the spinbox receives\n\t\t focus.\n\n       focusout  validateCommand will be called when the spinbox loses focus.\n\n       key\t validateCommand will be called when the spinbox is edited.\n\n       all\t validateCommand will be called for all above conditions.\n\n       It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the validateCommand\n       and invalidCommand, just as you would in a bind script.\tThe following\n       substitutions are recognized:\n\n       %d   Type of action: 1 for insert, 0 for delete, or -1 for focus,\n\t    forced or textvariable validation.\n\n       %i   Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise -1.\n\n       %P   The value of the spinbox should edition occur.  If you are\n\t    configuring the spinbox widget to have a new textvariable, this\n\t    will be the value of that textvariable.\n\n       %s   The current value of spinbox before edition.\n\n       %S   The text string being inserted/deleted, if any.  Otherwise it is\n\t    an empty string.\n\n       %v   The type of validation currently set.\n\n       %V   The type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin,\n\t    focusout, forced).\n\n       %W   The name of the spinbox widget.\n\n       In general, the textVariable and validateCommand can be dangerous to\n       mix.  Any problems have been overcome so that using the validateCommand\n       will not interfere with the traditional behavior of the spinbox widget.\n       Using the textVariable for read-only purposes will never cause\n       problems.  The danger comes when you try set the textVariable to\n       something that the validateCommand would not accept, which causes\n       validate to become none (the invalidCommand will not be triggered).\n       The same happens when an error occurs evaluating the validateCommand.\n\n       Primarily, an error will occur when the validateCommand or\n       invalidCommand encounters an error in its script while evaluating or\n       validateCommand does not return a valid Tcl boolean value.  The\n       validate option will also set itself to none when you edit the spinbox\n       widget from within either the validateCommand or the invalidCommand.\n       Such editions will override the one that was being validated.  If you\n       wish to edit the value of the widget during validation and still have\n       the validate option set, you should include the command\n\t\t   %W config -validate %v\n       in the validateCommand or invalidCommand (whichever one you were\n       editing the spinbox widget from).  It is also recommended to not set an\n       associated textVariable during validation, as that can cause the\n       spinbox widget to become out of sync with the textVariable.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The spinbox command creates a new Tcl command whose name is pathName.\n       This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.\n       It has the following general form:\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n   INDICES\n       Many of the widget commands for spinboxes take one or more indices as\n       arguments.  An index specifies a particular character in the spinbox's\n       string, in any of the following ways:\n\n       number\t   Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0\n\t\t   corresponds to the first character in the string.\n\n       anchor\t   Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set\n\t\t   with the select from and select adjust widget commands.\n\n       end\t   Indicates the character just after the last one in the\n\t\t   spinbox's string.  This is equivalent to specifying a\n\t\t   numerical index equal to the length of the spinbox's\n\t\t   string.\n\n       insert\t   Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately\n\t\t   following the insertion cursor.\n\n       sel.first   Indicates the first character in the selection.  It is an\n\t\t   error to use this form if the selection is not in the\n\t\t   spinbox window.\n\n       sel.last    Indicates the character just after the last one in the\n\t\t   selection.  It is an error to use this form if the\n\t\t   selection is not in the spinbox window.\n\n       @number\t   In this form, number is treated as an x-coordinate in the\n\t\t   spinbox's window;  the character spanning that x-coordinate\n\t\t   is used.  For example, “@0” indicates the left-most\n\t\t   character in the window.\n\n       Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g.  “e” or\n       “sel.f”.  In general, out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to\n       the nearest legal value.\n\n   SUBCOMMANDS\n       The following commands are possible for spinbox widgets:\n\n       pathName bbox index\n\t      Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of\n\t      the character given by index.  The first two elements of the\n\t      list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of\n\t      the screen area covered by the character (in pixels relative to\n\t      the widget) and the last two elements give the width and height\n\t      of the character, in pixels.  The bounding box may refer to a\n\t      region outside the visible area of the window.\n\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      spinbox command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      spinbox command.\n\n       pathName delete first ?last?\n\t      Delete one or more elements of the spinbox.  First is the index\n\t      of the first character to delete, and last is the index of the\n\t      character just after the last one to delete.  If last is not\n\t      specified it defaults to first+1, i.e. a single character is\n\t      deleted.\tThis command returns an empty string.\n\n       pathName get\n\t      Returns the spinbox's string.\n\n       pathName icursor index\n\t      Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the\n\t      character given by index.  Returns an empty string.\n\n       pathName identify x y\n\t      Returns the name of the window element corresponding to\n\t      coordinates x and y in the spinbox.  Return value is one of:\n\t      none, buttondown, buttonup, entry.\n\n       pathName index index\n\t      Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.\n\n       pathName insert index string\n\t      Insert the characters of string just before the character\n\t      indicated by index.  Returns an empty string.\n\n       pathName invoke element\n\t      Causes the specified element, either buttondown or buttonup, to\n\t      be invoked, triggering the action associated with it.\n\n       pathName scan option args\n\t      This command is used to implement scanning on spinboxes.\tIt has\n\t      two forms, depending on option:\n\n\t      pathName scan mark x\n\t\t     Records x and the current view in the spinbox window;\n\t\t     used in conjunction with later scan dragto commands.\n\t\t     Typically this command is associated with a mouse button\n\t\t     press in the widget.  It returns an empty string.\n\n\t      pathName scan dragto x\n\t\t     This command computes the difference between its x\n\t\t     argument and the x argument to the last scan mark command\n\t\t     for the widget.  It then adjusts the view left or right\n\t\t     by 10 times the difference in x-coordinates.  This\n\t\t     command is typically associated with mouse motion events\n\t\t     in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the\n\t\t     spinbox at high speed through the window.\tThe return\n\t\t     value is an empty string.\n\n       pathName selection option arg\n\t      This command is used to adjust the selection within a spinbox.\n\t      It has several forms, depending on option:\n\n\t      pathName selection adjust index\n\t\t     Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character\n\t\t     given by index, and adjust that end of the selection to\n\t\t     be at index (i.e. including but not going beyond index).\n\t\t     The other end of the selection is made the anchor point\n\t\t     for future select to commands.  If the selection is not\n\t\t     currently in the spinbox, then a new selection is created\n\t\t     to include the characters between index and the most\n\t\t     recent selection anchor point, inclusive.\tReturns an\n\t\t     empty string.\n\n\t      pathName selection clear\n\t\t     Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget.\n\t\t     If the selection is not in this widget then the command\n\t\t     has no effect.  Returns an empty string.\n\n\t      pathName selection element ?element?\n\t\t     Sets or gets the currently selected element.  If a\n\t\t     spinbutton element is specified, it will be displayed\n\t\t     depressed.\n\n\t      pathName selection from index\n\t\t     Set the selection anchor point to just before the\n\t\t     character given by index.\tDoes not change the selection.\n\t\t     Returns an empty string.\n\n\t      pathName selection present\n\t\t     Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the\n\t\t     spinbox, 0 if nothing is selected.\n\n\t      pathName selection range start end\n\t\t     Sets the selection to include the characters starting\n\t\t     with the one indexed by start and ending with the one\n\t\t     just before end.  If end refers to the same character as\n\t\t     start or an earlier one, then the spinbox's selection is\n\t\t     cleared.\n\n\t      pathName selection to index\n\t\t     If index is before the anchor point, set the selection to\n\t\t     the characters from index up to but not including the\n\t\t     anchor point.  If index is the same as the anchor point,\n\t\t     do nothing.  If index is after the anchor point, set the\n\t\t     selection to the characters from the anchor point up to\n\t\t     but not including index.  The anchor point is determined\n\t\t     by the most recent select from or select adjust command\n\t\t     in this widget.  If the selection is not in this widget\n\t\t     then a new selection is created using the most recent\n\t\t     anchor point specified for the widget.  Returns an empty\n\t\t     string.\n\n       pathName set ?string?\n\t      If string is specified, the spinbox will try and set it to this\n\t      value, otherwise it just returns the spinbox's string.  If\n\t      validation is on, it will occur when setting the string.\n\n       pathName validate\n\t      This command is used to force an evaluation of the\n\t      validateCommand independent of the conditions specified by the\n\t      validate option.\tThis is done by temporarily setting the\n\t      validate option to all.  It returns 0 or 1.\n\n       pathName xview args\n\t      This command is used to query and change the horizontal position\n\t      of the text in the widget's window.  It can take any of the\n\t      following forms:\n\n\t      pathName xview\n\t\t     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is\n\t\t     a real fraction between 0 and 1;  together they describe\n\t\t     the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For\n\t\t     example, if the first element is .2 and the second\n\t\t     element is .6, 20% of the spinbox's text is off-screen to\n\t\t     the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and\n\t\t     40% of the text is off-screen to the right.  These are\n\t\t     the same values passed to scrollbars via the\n\t\t     -xscrollcommand option.\n\n\t      pathName xview index\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character\n\t\t     given by index is displayed at the left edge of the\n\t\t     window.\n\n\t      pathName xview moveto fraction\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character\n\t\t     fraction of the way through the text appears at the left\n\t\t     edge of the window.  Fraction must be a fraction between\n\t\t     0 and 1.\n\n\t      pathName xview scroll number what\n\t\t     This command shifts the view in the window left or right\n\t\t     according to number and what.  Number must be an integer.\n\t\t     What must be either units or pages or an abbreviation of\n\t\t     one of these.  If what is units, the view adjusts left or\n\t\t     right by number average-width characters on the display;\n\t\t     if it is pages then the view adjusts by number\n\t\t     screenfuls.  If number is negative then characters\n\t\t     farther to the left become visible;  if it is positive\n\t\t     then characters farther to the right become visible."

Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection\n\t      consisting of whole words.\n\n       [3]    Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in\n\t      the spinbox and positions the insertion cursor before the first\n\t      character.\n\n       [4]    The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse\n\t      button 1 while the Shift key is down;  this will adjust the end\n\t      of the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when\n\t      button 1 was pressed.  If the button is double-clicked before\n\t      dragging then the selection will be adjusted in units of whole\n\t      words.\n\n       [5]    Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position\n\t      the insertion cursor in the spinbox without affecting the\n\t      selection.\n\n       [6]    If any normal printing characters are typed in a spinbox, they\n\t      are inserted at the point of the insertion cursor.\n\n       [7]    The view in the spinbox can be adjusted by dragging with mouse\n\t      button 2.  If mouse button 2 is clicked without moving the\n\t      mouse, the selection is copied into the spinbox at the position\n\t      of the mouse cursor.\n\n       [8]    If the mouse is dragged out of the spinbox on the left or right\n\t      sides while button 1 is pressed, the spinbox will automatically\n\t      scroll to make more text visible (if there is more text off-\n\t      screen on the side where the mouse left the window).\n\n       [9]    The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character\n\t      to the left or right;  they also clear any selection in the\n\t      spinbox and set the selection anchor.  If Left or Right is typed\n\t      with the Shift key down, then the insertion cursor moves and the\n\t      selection is extended to include the new character.  Control-\n\t      Left and Control-Right move the insertion cursor by words, and\n\t      Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion\n\t      cursor by words and also extend the selection.  Control-b and\n\t      Control-f behave the same as Left and Right, respectively.\n\t      Meta-b and Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control-\n\t      Right, respectively.\n\n       [10]   The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to\n\t      the beginning of the spinbox and clear any selection in the\n\t      spinbox.\tShift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning\n\t      of the spinbox and also extends the selection to that point.\n\n       [11]   The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the\n\t      end of the spinbox and clear any selection in the spinbox.\n\t      Shift-End moves the cursor to the end and extends the selection\n\t      to that point.\n\n       [12]   The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the\n\t      position of the insertion cursor.  They do not affect the\n\t      current selection.  Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust\n\t      the selection to the current position of the insertion cursor,\n\t      selecting from the anchor to the insertion cursor if there was\n\t      not any selection previously.\n\n       [13]   Control-/ selects all the text in the spinbox.\n\n       [14]   Control-\\ clears any selection in the spinbox.\n\n       [15]   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w\n\t      copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is\n\t      a selection.\n\n       [16]   The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w\n\t      copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes\n\t      the selection.  If there is no selection in the widget then\n\t      these keys have no effect.\n\n       [17]   The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations) or\n\t      Control-y inserts the contents of the clipboard at the position\n\t      of the insertion cursor.\n\n       [18]   The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the\n\t      spinbox.\tIf there is no selection, it deletes the character to\n\t      the right of the insertion cursor.\n\n       [19]   The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there\n\t      is one in the spinbox.  If there is no selection, it deletes the\n\t      character to the left of the insertion cursor.\n\n       [20]   Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion\n\t      cursor.\n\n       [21]   Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.\n\n       [22]   Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the\n\t      insertion cursor.\n\n       [23]   Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right\n\t      of the insertion cursor.\n\n       If the spinbox is disabled using the -state option, then the spinbox's\n       view can still be adjusted and text in the spinbox can still be\n       selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no text\n       modifications will take place.\n\n       The behavior of spinboxes can be changed by defining new bindings for\n       individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings."
