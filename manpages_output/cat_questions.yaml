The file operands are processed in command-line order.  If file\n     is a single dash (‘-’) or absent, cat reads from the standard input.  If\n     file is a UNIX domain socket, cat connects to it and then reads it until\n     EOF.  This complements the UNIX domain binding capability available in\n     inetd(8).\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -b      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.\n\n     -e      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display\n\t     a dollar sign (‘$’) at the end of each line.\n\n     -l      Set an exclusive advisory lock on the standard output file\n\t     descriptor.  This lock is set using fcntl(2) with the F_SETLKW\n\t     command.  If the output file is already locked, cat will block\n\t     until the lock is acquired."

Control\n\t     characters print as ‘^X’ for control-X; the delete character\n\t     (octal 0177) prints as ‘^?’.  Non-ASCII characters (with the high\n\t     bit set) are printed as ‘M-’ (for meta) followed by the character\n\t     for the low 7 bits.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     The command:\n\n\t   cat file1\n\n     will print the contents of file1 to the standard output.\n\n     The command:\n\n\t   cat file1 file2 > file3\n\n     will sequentially print the contents of file1 and file2 to the file\n     file3, truncating file3 if it already exists.
