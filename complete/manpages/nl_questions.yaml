If file is a single dash (‘-’) or absent, nl reads from the\n     standard input.\n\n     The nl utility treats the text it reads in terms of logical pages.\n     Unless specified otherwise, line numbering is reset at the start of each\n     logical page.  A logical page consists of a header, a body and a footer\n     section; empty sections are valid.  Different line numbering options are\n     independently available for header, body and footer sections.\n\n     The starts of logical page sections are signalled by input lines\n     containing nothing but one of the following sequences of delimiter\n     characters:\n\n\t   Line      Start of\n\t   \\:\\:\\:    header\n\t   \\:\\:      body\n\t   \\:\t     footer\n\n     If the input does not contain any logical page section signalling\n     directives, the text being read is assumed to consist of a single logical\n     page body.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -b type\t\tSpecify the logical page body lines to be numbered.\n\t\t\tRecognized type arguments are:\n\n\t\t\ta\tNumber all lines.\n\n\t\t\tt\tNumber only non-empty lines.\n\n\t\t\tn\tNo line numbering.\n\n\t\t\tpexpr\tNumber only those lines that contain the basic\n\t\t\t\tregular expression specified by expr.\n\n\t\t\tThe default type for logical page body lines is t.\n\n     -d delim\t\tSpecify the delimiter characters used to indicate the\n\t\t\tstart of a logical page section in the input file.  At\n\t\t\tmost two characters may be specified; if only one\n\t\t\tcharacter is specified, the first character is\n\t\t\treplaced and the second character remains unchanged.\n\t\t\tThe default delim characters are “\\:”.\n\n     -f type\t\tSpecify the same as -b type except for logical page\n\t\t\tfooter lines.  The default type for logical page\n\t\t\tfooter lines is n.\n\n     -h type\t\tSpecify the same as -b type except for logical page\n\t\t\theader lines.  The default type for logical page\n\t\t\theader lines is n.\n\n     -i incr\t\tSpecify the increment value used to number logical\n\t\t\tpage lines.  The default incr value is 1.\n\n     -l num\t\tIf numbering of all lines is specified for the current\n\t\t\tlogical section using the corresponding -b a, -f a or\n\t\t\t-h a option, specify the number of adjacent blank\n\t\t\tlines to be considered as one.\tFor example, -l 2\n\t\t\tresults in only the second adjacent blank line being\n\t\t\tnumbered.  The default num value is 1.\n\n     -n format\t\tSpecify the line numbering output format.  Recognized\n\t\t\tformat arguments are:\n\t\t\tln\tLeft justified.\n\t\t\trn\tRight justified, leading zeros suppressed.\n\t\t\trz\tRight justified, leading zeros kept.\n\n\t\t\tThe default format is rn.\n\n     -p \t\tSpecify that line numbering should not be restarted at\n\t\t\tlogical page delimiters.\n\n     -s sep\t\tSpecify the characters used in separating the line\n\t\t\tnumber and the corresponding text line.  The default\n\t\t\tsep setting is a single tab character.\n\n     -v startnum\tSpecify the initial value used to number logical page\n\t\t\tlines; see also the description of the -p option.  The\n\t\t\tdefault startnum value is 1.\n\n     -w width\t\tSpecify the number of characters to be occupied by the\n\t\t\tline number; in case the width is insufficient to hold\n\t\t\tthe line number, it will be truncated to its width\n\t\t\tleast significant digits.  The default width is 6.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE environment variables affect\n     the execution of nl as described in environ(7).\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The nl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Number all non-blank lines:\n\n\t   $ echo -e \"This is\\n\\n\\na simple text\" | nl\n\t\t1  This is"
