- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `hdid`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nhdid(8) \t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t       hdid(8)\n\nNAME\n     hdid â€“ historical mechanism for attaching disk images\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     hdid [options] image\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     Historically, hdid was both the tool used to attach a disk image and the\n     user process used to load and decompress disk image data for the hard\n     disk image (HDI) driver in Mac OS X.  hdid exists only for backwards\n     compatibility.\n\n     As of Mac OS X 10.4, hdid invokes\n\t   hdiutil attach -agent hdid\n     which causes hdiutil(1) to behave like the historical hdid.  For example,\n     some of hdiutil attach's more modern behaviors (such as verifying images\n     which haven't been verified before) are disabled.\thdiutil(1) should be\n     used instead of hdid.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     hdiutil(1)\n\nmacOS\t\t\t\t  16 Aug 2013\t\t\t\t macOS"
