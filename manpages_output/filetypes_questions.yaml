This recognizer is large, about 276 Kilobyte of generated Tcl\n       code.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::filetype filename\n\t      This command is similar to the command fileutil::fileType.\n\n\t      The output of the command for the specified file is a string\n\t      describing the type of the file."
