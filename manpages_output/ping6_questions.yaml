Note that the specification does\n\t\t     not specify how to get responder's anycast addresses.\n\t\t     This is an experimental option."

         the current number of packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean,

         This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and

         unwise to use ping6 during normal operations or from automated scripts.

    DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
         The ping6 utility will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate
         packets should never occur when pinging a unicast address, and seem to be
         caused by inappropriate link-level retransmissions.  Duplicates may occur
         in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign, although the
         presence of low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.
         Duplicates are expected when pinging a broadcast or multicast address,
         since they are not really duplicates but replies from different hosts to
         the same request.

    HISTORY
         The ping(8) utility appeared in 4.3BSD.  The ping6 utility with IPv6
         support first appeared in the WIDE Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack kit.

         IPv6 and IPsec support based on the KAME Project (http://www.kame.net/)
         stack was initially integrated into FreeBSD 4.0.

    BUGS
         The ping6 utility is intentionally separate from ping(8).

         There have been many discussions on why we separate ping6 and ping(8).
         Some people argued that it would be more convenient to uniform the ping
         command for both IPv4 and IPv6.

         The following are an answer to the request:

         From a developer's point of view: since the underling raw sockets API is
         totally different between IPv4 and IPv6, we would end up having two types
         of code base.  There would actually be less benefit to uniform the two
         commands into a single command from the developer's standpoint.

We do not just want to know the\n     reachability to the host, but want to know the reachability to the host\n     via a particular network protocol such as IPv6.  Thus, even if we had a\n     unified ping(8) command for both IPv4 and IPv6, we would usually type a\n     -6 or -4 option (or something like those) to specify the particular\n     address family.
