All\n     children of the specified program also inherit these policies.\n\n     taskpolicy accepts the following flags and arguments:\n\n\t   -d policy  Run the program after calling setiopolicy_np(3) with an\n\t\t      iotype of IOPOL_TYPE_DISK, a scope of\n\t\t      IOPOL_SCOPE_PROCESS, and the specified policy.  The\n\t\t      argument can either be an integer, or a symbolic string\n\t\t      like \"default\" or \"throttle\", which is interpreted case-\n\t\t      insensitively."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the taskpolicy command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use taskpolicy to set a disk I/O policy of 'throttle' for the program 'myapp' with default scheduling settings?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using taskpolicy to change the I/O policy and scheduling priority for a running process with PID 1234?
