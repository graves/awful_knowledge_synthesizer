It\n     operates by sending commands to the Xsan file system management daemon\n     xsand.  xsanctl must be run by the superuser.\n\nCOMMANDS\n     xsanctl provides the following commands:\n\n   Primary commands\n     These commands are the primary ones needed for SAN management.\n\n     help\t  Display a list of the available xsanctl commands.\n\n     ping\t  Sends a ‘ping’ message to xsand.  This can be used to verify\n\t\t  that xsand is responding to management requests.\n\n     mount volumeName [options]\n\t\t  Creates the volume mount device for volume volumeName.  If\n\t\t  any mount options are given, xsand updates the local mount\n\t\t  options for the volume before creating the volume mount\n\t\t  device.  diskarbitrationd will mount the volume after the\n\t\t  volume mount device is created.  This is the preferred\n\t\t  method of mounting Xsan volumes from the command line.\n\n\t\t  [options] include those options recognized by mount_acfs and\n\t\t  three others:\n\n\t\t  --at\n\t\t      Specify a non-standard path at which to mount the\n\t\t  volume.\n\n\t\t  --rw\n\t\t      Mount the volume for both reading and writing. This\n\t\t  behavior is the default.\n\n\t\t  --ro\n\t\t      Mount the volume read-only.\n\n\t\t  --clusteriosize=size\n\t\t      Specify the maximum I/O transfer size (in bytes) that\n\t\t  the cluster layer can submit to the file system's IO\n\t\t  strategy routine. The minimum value allowed is 1MB and the\n\t\t  maximum value allowed is 32MB. The default value is set to\n\t\t  8MB when the option is not specified.\n\n\t\t  mount_acfs options should be preceded by two dashes. For\n\t\t  instance, the number of kernel threads will increase to\n\t\t  twenty as a result of this option: --threads=20.\n\n     unmount volumeName [options]\n\t\t  Unmounts the volume volumeName.\n\n\t\t  --force\n\n\t\t       Force the unmount. This operation may cause data loss\n\n\t\t  Previous versions of Xsan explicitly forced mounting of\n\t\t  selected volumes.  This version of Xsan creates volume mount\n\t\t  devices for all on-line and connected volumes and leaves\n\t\t  mount state control to disk arbitration.\n\n     list\t  Displays a list of the available volumes.\n\n     createSan sanName [createMaster arguments]\n\t\t  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on\n\t\t  xsand running.  This subcommand creates a new SAN with this\n\t\t  computer as the only controller. The SAN's name is sanName\n\t\t  and may not begin with a dash. This subcommand has two\n\t\t  variants. In both forms, it creates a new Xsan SAN. The\n\t\t  subcommand's behavior depends on the configuration state of\n\t\t  Open Directory when it runs.\tXsan controllers must be Open\n\t\t  Directory controllers for the cluster containing the SAN\n\t\t  configuration. If the computer is not an Open Directory\n\t\t  controller this subcommand configures the computer to be the\n\t\t  master of a new Open Directory cluster, and then creates the\n\t\t  SAN using that cluster.\n\n\t\t  The subcommand options supplied after the SAN name are\n\t\t  examined in the case where the computer is not an Open\n\t\t  Directory controller. In this case, they are processed as if\n\t\t  the createMaster subcommand had been run. In the case where\n\t\t  the computer is already an Open Directory controller, none\n\t\t  of the additional command options are valid.\n\n     listSan\t  Displays a list of available Xsan SANs in the local network.\n\t\t  This subcommand does not depend on xsand running.\n\n     joinSan sanName [options] [createReplica arguments]\n\t\t  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on\n\t\t  xsand running.  This subcommand joins this computer with an\n\t\t  existing SAN as a metadata controller. This computer will be\n\t\t  an additional metadata controller for an existing SAN. The\n\t\t  subcommand's behavior depends on the configuration state of\n\t\t  Open Directory when it runs.\tXsan controllers must be Open\n\t\t  Directory controllers for the cluster containing the SAN\n\t\t  configuration. If the computer is not an Open Directory\n\t\t  controller, this subcommand configures the computer to be a\n\t\t  replica in the Open Directory cluster, and then joins the\n\t\t  SAN using that cluster.\n\n\t\t  The subcommand options supplied after the joinSAN options\n\t\t  are examined in the case where the computer is not an Open\n\t\t  Directory controller. In this case, they are processed as if\n\t\t  the createReplica subcommand had been run. In the case where\n\t\t  the computer is already an Open Directory controller, none\n\t\t  of the additional createReplica command options are valid.\n\n\t\t  --controller-name ControllerName\n\n\t\t       Specify the metadata controller name in the SAN in\n\t\t  which this computer wants to join.\n\n\t\t  --controller-user ControllerUserName\n\n\t\t       Specify the administrator name for the metadata\n\t\t  controller in which this computer wants to join.\n\n\t\t  --controller-pass ControllerPassword\n\n\t\t       Specify the administrator password for the metadata\n\t\t  controller in which this computer wants to join.\n\n     leaveSan\t  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on\n\t\t  xsand running.  This subcommand removes this computer as a\n\t\t  metadata controller from an existing SAN.\n\n     removeControllerFromSan controllerName\n\t\t  This subcommand removes the specified computer as a metadata\n\t\t  controller from an existing SAN.\n\n     destroySan   This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on\n\t\t  xsand running.  This subcommand sets the SAN configuration\n\t\t  for this system's SAN to dead and updates the configuration\n\t\t  in LDAP. It also posts a configuration update message to the\n\t\t  SAN. Note: this command does NOT gracefully stop the SAN.\n\t\t  Controllers and clients may need to be rebooted if they do\n\t\t  not cleanly stop.  Use with care. This operation can not be\n\t\t  undone.\n\n     exportClientProfile\n\t\t  Exports Xsan configuration profile which can be installed on\n\t\t  clients with Profile Manager.\n\n\t\t  --path dirPath\n\n\t\t       Specify the directory path in which the configuration\n\t\t  profile will be created. If this option is not selected, the\n\t\t  current working directory path will be used.\n\n\t\t  --output outputFile\n\n\t\t       Specify the file name to use for the configuration\n\t\t  profile. If this option is not selected, the name of the SAN\n\t\t  will be used as a default.\n\n     addVolume volumeName [addOrEditVolumeOptions]\n\t\t  This subcommand creates a new volume named volumeName.  The\n\t\t  command options used to describe a new volume's format are\n\t\t  described in the VOLUME DESCRIPTION section below. The\n\t\t  volume will be hosted on all current controllers, and will\n\t\t  be started after creation. A new volume will consist of one\n\t\t  or more Storage pools.  One or more Storage pools must\n\t\t  contain metadata, One or more Storage pools must contain\n\t\t  userdata, and exactly one Storage pool must contain the\n\t\t  journal.\n\n     editVolume volumeName [addOrEditVolumeOptions]\n\t\t  This subcommand edits the settings for an existing volume\n\t\t  named volumeName.  The command options used to describe\n\t\t  volume's settings are described in the VOLUME DESCRIPTION\n\t\t  section below. Many of the volume settings set at addVolume\n\t\t  time may be subsequently changed. The ones which can not are\n\t\t  documented in that section. This subcommand can also add new\n\t\t  Storage pools to the volume.\n\n     dropVolume [option] volumeName\n\t\t  Removes a volume from SAN. This subcommand must be run as\n\t\t  root. Note: the clients may need to be rebooted if '--force'\n\t\t  option fails to cleanly stop the clients.\n\n\t\t  --force\n\n\t\t       Force the deletion even the volume is still mounted by\n\t\t  the clients\n\n     startVolume volumeName\n\t\t  Start the volume volumeName.\tThis subcommand must be run as\n\t\t  root.\n\n     stopVolume [option] volumeName\n\t\t  Stops the volume volumeName.\tFurther operations to the\n\t\t  volume will be blocked in clients until the volume is\n\t\t  started. This subcommand must be run as root.\n\n\t\t  --force\n\n\t\t       Force the stop even the volume is still mounted by the\n\t\t  clients\n\n     dumpVolumeConfig [option]\n\t\t  Prints the Xsan volume configuration(s) hosted on the local\n\t\t  machine as JSON.\n\n\t\t  --volume\n\n\t\t       The name of the volume to print. If specified, only the\n\t\t  volume with the same name will get printed.\n\n     unloadProfile\n\t\t  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on\n\t\t  xsand running. This subcommand unloads any profiles\n\t\t  configuring Xsan which were not installed by Profile\n\t\t  Manager.  Profile removal will wipe the local Xsan\n\t\t  configuration.\n\n   Secondary commands\n     These commands are less-frequently used commands for SAN management.\n\n     changeIP oldIP newIP [oldHostName newHostName]\n\t\t  This subcommand must be run as root.\tThis subcommand\n\t\t  changes the SAN configuration locally and in LDAP if the\n\t\t  current Xsan address is oldIP.  newIP is used in its place.\n\t\t  If the fully-qualified domain name oldHostName is also\n\t\t  passed as an arguement, the host name retained in the LDAP\n\t\t  configuration for this host is changed to newHostName.\n\t\t  Please ensure that all controllers have the SSL certificate\n\t\t  for newHostName before running this command. Changing the\n\t\t  host name of a controller will cause all clients in the SAN\n\t\t  to re-read the controller certificates.\n\n     createMaster\n\t\t  Creates a new master LDAP server and a new directory node\n\t\t  administrator.\n\n\t\t  --cert-auth-name CertAuthName\n\n\t\t       Specify the name to be used for Certificate Authority.\n\n\t\t  --cert-admin-email CertAdminEmail\n\n\t\t       Specify the email address to be used for Certificate\n\t\t  Authority admin.\n\n\t\t  --user AdminFullName\n\n\t\t       Specify the full name for the new administrator\n\t\t  account.\n\n\t\t  --account AdminAccountShortName\n\n\t\t       Specify the username for the new administrator account.\n\n\t\t  --pass AdminPassword\n\n\t\t       Specify the password for the new administrator account."

A Storage Pool's description begins with a --storagePool argument\n     which specifies the Storage Pool's name. Subsequent arguments control the\n     content stored in the pool and add LUNs to the pool. A pool's description\n     ends when a subsequent --storagePool argument starts the next pool, or\n     the command line ends. Storage Pool names must be unique within the\n     volume.\n\n     As every volume requires one pool containing metadata and the journal,\n     the --defaultFirstPool argument facilitates quickly creating such a\n     Storage Pool. This argument is equivalent to this sequence of command\n     arguments: --storagePool MetadataAndJournal --metadata --journal Further,\n     this Storage Pool is placed at the beginning of the Storage Pool list,\n     regardless of where this argument is located in the command line. For\n     typical usage, the only arguments needed for this storage pool are to add\n     one or more LUNs to the pool.\n\n     If none of the content types are set on a Storage Pool, it defaults to\n     contain userdata.\n\n     --storagePool StoragePoolName\n\t      Begin specifying a storage pool named StoragePoolName.

This Storage Pool is placed\n\t      at the beginning of the Storage Pool list, regardless of where\n\t      this argument is located on the command line.  This argument\n\t      implicitly ends any preceding Storage Pool description.\n\n     --metadata\n\t      This Storage Pool may contain metadata.\n\n     --journal\n\t      This Storage Pool will contain the journal.\n\n     --data   This Storage Pool may contain userdata.\n\n     --any    Shorthand for specifying --metadata --data --journal\n\n     --addLUN DiskLabelName\n\t      Add a disk to the Storage Pool.

This Storage Pool will contain two LUNs named\n\t      thirdAcreOfData and fourthAcreOfData.\n\nCAUTION\n     The pushConfigUpdate and ldapConfigChanged verbs can permanently damage a\n     SANs configuration when run on a controller if LDAP replication is not\n     functioning correctly. These verbs assume that the local LDAP node\n     contains a correct configuration for the SAN, and can lose data if this\n     assumption is incorrect.\n\n     The pushConfigUpdate verb especially can be dangerous if the local LDAP\n     configuration is not current. Any local differences between it and the\n     state in the /Library/Preferences/Xsan configuration files will trigger\n     an update to the local LDAP which the SAN will then take as the most-up-\n     to-date configuration.\n\n     Specifically, if a volume has been created in the SAN but it is not\n     described in the LDAP configuration of a controller executing\n     pushConfigUpdate, this volume's configuration will be lost and any\n     controller currently hosting it will stop.
