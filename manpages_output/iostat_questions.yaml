The first statistics that are printed are averaged over\n     the system uptime.  To get information about the current activity, a\n     suitable wait time should be specified, so that the subsequent sets of\n     printed statistics will be averaged over that time.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -?    Display a usage statement and exit.\n\n     -c    Repeat the display count times.  If no wait interval is specified,\n\t   the default is 1 second.\n\n     -C    Display CPU statistics.  This is on by default, unless -d is\n\t   specified.\n\n     -d    Display only device statistics.  If this flag is turned on, only\n\t   device statistics will be displayed, unless -C or -U or -T is also\n\t   specified to enable the display of CPU, load average or TTY\n\t   statistics."
