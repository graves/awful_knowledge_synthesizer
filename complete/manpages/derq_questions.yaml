This forces derq to treat the input as a raw DER object.\n\t      Particularly this means that if a V1 entitlements is passed in,\n\t      the active context will be set to the outer metadata object, and\n\t      not the inner entitlements dictionary.\n\n     --xml    Instruct the macho or csops subcommands to query the embedded\n\t      XML blob instead of the embedded DER blob. Using this flag on\n\t      the query command will change the the output format to be an XML\n\t      plist.\n\n     -i input\n\t      Allows you to specify which file should be used as the input.\n\t      If not specified \"-\" is assumed, which signfies that the input\n\t      will follow on stdin.\n\n     -o output\n\t      Allows you to specify which file should be used as the output.\n\t      If not specified \"-\" is assumed, which signfies that derq should\n\t      use stdout for output.\n\n     -p pid   Specifies the pid of a running process from which derq should\n\t      extract the DER entitlements blob to be used as input.\n\n     -f format\n\t      Specifies what format the input is. If this flag isn't passed in\n\t      DER is assumed. The other supported format is \"xml.\"\n\n     query statements ...\n\t      A space seperated list of operations to be exected left-to-\n\t      right. The operation syntax is described in SYNTAX.\n\nSYNTAX\n     DERQL has very simplistic syntax that consists of a series of operations\n     that are executed one after another. Execution stops either when the last\n     operation is executed or an operation induces the execution engine into\n     an invalid state.\tThere are many operations that can produce an invalid\n     state, such as selecting a key that doesn't exist, or indexing an array\n     past the bounds. Invalid state is also produced when a matching operation\n     fails.\n\n     Currently derq supports 4 operations:\n\n\t   CESelectIndex\n\t   This operation selects an index in a zero indexed array. Any query\n\t   statement that starts with a number character (0-9) implies the\n\t   start of a CESelectIndex operation. Example invocation: invocatio:\n\n\t\t % derq query -i - -o - 1\n\n\t   Will select the second element in the array passed in on stdin and\n\t   output the selected value to stdout.\n\n\t   CESelectDictValue\n\t   This operation selects the value associated with the passed in key\n\t   in the actively selected dictionary. Any query statement that does\n\t   not imply any operation will be parsed as CESelectDictValue.\n\t   Meaning that any query statement that starts with an alphanumeric\n\t   sequence will be treated as a CESelectDictValue operation. Example:\n\n\t\t % derq query application-identifier\n\n\t   Will select the value that belongs to the key\n\t   \"application-identifier\" from the dictionary passed in on stdin and\n\t   output the selected value to stdout.\n\n\t   CEMatchBool\n\t   This operation produces a valid output if the currently selected\n\t   value is a boolean that has the value of true. Execution of this\n\t   operation does not modify the selection. Any query statement that\n\t   starts with \"?\" signifies this operation. Example:\n\n\t\t % derq query get-task-allow ?\n\n\t   Will return a valid boolean only if the value for the key\n\t   \"get-task-allow\" is a boolean and has the value of true.\n\n\t   CEMatchString\n\t   This operation produces a valid output if the currently selected\n\t   value is a string that is equal to the passed in value.  Execution\n\t   of this operation does not modify the selection. Any query\n\t   statement that starts with \"=\" signifies this operation. Example:\n\n\t\t % derq query useractivity-team-identifier =appleiwork\n\n\t   Will return a valid string only if the value for the key\n\t   \"useractivity-team-identifier\" is exactly equal to \"appleiwork\".\n\nEXAMPLES\n     To check if a file has the string \"secret-entitlement\" as the first value\n     in an array in a file named \"application.entitlements\":\n\t   % derq query -i application.entitlements 0 =secret-entitlement"
