Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `parray`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n       Tcl includes a library of Tcl procedures for commonly-needed functions.\n       The procedures defined in the Tcl library are generic ones suitable for\n       use by many different applications.  The location of the Tcl library is\n       returned by the info library command.  In addition to the Tcl library,\n       each application will normally have its own library of support\n       procedures as well;  the location of this library is normally given by\n       the value of the $app_library global variable, where app is the name of\n       the application.  For example, the location of the Tk library is kept\n       in the variable $tk_library.\n\n       To access the procedures in the Tcl library, an application should\n       source the file init.tcl in the library, for example with the Tcl\n       command\n\t      source [file join [info library] init.tcl]\n       If the library procedure Tcl_Init is invoked from an application's\n       Tcl_AppInit procedure, this happens automatically.  The code in\n       init.tcl will define the unknown procedure and arrange for the other\n       procedures to be loaded on-demand using the auto-load mechanism defined\n       below."

If not, it returns an empty string.  This command\n\t      examines the directories in the current search path (given by\n\t      the PATH environment variable) in its search for an executable\n\t      file named cmd.  On Windows platforms, the search is expanded\n\t      with the same directories and file extensions as used by exec.\n\t      Auto_execok remembers information about previous searches in an\n\t      array named auto_execs;  this avoids the path search in future\n\t      calls for the same cmd.  The command auto_reset may be used to\n\t      force auto_execok to forget its cached information.\n\n       auto_import pattern\n\t      Auto_import is invoked during namespace import to see if the\n\t      imported commands specified by pattern reside in an autoloaded\n\t      library.\tIf so, the commands are loaded so that they will be\n\t      available to the interpreter for creating the import links.  If\n\t      the commands do not reside in an autoloaded library, auto_import\n\t      does nothing.  The pattern matching is performed according to\n\t      the matching rules of namespace import."

To do this, it searches an auto-load path, which is\n\t      a list of one or more directories.  The auto-load path is given\n\t      by the global variable $auto_path if it exists.  If there is no\n\t      $auto_path variable, then the TCLLIBPATH environment variable is\n\t      used, if it exists.  Otherwise the auto-load path consists of\n\t      just the Tcl library directory.  Within each directory in the\n\t      auto-load path there must be a file tclIndex that describes one\n\t      or more commands defined in that directory and a script to\n\t      evaluate to load each of the commands.  The tclIndex file should\n\t      be generated with the auto_mkindex command.  If cmd is found in\n\t      an index file, then the appropriate script is evaluated to\n\t      create the command.  The auto_load command returns 1 if cmd was\n\t      successfully created.  The command returns 0 if there was no\n\t      index entry for cmd or if the script did not actually define cmd\n\t      (e.g. because index information is out of date).\tIf an error\n\t      occurs while processing the script, then that error is returned.\n\t      Auto_load only reads the index information once and saves it in\n\t      the array auto_index;  future calls to auto_load check for cmd\n\t      in the array rather than re-reading the index files.  The cached\n\t      index information may be deleted with the command auto_reset.\n\t      This will force the next auto_load command to reload the index\n\t      database from disk."

If no pattern is given a pattern of *.tcl will\n\t      be assumed.
