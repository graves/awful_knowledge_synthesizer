With no\n     arguments, lastcomm prints information about all the commands recorded\n     during the current accounting file's lifetime.\n\n     Option:\n\n     -f file\t Read from file rather than the default accounting file.\n\n     -w \t Use as many columns as needed to print the output instead of\n\t\t limiting it to 80.  This is the default behavior on Apple\n\t\t systems.\n\n     If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a matching command\n     name, user name, or terminal name are printed.  So, for example:\n\n\t   lastcomm a.out root ttyd0\n\n     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands named a.out by\n     user root on the terminal ttyd0.\n\n     For each process entry, the following are printed."
