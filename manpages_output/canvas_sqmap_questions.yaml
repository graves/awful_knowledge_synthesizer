The tiles are the background of\n       the canvas, with all other canvas items added always shown in front of\n       them. The number of tiles shown, tile size, and where to get the images\n       to show are all configurable."

It\n\t      specifies the height of the cells the background is made up of.\n\n       -grid-cell-command\n\t      The value for this option is a command prefix. It is invoked\n\t      whenever the canvas needs the image for a specific cell of the\n\t      background, with two additional arguments, the id of the cell,\n\t      and a command prefix to invoke when the image is ready, or known\n\t      to not exist.\n\n\t      The id of the cell is a 2-element list containing the row and\n\t      column number of the cell, in this order. The result command\n\t      prefix (named \"$result\" in the example below) has to be invoked\n\t      with either two or three arguments, i.e."

In that case the only images shown in grid cells are\n\t      those explicitly set with the method image set, see the next\n\t      section. All other grid cells will simply be empty.\n\n       -viewport-command\n\t      This option specifies a command prefix to invoke when the\n\t      viewport of the canvas is changed, to allow users keep track of\n\t      where in the scroll-region we are at all times. This can be\n\t      used, for example, to drive derivate displays, or to keep items\n\t      in view by moving them as the viewport moves.\n\n       -image-on-load\n\t      The value for this option is an image.

The cell is given as a 2-element list containing\n\t      row and column number, in this order.\n\n\t      Note that an image is allowed to be associated with and\n\t      displayed in multiple cells of the canvas.\n\n       canvasName image unset cell\n\t      Invoking this method declares the specified cell of the\n\t      background as empty, an existing image shown by this cell will\n\t      be forgotten.  The cell is given as a 2-element list containing\n\t      row and column number, in this order.\n\n       canvasName flush\n\t      Invoking this method forces the canvas to completely reload the\n\t      images for all cells. Do not use this method if the canvas is\n\t      operated without a -grid-cell-command, as in that case the\n\t      canvas will simply forget all images without being able to\n\t      reload them.\n\nIMAGE OWNERSHIP\n       Note that the canvas does not take ownership of the images it shows in\n       the background. In other words, when we say that the canvas forgets an\n       image this means only that the association between a grid cell and\n       shown image is broken. The image is not deleted. Managing the lifecycle\n       of the images shown by the canvas is responsibility of the user of the\n       canvas."
