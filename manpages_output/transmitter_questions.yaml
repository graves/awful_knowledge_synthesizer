This object command is\n\t      explained in full detail in the sections Object command and\n\t      Object methods. The set of supported options is explained in\n\t      section Options.\n\n\t      The object command will be created under the current namespace\n\t      if the objectName is not fully qualified, and in the specified\n\t      namespace otherwise.  The fully qualified name of the object\n\t      command is returned as the result of the command.\n\n       transfer::transmitter stream channel chan host port ?arg...?\n\t      This method creates a fire-and-forget transfer for the data\n\t      contained in the channel chan, starting at the current seek\n\t      location. The channel is configured to use binary translation\n\t      and encoding for the transfer.  The channel is automatically\n\t      closed when the transfer has completed.\n\n\t      If both host and port are provided an active connection to the\n\t      destination is made. If only a port is specified (with host the\n\t      empty string) then a passive connection is made instead.\n\n\t      Any arguments after the port are treated as options and are used\n\t      to configure the internal transmitter object.  See the section\n\t      Options for a list of the supported options and their meaning.\n\t      Note however that the signature of the command prefix specified\n\t      for the -command callback differs from the signature for the\n\t      same option of the transmitter object.  This callback is only\n\t      given the number of bytes and transfered, and possibly an error\n\t      message. No reference to the internally used transmitter object\n\t      is made.\n\n\t      The result returned by the command is the empty string if it was\n\t      set to make an active connection, and the port the internal\n\t      transmitter object is listening on otherwise, i.e when it is\n\t      configured to connect passively.\tSee also the package\n\t      transfer::connect and the description of the method connect for\n\t      where this behaviour comes from.\n\n       transfer::transmitter stream file path host port ?arg...?\n\t      This method is like stream channel, except that the data\n\t      contained in the file path is transfered.\n\n   OBJECT COMMAND\n       All objects created by the ::transfer::transmitter command have the\n       following general form:\n\n       objectName method ?arg arg ...?\n\t      The method method and its arg'uments determine the exact\n\t      behavior of the command.\tSee section Object methods for the\n\t      detailed specifications.\n\n   OBJECT METHODS\n       objectName destroy\n\t      This method destroys the object. Doing so while a transmission\n\t      is in progress will cause errors later on, when the transmission\n\t      completes and tries to access the now missing data structures of\n\t      the destroyed object.\n\n       objectName start\n\t      This method initiates the data transmission, setting up the\n\t      connection first and then copying the information.  The method\n\t      will throw an error if a transmission is already/still in\n\t      progress.  I.e. it is not possible to run two transmissions in\n\t      parallel on a single object, only in sequence. Multiple\n\t      transmitter objects are needed to manage parallel transfers, one\n\t      per transmission.  Errors will also be thrown if the\n\t      configuration of the data source is invalid, or if no completion\n\t      callback was specified.\n\n\t      The result returned by the method is the empty string for an\n\t      object configured to make an active connection, and the port the\n\t      object is listening on otherwise, i.e when it is configured to\n\t      connect passively.  See also the package transfer::connect and\n\t      the description of the method connect for where this behaviour\n\t      comes from.\n\n       objectName busy\n\t      This method returns a boolean value telling us whether a\n\t      transmission is in progress (True), or not (False).\n\n   OPTIONS\n       All transmitter objects support the union of the options supported by\n       their connect and data source components, plus two of their own.  See\n       also the documentation for the packages transfer::data::source and\n       transfer::connect.\n\n       -blocksize int\n\t      This option specifies the size of the chunks to be transmitted\n\t      in one block. Usage is optional, its default value is 1024.\n\n       -command cmdprefix\n\t      This option specifies the command to invoke when the\n\t      transmission of the information has been completed.  The\n\t      arguments given to this command are the same as given to the\n\t      completion callback of the command transfer::copy::do provided\n\t      by the package transfer::copy.\n\n       -mode mode\n\t      This option specifies the mode the object is in. It is optional\n\t      and defaults to active mode. The two possible modes are:\n\n\t      active In this mode the two options -host and -port are relevant\n\t\t     and specify the host and TCP port the object has to\n\t\t     connect to. The host is given by either name or IP\n\t\t     address.\n\n\t      passive\n\t\t     In this mode the option -host has no relevance and is\n\t\t     ignored should it be configured.  The only option the\n\t\t     object needs is -port, and it specifies the TCP port on\n\t\t     which the listening socket is opened to await the\n\t\t     connection from the partner.\n\n       -host hostname-or-ipaddr\n\t      This option specifies the host to connect to in active mode,\n\t      either by name or ip-address. An object configured for passive\n\t      mode ignores this option.\n\n       -port int\n\t      For active mode this option specifies the port the object is\n\t      expected to connect to. For passive mode however it is the port\n\t      where the object creates the listening socket waiting for a\n\t      connection. It defaults to 0, which allows the OS to choose the\n\t      actual port to listen on.\n\n       -socketcmd command\n\t      This option allows the user to specify which command to use to\n\t      open a socket. The default is to use the builtin ::socket. Any\n\t      compatible with that command is allowed.\n\n\t      The envisioned main use is the specfication of tls::socket. I.e.\n\t      this option allows the creation of secure transfer channels,\n\t      without making this package explicitly dependent on the tls\n\t      package.\n\n\t      See also section Secure connections.\n\n       -encoding encodingname\n\n       -eofchar eofspec\n\n       -translation transspec\n\t      These options are the same as are recognized by the builtin\n\t      command fconfigure. They provide the configuration to be set for\n\t      the channel between the two partners after it has been\n\t      established, but before the callback is invoked (See method\n\t      connect).\n\n       -string text\n\t      This option specifies that the source of the data is an\n\t      immediate string, and its associated argument contains the\n\t      string in question.\n\n       -channel handle\n\t      This option specifies that the source of the data is a channel,\n\t      and its associated argument is the handle of the channel\n\t      containing the data.\n\n       -file path\n\t      This option specifies that the source of the data is a file, and\n\t      its associated argument is the path of the file containing the\n\t      data.\n\n       -variable varname\n\t      This option specifies that the source of the data is a string\n\t      stored in a variable, and its associated argument contains the\n\t      name of the variable in question. The variable is assumed to be\n\t      global or namespaced, anchored at the global namespace.\n\n       -size int\n\t      This option specifies the size of the data transfer. It is\n\t      optional and defaults to -1. This value, and any other value\n\t      less than zero signals to transfer all the data from the source.\n\n       -progress command\n\t      This option, if specified, defines a command to be invoked for\n\t      each chunk of bytes transmitted, allowing the user to monitor\n\t      the progress of the transmission of the data. The callback is\n\t      always invoked with one additional argument, the number of bytes\n\t      transmitted so far.\n\nSECURE CONNECTIONS\n       One way to secure connections made by objects of this package is to\n       require the package tls and then configure the option -socketcmd to\n       force the use of command tls::socket to open the socket.\n\n\t   # Load and initialize tls\n\t   package require tls\n\t   tls::init -cafile /path/to/ca/cert -keyfile ...\n\n\t   # Create a connector with secure socket setup,\n\t   transfer::transmitter T -socketcmd tls::socket ...\n\t   ..."
