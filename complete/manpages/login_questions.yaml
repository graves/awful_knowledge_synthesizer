Authentication of users\n     is configurable via pam(8).  Password authentication is the default.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -f      When a user name is specified, this option indicates that proper\n\t     authentication has already been done and that no password need be\n\t     requested.  This option may only be used by the super-user or\n\t     when an already logged in user is logging in as themselves.\n\n\t     With the -f option, an alternate program (and any arguments) may\n\t     be run instead of the user's default shell.  The program and\n\t     arguments follows the user name."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `login`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-h      Specify the host from which the connection was received.  It is\n\t     used by various daemons such as telnetd(8).  This option may only\n\t     be used by the super-user.\n\n     -l      Tells the program executed by login that this is not a login\n\t     session (by convention, a login session is signalled to the\n\t     program with a hyphen as the first character of argv[0]; this\n\t     option disables that), and prevents it from chdir(2)ing to the\n\t     user's home directory.  The default is to add the hyphen (this is\n\t     a login session).\n\n     -p      By default, login discards any previous environment.  The -p\n\t     option disables this behavior.\n\n     -q      This forces quiet logins, as if a .hushlogin is present.\n\n     If the file /etc/nologin exists, login dislays its contents to the user\n     and exits.  This is used by shutdown(8) to prevent users from logging in\n     when the system is about to go down.\n\n     Immediately after logging a user in, login displays the system copyright\n     notice, the date and time the user last logged in, the message of the day\n     as well as other information.  If the file .hushlogin exists in the\n     user's home directory, all of these messages are suppressed.  If -q is\n     specified, all of these messages are suppressed.  This is to simplify\n     logins for non-human users, such as uucp(1).  login then records an entry\n     in utmpx(5) and the like, and executes the user's command interpreter (or\n     the program specified on the command line if -f is specified)."
