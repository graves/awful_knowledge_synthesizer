As a result, comm works\n       with multiple interpreters, works on Windows and Macintosh systems, and\n       provides control over the remote execution path.\n\n       This document contains a specification of the various versions of the\n       wire protocol used by comm internally for the communication between its\n       endpoints. It has no relevance to users of comm, only to developers who\n       wish to modify the package, write a compatible facility in a different\n       language, or some other facility based on the same protocol.\n\nWIRE PROTOCOL VERSION 3\n   BASIC LAYER\n       The basic encoding for all data is UTF-8. Because of this binary data,\n       including the NULL character, can be sent over the wire as is, without\n       the need for armoring it.\n\n   BASIC MESSAGE LAYER\n       On top of the Basic Layer we have a message oriented exchange of data.\n       The totality of all characters written to the channel is a Tcl list,\n       with each element a separate message, each itself a list. The messages\n       in the overall list are separated by EOL. Note that EOL characters can\n       occur within the list as well. They can be distinguished from the\n       message-separating EOL by the fact that the data from the beginning up\n       to their location is not a valid Tcl list.\n\n       EOL is signaled through the linefeed character, i.e LF, or, hex 0x0a.\n       This is following the unix convention for line-endings.\n\n       As a list each message is composed of words. Their meaning depends on\n       when the message was sent in the overall exchange. This is described in\n       the upcoming sections.\n\n   NEGOTIATION MESSAGES - INITIAL HANDSHAKE\n       The command protocol is defined like this:\n\n       •      The first message send by a client to a server, when opening the\n\t      connection, contains two words. The first word is a list as\n\t      well, and contains the versions of the wire protocol the client\n\t      is willing to accept, with the most preferred version first. The\n\t      second word is the TCP port the client is listening on for\n\t      connections to itself. The value 0 is used here to signal that\n\t      the client will not listen for connections, i.e. that it is\n\t      purely for sending commands, and not receiving them.\n\n       •      The first message sent by the server to the client, in response\n\t      to the message above contains only one word. This word is a\n\t      list, containing the string vers as its first element, and the\n\t      version of the wire protocol the server has selected from the\n\t      offered versions as the second.\n\n   SCRIPT/COMMAND MESSAGES\n       All messages coming after the initial handshake consist of three words.\n       These are an instruction, a transaction id, and the payload. The valid\n       instructions are shown below. The transaction ids are used by the\n       client to match any incoming replies to the command messages it sent.\n       This means that a server has to copy the transaction id from a command\n       message to the reply it sends for that message.\n\n       send\n\n       async\n\n       command\n\t      The payload is the Tcl script to execute on the server. It is\n\t      actually a list containing the script fragments. These fragment\n\t      are concatenated together by the server to form the full script\n\t      to execute on the server side.  This emulates the Tcl \"eval\"\n\t      semantics.  In most cases it is best to have only one word in\n\t      the list, a list containing the exact command.\n\n\t      Examples:"
