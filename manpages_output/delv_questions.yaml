    Manpage text:

    By default, responses are validated using built-in DNSSEC trust anchors
           for the root zone (".") and for the ISC DNSSEC lookaside validation
           zone ("dlv.isc.org"). Records returned by delv are either fully
           validated or were not signed. If validation fails, an explanation of
           the failure is included in the output; the validation process can be
           traced in detail. Because delv does not rely on an external server to
           carry out validation, it can be used to check the validity of DNS
           responses in environments where local name servers may not be
           trustworthy.

           Unless it is told to query a specific name server, delv will try each
           of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable server
           addresses are found, delv will send queries to the localhost addresses
           (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).

           When no command line arguments or options are given, delv will perform
           an NS query for "." (the root zone).

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `delv`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSIMPLE USAGE\n       A typical invocation of delv looks like:\n\n\t    delv @server name type\n\n       where:\n\n       server\n\t   is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be\n\t   an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in\n\t   colon-delimited notation. When the supplied server argument is a\n\t   hostname, delv resolves that name before querying that name server\n\t   (note, however, that this initial lookup is not validated by\n\t   DNSSEC).\n\n\t   If no server argument is provided, delv consults /etc/resolv.conf;\n\t   if an address is found there, it queries the name server at that\n\t   address. If either of the -4 or -6 options are in use, then only\n\t   addresses for the corresponding transport will be tried. If no\n\t   usable addresses are found, delv will send queries to the localhost\n\t   addresses (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).\n\n       name\n\t   is the domain name to be looked up.\n\n       type\n\t   indicates what type of query is required — ANY, A, MX, etc.\ttype\n\t   can be any valid query type. If no type argument is supplied, delv\n\t   will perform a lookup for an A record."
