There is one\n     line in the ttys file per special device file.  Fields are separated by\n     tabs and/or spaces.  Fields comprised of more than one word should be\n     enclosed in double quotes (``\"'').  Blank lines and comments may appear\n     anywhere in the file; comments are delimited by hash marks (``#'') and\n     new lines.  Any unspecified fields will default to null.\n\n     The first field is normally the name of the terminal special file as it\n     is found in /dev.\tHowever, it can be any arbitrary string when the\n     associated command is not related to a tty.\n\n     The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line,\n     usually getty(8), which initializes and opens the line, setting the\n     speed, waiting for a user name and executing the login(1) program.  It\n     can be, however, any desired command, for example the start up for a\n     window system terminal emulator or some other daemon process, and can\n     contain multiple words if quoted."

    Manpage text:

    The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that tty
         line, normally the one found in the termcap(5) data base file.  The
         environment variable TERM is initialized with the value by either
         getty(8) or login(1).

         The remaining fields set flags in the ty_status entry (see getttyent(3)),
         specify a window system process that launchd(8) will maintain for the
         terminal line, optionally determine the type of tty (whether dialin,
         network or otherwise), or specify a tty group name that allows the login
         class database (see login.conf(5)) to refer to many ttys as a group, to
         selectively allow or deny access or enable or disable accounting
         facilities for ttys as a group.

         As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that launchd(8)
         should (should not) execute the command given in the second field.
         ``onifconsole'' will cause this line to be enabled if and only if it is
         an active kernel console device (it is equivalent to ``on'' in this
         case).  The flag ``onifexists'' will cause this line to be enabled if and
         only if the name exists.  If the name starts with a ``/'', it will be
         considered an absolute path.  Otherwise, it is considered a path relative
         to /dev.  The flag ``secure'' (if the console is enabled) allows users
         with a uid of 0 to login on this line.  The flag ``dialup'' indicates
         that a tty entry describes a dialin line, and ``network'' is obsolete and
         does nothing.  Either of these strings may also be specified in the
         terminal type field.  The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted
         command string which launchd(8) will execute before starting the command
         specified by the second field.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ttys`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe string ``group='' may be followed by a group name comprised of\n     alphanumeric characters that can be used by login.conf(5) to refer to\n     many tty lines as a group to enable or disable access and accounting\n     facilities.  If no group is specified, then the tty becomes a member of\n     the group \"none\".\tFor backwards compatibility, the ``group='' should\n     appear last on the line, immediately before the optional comment.\n\n     Both the second field and any command specified with ``window='' will be\n     split into words and executed using execve(2).  Words are separated by\n     any combinations of tabs and spaces.  Arguments containing whitespace\n     should be enclosed in single quotes (').  Note that no shell-style\n     globbing or other variable substitution occurs.\n\nFILES\n     /etc/ttys\n\nNUMERIC SEQUENCES\n     Numeric sequences of terminals can be represented in a more compact\n     format.  A matching pair of square bracket may enclose two numbers (the\n     start and stop values), separated by a hyphen.  The numbers are assumed\n     to be decimal, unless prefixed with ``0x'', in which case they are\n     interpreted as hexadecimal.  The number of characters (not including any\n     ``0x'') in the starting value gives the minimum width; sequence values\n     are zero padded up to this width.\tThus ``tty[00-07]'' represents the\n     eight terminals ``tty00'' through ``tty07''."
