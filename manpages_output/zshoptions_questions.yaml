These names are case\n       insensitive and underscores are ignored.  For example, `allexport' is\n       equivalent to `A__lleXP_ort'.\n\n       The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with `no',\n       so `setopt No_Beep' is equivalent to `unsetopt beep'.  This inversion\n       can only be done once, so `nonobeep' is not a synonym for `beep'.\n       Similarly, `tify' is not a synonym for `nonotify' (the inversion of\n       `notify').\n\n       Some options also have one or more single letter names.\tThere are two\n       sets of single letter options: one used by default, and another used to\n       emulate sh/ksh (used when the SH_OPTION_LETTERS option is set).\tThe\n       single letter options can be used on the shell command line, or with\n       the set, setopt and unsetopt builtins, as normal Unix options preceded\n       by `-'."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshoptions`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using `+'\n       instead of `-'.\tSome of the single letter option names refer to an\n       option being off, in which case the inversion of that name refers to\n       the option being on.  For example, `+n' is the short name of `exec',\n       and `-n' is the short name of its inversion, `noexec'.\n\n       In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at startup,\n       trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string `-f\t  '\n       will be treated just as `-f', but the string `-f i' is an error.  This\n       is because many systems which implement the `#!' mechanism for calling\n       scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.\n\n       It is possible for options to be set within a function scope.  See the\n       description of the option LOCAL_OPTIONS below.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS\n       In the following list, options set by default in all emulations are\n       marked <D>; those set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh\n       emulations are marked <C>, <K>, <S>, <Z> as appropriate.  When listing\n       options (by `setopt', `unsetopt', `set -o' or `set +o'), those turned\n       on by default appear in the list prefixed with `no'.  Hence (unless\n       KSH_OPTION_PRINT is set), `setopt' shows all options whose settings are\n       changed from the default."

If this option is not explicitly set,\n\t      the shell becomes a login shell if the first character of the\n\t      argv[0] passed to the shell is a `-'.\n\n       PRIVILEGED (-p, ksh: -p)\n\t      Turn on privileged mode. Typically this is used when script is\n\t      to be run with elevated privileges. This should be done as\n\t      follows directly with the -p option to zsh so that it takes\n\t      effect during startup.\n\n\t\t     #!/bin/zsh -p\n\n\t      The option is enabled automatically on startup if the effective\n\t      user (group) ID is not equal to the real user (group) ID. In\n\t      this case, turning the option off causes the effective user and\n\t      group IDs to be set to the real user and group IDs. Be aware\n\t      that if that fails the shell may be running with different IDs\n\t      than was intended so a script should check for failure and act\n\t      accordingly, for example:\n\n\t\t     unsetopt privileged || exit\n\n\t      The PRIVILEGED option disables sourcing user startup files.  If\n\t      zsh is invoked as `sh' or `ksh' with this option set,\n\t      /etc/suid_profile is sourced (after /etc/profile on interactive\n\t      shells). Sourcing ~/.profile is disabled and the contents of the\n\t      ENV variable is ignored. This option cannot be changed using the\n\t      -m option of setopt and unsetopt, and changing it inside a\n\t      function always changes it globally regardless of the\n\t      LOCAL_OPTIONS option."
