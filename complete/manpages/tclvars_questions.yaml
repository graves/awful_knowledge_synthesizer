Reading an\n\t      element will return the value of the corresponding environment\n\t      variable.  Setting an element of the array will modify the\n\t      corresponding environment variable or create a new one if it\n\t      does not already exist.  Unsetting an element of env will remove\n\t      the corresponding environment variable.  Changes to the env\n\t      array will affect the environment passed to children by commands\n\t      like exec.  If the entire env array is unset then Tcl will stop\n\t      monitoring env accesses and will not update environment\n\t      variables."
