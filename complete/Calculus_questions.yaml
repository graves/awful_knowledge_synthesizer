    PREFACE

    PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

    Every aspect of this book was influenced by the desire to present calculus not
    merely as a prelude to but as the first real encounter with mathematics. Since
    the foundations of analysis provided the arena in which modern modes of math-
    ematical thinking developed, calculus ought to be the place in which to expect,
    rather than avoid, the strengthening of insight with logic. In addition to devel-
    oping the students' intuition about the beautiful concepts of analysis, it is surely
    equally important to persuade them that precision and rigor are neither deterrents
    to intuition, nor ends in themselves, but the natural medium in which to formulate
    and think about mathematical questions.

    This goal implies a view of mathematics which, in a sense, the entire book
    attempts to defend. No matter how well particular topics may be developed, the
    goals of this book will be realized only if it succeeds as a whole. For this reason, it
    would be of little value merely to list the topics covered, or to mention pedagogical
    practices and other innovations. Even the cursory glance customarily bestowed on
    new calculus texts will probably tell more than any such extended advertisement,
    and teachers with strong feelings about particular aspects of calculus will know just
    where to look to see if this book fulfills their requirements.

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Calculus Foundations**\n\nUsing the principles of mathematical rigor and precision from the preface, explain how the concept of a limit in calculus is both a foundational and intuitive idea.\n- **Step 1**: Define a limit using the terminology and philosophy presented in the preface.\n- **Step 2**: Relate the concept of a limit to the development of mathematical insight and logic as described in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from calculus (e.g., the limit of a function as x approaches a value) that demonstrates both the formal and intuitive aspects of the concept.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must explicitly connect the philosophical stance of the text to the practical application of limits in calculus.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Mathematical Precision**\n\nGiven the emphasis on precision in the preface, construct a proof for the following statement: If f(x) is continuous at x = a and lim_{x→a} g(x) = L, then lim_{x→a} [f(x)g(x)] = f(a)L.\n- **Step 1**: State the definitions of continuity and limit from the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to formalize the proof.\n- **Step 3**: Justify each step of the proof using the properties of limits and continuity as presented in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must adhere strictly to the definitions and logical structure provided in the text, without external references.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Calculus Concepts**\n\nConsider the function f(x) = x^2.\n- **Part A**: Use the definition of a derivative from the text to derive the derivative of f(x).\n- **Part B**: Explain how the derivative, as a limit, reflects the philosophical emphasis on precision and rigor in the preface.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "A function must be continuous to be differentiable." Your example must reference the definitions of continuity and differentiability from the text and demonstrate logical reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions and concepts from the text, demonstrating a clear understanding of the relationship between continuity and differentiability.'

    A few features do require explicit comment, however. Of the twenty-nine chapters in the book, two (starred) chapters are optional, and the three chapters comprising Part V have been included only for the benefit of those students who might want to examine on their own a construction of the real numbers. Moreover, the appendices to Chapters 3 and 11 also contain optional material.

    The order of the remaining chapters is intentionally quite inflexible, since the purpose of the book is to present calculus as the evolution of one idea, not as a collection of "topics." Since the most exciting concepts of calculus do not appear until Part III, it should be pointed out that Parts I and II will probably require less time than their length suggests—although the entire book covers a one-year course, the chapters are not meant to be covered at any uniform rate. A rather natural dividing point does occur between Parts II and III, so it is possible to reach differentiation and integration even more quickly by treating Part II very briefly, perhaps returning later for a more detailed treatment. This arrangement corresponds to the traditional organization of most calculus courses, but I feel that it will only diminish the value of the book for students who have seen a small amount of calculus previously, and for bright students with a reasonable background.

    The problems have been designed with this particular audience in mind. They range from straightforward, but not overly simple, exercises which develop basic techniques and test understanding of concepts, to problems of considerable difficulty and, I hope, of comparable interest. There are about 625 problems in all. Those which emphasize manipulations usually contain many examples, numbered

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Calculus as an Evolution of Ideas**\n\nGiven the text''s emphasis on calculus as the evolution of one idea, explain how the concept of a limit is central to the development of both derivatives and integrals.\n- **Step 1**: Define what a limit is based on the text''s description of calculus as a progression of ideas.\n- **Step 2**: Relate the definition of a derivative to the concept of a limit.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the integral is constructed using the limit of a Riemann sum.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the idea of a limit to both the derivative and the integral, demonstrating an understanding of how calculus is built upon this foundational concept.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Chapter Structure and Optional Material**\n\nThe text mentions that two chapters are optional and that Part V is for those interested in constructing the real numbers. Consider the following scenario: a student is deciding whether to skip the optional chapters to focus on the core content.\n- **Part A**: Explain how skipping the optional chapters might affect the student''s ability to understand the main content of the book, particularly in relation to the structure of the chapters.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the implications of the text''s traditional organization of chapters for students with prior calculus experience.\n- **Problem**: If a student chooses to skip the optional chapters, what is the minimum number of chapters they must still read to ensure they can follow the main content of the book? Justify your answer based on the text''s structure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must address both the structure of the book and the implications of skipping optional chapters, demonstrating an understanding of the text''s organizational philosophy.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Problem Design and Calculus Concepts**\n\nThe text states that problems range from straightforward exercises to those of considerable difficulty. Consider the following:\n- **Part A**: Design a problem that combines concepts from calculus and algebra, such as finding the derivative of a function involving rational exponents.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the problem you designed in Part A reflects the text''s philosophy of balancing basic techniques with more complex concepts.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the role of problem difficulty in reinforcing the text''s goal of presenting calculus as the evolution of one idea.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s problem design philosophy and its relationship to the overarching theme of calculus as a single evolving idea.'

    With small Roman numerals, while small letters are used to label interrelated parts
    in other problems. Some indication of relative difficulty is provided by a system of
    starring and double starring, but there are so many criteria for judging difficulty,
    and so many hints have been provided, especially for harder problems, that this
    guide is not completely reliable. Many problems are so difficult, especially if the
    hints are not consulted, that the best of students will probably have to attempt only
    those which especially interest them; from the less difficult problems it should be
    easy to select a portion which will keep a good class busy, but not frustrated. The
    answer section contains solutions to about half the examples from an assortment
    of problems that should provide a good test of technical competence. A separate
    answer book contains the solutions of the other parts of these problems, and of all
    the other problems as well. Finally, there is a Suggested Reading list, to which the
    problems often refer, and a glossary of symbols.

    I am grateful for the opportunity to mention the many people to whom I owe my
    thanks. Jane Bjorkgren performed prodigious feats of typing that compensated for
    my fitful production of the manuscript. Richard Serkey helped collect the material
    which provides historical sidelights in the problems, and Richard Weiss supplied
    the answers appearing in the back of the book. I am especially grateful to my
    friends Michael Freeman, Jay Goldman, Anthony Philips, and Robert Wells for
    the care with which they read, and the relentlessness with which they criticized, a
    preliminary version of the book. Needles to say, they are not responsible for the
    deficiencies which remain, especially since I sometimes rejected suggestions which
    would have made the book appear suitable for a larger group of students. I must
    express my admiration for the editors and staff of W. A. Benjamin, Inc., who were
    always eager to increase the appeal of the book, while recognizing the audience
    for which it was intended.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding the Structure of a Mathematical Text**\n\n**I.** Identify the primary purpose of the introductory paragraph in the provided text.\n\n**II.** Explain how the text reflects the author''s approach to writing for a mathematical audience, based on the language and structure used.\n\n**III.** Discuss the role of the ''Suggested Reading list'' and ''glossary of symbols'' mentioned in the text, and how they contribute to the overall learning experience.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s structure and purpose, and how these elements serve the goals of the book.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing the Author''s Acknowledgments**\n\n**I.** List the individuals and their contributions mentioned in the acknowledgments section of the text.\n\n**II.** Explain the significance of the author''s gratitude towards Jane Bjorkgren, Richard Serkey, and Richard Weiss, in the context of the book''s production.\n\n**III.** Interpret the author''s statement: "They are not responsible for the deficiencies which remain." How does this reflect the author''s attitude towards the book''s final product?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must analyze the text''s acknowledgments and interpret the author''s intentions and attitudes as revealed in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluating the Text''s Educational Approach**\n\n**I.** Based on the text, describe the author''s philosophy regarding the balance between technical competence and accessibility in the book.\n\n**II.** Explain how the mention of ''a separate answer book'' and ''the answer section'' supports the author''s educational goals.\n\n**III.** Discuss the role of the ''glossary of symbols'' in the context of a calculus textbook, and how it contributes to the reader''s understanding of the material.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must evaluate the text''s educational approach and demonstrate an understanding of its pedagogical strategies.'

- prompt: "The inadequacies which preliminary editions always involve were gallantly endured by a rugged group of freshmen in the honors mathematics course at Brandeis University during the academic year 1965-1966. About half of this course was devoted to algebra and topology, while the other half covered calculus, with the preliminary edition as the text. It is almost obligatory in such circumstances to report that the preliminary version was a gratifying success. This is always safe—after all, the class is unlikely to rise up in a body and protest publicly—but the students themselves, it seems to me, deserve the right to assign credit for the thoroughness with which they absorbed an impressive amount of mathematics. I am content to hope that some other students will be able to use the book to such good purpose, and with such enthusiasm.\n\nWaltham, Massachusetts  \nMICHAEL SPIVAK  \nFebruary 1967\n\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\n\nI have often been told that the title of this book should really be something like \"An Introduction to Analysis,\" because the book is usually used in courses where the students have already learned the mechanical aspects of calculus—such courses are standard in Europe, and they are becoming more common in the United States. After thirteen years it seems too late to change the title, but other changes, in addition to the correction of numerous misprints and mistakes, seemed called for. There are now separate Appendices for many topics that were previously shghted: polar coordinates, uniform continuity, parameterized curves, Riemann sums, and the use of integrals for evaluating lengths, volumes and surface areas. A few topics, like manipulations with power series, have been discussed more thoroughly in the text, and there are also more problems on these topics, while other topics, like Newton's method and the trapezoid rule and Simpson's rule, have been developed in the problems. There are in all about 160 new problems, many of which are intermediate in difficulty between the few routine problems at the beginning of each chapter and the more difficult ones that occur later.\n\nThe text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak."

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Textbook Structure and Content**\n\nCompare and contrast the first and second editions of the textbook based on the preface.\n- **Part A**: Discuss the primary changes in content and structure between the two editions.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the pedagogical implications of these changes, particularly regarding the inclusion of new problems and appendices.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the author''s justification for these changes, considering the context of the book''s use in different educational settings (e.g., European vs. American courses).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s evolution and its impact on teaching and learning, with specific references to the preface''s descriptions.'

    Most of the new problems are the work of Ted Shifrm. Frederick Gordon
    pointed out several serious mistakes in the original problems, and supplied some
    non-trivial corrections, as well as the neat proof of Theorem 12-2, which took
    two Lemmas and two pages in the first edition. Joseph Lipman also told me
    of this proof, together with the similar trick for the proof of the last theorem in
    the Appendix to Chapter 11, which went unproved in the first edition. Roy O.
    Davies told me the trick for Problem 11-66, which previously was proved only in
    Problem 20-8 [21-8 in the third edition], and Marina Ratner suggested several
    interesting problems, especially ones on uniform continuity and infinite series. ‘To
    all these people go my thanks, and the hope that in the process of fashioning the
    new edition their contributions weren't too badly botched.

    PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

    The most significant change in this third edition is the inclusion of a new (starred)
    Chapter 7 on planetary motion, in which calculus is employed for a substantial
    physics problem.

    In preparation for this, the old Appendix to Chapter 4 has been replaced by
    three Appendices: the first two cover vectors and conic sections, while polar coor-
    dinates are now deferred until the third Appendix, which also discusses the polar
    coordinate equations of the conic sections. Moreover, the Appendix to Chapter 12
    has been extended to treat vector operations on vector-valued curves.

    Another large change is merely a rearrangement of old material: "The Cos-
    mopolitan Integral," previously a second Appendix to Chapter 13, is now an
    Appendix to the chapter on "Integration in Elementary Terms" (previously Chap-
    ter 18, now Chapter 19); moreover, those problems from that chapter which used
    the material from that Appendix now appear as problems in the newly placed
    Appendix.

    A few other changes and renumbering of Problems result from corrections, and
    elimination of incorrect problems.

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Calculus and Physics Concepts**\n\nUsing the concepts from Chapter 7 on planetary motion, explain how calculus can be employed to derive the orbital period of a planet around the Sun.\n- **Step 1**: Recall the relationship between gravitational force and centripetal acceleration.\n- **Step 2**: Set up the differential equations that describe the motion of the planet.\n- **Step 3**: Solve the equations using calculus techniques (e.g., separation of variables or integration).\n- **Step 4**: Relate the solution to the Kepler''s Third Law and the orbital period.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the physics concepts and calculus methods from the text, and demonstrate an understanding of how calculus is applied to model planetary motion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Vector Calculus**\n\nGiven the definitions of vectors and conic sections in the Appendices, explain how the polar coordinate equations of conic sections can be derived from the general polar form $ r = \frac{ed}{1 + e\cos\theta} $.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the parameters $ e $ (eccentricity) and $ d $ (distance from the directrix) in the equation.\n- **Step 2**: Use the definitions of conic sections in the text to relate $ e $ to the type of conic (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola).\n- **Step 3**: Derive the Cartesian equation of the conic from the polar equation, using the relationship between polar and Cartesian coordinates.\n- **Step 4**: Explain how the text''s discussion of vector operations on vector-valued curves relates to the geometric interpretation of conic sections.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts from the Appendices and demonstrate a clear understanding of the mathematical relationships between conic sections and polar coordinates.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Calculus Text Structure**\n\nThe text mentions a rearrangement of material, including the move of "The Cosmopolitan Integral" from Chapter 18 to Chapter 19. Analyze the implications of this rearrangement on the study of integration in elementary terms.\n- **Step 1**: Explain how the new placement of the Appendix affects the logical flow of the integration chapter.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the previous structure (Chapter 18) with the new structure (Chapter 19) in terms of the problems and concepts presented.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate how the renumbering of problems and the elimination of incorrect problems impact the overall clarity of the text.\n- **Step 4**: Reflect on how the changes in the third edition reflect the author''s approach to organizing mathematical concepts for clarity and pedagogical effectiveness.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s structural changes and their impact on the learning process, as well as the author''s intent in reorganizing the material.'

    I was both startled and somewhat dismayed when I realized that after allowing 13 years to elapse between the first and second editions of the book, I have allowed another 14 years to elapse before this third edition. During this time, it seems to have accumulated a not-so-short list of corrections, but no longer have the original communications, and therefore cannot properly thank the various individuals involved (who by now have probably lost interest anyway). I have had time to make only a few changes to the Suggested Reading, which after all these years probably requires a complete revision; this will have to wait until the next edition, which I hope to make in a more timely fashion.

    PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION

    Promises, promises! In the preface to the third edition I noted that it was 13 years between the first and second editions, and then another 14 years before the third, expressing the hope that the next edition would appear sooner. Well, here it is another 14 years later before the fourth, and presumably final, edition.

    Although small changes have been made to some material, especially in Chapters 5 and 20, this edition differs mainly in the introduction of additional problems, a complete update of the Suggested Reading, and the correction of numerous errors. These have been brought to my attention over the years by, among others, Nils von Barth; Philip Loewen; Fernando Mejias; Lance Muler, who provided a long list, particularly for the answer book; and Michael Maltenfort, who provided an amazingly extensive list of misprints, errors, and criticisms.

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Textual Context and Authorial Intent**\n\nBased on the preface text, analyze the author''s (Michael Spivak) attitude toward the delay in publishing subsequent editions of his calculus textbook.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the author''s expressed frustrations with the time between editions.\n- **Step 2**: Interpret the author''s tone in the statement: "Promises, promises!"\n- **Step 3**: Connect this attitude to the overall message about the evolution of the text and the author''s responsibility to readers.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect an understanding of the author''s perspective on the delay and its implications for the book''s development.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Authorial Contributions and Corrections**\n\nExamine the list of individuals mentioned in the preface who contributed to the fourth edition.\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three individuals and describe their specific contributions.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the significance of the phrase "a long list, particularly for the answer book" in the context of the text.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the author''s acknowledgment of these contributors reflects on the collaborative nature of academic publishing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s acknowledgment section and its implications for the collaborative process in academic publishing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of the Edition''s Purpose and Legacy**\n\nBased on the preface, assess the author''s view of the fourth edition as the "final" edition.\n- **Part A**: Interpret the author''s statement that this is the "final" edition.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the author''s reasons for considering it the final edition, including the mention of "a complete update of the Suggested Reading."\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the implications of labeling the edition as "final" for the book''s future and the author''s responsibility to readers.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the author''s perspective on the book''s development and its lasting impact on the field of calculus education.'

    Most of all, however, I am indebted to my friend ‘Ted Shifrin, who has been
    using the book for the text in his renowned course at the University of Georgia
    for all these years, and who prodded and helped me to finally make this needed
    revision. I must also thank the students in his course this last academic year, who
    served as guinea pigs for the new edition, resulting, in particular, in the current
    proof in Problem 8-20 for the Rising Sun Lemma, far simpler than Reisz's original
    proof, or even the proof in [38] of the Suggested Reading, which itself has now
    been updated considerably, again with great help from Ted.

    CHAPTER

    BASIC PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS

    The title of this chapter expresses in a few words the mathematical knowledge
    required to read this book. In fact, this short chapter is simply an explanation of
    what is meant by the "basic properties of numbers," all of which—addition and
    multiplication, subtraction and division, solutions of equations and inequalities,
    factoring and other algebraic manipulations—are already familiar to us. Nevertheless, this chapter is not a review. Despite the familiarity of the subject, the
    survey we are about to undertake will probably seem quite novel; it does not aim
    to present an extended review of old material, but to condense this knowledge
    into a few simple and obvious properties of numbers. Some may even seem too
    obvious to mention, but a surprising number of diverse and important facts turn
    out to be consequences of the ones we shall emphasize.

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Number Properties**\n\nUsing the basic properties of numbers described in the text, simplify the expression $ 2(x + 3) - 4x + 12 $.\n- **Step 1**: Apply the distributive property to expand the terms.\n- **Step 2**: Use the associative and commutative properties to combine like terms.\n- **Step 3**: Justify each step by referencing the specific property (e.g., "The distributive property states that...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final simplified expression must be correct, and you must explicitly identify at least two distinct properties used in your reasoning.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Properties in Problem Solving**\n\nSolve the equation $ 3(x - 2) + 5 = 2x + 1 $ using the basic properties of numbers.\n- **Step 1**: Expand the left-hand side using the distributive property.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the inverse property of addition to isolate the variable terms.\n- **Step 3**: Use the inverse property of multiplication to solve for x.\n- **Step 4**: Verify your solution by substituting back into the original equation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must be correct, and you must explicitly reference at least two properties from the text in your explanation.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Number Classifications**\n\nConsider the number 0. Based on the basic properties of numbers and the definitions provided in the text, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain why 0 is considered a special number in the context of addition and multiplication.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the role of 0 in the identity properties of addition and multiplication. Use specific examples from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument to show that the multiplicative inverse of 0 does not exist.

    Of the twelve properties which we shall study in this chapter, the first nine are
    concerned with the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication. For
    the moment we consider only addition: this operation is performed on a pair
    of numbers—the sum a + 5b exists for any two given numbers a and b (which
    may possibly be the same number, of course). It might seem reasonable to regard
    addition as an operation which can be performed on several numbers at once, and
    consider the sum a; + --- +a, of nm numbers aj,..., a, as a basic concept. It 1s
    more convenient, however, to consider addition of pairs of numbers only, and to
    define other sums in terms of sums of this type. For the sum of three numbers
    a, b, and c, this may be done in two different ways. One can first add b and c,
    obtaining b+ c, and then add a to this number, obtaining a + (b+); or one can
    first add a and 5b, and then add the sum a + b to c, obtaining (a+ b)+c. Of
    course, the two compound sums obtained are equal, and this fact is the very first

    property we shall list:

    (Pl) If a,b, and c are any numbers, then

    a+(b+c)=(at+b)+c.

    The statement of this property clearly renders a separate concept of the sum of
    three numbers superfluous; we simply agree that a + b+ c denotes the number
    a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c. Addition of four numbers requires similar, though slightly
    more involved, considerations. ‘The symbol a + b + c + d is defined to mean

    (1) ((a+b)+c)+d,
    or (2) (a+(b+c))+d,
    or (3) a+((b+c)+ 4),
    or (4) a+(b4+(c+d)),
    or (5) (a+b)+(c+ 4).

    4 Prologue

    This definition 1s unambiguous since these numbers are all equal. Fortunately, this
    fact need not be listed separately, since it follows from the property P1 already
    listed. For example, we know from PI that

    (a+b)+c=a+(b+ 0),

    and it follows immediately that (1) and (2) are equal. The equality of (2) and (3)
    is a direct consequence of Pl, although this may not be apparent at first sight
    (one must let b+ c play the role of b in PI, and d the role of c). The equalities
    (3) = (4) = (5) are also simple to prove.

    It is probably obvious that an appeal to P! will also suffice to prove the equality
    of the 14 possible ways of summing five numbers, but it may not be so clear how we
    can reasonably arrange a proof that this is so without actually listing these 14 sums.
    Such a procedure is feasible, but would soon cease to be if we considered collections
    of six, seven, or more numbers; it would be totally inadequate to prove the equality
    of all possible sums of an arbitrary finite collection of numbers aj,...,a,. ‘This
    fact may be taken for granted, but for those who would like to worry about the
    proof (and it is worth worrying about once) a reasonable approach is outlined in
    Problem 24. Henceforth, we shall usually make a tacit appeal to the results of this
    problem and write sums a; +---+ a, with a blithe disregard for the arrangement
    of parentheses.

    The number 0 has one property so important that we list it next:

    (P2) If ais any number, then
    a+O0=O0+a=a.

    An important role is also played by O in the third property of our list:

    (P3) For every number a, there 1s a number —a such that

    a+(—a) =(-a)+a=0.

    Property P2 ought to represent a distinguishing characteristic of the number 0,
    and it is comforting to note that we are already in a position to prove this. Indeed,
    if a number x satisfies

    atx=a

    for any one number a, then x = 0 (and consequently this equation also holds for all
    numbers a). The proof of this assertion involves nothing more than subtracting a
    from both sides of the equation, in other words, adding —a to both sides; as the
    following detailed proof shows, all three properties P!1—P3 must be used to justify
    this operation.

    If a + x = a,
    then (-a) + (a + x) = (-a) + a = 0;

    1. Basic Properties of Numbers 5

    As we have just hinted, it is convenient to regard subtraction as an operation
    derived from addition: we consider a - b to be an abbreviation for a + (-b). It
    is then possible to find the solution of certain simple equations by a series of steps
    (each justified by P1, P2, or P3) similar to the ones just presented for the equation
    a + x = a. For example:

    If x + 3 = 5,
    then (x + 3) + (-3) = 5 + (-3);
    hence x + (3 + (-3)) = 5 - 3 = 2;
    hence x + 0 = 2;
    hence x = 2.

    Naturally, such elaborate solutions are of interest only until you become convinced
    that they can always be supplied. In practice, it is usually just a waste of time to
    solve an equation by indicating so explicitly the reliance on properties P1, P2, and
    P3 (or any of the further properties we shall list).

    Only one other property of addition remains to be listed. When considering the
    sums of three numbers a, b, and c, only two sums were mentioned: (a + b) + c
    and a + (b + c). Actually, several other arrangements are obtained if the order of
    a, b, and c is changed. That these sums are all equal depends on

    (P4) If a and b are any numbers, then
    a + b = b + a.

- prompt: |-
    The statement of P4 is meant to emphasize that although the operation of ad-
    dition of pairs of numbers might conceivably depend on the order of the two
    numbers, in fact it does not. It is helpful to remember that not all operations are
    so well behaved. For example, subtraction does not have this property: usually
    a—b+#b—a. In passing we might ask just when a — b does equal b — a, and it
    is amusing to discover how powerless we are if we rely only on properties P1—P4
    to justify our manipulations. Algebra of the most elementary variety shows that
    a — b = b—a only when a = b. Nevertheless, it 1s impossible to derive this fact
    from properties P1—P4; it 1s instructive to examine the elementary algebra care-
    fully and determine which step(s) cannot be justified by PI—P4. We will indeed
    be able to justify all steps in detail when a few more properties are listed. Oddly
    enough, however, the crucial property involves multiplication.

    The basic properties of multiplication are fortunately so similar to those for ad-
    dition that little comment will be needed; both the meaning and the consequences
    should be clear. (As in elementary algebra, the product of a and b will be denoted
    by a-b, or simply ab.)

    a-(b-c)=(a-b)-c.

- prompt: |-
    One detail which deserves emphasis is the appearance of the condition a 4 0 in P7. ‘This condition is quite necessary; since 0-b = 0 for all numbers b, there is no number 07! satisfying 0-07! = 1. This restriction has an important consequence for division. Just as subtraction was defined in terms of addition, so division is defined in terms of multiplication: The symbol a/b means a- b~!. Since 07! is meaningless, a/0 is also meaningless—division by O is always undefined.

    Property P7 has two important consequences. If a-b = a-c, it does not necessarily follow that b = c; for if a = 0, then both a-b and a.-c are 0, no matter what b and c are. However, if a ≠ 0, then b = c; this can be deduced from P7 as follows:

    If a-b=a-c and a ≠ 0,
    then a~!.(a-b)=a™!-(a-c):
    hence (a~!-a)-b= (aq! -a)-Cc;
    hence 1-b=1-c;

    hence b=c.

    It is also a consequence of P7 that if a-b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. In fact,

    if a-b=O and a ≠ 0,
    then a !-(a-b)=0:
    hence (a7!-a)-b=0:
    hence 1-b=0;
    hence b= 0.

    (It may happen that a = 0 and b = O are both true; this possibility is not excluded when we say "either a = 0 or b = 0"; in mathematics "or" is always used in the sense of "one or the other, or both.")

    ‘This latter consequence of P7 is constantly used in the solution of equations.
    Suppose, for example, that a number x is known to satisfy

    (x — 11)\(x — 2) = 0.

    Then it follows that either x — 1 = 0 or x — 2 = 0; hence x = 1 or x = 2.

    The three basic properties of numbers which remain to be listed are concerned with inequalities. Although inequalities occur rarely in elementary mathematics, they play a prominent role in calculus. The two notions of inequality, a < b (a is less than b) and a > b (a is greater than b), are intimately related: a < b means the same as b > a (thus a < 3 and 3 > a are merely two ways of writing the same assertion). The numbers a satisfying a > 0 are called positive, while those numbers a satisfying a < 0 are called negative. While positivity can thus be defined in terms of <, it is possible to reverse the procedure: a < b can be defined to mean that b - a is positive. In fact, it is convenient to consider the collection of all positive numbers, denoted by P, as the basic concept, and state all properties in terms of P:

    (P10) (Irishotomy law) For every number a, one and only one of the following holds:

    i) a = 0,

    (1) a is in the collection P,
    (1) —a is in the collection P.

    (P11) (Closure under addition) If a and b are in P, then a + b is in P.

    (P12) (Closure under multiplication) If a and b are in P, then a · b is in P.

    These three properties should be complemented with the following definitions:

    a > b if a - b is in P:
    a < b if b > a;

    a ≥ b if a > b or a = b;
    a ≤ b if a < b or a = b.

    Note, in particular, that a > 0 if and only if a is in P.

    All the familiar facts about inequalities, however elementary they may seem, are consequences of P10-P12. For example, if a and b are any two numbers, then precisely one of the following holds:

    a) a - b = 0,
    (1) a - b is in the collection P,
    (3) -(a - b) = b - a is in the collection P.

    Using the definitions just made, it follows that precisely one of the following holds:

    (i) a = b,
    (ii) a > b,
    (iii) b > a.

    A slightly more interesting fact results from the following manipulations. If
    a < b, so that b — a is in P, then surely (b + c) — (a + c) is in P; thus, if a < b,
    then a + c < b + c. Similarly, suppose a < b and b < c. Then

    b — a is in P,
    and c — b is in P,
    so c — a = (c — b) + (b — a) is in P.

    This shows that if a < b and b < c, then a < c. (The two inequalities a < b and
    b < c are usually written in the abbreviated form a < b < c, which has the third
    inequality a < c almost built in.)

    The following assertion is somewhat less obvious: If a < 0 and b < 0, then
    ab > 0. The only difficulty presented by the proof is the unraveling of definitions.
    The symbol a < 0 means, by definition, 0 > a, which means 0 — a = —a is in P.
    Similarly —b is in P, and consequently, by P12, (—a)(—b) = ab is in P. Thus
    ab > 0.

    The fact that ab > 0 if a > 0, b > 0 and also if a < 0, b < 0 has one
    special consequence: a² > 0 if a ≠ 0. Thus squares of nonzero numbers are
    always positive, and in particular we have proved a result which might have seemed

    sufficiently elementary to be included in our list of properties: 1 > 0 (since 1 = 1²).

    There is one slightly perplexing feature of the symbols > and <. The statements

    1 + 1 < 3
    1 + 1 < 2

    are both true, even though we know that < could be replaced by < in the first, and by = in the
    second. This sort of thing is bound to occur when < is used with specific numbers; the usefulness
    of the symbol is revealed by a statement like Theorem I- here equality holds for some values of a
    and b, while inequality holds for other values.

    12 Prologue

    Although this method of treating absolute values (separate consideration of var-
    ious Cases) 1s sometimes the only approach available, there are often simpler meth-
    ods which may be used. In fact, it is possible to give a much shorter proof of
    Theorem 1; this proof is motivated by the observation that

    |a| = √a².

    (Here, and throughout the book, |x| denotes the positive square root of x; this
    symbol is defined only when x > 0.) We may now observe that

    (|a + b|)² = (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
    < a² + 2|a||b| + b²
    = |a|² + 2|a||b| + |b|²
    = (|a| + |b|)².

    From this we can conclude that |a + b| < |a| + |b| because x² < y² implies x < y,
    provided that x and y are both nonnegative; a proof of this fact is left to the reader
    (Problem 5).

    One final observation may be made about the theorem we have just proved: a
    close examination of either proof offered shows that

    |a + b| = |a| + |b|

    if a and b have the same sign (i.e., are both positive or both negative), or if one of
    the two is 0, while
    |a + b| < |a| + |b|

    if a and b are of opposite signs.

    We will conclude this chapter with a subtle point, neglected until now, whose
    inclusion is required in a conscientious survey of the properties of numbers. After
    stating property P9, we proved that a − b = b − a implies a = b. The proof began
    by establishing that

    a − (1 + 1) = b − (1 + 1),

    From which we concluded that a = b. This result is obtained from the equation
    a-(1+1) = b-(1 +1) by dividing both sides by 1+ 1. Division by 0 should
    be avoided scrupulously, and it must therefore be admitted that the validity of the
    argument depends on knowing that 1+ 1 ≠ 0. Problem 25 is designed to convince
    you that this fact cannot possibly be proved from properties P1—P9 alone! Once
    P10, P11, and P12 are available, however, the proof is very simple: We have
    already seen that 1 > 0; it follows that 1 + 1 > 0, and in particular 1+ 1 ≠ 0.
    This last demonstration has perhaps only strengthened your feeling that it is
    absurd to bother proving such obvious facts, but an honest assessment of our
    present situation will help justify serious consideration of such details. In this
    chapter we have assumed that numbers are familiar objects, and that P1—P12 are
    merely explicit statements of obvious, well-known properties of numbers. It would
    be difficult, however, to justify this assumption. Although one learns how to "work
    with" numbers in school, just what numbers are, remains rather vague. A great
    deal of this book is devoted to elucidating the concept of numbers, and by the end
    of the book we will have become quite well acquainted with them. But it will be
    necessary to work with numbers throughout the book. It is therefore reasonable
    to admit frankly that we do not yet thoroughly understand numbers; we may still
    say that, in whatever way numbers are finally defined, they should certainly have
    properties P1—P12.

    Most of this chapter has been an attempt to present convincing evidence that
    P1—P12 are indeed basic properties which we should assume in order to deduce
    other familiar properties of numbers. Some of the problems (which indicate the
    derivation of other facts about numbers from P1—P12) are offered as further evi-
    dence. It is still a crucial question whether P1—P12 actually account for all prop-
    erties of numbers. As a matter of fact, we shall soon see that they do not. In the
    next chapter the deficiencies of properties P1—P12 will become quite clear, but
    the proper means for correcting these deficiencies is not so easily discovered. The
    crucial additional basic property of numbers which we are seeking is profound and
    subtle, quite unlike P1—P12. The discovery of this crucial property will require all
    the work of Part II of this book. In the remainder of Part I we will begin to see
    why some additional property is required; in order to investigate this we will have
    to consider a little more carefully what we mean by "numbers."

    PROBLEMS
    1. Prove the following:

    i) If ax = a for some number a ≠ 0, then x = 1.

    ii) x² - y² = (−y)x + y.

    iii) If x⁷ = y⁷, then x = y or x = −y.

    iv) x³ - y³ = (x - y)(x² + xy + y²).

    v) xⁿ yᵐ - (x - y)(xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹).

    (A more general form occurs in Problem 2-21.) The three proofs of the Schwarz inequality outlined below have only one thing in common—their reliance on the fact that a² > 0 for all a.

    (a) Prove that if x₁ = Ay₁ and x₂ = Ay₂ for some number A > 0, then equality holds in the Schwarz inequality. Prove the same thing if y₁ = y₂ = 0. Now suppose that y₁ and y₂ are not both 0, and that there is no number A such that x₁ = Ay₁ and x₂ = Ay₂. Then

    0 < (Ay₁ - x₁)² + (Ay₂ - x₂)²
    = 2(y₁² + y₂²) - 2A(x₁² + x₂²) + (x₁² + x₂²).

    Using Problem 18, complete the proof of the Schwarz inequality.
    (b) Prove the Schwarz inequality by using 2xy < x² + y² (how is this derived?)

    with
    x₁y₁ + x₂y₂
    = √(x₁² + x₂²)√(y₁² + y₂²)

    first for i = 1 and then for i = 2.
    (c) Prove the Schwarz inequality by first proving that

    (x₁y₁ + x₂y₂)² ≤ (x₁² + x₂²)(y₁² + y₂²)

    (x₁y₁ + x₂y₂)² = (x₁y₁)² + (x₂y₂)² + 2x₁x₂y₁y₂
    (x₁² + x₂²)(y₁² + y₂²) = (x₁y₁)² + (x₁y₂)² + (x₂y₁)² + (x₂y₂)²
    (x₁y₁)² + (x₂y₂)² + 2x₁x₂y₁y₂ = (x₁y₁)² + (x₂y₂)² + 2x₁x₂y₁y₂

    (d) Deduce, from each of these three proofs, that equality holds only when y₁ = y₂ = 0 or when there is a number A > 0 such that x₁ = Ay₁ and x₂ = Ay₂.

    In our later work, three facts about inequalities will be crucial. Although proofs
    will be supplied at the appropriate point in the text, a personal assault on these
    problems is infinitely more enlightening than a perusal of a completely worked-out
    proof. 'The statements of these propositions involve some weird numbers, but their
    basic message is very simple: if x is close enough to xg, and y is close enough to yo,
    then x + y will be close to xg + yo, and xy will be close to xg yo, and 1/y will be close
    to 1/yo. 'The symbol "e" which appears in these propositions is the fifth letter of the
    Greek alphabet ("epsilon"), and could just as well be replaced by a less intimidating
    Roman letter; however, tradition has made the use of ε almost sacrosanct in the
    contexts to which these theorems apply.

    at one point in the argument you will need the first inequality, and at an-
    other point you will need the second. One more word of advice: since the
    hypotheses only provide information about x - xo and y - yo, it is almost a
    foregone conclusion that the proof will depend upon writing xy - xoyo in
    a way that involves x - xo and y - yo.)

- prompt: |-
    Note that condition (2) merely asserts the truth of P(k+1) under the assumption
    that P(k) is true; this suffices to ensure the truth of P(x) for all x, if condition
    (1) also holds. In fact, if P(1) is true, then it follows that P(2) is true (by using
    (2) in the special case k = 1). Now, since P(2) is true it follows that P(3) is true
    (using (2) in the special case k = 2). It is clear that each number will eventually be
    reached by a series of steps of this sort, so that P(k) is true for all numbers k.

    A favorite illustration of the reasoning behind mathematical induction envisions
    an infinite line of people,

    person number 1, person number 2, person number 3, ... .

    If each person has been instructed to tell any secret he hears to the person behind
    him (the one with the next largest number) and a secret is told to person number 1,
    then clearly every person will eventually learn the secret. If P(x) is the assertion
    that person number x will learn the secret, then the instructions given (to tell all
    secrets learned to the next person) assures that condition (2) is true, and telling
    the secret to person number 1 makes (1) true. The following example is a less
    facetious use of mathematical induction. There is a useful and striking formula
    which expresses the sum of the first n numbers in a simple way:

    n(n + 1)
    I+... =
    2

    To prove this formula, note first that it is clearly true for n = 1. Now assume that
    for some natural number k we have

    k(k + 1)
    1+2+...+k =
    2

    Then

    1+2+...+k + (k + 1) = k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1)

    = [k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)] / 2

    = (k^2 + k + 2k + 2) / 2

    = (k^2 + 3k + 2) / 2

    = (k + 1)(k + 2) / 2

    Thus, the formula holds for n = k + 1. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the
    formula is true for all natural numbers n.

    so the formula is also true for k + 1. By the principle of induction this proves
    the formula for all natural numbers n. This particular example illustrates a phe-
    nomenon that frequently occurs, especially in connection with formulas like the
    one just proved. Although the proof by induction 1s often quite straightforward,
    the method by which the formula was discovered remains a mystery. Problems 5
    and 6 indicate how some formulas of this type may be derived.

    The principle of mathematical induction may be formulated in an equivalent
    way without speaking of "properties" of a number, a term which 1s sufficiently
    vague to be eschewed in a mathematical discussion. A more precise formulation
    states that if A is any collection (or "set"—a synonymous mathematical term) of
    natural numbers and

    (1) 1 is in A,
    (2) k+1 is in A whenever k is in A,

    then A is the set of all natural numbers. It should be clear that this formulation
    adequately replaces the less formal one given previously—we just consider the
    set A of natural numbers x which satisfy P(x). For example, suppose A is the set
    of natural numbers n for which it is true that

    n(n + 1)
    5 ;

    l+---+tn=

    Our previous proof of this formula showed that A contains 1, and that k + 1 is
    in A, if k is. It follows that A is the set of all natural numbers, i.e., that the formula
    holds for all natural numbers n.

    There is yet another rigorous formulation of the principle of mathematical in-
    duction, which looks quite different. If A is any collection of natural numbers, it

- prompt: "It is tempting to say that A must have a smallest member. Actually, this statement  \ncan fail to be true in a rather subtle way. A particularly important set of natural  \nnumbers is the collection A that contains no natural numbers at all, the \"empty  \ncollection\" or \"null set,\"'* denoted by @. The null set @ is a collection of natural  \nnumbers that has no smallest member—in fact, it has no members at all. This  \nis the only possible exception, however; if A is a nonnull set of natural numbers,  \nthen A has a least member. This \"intuitively obvious\" statement, known as the  \n\"well-ordering principle,\" can be proved from the principle of induction as follows.  \nSuppose that the set A has no least member. Let B be the set of natural numbers  \nn such that 1,..., are all not in A. Clearly | 1s in B (because if 1 were in A, then  \nA would have | as smallest member). Moreover, if 1,...,k are not in A, surely  \nk + 1 is not in A (otherwise k + 1 would be the smallest member of A), so l,... ,  \nk +1 are all not in A. This shows that if k is in B, then k + 1 1s in B. It follows  \nthat every number n is in B, 1.e., the numbers 1, ... , m are not in A for any natural  \nnumber n. Thus A = 9, which completes the proof.\n\nIt is also possible to prove the principle of induction from the well-ordering  \nprinciple (Problem 10). Either principle may be considered as a basic assumption  \nabout the natural numbers.\n\nThere is still another form of induction which should be mentioned. It some-  \ntimes happens that in order to prove P(k + 1) we must assume not only P(k), but  \nalso P(/) for all natural numbers / < k.

    To define $ a_n $ precisely really requires a recursive definition:

    (1) \quad S_0 = a_0,
    $$

    $$
    (2) \quad S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n.

    a_i,

    A still larger system of numbers 1s obtained by taking quotients m/n of integers (with n ≠ 0). These numbers are called rational numbers, and the set of all rational numbers is denoted by Q (for "quotients"). In this system of numbers all of P1–P12 are true. It is tempting to conclude that the "properties of numbers," which we studied in some detail in Chapter 1, refer to just one set of numbers, namely, Q. There is, however, a still larger collection of numbers to which properties P1–P12 apply—the set of all real numbers, denoted by R. The real numbers include not only the rational numbers, but other numbers as well (the irrational numbers) which can be represented by infinite decimals; a and √2 are both examples of irrational numbers. The proof that √2 is irrational is not easy—we shall devote all of Chapter 16 of Part III to a proof of this fact. The irrationality of √2, on the other hand, is quite simple, and was known to the Greeks. (Since the Pythagorean theorem shows that an isosceles right triangle, with sides of length 1, has a hypotenuse of length √2, it is not surprising that the Greeks should have investigated this question.) The proof depends on a few observations about the natural numbers. Every natural number n can be written either in the form 2k for some integer k, or else in the form 2k + 1 for some integer k (this "obvious" fact has a simple proof by induction (Problem 8)). Those natural numbers of the form 2k are called even; those of the form 2k + 1 are called odd. Note that even numbers have even squares, and odd numbers have odd squares:

    (2k)² = 4k² = 2·(2k²),
    (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 = 2·(2k² + 2k) + 1.

    In particular it follows that the converse must also hold: if n* is even, then n is even;
    if n* is odd, then n is odd. The proof that J2 is irrational is now quite simple.
    Suppose that V2 were rational; that is, suppose there were natural numbers p
    and q such that

    We can assume that p and q have no common divisor (since all common divisors
    could be divided out to begin with). Now we have

    This shows that p is even, and consequently p must be even; that is, p = 2k for
    some natural number k. Then

    p^2 = 2q^2,

    SO
    (2k)^2 = 2q^2,

    This shows that q^2 is even, and consequently that q is even. Thus both p and q
    are even, contradicting the fact that p and q have no common divisor. This
    contradiction completes the proof.

    It is important to understand precisely what this proof shows. We have demon-
    strated that there is no rational number x such that x^2 = 2. This assertion is often
    expressed more briefly by saying that √2 is irrational. Note, however, that the

    use of the symbol √2 implies the existence of some number (necessarily irrational)
    whose square is 2. We have not proved that such a number exists and we can as-
    sert confidently that, at present, a proof is impossible for us. Any proof at this stage
    would have to be based on P1–P12 (the only properties of R we have mentioned);
    since P1–P12 are also true for Q, the exact same argument would show that there
    is a rational number whose square is 2, and this we know is false. (Note that the
    reverse argument will not work—our proof that there is no rational number whose
    square is 2 cannot be used to show that there is no real number whose square is 2,
    because our proof used not only P1–P12 but also a special property of Q, the fact
    that every number in Q can be written p/q for integers p and q.)

    This particular deficiency in our list of properties of the real numbers could,
    of course, be corrected by adding a new property which asserts the existence of
    square roots of positive numbers. Resorting to such a measure is, however, neither
    aesthetically pleasing nor mathematically satisfactory; we would still not know that
    every number has an nth root if n is odd, and that every positive number has an
    nth root if n is even. Even if we assumed this, we could not prove the existence of
    a number x satisfying x² + x + 1 = 0 (even though there does happen to be one),
    since we do not know how to write the solution of the equation in terms of nth
    roots (in fact, it is known that the solution cannot be written in this form). And,
    of course, we certainly do not wish to assume that all equations have solutions,
    since this is false (no real number x satisfies x7 + 1 = 0, for example). In fact,
    this direction of investigation is not a fruitful one. ‘The most useful hints about the
    property distinguishing R from Q, the most compelling evidence for the necessity
    of elucidating this property, do not come from the study of numbers alone. In
    order to study the properties of the real numbers in a more profound way, we
    must study more than the real numbers. At this point we must begin with the
    foundations of calculus, in particular the fundamental concept on which calculus
    is based—functions.

    Suppose we know properties Pl and P4 for the natural numbers, but that
    multiplication has never been mentioned. Then the following can be used
    as a recursive definition of multiplication:

    1-b = b,
    (a+1)-b = a-b + b.

    Prove the following (in the order suggested!):

    a-(b+c) = a-b + a-c (use induction on a),
    a-b = b-a (you just finished proving the case b = 1).

    In this chapter we began with the natural numbers and gradually built up to
    the real numbers. A completely rigorous discussion of this process requires
    a little book in itself (see Part V). No one has ever figured out how to get to
    the real numbers without going through this process, but if we do accept the
    real numbers as given, then the natural numbers can be defined as the real
    numbers of the form 1, 1 +1, 1+1+1, etc. 'The whole point of this problem
    is to show that there is a rigorous mathematical way of saying "etc."

    (a) A set A of real numbers is called inductive if

    (1) 1 is in A,
    (2) k+1 is in A whenever k is in A.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Inductive Proof of Order Relationships**\n\nUsing the recursive definition of the relation < A, < A, prove by induction on k that G, < A, for n = 2.\n\n**Steps to Consider**:\n1. **Base Case (k=1)**: Demonstrate that G, < A, holds when k=1.\n2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that G, < A, is true for some k = m.\n3. **Inductive Step**: Show that G, < A, holds for k = m + 1 by using the recursive definition of < A, < A.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must explicitly reference the properties of < A, < A and the recursive structure of the relation. You must also ensure that your inductive step directly follows from the base case and the inductive hypothesis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Recursive Multiplication and Inductive Proof**\n\nGiven the recursive definition of multiplication: 1-b = b, (a+1)-b = a-b + b, prove by induction on a that a-(b+c) = a-b + a-c. Then, using the result from part (a), prove that a-b = b-a.\n\n**Task Breakdown**:\n1. **Inductive Proof for a-(b+c)**:\n   - **Base Case (a=1)**: Show that 1-(b+c) = 1-b + 1-c using the recursive definition.\n   - **Inductive Step**: Assume the formula holds for a = m, then prove it for a = m + 1.\n2. **Proof of a-b = b-a**:\n   - Use the result from part (a) and the recursive definition of multiplication to show that a-b = b-a for all a, b.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must clearly separate the inductive proof from the second part, and explicitly reference the recursive definition of multiplication in both parts.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Rigorous Definition of Natural Numbers**\n\nGiven the inductive definition of a set A of real numbers (1 is in A, and k+1 is in A whenever k is in A), prove that the real numbers 1, 1+1, 1+1+1, etc., form an inductive set.\n\n**Steps to Consider**:\n1. **Show that 1 is in the set**: This is given by the definition of an inductive set.\n2. **Show that if k is in the set, then k+1 is also in the set**: Use the recursive structure of the natural numbers as defined by the real numbers.\n3. **Conclude that the set of natural numbers as defined by the real numbers is inductive**: Demonstrate that this set satisfies both conditions of an inductive set.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must explicitly reference the definition of an inductive set and the recursive construction of natural numbers. You must also clarify how this rigorous definition supports the idea of ''etc.'' in the text.'

    There is a puzzle consisting of three spindles, with n concentric rings of

    stack may be moved from one spindle to another spindle, provided that it
    is not placed on top of a smaller ring. For example, if the smallest ring is
    moved to spindle 2 and the next-smallest ring is moved to spindle 3, then
    the smallest ring may be moved to spindle 3 also, on top of the next-smallest.

    University B. once boasted 17 tenured professors of mathematics. "Radiation prescribed that at their weekly luncheon meeting, faithfully attended by
    all 17, any members who had discovered an error in their published work
    should make an announcement of this fact, and promptly resign. Such an an-
    nouncement had never actually been made, because no professor was aware
    of any errors in her or his work. This is not to say that no errors existed,
    however. In fact, over the years, in the work of every member of the de-
    partment at least one error had been found, by some other member of the
    department. This error had been mentioned to all other members of the
    department, but the actual author of the error had been kept ignorant of the
    fact, to forestall any resignations.

    One fateful year, the department was augmented by a visitor from another university, one Prof. X, who had come with hopes of being offered a permanent position at the end of the academic year. Naturally, he was apprised, by various members of the department, of the published errors which had been discovered. When the hoped-for appointment failed to materialize, Prof. X obtained his revenge at the last luncheon of the year. "I have enjoyed my visit here very much," he said, "but I feel that there is one thing that I have to tell you. At least one of you has published an incorrect result, which has been discovered by others in the department." What happened the next year?

    After figuring out, or looking up, the answer to Problem 27, consider the following: Each member of the department already knew what Prof. X asserted, so how could his saying it change anything?

    FOUNDATIONS

    The statement is so frequently made that the differential calculus deals with continuous magnitude, and yet

    an explanation of this continuity is nowhere given;

    even the most rigorous expositions

    of the differential calculus do not base their proofs upon continuity but,

    with more or less consciousness of the fact,

    they either appeal to geometric notions

    or those suggested by geometry,

    or depend upon theorems which are never

    established in a purely arithmetic manner.
    Among these, for example,

    belongs the above-mentioned theorem,

    and a more careful investigation

    convinced me that this theorem, or

    any one equivalent to it, can be regarded

    in some way as a Sufficient basis

    for infinitesimal analysis.

    It then only remained to discover its true

    origin in the elements of arithmetic

    and thus at the same time

    to secure a real definition of

    the essence of continuity.

    I succeeded Nov. 24, 1858, and

    a few days afterward I communicated

    the results

    of my meditations to my dear friend

    Durege with whom I had a long

    and lively discussion.

    Undoubtedly the most important concept in all of mathematics is that of a
    function—in almost every branch of modern mathematics functions turn out to
    be the central objects of investigation. It will therefore probably not surprise you
    to learn that the concept of a function is one of great generality. Perhaps it will
    be a relief to learn that, for the present, we will be able to restrict our attention to
    functions of a very special kind; even this small class of functions will exhibit sufficient variety to engage our attention for quite some time. We will not even begin
    with a proper definition. For the moment a provisional definition will enable us to
    discuss functions at length, and will illustrate the intuitive notion of functions, as
    understood by mathematicians. Later, we will consider and discuss the advantages
    of the modern mathematical definition. Let us therefore begin with the following:

    A function is a rule which assigns, to each of certain real numbers, some other real
    number.

    The following examples of functions are meant to illustrate and amplify this defi-
    nition, which, admittedly, requires some such clarification.

    Example 1: The rule which assigns to each number the square of that number.
    Example 2: The rule which assigns to each number y the number

    Example 3: The rule which assigns to each number c ≠ 1, —1 the number

    Example 4: The rule which assigns to each number x satisfying —17 < x < 2/3

    the number x'.

    Example 5: The rule which assigns to each number a the number 0 if a is
    irrational, and the number | if a is rational.

    to 2 the number 5,

    for a, b in Q.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Function Definition and Examples**\n\nBased on the provisional definition of a function provided in the text, explain why the following are or are not functions:\n1. The rule that assigns to each real number x the value of x^2.\n2. The rule that assigns to each real number x the value of 1/x when x ≠ 0, and the value 0 when x = 0.\n3. The rule that assigns to each real number x the value of the color of the sky on a given day.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between valid functions and non-functions, justifying each case using the definition that "a function is a rule which assigns, to each of certain real numbers, some other real number."'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Function Restrictions and Domain**\n\nConsider the function defined as follows: For each real number x, the function f(x) assigns to x the value of the square root of x.\n- **Part A**: Determine the domain of this function using the text''s definition of a function.\n- **Part B**: Compare this domain with the domain of the function defined in Example 3. Explain why the domain of Example 3 is restricted to c ≠ 1, —1.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on functions being "rules" that assign values to "certain real numbers" influences the domain of a function.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly address the domain restrictions based on the text''s definition and the examples provided.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Function Classification and Examples**\n\nBased on the text''s examples, classify the following as functions or non-functions, and justify your answer using the definition provided:\n1. The rule that assigns to each real number x the set {x, x + 1, x - 1}.\n2. The rule that assigns to each real number x the value of the number of real solutions to the equation x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0.\n3. The rule that assigns to each real number x the value of the next prime number after x.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the function definition, particularly the requirement that a function must assign a single, well-defined value to each input.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Function Domains and Rules: Understanding Ambiguity**\n\nConsider the function described in Example 86: ''The rule which assigns to each number z the number of 7''s in the decimal expansion of z, if this number is finite, and −z if there are infinitely many 7''s in the decimal expansion of z.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why this function''s domain is not clearly defined. Use the text''s explanation of the domain as ''the set of numbers to which a function does apply.''\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar function with a clearly defined domain, ensuring that your function''s rule is unambiguous and its domain is explicitly stated.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s emphasis on functions as ''any rule that assigns numbers to certain other numbers'' supports the idea that domains can be intentionally ambiguous or undefined.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s definitions and examples, and demonstrate an understanding of how function domains are determined by the rule''s applicability.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Notation and Function Naming: Logical Reasoning**\n\nThe text states that functions are typically denoted by a letter, with ''f'' being a common choice. It also mentions that functions can be described by ''a rule which can be expressed by an algebraic formula, or even by one uniform condition which applies to every number.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Given the function f(x) = x^2, explain why this function''s rule is considered a ''uniform condition'' according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Create a function named ''g'' that is not described by an algebraic formula but by a non-uniform condition. Define its rule and domain clearly.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s notation (using letters to name functions) allows for flexibility in describing functions that may not have a single, simple rule.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of function notation and the distinction between uniform and non-uniform conditions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Function Ambiguity and Counterexamples**\n\nThe text discusses the function in Example 6, which is described as ''the rule which assigns to each number t the number t? + x.'' It notes that this rule depends on the value of x, resulting in infinitely many different functions, each corresponding to a different x.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why this function is considered ''infinitely many different functions'' based on the text''s explanation.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to the claim: ''All functions must have a single, fixed rule that applies to all numbers.'' Your counterexample must reference the text''s discussion of functions with varying rules.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s emphasis on functions as ''any rule that assigns numbers to certain other numbers'' supports the idea that a function can have a rule that changes based on input or external factors.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s examples and definitions, and demonstrate a clear understanding of function variability.'

    These definitions illustrate the common procedure adopted for defining a function f—indicating what f(x) is for every number x in the domain of f. (Notice that this is exactly the same as indicating f(a) for every number a, or f(b) for every number b, etc.) In practice, certain abbreviations are tolerated. Definition (1) could be written simply

    (1) f(x) = x?

    the qualifying phrase "for all x" being understood. Of course, for definition (4) the only possible abbreviation is

    (4) r(x) = x', -17 <x <2/3.

    It is usually understood that a definition such as

    l l
    k(x) = -—- + —, x ∈ (0,1)

    can be shortened to

    x - 1

    |
    k(x) = —+

    in other words, unless the domain is explicitly restricted further, it is understood to consist of all numbers for which the definition makes any sense at all.

    You should have little difficulty checking the following assertions about the functions defined above:

    f(x) = f(x) + 2x + 4 + 1;

    If the expression f(s(a)) looks unreasonable to you, then you are forgetting that s(a) is a number like any other number, so that f(s(a)) makes sense. As a matter of fact, f(s(a)) = s(a) for all a. Why? Even more complicated expressions than f (s(a)) are, after a first exposure, no more difficult to unravel. The expression

    f(r(s(0(a3(yG)))))),

    formidable as it appears, may be evaluated quite easily with a little patience:

    f(r(s(0(a3(y())))))
    = f(r(s(6(a3(0)))))

    By what criterion, you may feel impelled to ask, can such functions, especially a
    monstrosity like (12), be considered simple? ‘The answer is that they can be built
    up from a few simple functions using a few simple means of combining functions.
    In order to construct the functions (9)-(12) we need to start with the "identity
    function" J, for which (x) = x, and the "sine function" sin, whose value sin(x) at
    x is often written simple sinx. The following are some of the important ways in
    which functions may be combined to produce new functions.

    If f and g are any two functions, we can define a new function f + g, called
    the sum of f and g, by the equation

    (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x).

    Note that according to the conventions we have adopted, the domain of f + g
    consists of all x for which " f(x) + g(x)" makes sense, 1.e., the set of all x in both
    domain f and domain g. If A and B are any two sets, then A ∩ B (read "A
    intersect B" or "the intersection of A and B") denotes the set of x in both A
    and B; this notation allows us to write domain( f + g) = domain f ∩ domain g.

    In a similar vein, we define the product f - g and the quotient f / g of
    f and g by
    (f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)

    (f / g)(x) = f(x)/g(x)

    Moreover, if g is a function and c is a number, we define a new function c · g by

    and

    (c · g)(x) = c · g(x).

    This becomes a special case of the notation f - g if we agree that the symbol c
    should also represent the function f defined by f(x) = c; such a function, which
    has the same value for all numbers x, is called a constant function.

    The domain of $ f - g $ is $ \text{domain } f \cap \text{domain } g $, and the domain of $ c - g $ is simply the domain of $ g $. On the other hand, the domain of $ \frac{f}{g} $ is rather complicated—it may be written $ \text{domain } f \cap \text{domain } g \setminus \{x : g(x) = 0\} $, the symbol $ \{x : g(x) = 0\} $ denoting the set of numbers $ x $ such that $ g(x) = 0 $. In general, $ \{x : ...\} $ denotes the set of all $ x $ such that "..." is true. Thus $ \{x : x^2 + 3 < 11\} $ denotes the set of all numbers $ x $ such that $ x^2 < 8 $, and consequently $ \{x : x^3 < 11\} = \{x : x < 2\} $. Either of these symbols could just as well have been written using $ y $ everywhere instead of $ x $. Variations of this notation are common, but hardly require any discussion. Any one can guess that $ \{x > 0 : x^3 < 8\} $ denotes the set of positive numbers whose cube is less than 8; it could be expressed more formally as $ \{x : x > 0 \text{ and } x^3 < 8\} $. Incidentally, this set is equal to the set $ \{x : 0 < x < 2\} $.

    A variation is slightly less transparent, but very standard. The set $ \{1, 3, 2, 4\} $, for example, contains just the four numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4; it can also be denoted by $ \{x : x = 1 \text{ or } x = 3 \text{ or } x = 2 \text{ or } x = 4\} $.

    Certain facts about the sum, product, and quotient of functions are obvious consequences of facts about sums, products, and quotients of numbers. For example, it is very easy to prove that

    $$
    (f + g) \circ h = f \circ h + g \circ h.
    $$

    The proof is characteristic of almost every proof which demonstrates that two functions are equal—the two functions must be shown to have the same domain, and the same value at any number in the domain. For example, to prove that $ (f + g) + h = f + (g + h) $, note that unraveling the definition of the two sides gives

    $$
    [(f + g) + h](x) = (f + g)(x) + h(x)
    = [f(x) + g(x)] + h(x)

    and the equality of [f(x)+ g9(x)] +h(x) and f(x) + [g(x) +A(x)] 1s a fact about
    numbers. In this proof the equality of the two domains was not explicitly men-
    tioned because this is obvious, as soon as we begin to write down these equations;
    the domain of (f + g) +h and of f + (g +A) 1s clearly domain f 1 domain gM

    as we did for numbers.

    It is just as easy to prove that (f-g)-h = f -(g-h), and this function is denoted
    by f-g-h. The equations f+ ¢g=g+f and f-g =g- f should also present

    These must not be confused, since they are not usually equal; in fact, almost any f and g chosen at random will illustrate this point (try f = /-J and g = sin, for example). Lest you become too apprehensive about the operation of composition, let us hasten to point out that composition is associative:

    (fog)oh = fo(goh)

    (and the proof is a triviality); this function is denoted by fo goh. We can now write the functions (10), (11), (12) as

    (10) f = sin o (/ - J),
    (11) f = sin o (sin o (/ - J)),

    One fact has probably already become clear. Although this method of writing functions reveals their "structure" very clearly, it is hardly short or convenient. The shortest name for the function f such that f(x) = sin(x') for all x unfortunately seems to be "the function f such that f(x) = sin(x') for all x." The need for abbreviating this clumsy description has been clear for two hundred years, but no reasonable abbreviation has received universal acclaim. At present the strongest contender for this honor is something like

    x > sin(x')

    (read "x goes to sin(x)") or just "x arrow sin(x7)"), but it is hardly popular among writers of calculus textbooks. In this book we will tolerate a certain amount of ellipsis, and speak of "the function f(x) = sin(x')." Even more popular is the quite drastic abbreviation: "the function sin(x*)." For the sake of precision we will never use this description, which, strictly speaking, confuses a number and a function, but it is so convenient that you will probably end up adopting it for personal use. As with any convention, utility is the motivating factor, and this criterion is reasonable so long as the slight logical deficiencies cause no confusion.
    On occasion, confusion will arise unless a more precise description is used. For example, "the function x + 1°" is an ambiguous phrase; it could mean either

    x —> x + t, ie, the function f such that f(x) = x + 2? for all x

    Or

    t —> x + t, ie., the function f such that f(t) = x + t? for all t.

    As we shall see, however, for many important concepts associated with functions,
    calculus has a notation which contains the "x —" built in.

    By now we have made a sufficiently extensive investigation of functions to war-
    rant reconsidering our definition. We have defined a function as a "rule," but it is
    hardly clear what this means. If we ask "What happens if you break this rule?" it
    is not easy to say whether this question is merely facetious or actually profound.

    46 foundations

    A more substantial objection to the use of the word "rule" is that

    f(x) = x^2?
    and

    f(x) = x^7 + 3x^4 + 3 - 3(x + 1)

    are certainly different rules, if by a rule we mean the actual instructions given for
    determining f(x); nevertheless, we want

    f(x) = x^2?
    and

    f(x) = x^7 + 3x^4 + 3 - 3(x + 1)

    to define the same function. For this reason, a function is sometimes defined as an
    "association" between numbers; unfortunately the word "association" escapes the
    objections raised against "rule" only because it is even more vague.

    There is, of course, a satisfactory way of defining functions, or we should never
    have gone to the trouble of criticizing our original definition. But a satisfactory
    definition can never be constructed by finding synonyms for English words which
    are troublesome. The definition which mathematicians have finally accepted for
    "function" is a beautiful example of the means by which intuitive ideas have been
    incorporated into rigorous mathematics. The correct question to ask about a
    function is not "What is a rule?" or "What is an association?" but "What does
    one have to know about a function in order to know all about it?" The answer to
    the last question is easy—for each number x one needs to know the number f(x);
    we can imagine a table which would display all the information one could desire
    about the function f(x) = x^2:

    x   f(x)

Using the text''s discussion, explain why the following two definitions of a function are equivalent:\n1. A function is a set of ordered pairs (x, f(x)) such that each x is associated with exactly one f(x).\n2. A function is a rule that assigns to each x a unique f(x).\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Reference the text''s example of the table for f(x) = x^2 to show how both definitions are consistent.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the text criticizes the word ''rule'' as being too vague and how the concept of an ''association'' is still insufficient.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this equivalence for understanding functions in calculus.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s critique of vague terminology and the equivalence between the two definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Function Definitions**\n\nThe text presents the idea that the correct question to ask about a function is not "What is a rule?" or "What is an association?" but "What does one have to know about a function in order to know all about it?" Using this perspective, answer the following questions:\n1. How does the text''s definition of a function as "a set of ordered pairs (x, f(x)) such that each x is associated with exactly one f(x)" align with the idea of knowing all about a function?\n2. Why is the text''s emphasis on knowing "f(x) for each x" more informative than simply knowing "what the rule is"?\n3. Construct an example of a function that would be considered the same under the ''rule'' definition but different under the ''association'' definition. Explain why this is a problem for the definitions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect the text''s critique of vague definitions and the importance of focusing on the essential properties of functions.'

    number of the pair whose first member is 1; to find f(z) we take the second
    number of the pair whose first member 1s 7. We seem to be saying that a function
    might as well be defined as a collection of pairs of numbers. For example, if we
    were given the following collection (which contains just 5 pairs):

    f ={(1,7), (3,7), (5,3), (4,8), (8, 4)},
    then f(1) = 7, f(3) =7, f(5) = 3, f(4) = 8, f(8) = 4 and 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 are the

    only numbers in the domain of f. If we consider the collection

    f ={(1,7), (3,7), (2,5), (4, 8), (8,4) },
    then f(3) = 7, f(2) =5, f(8) = 4; but it is impossible to decide whether f(1) = 7

    or f(1) = 8. In other words, a function cannot be defined to be any old collection
    of pairs of numbers; we must rule out the possibility which arose in this case. We
    are therefore led to the following definition.

    A function is a collection of pairs of numbers with the following property: if
    (a,b) and (a,c) are both in the collection, then b = c; in other words, the

    This is our first full-fledged definition, and illustrates the format we shall always use to define significant new concepts. These definitions are so important (at least as important as theorems) that it is essential to know when one is actually at hand, and to distinguish them from comments, motivating remarks, and casual explanations. They will be preceded by the word DEFINITION, contain the term being defined in boldface letters, and constitute a paragraph unto themselves.

    There is one more definition (actually defining two things at once) which can now be made rigorously:

    If f is a function, the domain of f is the set of all a for which there is some b such that (a, b) is in f. If a is in the domain of f, it follows from the definition of a function that there is, in fact, a unique number b such that (a, b) is in f. This unique b is denoted by f(a).

    With this definition we have reached our goal: the important thing about a function f is that a number f(x) is determined for each number x in its domain. You may feel that we have also reached the point where an intuitive definition has been replaced by an abstraction with which the mind can hardly grapple. Two consolations may be offered. First, although a function has been defined as a collection of pairs, there is nothing to stop you from thinking of a function as a rule. Second, neither the intuitive nor the formal definition indicates the best way of thinking about functions. The best way is to draw pictures; but this requires a chapter all by itself.

    If $ f(x) = 0 $ for all $ x $, then $ f $ satisfies $ f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) $ for all $ x $ and $ y $, and also $ f(x - y) = f(x) - f(y) $ for all $ x $ and $ y $. Now suppose that $ f $ satisfies these two properties, but that $ f(x) $ is not always 0. Prove that $ f(x) = x $ for all $ x $, as follows:

    (a) Prove that $ f(1) = 1 $.

    (b) Prove that $ f(x) = x $ if $ x $ is rational.

    (c) Prove that $ f(x) > 0 $ if $ x > 0 $. (This part is tricky, but if you have been paying attention to the philosophical remarks accompanying the problems in the last two chapters, you will know what to do.)

    (d) Prove that $ f(x) > f(y) $ if $ x > y $.

    (e) Prove that $ f(x) = x $ for all $ x $. Hint: Use the fact that between any two numbers there is a rational number.

    i) $ f(x) + g(y) = xy $ for all $ x $ and $ y $.

    ii) $ f(x) - g(y) = x + y $ for all $ x $ and $ y $.

    Hint: Try to get some information about $ f $ or $ g $ by choosing particular values of $ x $ and $ y $.

    (b) Find functions $ f $ and $ g $ such that $ f(x + y) = g(xy) $ for all $ x $ and $ y $.

    ---

    (a) Find a function $ f $, other than a constant function, such that $ |f(y) - f(x)| < |y - x| $.

    (b) Suppose that $ f(y) - f(x) < (y - x)^2 $ for all $ x $ and $ y $. (Why does this imply that $ |f(y) - f(x)| < (y - x)^2 $?) Prove that $ f $ is a constant function.

    Hint: Divide the interval from $ x $ to $ y $ into $ n $ equal pieces.

    DEFINITION

    THEOREM 1

    PROOF

    APPENDIX. ORDERED PAIRS

    Not only in the definition of a function, but in other parts of the book as well, it is necessary to use the notion of an ordered pair of objects. A definition has not yet been given, and we have never even stated explicitly what properties an ordered pair is supposed to have. The one property which we will require states formally that the ordered pair (a,b) should be determined by a and b, and the order in which they are given:

    if (a,b) = (c,d), then a = c and b = d.

    Ordered pairs may be treated most conveniently by simply introducing (a, b) as an undefined term and adopting the basic property as an axiom—since this property is the only significant fact about ordered pairs, there is not much point worrying about what an ordered pair "really" is. Those who find this treatment satisfactory need read no further.

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Consistency of Ordered Pair Axiom in Functions**\n\nConsider the scenario where we define functions f and g such that f(x) = 0 for all x except at x1 and x2, and g(x) = 0 for all x except at x1 and x2. Assume f(x1) ≠ g(x1) or f(x2) ≠ g(x2).\n- **Task**: Show that the ordered pair axiom (as described in the text) cannot be used to define a collection P of functions in F that satisfies the conditions of PIQ—P12.\n- **Step 1**: Assume that such a collection P exists and satisfies the given properties.\n- **Step 2**: Use the ordered pair axiom to derive a contradiction based on the definitions of f and g.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude that no such collection P can exist.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must explicitly reference the ordered pair axiom and the definitions of functions in F, demonstrating logical consistency and contradiction.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Ordering of Functions and Composition**\n\nGiven the definition f < g meaning f(x) < g(x) for all x, analyze the properties P''10—P''13 and Problem 1-8.\n- **Task**: Determine which of these properties hold under the given ordering relation.\n- **Step 1**: For each property (P''10—P''13 and Problem 1-8), check if it is logically consistent with the definition of f < g.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a detailed justification for each property that holds or does not hold.\n- **Step 3**: Compare your findings with the properties of ordered pairs as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly identify which properties hold and which do not, using logical reasoning based on the text''s definitions and theorems.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Composition of Functions and Ordering**\n\nGiven the definition f < g meaning f(x) < g(x) for all x, analyze the composition of functions f o h and g o h.\n- **Task**: Determine whether f o h < g o h is necessarily true when f < g.\n- **Step 1**: Assume f < g and h is any function.\n- **Step 2**: Use the definitions of function composition and the given ordering to derive a logical conclusion.\n- **Step 3**: Consider cases where h might not be injective or surjective, and assess how these affect the relationship between f o h and g o h.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of function composition and the implications of the ordering relation, with explicit logical reasoning based on the text''s definitions.'

    The rest of this short appendix is for the benefit of those readers who will feel uncomfortable unless ordered pairs are somehow defined so that this basic property becomes a theorem. There is no point in restricting our attention to ordered pairs of numbers; it is just as reasonable, and just as important, to have available the notion of an ordered pair of any two mathematical objects. 'This means that our definition ought to involve only concepts common to all branches of mathematics. The one common concept which pervades all areas of mathematics is that of a set, and ordered pairs (like everything else in mathematics) can be defined in this context; an ordered pair will turn out to be a set of a rather special sort.

    The set {a, b}, containing the two elements a and b, is an obvious first choice, but will not do as a definition for (a, b), because there is no way of determining from {a,b} which of a or b is meant to be the first element. A more promising candidate is the rather startling set:

    { {a}, {a, b} }.

    This set has two members, both of which are themselves sets; one member is the set {a}, containing the single member a, the other is the set {a, b}. Shocking as it may seem, we are going to define (a, b) to be this set. The justification for this choice is given by the theorem immediately following the definition—the definition works, and there really isn't anything else worth saying.

    (a, b) = { {a}, {a, b} }.

    If (a,b) = (c,d), then a = c and b = d.

    The hypothesis means that
    {{a}, {a,b}} = {{c}, {c,d}}.

    Now { {a}, {a, b} } contains just two members, {a} and {a,b}; and a is the only common element of these two members of { {a}, {a,b} }. Similarly, c is the unique common member of both members of { {c}, {c,d} }. Therefore a = c. We therefore have

    {{a}, {a,b}} = {{c}, {c,d}}.

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Deduction in Set Theory**\n\nGiven the definition of an ordered pair as (a, b) = { {a}, {a, b} }, prove that if (a, b) = (c, d), then a = c and b = d.\n- **Step 1**: Start by assuming that (a, b) = (c, d).\n- **Step 2**: Use the definition of an ordered pair to write both sides as sets.\n- **Step 3**: Analyze the elements of the sets and apply the properties of set equality to show that a must equal c.\n- **Step 4**: Use the result from Step 3 to demonstrate that b must equal d.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must be logically structured, referencing the specific properties of sets and the given definition of ordered pairs without referencing external materials.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Set-Theoretic Reasoning with Ordered Pairs**\n\nConsider two ordered pairs: (a, b) and (c, d). Use the definition (a, b) = { {a}, {a, b} } to determine under what conditions these two ordered pairs are equal.\n- **Step 1**: Express both ordered pairs as sets using the given definition.\n- **Step 2**: Set the two sets equal to each other and analyze the resulting equation.\n- **Step 3**: Use the properties of set equality to derive the necessary conditions for a, b, c, and d.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly establish the conditions under which (a, b) = (c, d) and explicitly link the reasoning to the set-theoretic definition of ordered pairs.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Set Definitions**\n\nSuppose we define an ordered pair (a, b) as { {a}, {a, b} }, and we are told that (a, b) = { {2}, {2, 3} }. Find the values of a and b.\n- **Step 1**: Use the definition of an ordered pair to equate { {a}, {a, b} } to { {2}, {2, 3} }.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the elements of the sets and determine possible values for a and b.\n- **Step 3**: Verify that your solution satisfies the definition and the given equality.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must be logically sound, showing how the definition of an ordered pair allows you to uniquely determine the values of a and b.'

    and only the proof that b = d remains. It is convenient to distinguish 2 cases.

    Case 1. b = a. In this case, {a, b} = {a}, so the set { {a}, {a, b}} really has only one
    member, namely, {a}. The same must be true of { {a}, {a, d}}, so {a, d} = {a},
    which implies that d = a = b.

    Case 2. b ≤ a. In this case, b is in one member of { {a}, {a, b} } but not in the
    other. It must therefore be true that b is in one member of { {a}, {a, d}} but not
    in the other. This can happen only if b is in {a, d}, but b is not in {a}; thus b = a
    or b = d, but b ≠ a; hence b = d. ✅

    Mention the real numbers to a mathematician and the image of a straight line will
    probably form in her mind, quite involuntarily. And most likely she will neither
    banish nor too eagerly embrace this mental picture of the real numbers. "Geometric
    intuition" will allow her to interpret statements about numbers in terms of this
    picture, and may even suggest methods of proving them. Although the properties
    of the real numbers which were studied in Part I are not greatly illuminated by a
    geometric picture, such an interpretation will be a great aid in Part II.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Set Theory and Logical Reasoning**\n\nProve that if { {a}, {a, b} } = { {a}, {a, d} }, then b = d.\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the given equality of sets and consider the cases where b = a and b ≤ a.\n- **Step 2**: For each case, use the properties of set membership and the definitions of set equality to deduce the relationship between b and d.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude that b must equal d in both scenarios.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must be rigorous, using only the logical deductions and set theory principles presented in the text.

Use logical reasoning based on the distinction between rational and irrational numbers provided in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All numbers with exponents are irrational." Your example must reference at least two sets from the text (e.g., integers, rationals) and clarify how they relate to exponentiation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the hierarchy of real number classifications and demonstrate an understanding of why certain numbers fall into specific categories.'

    You are probably already familiar with the conventional method of considering
    the straight line as a picture of the real numbers, i.e., of associating to each real
    number a point on a line. 'To do this (Figure 1) we pick, arbitrarily, a point which
    we label 0, and a point to the right, which we label 1. The point twice as far to
    the right is labeled 2, the point the same distance from 0 to 1, but to the left of 0,
    is labeled -1, etc. With this arrangement, if a < b, then the point corresponding
    to a lies to the left of the point corresponding to b. We can also draw rational
    numbers, such as 7 in the obvious way. It is usually taken for granted that the
    irrational numbers also somehow fit into this scheme, so that every real number
    can be drawn as a point on the line. We will not make too much fuss about
    justifying this assumption, since this method of "drawing" numbers is intended
    solely as a method of picturing certain abstract ideas, and our proofs will never
    rely on these pictures (although we will frequently use a picture to suggest or help
    explain a proof). Because this geometric picture plays such a prominent, albeit
    inessential role, geometric terminology is frequently employed when speaking of
    numbers—thus a number is sometimes called a point, and R is often called the
    real line.

    The number |a—b| has a simple interpretation in terms of this geometric picture:
    it is the distance between a and b, the length of the line segment which has a as one
    end point and b as the other. This means, to choose an example whose frequent
    occurrence justifies special consideration, that the set of numbers x which satisfy
    |x — a| < ε may be pictured as the collection of points whose distance from a is
    less than ε. 'This set of points is the "interval" from a — ε to a+ε, which may also
    be described as the points corresponding to numbers x with a — ε < x < a+ε (Figure 2).

    Sets of numbers which correspond to intervals arise so frequently that it is desirable to have special names for them. The set {x : a < x < b} is denoted by (a, b) and called the open interval from a to b. This notation naturally creates some ambiguity, since (a, b) is also used to denote a pair of numbers, but in context it is always clear (or can easily be made clear) whether one is talking about a pair or an interval. Note that if a > b, then (a, b) = ∅, the set with no elements; in practice, however, it is almost always assumed (explicitly if one has been careful, and implicitly otherwise), that whenever an interval (a, b) is mentioned, the number a is less than b.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Interval Notation and Its Ambiguity**\n\nThe text discusses how the notation (a, b) is used for both an open interval and a pair of numbers. Given this ambiguity, explain how the context determines whether (a, b) refers to an interval or a pair. Use examples from the text (e.g., the open interval (a, b) and the pair (a, b)) to support your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the two interpretations and demonstrate an understanding of how context resolves the ambiguity. This question requires logical reasoning about the notation''s dual usage.'

Additionally, explain how the notation (—∞, a) and [a, ∞) can be used to define intervals that extend to infinity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the specific interval notations from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how intervals are used to describe mathematical functions. This question requires creative problem-solving based on the text''s examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Interval Notation and Graphs**\n\nThe text includes a graph of f(x) = 1 and f(x) = —3, which are horizontal lines.

    The set {x : a < x < b} is denoted by [a, b] and is called the closed interval from a to b. This symbol is usually reserved for the case a < b, but it is sometimes used for a = b, also. The usual pictures for the intervals (a, b) and [a, b] are shown in Figure 3; since no reasonably accurate picture could ever indicate the difference between the two intervals, various conventions have been adopted. Figure 3 also shows certain "infinite" intervals. The set {x : x > a} is denoted by (a, ∞), while the set {x : x ≥ a} is denoted by [a, ∞); the sets (−∞, a) and (−∞, a] are defined similarly. At this point a standard warning must be issued: the symbols ∞ and −∞, though usually read "infinity" and "minus infinity," are purely suggestive; there is no number "∞" which satisfies ∞ > a for all numbers a. While the symbols ∞ and −∞ will appear in many contexts, it is always necessary to define these uses in ways that refer only to numbers. The set R of all real numbers is also considered to be an "interval," and is sometimes denoted by (−∞, ∞).

- prompt: "Of even greater interest to us than the method of drawing numbers is a method  \nof drawing pairs of numbers. This procedure, probably also familiar to you, re-  \nquires a \"coordinate system,\" two straight lines intersecting at right angles. To  \ndistinguish these straight lines, we call one the horizontal axis, and one the vertical  \naxis. (More prosaic terminology, such as the \"first\" and \"second\" axes, is probably  \npreferable from a logical point of view, but most people hold their books, or at  \nleast their blackboards, in the same way, so that \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" are  \nmore descriptive.) Each of the two axes could be labeled with real numbers, but  \nwe can also label points on the horizontal axis with pairs (a, 0) and points on the  \nvertical axis with pairs (0, b), so that the intersection of the two axes, the \"origin\"  \nof the coordinate system, is labeled (0,0). Any pair (a, b) can now be drawn as  \nin Figure 4, lying at the vertex of the rectangle whose other three vertices are la-  \nbeled (0, 0), (a, 0), and (0, b). ‘The numbers a and b are called the first and second  \ncoordinates, respectively, of the point determined in this way.\n\nOur real concern, let us recall, is a method of drawing functions. Since a func-  \ntion is just a collection of pairs of numbers, we can draw a function by drawing  \neach of the pairs in the function. ‘The drawing obtained in this way is called the  \ngraph of the function. In other words, the graph of f contains all the points cor-  \nresponding to pairs (x, f(x)). Since most functions contain infinitely many pairs,  \ndrawing the graph promises to be a laborious undertaking, but, in fact, many  \nfunctions have graphs which are quite easy to draw.\n\nNot surprisingly, the simplest functions of all, the constant functions f(x) = c,  \nhave the simplest graphs. It is easy to see that the graph of the function f(x) =c  \nis a straight line parallel to the horizontal axis, at distance c from it (Figure 5).\n\nThe text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak."

    other cases are treated easily enough. The number c, which measures the ratio of

    This demonstration has neither been labeled nor treated as a formal proof. Indeed, a rigorous demonstration would necessitate a digression which we are not at all prepared to follow. 'The rigorous proof of any statement connecting geometric and algebraic concepts would first require a real proof (or a precisely stated assumption) that the points on a straight line correspond in an exact way to the real numbers. Aside from this, it would be necessary to develop plane geometry as precisely as we intend to develop the properties of real numbers. Now the detailed development of plane geometry is a beautiful subject, but it is by no means a prerequisite for the study of calculus. We shall use geometric pictures only as an aid to intuition; for our purposes (and for most of mathematics) it is perfectly satisfactory to define the plane to be the set of all pairs of real numbers, and to define straight lines as certain collections of pairs, including, among others, the collections {(x, cx) : x a real number}. 'To provide this artificially constructed geometry with all the structure of geometry studied in high school, one more definition is required. If (a,b) and (c,d) are two points in the plane, that is, pairs of real numbers, we define the distance between (a, b) and (c, d) to be

    √[(a−c)² + (b−d)²].

    If the motivation for this definition is not clear, Figure 8 should serve as adequate explanation—with this definition the Pythagorean theorem has been built into our geometry.*

    Reverting once more to our informal geometric picture, it is not hard to see (Figure 9) that the graph of the function f(x) = cx + d is a straight line with slope c, passing through the point (0,d). For this reason, the functions f(x) = cx +d are called linear functions. Simple as they are, linear functions occur frequently, and you should feel comfortable working with them. The following is a typical problem whose solution should not cause any trouble. Given two distinct points (a, b) and (c,d), find the linear function f whose graph goes through (a, b) and (c,d). This amounts to saying that f(a) = b and f(c) =d. If

    f is to be of the form f(x) = ax + B, then we must have

    a formula most easily remembered by using the "point-slope form" (see Problem 6).

    Of course, this solution is possible only if a 4 c; the graphs of linear functions account only for the straight lines which are not parallel to the vertical axis. The vertical straight lines are not the graph of any function at all; in fact, the graph of a function can never contain even two distinct points on the same vertical line. ‘This conclusion 1s immediate from the definition of a function—two points on the same vertical line correspond to pairs of the form (a, b) and (a,c) and, by definition, a function cannot contain (a, b) and (a,c) if b # c. Conversely, if a set of points in the plane has the property that no two points lie on the same vertical line, then it is surely the graph of a function. Thus, the first two sets in Figure 10 are not graphs of functions and the last two are; notice that the fourth is the graph of a function whose domain 1s not all of R, since some vertical lines have no poits on them at all.

    After the linear functions the simplest is perhaps the function f(x) = x*. If we draw some of the pairs in f, 1.e., some of the pairs of the form (x, x7), we obtain a picture hike Figure 11.

    It is not hard to convince yourself that all the pairs (x, x') lie along a curve like
    the one shown in Figure 12; this curve is known as a parabola.

    Since a graph is just a drawing on paper, made (in this case) with printer's ink,
    the question "Is this what the graph really looks like?" is hard to phrase in any
    sensible manner. No drawing is ever really correct since the line has thickness.
    Nevertheless, there are some questions which one can ask: for example, how can
    you be sure that the graph does not look like one of the drawings in Figure 13?
    It is easy to see, and even to prove, that the graph cannot look like (a); for if
    0 <x < y, then x* < y', so the graph should be higher at y than at x, which is
    not the case in (a) . It is also easy to see, simply by drawing a very accurate graph,
    first plotting many pairs (x, x*), that the graph cannot have a large "jump" as in (b)
    or a "corner" as in (c). In order to prove these assertions, however, we first need
    to say, in a mathematical way, what it means for a function not to have a "jump"
    or "corner"; these ideas already involve some of the fundamental concepts of
    calculus. Eventually we will be able to define them rigorously, but meanwhile you
    may amuse yourself by attempting to define these concepts, and then examining
    your definitions critically. Later these definitions may be compared with the ones
    mathematicians have agreed upon. If they compare favorably, you are certainly
    to be congratulated!

    The functions f(x) = x^n, for various natural numbers n, are sometimes called
    power functions. Their graphs are most easily compared as in Figure 14, by
    drawing several at once.

    The power functions are only special cases of polynomial functions, introduced
    in the previous chapter. Two particular polynomial functions are graphed in

    for example, have at most one valley). Although these assertions are easy to make,
    we will not even contemplate giving proofs until Part III (once the powerful meth-

    An interesting modification of this function is f(x) = x sin(1/x). The graph of
    this function is sketched in Figure 21. Since sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely often near O

    seems to be no telling what the product will do. It is possible to decide, but this is
    another question that is best deferred to Part III. The graph of f(x) = x² sin(1/x)
    has also been illustrated (Figure 22).

    For these infinitely oscillating functions, it is clear that the graph cannot hope to
    be really "accurate." The best we can do is to show part of it, and leave out the
    part near 0 (which is the interesting part). Actually, it is easy to find much simpler
    functions whose graphs cannot be "accurately" drawn. The graphs of

    The picture is shown in Figure 27. It contains two pieces, because the difference between the distances of (x, y) from (—c, 0) and (c, 0) may be taken in two different orders. The hyperbola intersects the horizontal axis when y = 0, so that x = a, but it never intersects the vertical axis.

    It is interesting to compare (Figure 28) the hyperbola with a = b = √(1/2) and the graph of the function f(x) = 1/x. The drawings look quite similar, and the two sets are actually identical, except for a rotation through an angle of π/4 (Problem 23).

    Clearly no rotation of the plane will change circles or ellipses into the graphs of functions. Nevertheless, the study of these important geometric figures can often be reduced to the study of functions. Ellipses, for example, are made up of the

    f(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < a

    and

    g(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < a.

    Of course, there are many other pairs of functions with this same property. For example, we can take

    f(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), 0 < x < a
    g(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < 0
    and
    f(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), 0 < x < a
    g(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < 0.

    We could also choose

    f(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x rational, -a < x < a
    g(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x irrational, -a < x < a
    and
    f(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x rational, -a < x < a
    g(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x irrational, -a < x < a.

    But all these other pairs necessarily involve unreasonable functions which jump
    around. A proof, or even a precise statement of this fact, is too difficult at present.
    Although you have probably already begun to make a distinction between those
    functions with reasonable graphs, and those with unreasonable graphs, you may
    find it very difficult to state a reasonable definition of reasonable functions. A
    mathematical definition of this concept is by no means easy, and a great deal of this
    book may be viewed as successive attempts to impose more and more conditions
    that a "reasonable" function must satisfy. As we define some of these conditions,
    we will take time out to ask if we have really succeeded in isolating the functions
    which deserve to be called reasonable. The answer, unfortunately, will always be
    "no," or at best, a qualified "yes."

    Hint: You already know the answers when x and y are interchanged.

    (a)

    Show that the straight line through (a, b) with slope m is the graph of the
    function f(x) = m(x —a)+b. This formula, known as the "point-slope
    form" is far more convenient than the equivalent expression f(x) =
    mx + (b — ma); it is immediately clear from the point-slope form that the
    slope is m, and that the value of f at a is b.

    For a ≠ c, show that the straight line through (a, b) and (c,d) is the
    graph of the function

    f(x)= (d — b)(x —a)/(c — a) + b.

    When are the graphs of f(x) = mx + b and g(x) = m'x + D' parallel
    straight lines?

    For any numbers A, B, and C, with A and B not both 0, show that the
    set of all (x, y) satisfying Ax + By + C = 0 is a straight line (possibly a
    vertical one). Hint: First decide when a vertical straight line is described.

    Show conversely that every straight line, including vertical ones, can be
    described as the set of all (x, y) satisfying Ax + By +C =0.

    Prove that the graphs of the functions

    f(x) =mx +b,
    g(x) =nx+c,
    are perpendicular if mn = —1, by computing the squares of the lengths
    of the sides of the triangle in Figure 29. (Why is this special case, where
    the lines intersect at the origin, as good as the general case?)

    Prove that the two straight lines consisting of all (x, y) satisfying the con-
    ditions

    Ax+ By+C =0,
    A'x + By +C'=0,

    are perpendicular if and only if AA'+ BB' = 0.

    you through the following problem, and others which occur before Chapter 23.
    There is one ambiguity about infinite decimals which must be eliminated: Every
    decimal ending in a string of 9's is equal to another ending in a string of 0's (e.g.,

    1.23999... = 1.24000...). We will always use the one ending in 9's.

    Vv = (VJ, U2).

    For convenience, we will use this convention that subscripts indicate the first and
    second pairs of a point that has been described by a single letter. Thus, if we
    mention the points w and z, it will be understood that w is the pair (w1, w2),
    while z is the pair (z1, z2).

    Instead of the actual pair of numbers (v1, v2), we often picture v as an arrow
    from the origin O to this point (Figure 1), and we refer to these arrows as vectors
    in the plane. Of course, we've haven't really said anything new yet, we've simply
    introduced an alternate term for a point of the plane, and another mental picture.
    The real point of the new terminology is to emphasize that we are going to do
    some new things with points in the plane.

    For example, suppose that we have two vectors (i.e., points) in the plane,

    v = (v1, v2), w = (w1, w2).
    Then we can define a new vector (a new point of the plane) v + w by the equation
    (1) v + w = (v1 + w1, v2 + w2).

    Notice that all the letters on the right side of this equation are numbers, and the
    + sign is just our usual addition of numbers. On the other hand, the + sign on
    the left side is new: previously, the sum of two points in the plane wasn't defined,
    and we've simply used equation (1) as a definition.

    A very fussy mathematician might want to use some new symbol for this newly
    defined operation, like
    v ⊕ w or perhaps v @ w,

    but there's really no need to insist on this; since v + w hasn't been defined before,
    there's no possibility of confusion, so we might as well keep the notation simple.
    Of course, any one can make new notation; for example, since it's our definition,
    we could just as well have defined v + w as (v1 + w1, v2 + w2), or by some
    other equally weird formula. The real question is, does our new construction have
    any particular significance?

    which, for the moment, we have simply indicated in the usual way, without drawing
    an arrow. Note that it is easy to compute the slope of the line L between v and
    our new point: as indicated in Figure 2, this slope is just

    (v2 + w2) − v2
    (w2) − v2

    and this, of course, is the slope of our vector w, from the origin O to (w1, w2). In
    other words, the line L is parallel to w.

    Similarly, the slope of the line M between (w1, w2) and our new point is

    (v2 + w2) − w2
    (v1 + w1) − w1

    which is the slope of the vector v; so M is parallel to v. In short, the new point
    v + w lies on the parallelogram having v and w as sides. When we draw v + w as
    an arrow (Figure 3), it points along the diagonal of this parallelogram. In physics,
    vectors are used to symbolize forces, and the sum of two vectors represents the
    resultant force when two different forces are applied simultaneously to the same
    object.

    Figure 4 shows another way of visualizing the sum v + w. If we use "w" to denote
    an arrow parallel to w, and having the same length, but starting at v instead of at
    the origin, then v + w is the vector from O to the final endpoint; thus we get to
    v + w by first following v, and then following w.

    Many of the properties of + for ordinary numbers also hold for this new + for
    vectors. For example, the "commutative law"

    v + w = w + v,

    is obvious from the geometric picture, since the parallelogram spanned by v and
    w is the same as the parallelogram spanned by w and v. It is also easily checked
    analytically, since it states that

    Figure 6(a) shows v and an arrow "w — v" that is parallel to w — v but that starts
    at the endpoint of v. As we established with Figure 4, the vector from the origin
    to the endpoint of this arrow 1s just v + (w — v) = w (Figure 6(b)). In other words,

    (We sometimes simply write av instead of a - vu; of course, it is then especially important to remember that v denotes a vector, rather than a number.) The vector a -v points in the same direction as v when a > O and in the opposite direction when a < O (Figure 7).

    1. Given a point v of the plane, let Rg(v) be the result of rotating v around the origin through an angle of 6 (Figure 8). ‘The aim of this problem is to obtain a formula for Rg, with minimal calculation.

    (a) Show that

    Ro(x, y) = (x cos@ — ysin6@, x sin@ + ycos@).

    *If you jump to Chapter 25, you'll find that there is an important way of defining a product, but

    Given two vectors v and w, we'd expect to have a simple formula, involving
    the coordinates v1, v2, w1, w2, for the area of the parallelogram they span.
    Figure 9 indicates a strategy for finding such a formula: since the triangle
    with vertices O, A, v + w is congruent to the triangle OBv, we can reduce
    the problem to an easier one where one side of the parallelogram lies along
    the horizontal axis:

    (a) The line L passes through v and is parallel to w, so has slope w2/w1.
    Conclude that the point B has coordinate

    B = (w1 - v1*w2/w1, w2)

    and that the parallelogram therefore has area

    det(v, w) = v1*w2 - v2*w1.

    This formula, which defines the determinant det, certainly seems to be simple
    enough, but it can't really be true that det(v, w) always gives the area. After
    all, we clearly have |

    det(w, v) = - det(v, w),

    so sometimes det will be negative! Indeed, it is easy to see that our "deriva-
    tion" made all sorts of assumptions (that w2 was positive, that B had a positive
    coordinate, etc.) Nevertheless, it seems likely that det(v, w) is + the area; the
    next problem gives an independent proof.

    (a) If v points along the positive horizontal axis, show that det(v, w) is the
    area of the parallelogram spanned by v and w for w above the horizontal
    axis (w2 > 0), and the negative of the area for w below this axis.

    (b) If R is rotation by an angle of θ (Problem 1), show that

    det(Rv, Rw) = det(v, w).

    Conclude that det(v, w) is the area of the parallelogram spanned by
    v and w when the rotation from v to w is counterclockwise, and the
    negative of the area when it is clockwise.

    Show that

    det(v, w + z) = det(v, w) + det(v, z)
    det(v + w, z) = det(v, z) + det(w, z)

    In a straight line. We can make things a lot simpler for ourselves if we rotate
    everything around the vertical axis so that this intersection line points straight out
    from the plane of the paper, while the first axis is in the usual position that we
    are familiar with. The plane P is thus viewed "straight on," so that all we see
    (Figure 4) is its intersection L with the plane of the first and third axes; from this
    view-point the cone itself simply appears as two straight lines.

    If this line L happens to be vertical, consisting of all points (a, z) for some a,
    then equation (1) says that the intersection of the cone and the plane consists of
    all points (a, y, z) with

    2 Cy? = C22,

    which is an hyperbola.
    Otherwise, in the plane of the first and third axes, the line L can be described
    as the collection of all points of the form

    (x, Mx+ B),
    where M is the slope of L. For an arbitrary point (x, y, z) it follows that
    (2) (x, y,z) is in the plane P if and only if z= Mx + B.

    Combining (1) and (2), we see that (x, y, z) is in the intersection of the cone and
    the plane if and only if

    (x) Mx +B =+Cv x2 + y?.

    Now we have to choose coordinate axes in the plane P. We can choose L as the
    first axis, measuring distances from the intersection Q with the horizontal plane
    (Figure 5); for the second axis we just choose the line through Q parallel to our
    original second axis. If the first coordinate of a point in P with respect to these
    axes is x, then the first coordinate of this point with respect to the original axes
    can be written in the form

    ax + B

    for some a and B. On the other hand, if the second coordinate of the point with
    respect to these axes is y, then y is also the second coordinate with respect to the
    original axes.

    Consequently, (*) says that the point lies on the intersection of the plane and the
    cone if and only if

    Although this looks fairly complicated, after squaring we can write this as
    Cy? —a*(M* —C')x? + Ex+F=0

    for some E and F that we won't bother writing out.
    Now Problem 4-16 indicates that this is either a parabola, an ellipse, or an
    hyperbola. In fact, looking a little more closely at the solution, we see that the

    (1) If M =+C we obtain a parabola;
    (2) If C* > M? we obtain an ellipse;
    (3) If C? < M? we obtain an hyperbola.

    These analytic conditions are easy to interpret geometrically (Figure 6):

    (1) If our plane is parallel to one of the generating lines of the cone we obtain
    a parabola;

    (2) If our plane slopes less than the generating line of the cone (so that our
    intersection omits one half of the cone) we obtain an ellipse;

    (3) If our plane slopes more than the generating line of the cone we obtain an

    hyperbola.

    In fact, the very names of these "conic sections" are related to this description.
    The word parabola comes from a Greek root meaning ‘alongside,' the same root
    that appears in parable, not to mention paradigm, paradox, paragon, paragraph,
    paralegal, parallax, parallel, and even parachute. Ellipse comes from a Greek root
    meaning ‘defect,' or omission, as in ellipsis (an omission, ... or the dots that in-
    dicate it). And hyperbola comes from a Greek root meaning ‘throwing beyond,' or
    excess. With the currency of words like hyperactive, hypersensitive, and hyperven-
    tilate, not to mention hype, one can probably say, without risk of hyperbole, that
    this root 1s familiar to almost everyone.*

    In this chapter we've been acting all along as if there's only one way to label
    points in the plane with pairs of numbers. Actually, there are many different
    ways, each giving rise to a different "coordinate system." The usual coordinates
    of a point are called its cartesian coordinates, after the French mathematician
    and philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650), who first introduced the idea of
    coordinate systems. In many situations it is more convenient to introduce polar
    coordinates, which are illustrated in Figure 1. To the point P we assign the polar
    coordinates (r,θ), where r is the distance from the origin O to P, and θ is the
    measure, in radians, of the angle between the horizontal axis and the line from
    O to P. This θ is not determined unambiguously. For example, points on the
    right side of the horizontal axis could have either θ = 0 or θ = 2π; moreover, θ
    is completely ambiguous at the origin O. So it is necessary to exclude some ray
    through the origin if we want to assign a unique pair (r,θ) to each point under
    consideration.

    On the other hand, there is no problem associating a unique point to any pair
    (r,θ). In fact, it is possible (though not approved of by all) to associate a point
    to (r,θ) when r < 0, according to the scheme indicated in Figure 2. Thus, it
    always makes sense to talk about "the point with polar coordinates (r, θ)," (with
    or without the possibility of r < 0), even though there is some ambiguity when we
    talk about "the polar coordinates" of a given point.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Coordinate System Ambiguity and Uniqueness**\n\nGiven the ambiguity in polar coordinates (as discussed in the text), explain how one can ensure that a unique pair (r,θ) is assigned to each point in the plane, and how this uniqueness is achieved when r < 0, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Describe the standard convention for uniquely determining polar coordinates (r,θ) for a point in the plane.\n- **Part B**: Explain the method by which negative r values can be used to represent points uniquely, referencing the scheme in Figure 2.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the uniqueness of polar coordinates with the uniqueness of Cartesian coordinates.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s discussion on the necessity of excluding certain rays through the origin to achieve uniqueness and the role of negative r values in this context.'

    Conversely, if a point has Cartesian coordinates (x, y), then (any of) its polar coordinates (r, θ) satisfy

    r = √(x² + y²)

    tanθ = y/x if x ≠ 0.

    Now suppose that f is a function. Then by the graph of f in polar coordinates we mean the collection of all points P with polar coordinates (r, θ) satisfying r = f(θ). In other words, the graph of f in polar coordinates is the collection of all points with polar coordinates (f(θ), θ). No special significance should be attached to the fact that we are considering pairs (f(θ), θ), with f(θ) first, as opposed to pairs (x, f(x)) in the usual graph of f; it is purely a matter of convention that r is considered the first polar coordinate and θ is considered the second.

    The graph of f in polar coordinates is often described as "the graph of the equation r = f(θ)." For example, suppose that f is a constant function, f(θ) = a for all θ. The graph of the equation r = a is simply a circle with center O and radius a (Figure 3). This example illustrates, in a rather blatant way, that polar coordinates are likely to make things simpler in situations that involve symmetry with respect to the origin O.

    The graph of the equation r = θ is shown in Figure 4. "The solid line corresponds to all values of θ > 0, while the dashed line corresponds to values of θ < 0.

    As another example involving both positive and negative r, consider the graph of the equation r = cosθ. Figure 5(a) shows the part that corresponds to 0 < θ < π/2. Figure 5(b) shows the part corresponding to π/2 < θ < π; here r < 0. You can check that no new points are added for θ > π/2 or θ < 0. It is easy to describe this same graph in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of its points. Since the polar coordinates of any point on the graph satisfy

    r = cosθ,

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Polar and Cartesian Coordinate Systems**\n\nGiven that a point P has polar coordinates (r, θ), and its Cartesian coordinates are (x, y), derive the relationship between r, θ, x, and y using the provided definitions of polar coordinates. Then, using the equation r = cosθ, show that the Cartesian coordinates of any point on this graph satisfy x² + y² = cos²θ and y = x tanθ.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your derivation must explicitly reference the given definitions of polar coordinates and the conversion formulas between polar and Cartesian coordinates. You must also demonstrate that the Cartesian equation derived from r = cosθ is consistent with the polar equation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Polar Graph Symmetry and Behavior**\n\nConsider the graph of r = θ, as described in the text. Explain how the graph behaves for θ > 0 and θ < 0, and describe the resulting shape (the spiral of Archimedes). Using the definition of polar coordinates, justify why the solid line corresponds to θ > 0 and the dashed line to θ < 0. Additionally, explain how the graph is affected when θ is allowed to take negative values.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must integrate the definition of polar coordinates and the behavior of the function r = θ for both positive and negative inputs. You must also describe the geometric implications of negative r values in this context.'

Additionally, construct a logical argument to show that the graph of r = cosθ is symmetric about the polar axis (the x-axis in Cartesian coordinates).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the relationship between polar and Cartesian equations.

    $ r = r \cos 6, $

    its cartesian coordinates satisfy the equation
    $ x^2 + y^2 = X $

    which describes a circle (Problem 4-16). [Conversely, it is clear that if the cartesian
    coordinates of a point satisfy $ x^2 + y^2 = X $, then it lies on the graph of the equation
    $ r = \cos 0 $.]

    Although we've now gotten a circle in two different ways, we might well be
    hesitant about trying to find the equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates. But
    it turns out that we can get a very nice equation if we choose one of the foci as
    the origin. Figure 6 shows an ellipse with one focus at O, with the sum of the
    distances of all points from O and the other focus f being 2a. We've chosen f to
    be the left of O, with coordinates written as

    $ (-2ea, 0) $.

    (We have $ 0 < e < 1 $, since we must have $ 2a > $ distance from f to O).

    $ (x, y) $
    $ 2a - F/r r $
    $ f = (-2ea, 0) $ O
    $ a $

    FIGURE 6

    The distance r from (x, y) to O is given by
    (1) $ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $,
    By assumption, the distance from (x, y) to f is $ 2a - r $, hence
    (2a - r)^2 = (x - [ -2ea ])^2 + y^2,
    or
    (2) $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 = x^2 + 4eax + 4e^2a^2 + y^2 $.
    Subtracting (1) from (2), and dividing by 4a, we get

    $ a - r = ex + t + e^2a $.
    Wait, I think there might be a typo in the original text here. Let me correct that.

    From subtracting (1) from (2), we get:

    $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = x^2 + 4eax + 4e^2a^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) $

    Simplifying both sides:

    Left side: $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 - (x^2 + y^2) $

    Right side: $ x^2 + 4eax + 4e^2a^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $

    So:

    $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $

    But from (1): $ r^2 = x^2 + y^2 $, so we can substitute that into the left side:

    $ 4a^2 - 4ar + (x^2 + y^2) - (x^2 + y^2) = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $

    Simplify:

    $ 4a^2 - 4ar = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $

    Divide both sides by 4a:

    $ a - r = ex + e^2a $

    Then solving for r:

    $ r = a - ex - e^2a $

    Which we can write as

    (3) $ r = (1 - e^2)a - ex $

    Substituting $ r \cos\theta $ for x, we have

    $ r = (1 - e^2)a - ex $

    $ r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a - e x $

    But $ x = r \cos\theta $, so:

    $ r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a - e r \cos\theta $

    Rearranging:

    $ r \cos\theta + e r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a $

    $ r \cos\theta (1 + e) = (1 - e^2)a $

    Note that $ 1 - e^2 = (1 - e)(1 + e) $, so:

    $ r \cos\theta (1 + e) = (1 - e)(1 + e)a $

    Divide both sides by $ 1 + e $:

    $ r \cos\theta = (1 - e)a $

    But this is not quite the form we want. Let me re-express the original equation again.

    From earlier:

    $ r = (1 - e^2)a - ex $

    Substituting $ x = r \cos\theta $, we have:

    $ r = (1 - e^2)a - e r \cos\theta $

    Rearranging:

    $ r + e r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a $

    Factor out r:

    $ r(1 + e \cos\theta) = (1 - e^2)a $

    Therefore:

    $ r = \frac{(1 - e^2)a}{1 + e \cos\theta} $

    Which we can write as

    (4) $ r = \frac{A}{1 + e \cos\theta} $, for $ A = (1 - e^2)a $

    In Chapter 4 we found that
    $ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 $

    One convenient way of picturing the assertion that f approaches / near a is provided by a method of drawing functions that was not mentioned in Chapter 4.
    In this method, we draw two straight lines, each representing R, and arrows from a point x in one, to f(x) in the other. Figure 2 illustrates such a picture for two different functions.

    Now consider a function f whose drawing looks like Figure 3. Suppose we ask that f(x) be close to J, say within the open interval B which has been drawn in Figure 3. This can be guaranteed if we consider only the numbers x in the interval A of Figure 3. (In this diagram we have chosen the largest interval which will work; any smaller interval containing a could have been chosen instead.) If we

    choose a smaller interval B' (Figure 4) we will, usually, have to choose a smaller A', but no matter how small we choose the open interval B, there is always supposed to be some open interval A which works.

    A similar pictorial interpretation is possible in terms of the graph of f, but in this case the interval B must be drawn on the vertical axis, and the set A on the horizontal axis. The fact that f(x) is in B when x is in A means that the part of the graph lying over A is contained in the region which is bounded by the horizontal lines through the end points of B; compare Figure 5(a), where a valid interval A has been chosen, with Figure 5(b), where A is too large.

    ‘To take a specific simple example, let's consider the function f(x) = 3x with
    a = 5 (Figure 6). Presumably f should approach the limit 15 near 5—we ought
    to be able to get f(x) as close to 15 as we like if we require that x be sufficiently
    close to 5. ‘Io be specific, suppose we want to make sure that 3x is within ε of
    15. This means that we want to have

    |3x - 15| < ε,

    which we can also write as
    |3x - 15| < ε,
    or
    -ε < 3x - 15 < ε.

    ‘To do this we just have to require that
    |x - 5| < ε/3;

    or simply |x —5| < ε/3; There is nothing special about the number in: It is just as
    easy to guarantee that |3x — 15| < ε; simply require that |x — 5| < ε/3. In fact,
    if we take any positive number ε we can make |3x — 15| < ε simply by requiring
    that |x —5| < ε/3.

    There's also nothing special about the choice a = 5. It's just as easy to see that
    f approaches the limit 3a at a for any a: ‘To ensure that

    |3x —3a| < ε

    we just have to require that

    |x - a| < ε/3.

    Naturally, the same sort of argument works for the function f(x) = 3,000,000x.
    We just have to be 1,000,000 times as careful, choosing |x — a| < ε/3,000,000 in
    order to ensure that | f(x) — 3,000,000a| < ε.

    The function f(x) = x² is a little more interesting. Presumably, we should be
    able to show that f(x) approaches 9 near 3. This means that we need to show
    how to ensure the inequality

    |x² - 9| < ε

    for any given positive number ε by requiring |x — 3| to be small enough. The
    obvious first step is to write

    |x² - 9| = |x - 3||x + 3|.

    which gives us the useful |x — 3| factor. Unlike the situation with the previous
    examples, however, the extra factor here is |x +3], which isn't a convenient constant
    like 3 or 3,000,000. But the only crucial thing is to make sure that we can say
    something about how big |x + 3| is. So the first thing we'll do is to require that
    |x — 3| < 1. Once we've specified that |x — 3| < 1, or 2 < x < 4, we have

    |x — 3| < min(ε/7, 1).

    The initial specification |x — 3| < 1 was simply made for convenience. We
    could just as well have specified that |x — 3| < ε or |x — 3| < 10 or any other

    Consider first the function f(x) = x sin(1/x) (Figure 8). Despite the erratic behavior of this function near 0 it is clear, at least intuitively, that f approaches 0 near a = 0 (remember that our provisional definition specifically exempts x = a from consideration, so it doesn't matter that this function isn't even defined at 0). We want to show that we can get f(x) = x sin(1/x) as close to 0 as desired if we require that x be sufficiently close to 0, but x ≠ 0. In other words, for any number ε > 0, we want to show that we can ensure that

    |f(x) − 0| = |x sin(1/x)| < ε

    by requiring that |x| = |x − 0| is sufficiently small (but x ≠ 0). But this is easy. Since

    |sin(1/x)| < 1 for all x ≠ 0,

    we have

    |x sin(1/x)| < |x|,

    for all x ≠ 0,

    so we can make |x sin(1/x)| < ε simply by requiring that |x| < ε and x ≠ 0.

    For the function f(x) = x^7 sin(1/x) (Figure 9) it seems even clearer that f approaches 0 near 0. If, for example, we want

    |x^7 sin(1/x)| < ε,

    then we certainly need only require that |x| < ε and x ≠ 0, since this implies that |x^7| < ε^7 and consequently

    |x^7 sin(1/x)| < |x^7| < ε^7.

    (We could do even better, and allow |x| < 1/10 and x ≠ 0, but there is no particular virtue in being as economical as possible.) In general, if ε > 0, to ensure that

    |x^7 sin(1/x)| < ε,

    we need only require that

    | x | < ε and x ≠ 0.

    small we require |x| to be, we cannot ensure that | f(x) —_| < 7 The reason is,
    that for any interval A containing 0 we can find both x; and x2 in this interval

    namely
    l l

    then, no matter what a is, f does not approach any number / near a. In fact, we

    cannot make | f(x) —/| < i no matter how close we bring x to a, because in any

    interval around a there are numbers x with f(x) = O, and also numbers x with
    f(x) = 1, so that we would need |O —/| < t and also |1 —/| < 7

    If a > 0, then f approaches | near a: indeed, to ensure that | f(x) — I] < « it
    certainly suffices to require that |x — a| < a, since this implies

    —a<x-—a
    or O<x

    so that f(x) = Ll. Similarly, if b < 0, then f approaches —1 near b: to ensure
    that | f(x) — (—1)| < ¢ it suffices to require that |x — b| < —b. Finally, as you may
    easily check, f does not approach any number near 0.

    The time has now come to point out that of the many demonstrations about
    limits which we have given, not one has been a real proof. The fault hes not
    with our reasoning, but with our definition. If our provisional definition of a
    function was open to criticism, our provisional definition of approaching a limit
    is even more vulnerable. This definition is simply not sufficiently precise to be
    used in proofs. It is hardly clear how one "makes" f(x) close to / (whatever
    "close" means) by "requiring" x to be sufficiently close to a (however close "suff-
    ciently" close is supposed to be). Despite the criticisms of our definition you may
    feel (I certainly hope you do) that our arguments were nevertheless quite convinc-
    ing. In order to present any sort of argument at all, we have been practically forced
    to invent the real definition. It is possible to arrive at this definition in several steps,
    each one clarifying some obscure phrase which still remains. Let us begin, once
    again, with the provisional definition:

    The function f approaches the limit / near a, if we can make f(x) as close
    as we like to / by requiring that x be sufficiently close to, but unequal to, a.

    The very first change which we made in this definition was to note that making
    f(x) close to / meant making | f(x) —/| small, and similarly for x and a:

    The second, more crucial, change was to note that making | f(x) — | "as small as we like" means making | f(x) —1| < € for any ¢ > 0 that happens to be given us:

    The function f approaches the limit / near a, if for every number e€ > 0 we
    can make | f(x) —/| < e by requiring that |x — a| be sufficiently small, and

    xa.

    There is a common pattern to all the demonstrations about limits which we have
    given. For each number € > 0 we found some other positive number, 6 say, with
    the property that if x 4 a and |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) —1| < e. For the function
    f(x) = xsm1/x (with a = 0, 1 = O), the number 6 was just the number ¢;
    for f(x) = J |x| sin 1/x, it was e*; for f(x) = x? it was the minimum of | and
    €/(2\a| + 1). In general, it may not be at all clear how to find the number 4,
    given &€, but it is the condition |x — a| < 6 which expresses how small "sufficiently"
    small must be:

    The function f approaches the limit / near a, if for every € > O there is some
    6 > O such that, for all x, if |x —a| < 6 and x #a, then | f(x) -l| <e.

    This is practically the definition we will adopt. We will make only one trivial
    change, noting that "|x — a| < 6 and x # a" can just as well be expressed "O <
    Ix —a| <6."

    The function f approaches the limit / near a means: for every ¢ > O there
    is some 6 > O such that, for all x, if O < |x —a| < 4, then | f(x) —l| < e.

    This definition is so important (everything we do from now on depends on it) that
    proceeding any further without knowing it is hopeless. If necessary memorize it,
    like a poem! That, at least, is better than stating it incorrectly; if you do this you
    are doomed to give incorrect proofs. A good exercise in giving correct proofs is to
    review every fact already demonstrated about functions approaching limits, giving
    formal proofs of each. In most cases, this will merely involve a bit of rewording
    to make the arguments conform to our formal definition—all the algebraic work
    has been done already. When proving that f does not approach / at a, be sure to
    negate the definition correctly:

    If it is not true that

    for every ε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that, for all x, if 0 < |x —a| < δ,
    then | f(x) —L| < ε,

    then
    there is some ε > 0 such that for every δ > 0 there is some x which satisfies
    0 < |x —a| < δ but not |f(x) - L| < ε.

    Thus, to show that the function f(x) = sin(1/x) does not approach 0 near 0, we
    consider ε = 1/2 and note that for every δ > 0 there is some x with 0 < |x — 0| < δ
    but not |sin(1/x) - 0| < 1/2 —namely, an x of the form 1/(2nπ + 2nπ), where n is
    so large that 1/(2nπ + 2nπ) < δ.

    As a final illustration of the use of the definition of a function approaching a
    limit, we have reserved the function shown in Figure 15, a standard example, but
    one of the most complicated:

    f(x) = {
    0, x irrational, 0 < x < 1;
    1/q, x = p/q in lowest terms, 0 < x < 1.
    }

    (Recall that p/q is in lowest terms if p and q are integers with no common factor
    and q > 0.)

Construct such an x by selecting x = 1/(2nπ + π/2) for sufficiently large n.\n4. Justify why this x satisfies the conditions and why |sin(1/x)| is not less than 1/2.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must explicitly reference the negation of the limit definition and demonstrate the existence of a counterexample for any δ > 0, using the text''s explanation as a guide.'

Start by restating the negation in your own words.\n2.

    A function cannot approach two different limits near a. In other words, if f approaches / near a, and f approaches m near a, then / = m.

    Since this is our first theorem about limits it will certainly be necessary to translate the hypotheses according to the definition.

    Since f approaches / near a, we know that for any ¢ > O there is some number 6, > 0 such that, for all x,

    if O < |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) —l| <e.

    We also know, since f approaches m near a, that there is some 52 > O such that,
    for all x,
    if O < |x —a| < 42, then | f(x) —m| <e.

    We have had to use two numbers, 6; and 42, since there is no guarantee that the 6
    which works in one definition will work in the other. But, in fact, it is now easy to
    conclude that for any ¢ > O there is some 6 > O such that, for all x,

    if O < |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) —l| < « and |f(x) —m| < ¢;

    we simply choose 6 = min(6, 62).
    To complete the proof we just have to pick a particular ¢ > O for which the two
    conditions

    If(x)-l<e and |f(x)-m|<e

    cannot both hold, if / # m. The proper choice is suggested by Figure 16. If
    1 £m, so that |l — m| > 0, we can choose |/ — m|/2 as our eé. It follows that there

    5. Limits 101

    The number / which f approaches near a is denoted by lim f(x) (read: the limit

    of f(x) as x approaches a). This definition is possible only because of Theorem 1,

    which ensures that lim f(x) never has to stand for two different numbers. The

    X—7a

    equation

    lim f(x) =1
    has exactly the same meaning as the phrase
    f approaches / near a.

    The possibility still remains that f does not approach / near a, for any /, so that
    lim f(x) =/ 1s false for every number /. This is usually expressed by saying that

    ‘lim f(x) does not exist."

    Xa

    Notice that our new notation introduces an extra, utterly irrelevant letter x,
    which could be replaced by ¢t, y, or any other letter which does not already
    appear—the symbols

    lim f(x), lim f(t), lim f(y),
    xa ta ya

    all denote precisely the same number, which depends on f and a, and has nothing
    to do with x, t, or y (these letters, in fact, do not denote anything at all). A more

    logical symbol would be something like lim f, but this notation, despite its brevity,

    is so infuriatingly rigid that almost no one has seriously tried to use it. ‘The notation
    lim f(x) 1s much more useful because a function f often has no simple name, even

    Xa

    though it might be possible to express f(x) by a simple formula involving x. ‘Thus,
    the short symbol
    lim (x? + sin x)

    Xa

    could be paraphrased only by the awkward expression

    lim f, where f(x) = x7 + sinx.

    These examples illustrate the main advantage of our notation, which is its flexibility. In fact, the notation lim f(x) is so flexible that there is some danger of
    xa

    forgetting what it really means. Here is a simple exercise in the use of this no-
    tation, which will be important later: first interpret precisely, and then prove the
    equality of the expressions

    lim f(x) and lim f(a +h).

    An important part of this chapter is the proof of a theorem which will make
    it easy to find many limits, as we promised long ago. The proof depends upon
    certain properties of inequalities and absolute values, hardly surprising when one
    considers the definition of limit. Although these facts have already been stated in
    Problems 1-20, 1-21, and 1-22, because of their importance they will be presented
    once again, in the form of a lemma (a lemma is an auxiliary theorem, a result that
    justifies its existence only by virtue of its prominent role in the proof of another
    theorem). The lemma says, roughly, that if x is close to xo, and y is close to yo,
    then x + y will be close to xo + yo, and xy will be close to xoyo, and 1/y will be
    close to 1/yo. ‘This intuitive statement is much easier to remember than the precise
    estimates of the lemma, and it is not unreasonable to read the proof of Theorem 2
    first, in order to see just how these estimates are used.

    (1) If |x — xo| < 5 and |y — yo| < ε, then
    |x + y — (xo + yo)| < ε.
    (2) If |x — xo| < min(1, ε/(2(|yo| + 1))) and |y — yo| < ε/(2(|xo| + 1)),
    then
    |xy — xoyo| < ε.
    (3) If yo ≠ 0 and |y — yo| < min(ε/|yo|², 1), then y ≠ 0 and
    |1/y — 1/yo| < ε.

    To prove (2) we proceed similarly, after consulting part (2) of the lemma. If

    and if O < |x —a| < 49, then |e(x) —m| < ,

    So, by the lemma, |(f - g)(x) —/-m| < ¢€, and this proves (2).

    if O < |x —a| <6, then |g(x) —m| < in (1 — )

Explain how the concept of ''closeness'' in the former translates to ''largeness'' in the latter.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the analogy given in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how the definitions are logically connected.\n\n**Answer**: The condition "OQ < |x — a| < 6" expresses that x is close to a, while "x > N" indicates that x is large. Both definitions rely on the idea of quantifying how ''close'' or ''large'' x must be to achieve a desired closeness of f(x) to L. In the case of limits at infinity, we are concerned with the behavior of f(x) as x becomes arbitrarily large, rather than x approaching a finite value. The analogy highlights that the core idea of limits—ensuring f(x) is within a certain tolerance of L—is preserved, even when x is not approaching a specific point but rather growing without bound.\n\n**Note**: This is a conceptual question that does not require direct computation from the text but rather requires the test taker to synthesize the analogy and logical structure of the definitions provided.'

    **(d)** If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)g(x)$ exists, does it follow that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x)$ exists?

    **Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to a} |f(x) - f(a)| = 0$.** (This is mainly an exercise in understanding what the terms mean.)

    **(a)** Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to a} |f(x) - L| = 0$. (First see why the assertion is obvious; then provide a rigorous proof. In this chapter most problems which ask for proofs should be treated in the same way.)

    **(b)** Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x - a)$.

    **(c)** Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$.

    **(d)** Give an example where $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists, but $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ does not.

    Suppose there is an $\epsilon > 0$ such that $f(x) = g(x)$ when $0 < |x - a| < \epsilon$. Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$. In other words, $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ depends only on the values of $f(x)$ for $x$ near $a$—this fact is often expressed by saying that limits are a "local property." (It will clearly help to use $\epsilon'$, or some other letter, instead of $\epsilon$, in the definition of limits.)

    **(a)** Suppose that $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x$. Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) < \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$, provided that these limits exist.

    **(b)** How can the hypotheses be weakened?

    **(c)** If $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x$, does it necessarily follow that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) < \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$?

    Suppose that $f(x) < g(x) < h(x)$ and that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x)$. Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x)$ exists, and that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x)$. (Draw a picture!)

    **(a)** Prove that if $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{x} = 1$ and $b \neq 0$, then $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(bx)}{x} = b$. Hint: Write $\frac{f(bx)}{x} = b \left[ \frac{f(bx)}{bx} \right]$.

    **(b)** What happens if $b = 0$?

    5. Limits 111

    Consider a function f with the following property: if g is any function for

    which lim g(x) does not exist, then lim [ f(x) + g(x)] also does not exist.

    Prove that this happens if and only if lim f(x) does exist. Hint: This is

    actually very easy: the assumption that lim f(x) does not exist leads to an

    immediate contradiction if you consider the right g.

    This problem is the analogue of Problem 22 when f + g is replaced by f - g.

    In this case the situation is considerably more complex, and the analysis

    requires several steps (those in search of an especially challenging problem

    can attempt an independent solution).

    (a) Suppose that lim f(x) exists and is ≠ 0. Prove that if lim g(x) does not

    exist, then lim f (x)g(x) also does not exist.

    (b) Prove the same result if lim | f (x)| = ∞. (The precise definition of this

    sort of limit is given in Problem 37.)

    (c) Prove that if neither of these two conditions holds, then there is a function

    g such that lim g(x) does not exist, but lim f (x) g(x) does exist.

  finalExamQuestion1: "**Proof of Limit Behavior with Disjoint Sets**\\n\\nLet $ A_n $ be a sequence of finite sets in $ (0, 1] $, where each $ A_n $ is disjoint from the others. Define a function $ f $ such that $ f(x) = a $ for $ x $ in $ A_n $, and $ f(x) = 0 $ otherwise. Prove that $ \\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 0 $ for all $ a $ in $ [0, 1] $.\\n\\n**Steps to Consider**:\\n1. Use the definition of a limit: For every $ \\varepsilon > 0 $, there exists a $ \\delta > 0 $ such that if $ 0 < |x - 0| < \\delta $, then $ |f(x) - 0| < \\varepsilon $.\\n2. Analyze the behavior of $ f(x) $ as $ x $ approaches 0. Since $ A_n $ are disjoint, only a finite number of $ A_n $ can intersect with the interval $ (0, \\delta) $.\\n3. For any $ x $ in $ (0, \\delta) $, if $ x $ belongs to one of the $ A_n $, then $ f(x) = a $, but since only finitely many $ A_n $ are in $ (0, \\delta) $, the distance from $ a $ to 0 must be less than $ \\varepsilon $ for sufficiently small $ \\delta $.\\n\\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must clearly reference the properties of finite sets and the definition of a limit, and it must explicitly show that the limit is 0 regardless of the value of $ a $."

    We would like to regard all behavior of this type as abnormal and honor, with
    some complimentary designation, functions which do not exhibit such peculiarities.
    The term which has been adopted is "continuous." Intuitively, a function f is
    continuous if the graph contains no breaks, jumps, or wild osculations. Although
    this description will usually enable you to decide whether a function is continuous
    simply by looking at its graph (a skill well worth cultivating) it is easy to be fooled,
    and the precise definition is very important.

    The function f is continuous at a if

    lim f(x) = f(a),

    We will have no difficulty finding many examples of functions which are, or are
    not, continuous at some number a—every example involving limits provides an
    example about continuity, and Chapter 5 certainly provides enough of these.

    The function f(x) = sin 1/x is not continuous at 0, because it is not even defined
    at 0, and the same is true of the function g(x) = x sin 1/x. On the other hand, if
    we are willing to extend the second of these functions, that is, if we wish to define

    THEOREM 1

    a new function G by

    x sin 1/x, x ≠ 0

    a, x = 0,

    G(x) = |

    then the choice of a = G(0) can be made in such a way that G will be continuous
    at 0—to do this we can (if fact, we must) define G(0) = 0 (Figure 4). This sort of
    extension is not possible for f; if we define

    sin 1/x, x ≠ 0

    a, x = 0,

    F(x) = |

    then F will not be continuous at 0, no matter what a is, because lim f(x) does

    x→0

    not exist.

    The function
    x, x rational

    f(x) = 0, x irrational

    is not continuous at a, if a ≠ 0, since lim f(x) does not exist. However, lim f(x) =
    x→a

    x→0 = f(0), so f is continuous at precisely one point, 0.

    We now use continuity of g to estimate how close x must be to a in order for the
    inequality |g(x) — g(a)| < 6' to hold. The number 6' is a positive number just like
    any other positive number; we can therefore take 6' as the ε in the definition of

    We have already noted that f is continuous at 0. A few applications of Theorems
    and 2, together with the continuity of sin, show that f is also continuous at a, for
    a #0. Functions like f(x) = sin(x? + sin(x + sin*(x3))) should be equally easy
    for you to analyze.

    The few theorems of this chapter have all been related to continuity of functions
    at a single point, but the concept of continuity doesn't begin to be really interesting
    until we focus our attention on functions which are continuous at all points of some
    interval. If f is continuous at x for all x in (a,b), then f is called continuous
    on (a,b); as a "special case", f is continuous on R = (—∞, ∞) [see page 57] if
    it is continuous at x for all x in R. Continuity on a closed interval must be defined
    a little differently; a function f is called continuous on [a, b] if

    (1) f is continuous at x for all x in (a, D),

    (2) lim f(x) = f(a) and lim f(x) = f(b).

    6. Continuous Functions 119

    shows that this description is a little too optimistic, but it is nevertheless true that
    there are many important results involving functions which are continuous on an
    interval. There theorems are generally much harder than the ones in this chapter,
    but there is a simple theorem which forms a bridge between the two kinds of results.
    The hypothesis of this theorem requires continuity at only a single point, but the
    conclusion describes the behavior of the function on some interval containing the
    point. Although this theorem is really a lemma for later arguments, it is included
    here as a preview of things to come.

    Suppose f is continuous at a, and f(a) > 0. Then f(x) > O for all x in some
    interval containing a; more precisely, there is a number 6 > O such that f(x) > O
    for all x satisfying |x —a| < 6. Similarly, if f(a) < 0, then there is a number 6 > 0
    such that f(x) < 0 for all x satisfying |x —a| < 6.

    if |x —a| < 6, then —5 f(a) < f(x) — f(a) < 3 f(a),

    and this implies that f(x) > 5 f (a) > Q. (We could even have picked € to be f(a)
    itself, leading to a proof that is more elegant, but more confusing to picture.)

Use the definition of continuity at a point: For every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that |x - 0| < δ implies |f(x) - f(0)| < ε.\n2. Since f(0) = 0, this reduces to showing that |f(x)| < ε for all x with |x| < δ.\n3. Use the given inequality |f(x)| < |x| to relate |x| and ε.\n4.

Consider how the absolute value of such a function might behave.\n3. Use the fact that the set of discontinuities of |f| is a subset of the discontinuities of f.\n4. Show that even though f has discontinuities everywhere, |f| can be continuous everywhere by choosing appropriate function behavior.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your function must be defined in a way that satisfies the given conditions, and your explanation must clearly connect the properties of f and |f| to the definitions of continuity and discontinuity.'

    Suppose f has a removable discontinuity at a. Let g(x) = f(x) for x ≠ a, and let g(a) = lim f(x). Prove that g is continuous at a. (Don't work very hard; this is quite easy.)

    Let f(x) = 0 if x is irrational, and let f(p/q) = 1/q if p/q is in lowest terms. What is the function g defined by g(x) = lim f(y)?

    Let f be a function with the property that every point of discontinuity is a removable discontinuity. This means that lim f(y) exists for all x, but f may be discontinuous at some (even infinitely many) numbers x. Define g(x) = lim f(y). Prove that g is continuous.

    Is there a function f which is discontinuous at every point, and which has only removable discontinuities?

    THREE HARD THEOREMS

    This chapter is devoted to three theorems about continuous functions, and some of their consequences. The proofs of the three theorems themselves will not be given until the next chapter, for reasons which are explained at the end of this chapter.

    If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < 0 < f(b), then there is some x in [a, b] such that f(x) = 0.

    (Geometrically, this means that the graph of a continuous function which starts below the horizontal axis and ends above it must cross this axis at some point, as in Figure 1.)

Does this function have a removable discontinuity at x = 0?\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Analyze the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 for both functions.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Proof of Continuity After Removing Discontinuities**\n\nSuppose f has a removable discontinuity at a point a. Define a new function g(x) as follows: g(x) = f(x) for x ≠ a, and g(a) = lim f(x) as x approaches a.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Prove that g is continuous at a.\n- **Part B**: Explain why this proof is straightforward, and how the concept of a removable discontinuity ensures the continuity of g at a.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must follow the logical steps outlined in the text, and you must explicitly reference the definition of continuity and the concept of a removable discontinuity.'

    If f is continuous on [a, b], then f is bounded above on [a, b], that is, there is
    some number M such that f(x) ≤ M for all x in [a, b].

    (Geometrically, this theorem means that the graph of f lies below some line par-
    allel to the horizontal axis, as in Figure 2.)

    If f is continuous on [a,b], then there is some number y in [a,b] such that

    f(y) = f(x) for all x in [a, b] (Figure 3).

    These three theorems differ markedly from the theorems of Chapter 6. The
    hypotheses of those theorems always involved continuity at a single point, while

    THEOREM 4

    7. Three Hard Theorems 123

    the hypotheses of the present theorems require continuity on a whole interval
    (a, b).—if continuity fails to hold at a single point, the conclusions may fail. For
    example, let f be the function shown in Figure 4,

    —], 0 < x < √2

    f(x) =
    1, √2 < x < 2.

    Then f is continuous at every point of [0,2] except √2, and f(0) < 0 < f(2),

    but there is no point x in [0, 2] such that f(x) = 0; the discontinuity at the single

    point √2 is sufficient to destroy the conclusion of Theorem 1.

    Similarly, suppose that f is the function shown in Figure 5,

    _ | 1/√x, x ≠ 0
    f(x) = |
    | 0, x = 0.

    Then f is continuous at every point of [0, 1] except 0, but f is not bounded above
    on [0, 1]. In fact, for any number N > 0 we have f(1/(2N)) = 2N > N.

    This example also shows that the closed interval [a, b] in Theorem 2 cannot be
    replaced by the open interval (a, b), for the function f is continuous on (0, 1), but
    is not bounded there.

    The text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding the Implications of Discontinuity on Theorems**\n\nConsider the function f defined as follows: \n\n$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{x} & \text{if } 0 < x < 1 \\ 0 & \text{if } x = 1 \end{cases} $$\n\n**Part A**: Explain why this function is not bounded above on the interval (0, 1).

    Finally, consider the function shown in Figure 6,

    2

    4p xe, x<l
    foy=]e x >I.

    On the interval [0,1] the function f is bounded above, so f does satisfy the
    conclusion of 'Theorem 2, even though f is not continuous on [0,1]. But f
    does not satisfy the conclusion of Theorem 3—there is no y in [O, 1] such that
    f(y) = f(x) for all x in [0, 1]; in fact, it is certainly not true that f(1) > f(x) for
    all x in [0, 1] so we cannot choose y = 1, nor can we choose 0 < y < I because
    f(y) < f(x) if x is any number with y < x < I.

    This example shows that Theorem 3 is considerably stronger than Theorem 2.
    Theorem 3 is often paraphrased by saying that a continuous function on a closed
    interval "takes on its maximum value" on that interval.

    As a compensation for the stringency of the hypotheses of our three theorems,
    the conclusions are of a totally different order than those of previous theorems.
    They describe the behavior of a function, not just near a point, but on a whole in-
    terval; such "global" properties of a function are always significantly more difficult

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding the Difference Between Theorems 2 and 3**\n\nThe text describes a function f(x) defined on [0,1] with f(x) = 4p xe, x < 1 and f(x) = e x > 1. Despite being discontinuous on [0,1], the function satisfies the conclusion of Theorem 2. However, it does not satisfy the conclusion of Theorem 3.\n\n**Question**: Why is the function f(x) described in the text satisfying the conclusion of Theorem 2 but not Theorem 3? Explain the logical implications of this difference in the theorems'' conclusions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the specific definition of Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 as presented in the text, and clarify why the function''s discontinuity does not affect the conclusion of Theorem 2 but does affect Theorem 3.'

If g(a) = 5 and g(b) = 3, and g(x) = 2 for some x in (a,b), what is the maximum value of g(x) on [a,b]?

    Let $ g = f - c $. Then $ g $ is continuous, and $ g(a) < 0 < g(b) $. By Theorem 1, there is some $ x $ in $[a,b]$ such that $ g(x) = 0 $. But this means that $ f(x) = c $.

    If $ f $ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $ f(a) > c > f(b) $, then there is some $ x $ in $[a, b]$ such that $ f(x) = c $.

    The function $ -f $ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $ -f(a) < -c < -f(b) $. By Theorem 4 there is some $ x $ in $[a,b]$ such that $ -f(x) = -c $, which means that $ f(x) = c $.

    Theorems 4 and 5 together show that $ f $ takes on any value between $ f(a) $ and $ f(b) $. We can do even better than this: if $ c $ and $ d $ are in $[a,b]$, then $ f $ takes on any value between $ f(c) $ and $ f(d) $. The proof is simple: if, for example, $ c < d $, then just apply Theorems 4 and 5 to the interval $[c,d]$. Summarizing, if a continuous function on an interval takes on two values, it takes on every value in between; this slight generalization of Theorem 1 is often called the Intermediate Value Theorem.

    If $ f $ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then $ f $ is bounded below on $[a, b]$, that is, there is some number $ N $ such that $ f(x) > N $ for all $ x $ in $[a, b]$.

    The function $ -f $ is continuous on $[a, b]$, so by Theorem 2 there is a number $ M $ such that $ -f(x) < M $ for all $ x $ in $[a,b]$. But this means that $ f(x) > -M $ for all $ x $ in $[a,b]$, so we can let $ N = -M $.

    Theorems 2 and 6 together show that a continuous function f on [a, b] is
    bounded on [a, b], that is, there is a number N such that | f(x)| < N for all x in

    f(x) < N, for all x in [a,b], and Theorem 6 ensures the existence of a number

    7. Three Hard Theorems 125

    Consider the function f(x) = x*, which is certainly continuous. Notice that the
    statement of the theorem can be expressed in terms of f: "the number @ has a
    square root" means that f takes on the value a. The proof of this fact about f
    will be an easy consequence of Theorem 4.

    There is obviously a number b > O such that f(b) > a (as illustrated in Figure 7);
    in fact, if a > 1 we can take b = a, while if a < 1 we can take b = 1. Since
    f() <a < f(b), Theorem 4 applied to [0, b] implies that for some x (in [0, d]),

    we have f(x) =a, ie, x*=a.§

    Precisely the same argument can be used to prove that a positive number has
    an nth root, for any natural number n. If n happens to be odd, one can do
    better: every number has an nth root. ‘To prove this we just note that if the positive
    number a has the nth root x, 1.e., if x" =a, then (—x)" = —a (since n 1s odd), so
    —a has the nth root —x. The assertion, that for odd n any number a@ has an nth
    root, is equivalent to the statement that the equation

    x"-—-a=0

    has a root if n is odd. Expressed in this way the result is susceptible of great
    generalization.

    If n is odd, then any equation

    has a root.

    We obviously want to consider the function

    we would like to prove that f is sometimes positive and sometimes negative. The
    intuitive idea is that for large |x|, the function is very much like g(x) = x" and,
    since n is odd, this function is positive for large positive x and negative for large
    negative x. A little algebra is all we need to make this intuitive idea work.

    According to ‘Theorem 10 there is a number y such that f(y) < f(x) for all x.
    Let m = f(y). If c < m, then the equation (*) obviously has no solution, since
    the left side always has a value > m. If c = m, then (*) has y as a solution.
    Finally, suppose c > m. Let b be a number such that b > y and f(b) > c. Then

    These consequences of Theorems 1, 2, and 3 are the only ones we will derive
    now (these theorems will play a fundamental role in everything we do later, how-
    ever). Only one task remains—to prove Theorems 1, 2, and 3. Unfortunately,
    we cannot hope to do this—on the basis of our present knowledge about the real
    numbers (namely, P1–P12) a proof is impossible. There are several ways of con-
    vincing ourselves that this gloomy conclusion is actually the case. For example,
    the proof of Theorem 8 relies only on the proof of Theorem 1; if we could prove
    Theorem 1, then the proof of Theorem 8 would be complete, and we would have
    a proof that every positive number has a square root. As pointed out in Part I, it
    is impossible to prove this on the basis of P1–P12. Again, suppose we consider the
    function

    f(x) =

    {
    x² - 2
    if x ≠ √2,
    0
    if x = √2.

    If there were no number x with x² = 2, then f would be continuous, since the
    denominator would never = 0. But f is not bounded on [0, 2]. So Theorem 2
    depends essentially on the existence of numbers other than rational numbers, and
    therefore on some property of the real numbers other than P1–P12.

    Despite our inability to prove Theorems 1, 2, and 3, they are certainly results
    which we want to be true. If the pictures we have been drawing have any con-
    nection with the mathematics we are doing, if our notion of continuous function
    corresponds to any degree with our intuitive notion, Theorems 1, 2, and 3 have
    got to be true. Since a proof of any of these theorems must require some new
    property of R which has so far been overlooked, our present difficulties suggest a
    way to discover that property: let us try to construct a proof of Theorem 1, for
    example, and see what goes wrong.

    One idea which seems promising is to locate the first point where f(x) = 0, that
    is, the smallest x in [a,b] such that f(x) = 0. To find this point, first consider
    the set A which contains all numbers x in [a,b] such that f is negative on [a, x].
    In Figure 11, x is such a point, while x' is not. The set A itself is indicated by a
    heavy line. Since f is negative at a, and positive at b, the set A contains some
    points greater than a, while all points sufficiently close to b are not in A. (We are
    here using the continuity of f on [a,b], as well as Problem 6-16.)

    THEOREM 11

    7. Three Hard Theorems 127

    theorem the entire point of the proof is to choose an interval [a, b] in such a way
    that this cannot happen.

    If n is even and f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + --- + a_0, then there is a number y such
    that f(y) < f(x) for all x.

    As in the proof of Theorem 9, if
    M = max(1, 2n|a_{n-1}|,..., 2n|a_0|),

    then for all x with |x| > M, we have

    A_n - a_0
    < 1474... 4,
    2 x x^n

    Since n is even, x^n > 0 for all x, so
    A_n - a_0
    < 1474... 4,
    2 x x^n

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding the Foundations of Continuity**\n\nThe text discusses the concept of a continuous function and hints at the necessity of a new property of the real numbers (R) to prove Theorem 1. Using the reasoning provided in the text, explain why the assumption of continuity alone is insufficient to prove Theorem 1 and what additional property of R is required.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the text''s discussion on the need to ''discover a new property of R'' and the role of continuity in the proof process. You must also connect this to the idea that the real numbers possess a property that allows for the existence of limits and the Intermediate Value Theorem.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Theorem 1''s Proof Strategy**\n\nThe text suggests that to prove Theorem 1, we should ''locate the first point where f(x) = 0'' and consider the set A, which contains all x in [a,b] such that f is negative on [a, x]. Explain the logical structure of this approach and why it leads to a contradiction if the function is continuous on [a,b].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include an analysis of the properties of set A, the role of continuity in defining the set, and the implications of the set not containing all points in [a,b]. You must also reference the text''s mention of ''the smallest x in [a,b] such that f(x) = 0''.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Reasoning About Polynomial Behavior**\n\nThe text presents a proof strategy for Theorem 10, which involves analyzing the behavior of polynomials for large |x|. Given that n is even and f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0, explain how the proof shows that there exists a number y such that f(y) < f(x) for all x.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the definition of M, the inequality provided in the text, and the role of the even degree of n in ensuring that x^n is positive for all x. You must also explain how this leads to the conclusion that such a y exists and why this is significant for the proof of Theorem 10.'

    provided that |x| => M. Now consider the number f(0). Let b > QO be a number such that b" > 2 (QO) and also b > M. Then, if x > b, we have (Figure 9)

    Summarizing:

    if x > b or x < —b, then f(x) > f(Q).

    Now apply Theorem 7 to the function f on the interval [—b, b]. We conclude that there is a number y such that

    (1) if -b < x < b, then f(y) < f(x).
    In particular, f(y) < f(0). Thus
    (2) if x < —b or x > b, then f(x) > f(0) > f(y).
    Combining (1) and (2) we see that f(y) < f(x) for all x. §

    Theorem 10 now allows us to prove the following result.

    Consider the equation

    (et) x" + a,_yx"| + --- + a9 = c,
    f(x) < 0 for all x in this interval

    A would also contain
    all these points

    Now suppose @ is the smallest number which is greater than all members of A;
    clearly a < a < b. We claim that f(a@) = 0, and to prove this we only have to
    eliminate the possibilities f(a) < 0 and f(a) > 0.

    Suppose first that f(a) < 0. Then, by Theorem 6-3, f(x) would be less than 0
    for all x in a small interval containing aq, in particular for some numbers bigger
    than @ (Figure 12); but this contradicts the fact that @ is bigger than every member
    of A, since the larger numbers would also be in A. Consequently, f(a) < 0 is
    false.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Application of Theorem 6-3 in a Logical Context**\n\nUsing the information provided in the text, explain why the assumption that f(a) < 0 leads to a contradiction.\n- **Step 1**: Reference Theorem 6-3 and state what it implies about f(x) near the point a.\n- **Step 2**: Describe how this implication contradicts the definition of @ as the smallest number greater than all members of A.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude that f(a) < 0 is false based on this contradiction.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must explicitly reference Theorem 6-3 and the definition of @, and demonstrate logical reasoning to show the inconsistency.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Theorem 7 and Theorem 10**\n\nThe text mentions Theorem 7 and Theorem 10 in the context of function analysis. Explain how these theorems are related and how they contribute to the proof of the main result.\n- **Step 1**: Describe what Theorem 7 states about the function f on the interval [—b, b].\n- **Step 2**: Explain how Theorem 10 is used to conclude that there is a number y such that f(y) < f(x) for all x in (-b, b).\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the combination of Theorem 7 and Theorem 10 leads to the conclusion that f(y) < f(x) for all x.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate both theorems and demonstrate how they collectively support the main conclusion about the function''s behavior.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analysis of Function Behavior in Different Intervals**\n\nThe text provides two figures (Figures 12 and 13) that describe the behavior of the function f(x) in different intervals. Analyze these figures and the surrounding text to explain the following:\n- **Part A**: How does the figure in Figure 12 illustrate the contradiction when assuming f(a) < 0?\n- **Part B**: How does the figure in Figure 13 support the conclusion that f(a) > 0 is also false?\n- **Part C**: Based on the text and figures, explain the overall significance of the proof in terms of function behavior and the role of the theorems mentioned.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate both figures and the text, and demonstrate an understanding of how the visual and textual information together support the logical conclusion.'

- prompt: |-
    On the other hand, suppose f(a) > 0. Again applying Theorem 6-3, we see that
    f(x) would be positive for all x in a small interval containing @, in particular for
    some numbers smaller than a (Figure 13). This means that these smaller numbers
    are all not in A. Consequently, one could have chosen an even smaller a which
    would be greater than all members of A. Once again we have a contradiction;
    f(a) > 0 is also false. Hence f(a) = O and, we are tempted to say, Q.E.D.

    We know, however, that something must be wrong, since no new properties of R
    were ever used, and it does not require much scrutiny to find the dubious point.
    It is clear that we can choose a number a which is greater than all members of A
    (for example, we can choose a = b), but it is not so clear that we can choose a
    smallest one. In fact, suppose A consists of all numbers x > 0 such that x* < 2.
    If the number V2 did not exist, there would not be a least number greater than
    all the members of A; for any y > /2 we chose, we could always choose a still
    smaller one.

    Now that we have discovered the fallacy, it is almost obvious what additional
    property of the real numbers we need. All we must do is say it properly and use it.
    That is the business of the next chapter.

    **LEAST UPPER BOUNDS**

    This chapter reveals the most important property of the real numbers. Nevertheless, it is merely a sequel to Chapter 7; the path which must be followed has already been indicated, and further discussion would be useless delay.

    A set $ A $ of real numbers is bounded above if there is a number $ x $ such that $ x > a $ for every $ a \in A $.

    Such a number $ x $ is called an upper bound for $ A $.

    Obviously $ A $ is bounded above if and only if there is a number $ x $ which is an upper bound for $ A $ (and in this case there will be lots of upper bounds for $ A $); we often say, as a concession to idiomatic English, that "$ A $ has an upper bound" when we mean that there is a number which is an upper bound for $ A $.

    Notice that the term "bounded above" has now been used in two ways—first, in Chapter 7, in reference to functions, and now in reference to sets. This dual usage should cause no confusion, since it will always be clear whether we are talking about a set of numbers or a function. Moreover, the two definitions are closely connected: if $ A $ is the set $ \{f(x) : a < x < b\} $, then the function $ f $ is bounded above on $ [a, b] $ if and only if the set $ A $ is bounded above.

    The entire collection $ \mathbb{R} $ of real numbers, and the natural numbers $ \mathbb{N} $, are both examples of sets which are not bounded above. An example of a set which is bounded above is

    $$ A = \{x : 0 < x < 1\} $$

Hint: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem and the properties of continuous functions on closed intervals.'

- prompt: |-
    To show that A is bounded above we need only name some upper bound for A,
    which is easy enough; for example, 138 is an upper bound for A, and so are 2,
    15, li, and 1. Clearly, 1 is the least upper bound of A; although the phrase
    just introduced is self-explanatory, in order to avoid any possible confusion (in
    particular, to ensure that we all know what the superlative of "less" means), we
    define this explicitly.

    A number x is a least upper bound of A if

    (1) x is an upper bound of A,
    and (2) if y is an upper bound of A, then x < y.

    133

    134 Foundations

    The use of the indefinite article "a" in this definition was merely a concession
    to temporary ignorance. Now that we have made a precise definition, it is easily
    seen that if x and y are both least upper bounds of A, then x = y. Indeed, in this
    case

    x < y, since y is an upper bound, and x is a least upper bound,

    and y < x, since x is an upper bound, and y is a least upper bound;

    it follows that x = y. For this reason we speak of the least upper bound of A.
    The term supremum of A is synonymous and has one advantage. It abbreviates
    quite nicely to

    sup A (pronounced "soup A")

    and saves us from the abbreviation

    lub A

    (which is nevertheless used by some authors).

    There is a series of important definitions, analogous to those just given, which
    can now be treated more briefly. A set A of real numbers is bounded below if
    there is a number x such that

    x < a for every a in A.

    Such a number x is called a lower bound for A. A number x is the greatest
    lower bound of A if

    (1) x is a lower bound of A,
    and (2) if y is a lower bound of A, then x > y.

    The greatest lower bound of A is also called the infimum of A, abbreviated
    inf A;
    some authors use the abbreviation
    glb A.

    Property P13 may strike you as anticlimactic, but that is actually one of its
    virtues. [o complete our list of basic properties for the real numbers we require no
    particularly abstruse proposition, but only a property so simple that we might feel
    foolish for having overlooked it. Of course, the least upper bound property is not
    really so innocent as all that; after all, it does not hold for the rational numbers Q.
    For example, if A is the set of all rational numbers x satisfying x" < 2, then there
    is no rational number y which is an upper bound for A and which 1s less than or
    equal to every other rational number which is an upper bound for A. It will become
    clear only gradually how significant P13 is, but we are already in a position to
    demonstrate its power, by supplying the proofs which were omitted in Chapter 7.

    If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < O < f(b), then there is some number x
    in [a, b] such that f(x) = 0

    Our proof is merely a rigorous version of the outline developed at the end of
    Chapter 7—we will locate the smallest number x in [a, b] with f(x) = O
    Define the set A, shown in Figure 1, as follows:

    = { x -a <x <b, and f 1s negative on the interval [a, x]}.

    Clearly A 4 Y, since a 1s in A; in fact, there is some 6 > O such that A contains
    all points x satisfying a < x < a+; this follows from Problem 6-16, since f is
    continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < 0. Similarly, b is an upper bound for A and, in
    fact, there is a 5 > O such that all points x satisfying b— 6 < x < b are upper
    bounds for A; this also follows from Problem 6-16, since f(b) > 0.

    From these remarks it follows that A has a least upper bound q@ and that
    a <a < b. We now wish to show that f(a) = 0, by eliminating the possibil-
    ities f(a) < Oand f(a) > 0.

    Suppose first that f(a) < 0. By Theorem 6-3, there is a δ > 0 such that
    f(x) < 0 for a − δ < x < a + δ (Figure 2). Now there is some number x₀ in A
    which satisfies a − δ < x₀ < a + δ (because otherwise a + δ would not be the least upper
    bound of A). This means that f is negative on the whole interval [a, x₀]. But if
    x₀ is a number between a and a + δ, then f is also negative on the whole interval
    [x₀, x₁]. Therefore f is negative on the interval [a, x], so x₀ is in A. But this
    contradicts the fact that a is an upper bound for A; our original assumption that
    f(a) < 0 must be false.

    Suppose, on the other hand, that f(a) > 0. Then there is a number δ > 0 such
    that f(x) > 0 for a − δ < x < a + δ (Figure 3). Once again we know that there is
    an x₀ in A satisfying a − δ < x₀ < a + δ; but this means that f is negative on [a, x₀].
    This is impossible, since f(x₀) > 0. Thus the assumption f(a) > 0 also leads to
    a contradiction, leaving f(a) = 0 as the only possible alternative. ✅

    The proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 of Chapter 7 require a simple preliminary
    result, which will play much the same role as "Theorem 6-3 played in the previous
    proof.

    If f is continuous at a, then there is a number δ > 0 such that f is bounded
    above on the interval (a − δ, a + δ) (see Figure 4).

    Since lim f(x) = f(a), there is, for every ε > 0, a δ > 0 such that, for all x,

    if |x − a| < δ, then |f(x) − f(a)| < ε.

    It is only necessary to apply this statement to some particular € (any one will do),
    for example, ¢ = 1. We conclude that there is a 6 > O such that, for all x,

    It follows, in particular, that if |x —a| < 6, then f(x) — f(a) < 1. This completes
    the proof: on the interval (a — 6,a + 5) the function f is bounded above by

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding the Role of Least Upper Bounds in Continuity**\n\nThe text discusses the concept of least upper bounds (suprema) in the context of continuity. Using the provided proof outline, explain how the existence of a least upper bound for the set A = {x : a <x < b and f is bounded above on [a, x]} is crucial in proving that f is bounded on [a, b].\n\n- **Step 1**: Define the set A and explain why it is non-empty and bounded above.\n- **Step 2**: Reference the least upper bound property of real numbers and explain how it leads to the conclusion that f is bounded above on [a, b].\n- **Step 3**: Relate this to the earlier discussion about boundedness on intervals (e.g., (a — 6, a + 6)) and how it supports the overall proof of continuity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the least upper bound to the boundedness of f on [a, b] and demonstrate an understanding of how this concept is foundational to the proof.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing the Implications of Continuity and Boundedness**\n\nThe text mentions that if lim f(x) = f(a), then there exists a 6 > 0 such that f is bounded on (a — 6, a + 6). Use this information to address the following:\n\n- **Part A**: Explain why the boundedness of f on (a — 6, a + 6) is a necessary condition for the continuity of f at a.\n- **Part B**: Consider a function f that is continuous on [a, b] and bounded on [a, b]. How does the boundedness on [a, b] relate to the boundedness on smaller intervals like (a — 6, a + 6)?\n- **Part C**: Discuss the relationship between the boundedness of f on [a, b] and the existence of a least upper bound for the set {f(x) : a < x < b}.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of continuity, boundedness, and least upper bounds as presented in the text, with clear logical connections between them.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Continuity and Boundedness**\n\nThe text proves that if f is continuous on [a, b], then f is bounded on [a, b]. Use the information provided to address the following:\n\n- **Part A**: Construct a proof by contradiction to show that if f is not bounded above on [a, b], then there must be a contradiction with the least upper bound property.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the boundedness of f on [a, b] ensures that the set {f(x) : a < x < b} has a least upper bound, and how this relates to the continuity of f at the endpoints a and b.\n- **Part C**: Consider a function f that is continuous on [a, b], but not bounded above on [a, b]. How does this contradict the theorem stated in the text, and what is the logical flaw in such an assumption?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the interplay between continuity, boundedness, and the least upper bound property, as outlined in the text.'

    Our first step is to prove that we actually have a = b. Suppose, instead, that
    a <b. By Theorem | there 1s 6 > O such that f is bounded on (w—6,a@+6). Since
    a is the least upper bound of A there is some xo in A satisfying a—5 < x9 <a. This
    means that f 1s bounded on [a, xo]. But if x; 1s any number witha < x1 <a+6,
    then f is also bounded on [xo, x1]. Therefore f 1s bounded on [a, x1], so x1 is
    in A, contradicting the fact that a is an upper bound for A. This contradiction
    shows that a = b. One detail should be mentioned: this demonstration implicitly
    assumed that a < @ [so that f would be defined on some interval (@ — 6,a@ + 4)];
    the possibility a = @ can be ruled out similarly, using the existence of a 6 > 0 such
    that f is bounded on {x :a <x <a+t+6}.

    The proof is not quite complete—we only know that f is bounded on [a, x] for
    every x < b, not necessarily that f is bounded on [a, b]. However, only one small
    argument needs to be added.

    There is a 6 > O such that f is bounded on {x : b—6 < x < b}. There is xg
    in A such that b — 5 < xg < b. Thus f is bounded on |[a, xo] and also on [xo, 5],
    so f is bounded on [a,b]. J

    ‘To prove the third important theorem we resort to a trick.

    If f is continuous on [a, b], then there is a number y in [a, b] such that f(y) >

    f(x) for all x in [a, b].

    We already know that f is bounded on [a, b], which means that the set

    { f(x) ix in [a, b}}

    So every number x is between two integers n, n + | (unless x is itself an integer)
    Basing the argument on a geometric picture is not a proof, however, and even the
    geometric picture contains an assumption: that if you place unit segments end-to-
    end you will eventually get a segment larger than any given segment. This axiom,
    often omitted from a first introduction to geometry, is usually attributed (not quite
    justly) to Archimedes, and the corresponding property for numbers, that N is not
    bounded, is called the Archimedean property of the real numbers. 'This property is not
    a consequence of PI—P12 (see reference [14] of the Suggested Reading), although
    it does hold for Q, of course. Once we have P13 however, there are no longer
    any problems.

    N is not bounded above.

    Suppose N were bounded above. Since N ⊆ ℝ, there would be a least upper
    bound α for N. Then

    α > n for all n ∈ N.

    Consequently,

    α > n + 1 for all n ∈ N,
    since n + 1 is in N if 1 is in N. But this means that
    α − 1 > n for all n ∈ N,

    and this means that α − 1 is also an upper bound for N, contradicting the fact that
    α is the least upper bound. J

    THEOREM 3

    PROOF

    8. Least Upper Bounds 139

    There is a consequence of Theorem 2 (actually an equivalent formulation) which
    we have very often assumed implicitly.

    For any ε > 0 there is a natural number n with |1/n| < ε.

    Suppose not; then |1/n| > ε for all n in N. Thus 1/ε < n for all n in N. But this
    means that 1/ε is an upper bound for N, contradicting Theorem 2. J

    Suppose that $ f $ is a function such that $ f(a) < f(b) $ whenever $ a < b $ (Figure 6).

    (a) Prove that $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) $ and $ \lim_{x \to b} f(x) $ both exist. Hint: Why is this problem in this chapter?

    (b) Prove that $ f $ never has a removable discontinuity (this terminology comes from Problem 6-17).

    (c) Prove that if $ f $ satisfies the conclusions of the Intermediate Value Theorem, then $ f $ is continuous.

    If $ f $ is a bounded function on $ [0, 1] $, let $ \|f\| = \sup\{ | f(x)| : x \in [0, 1] \} $.
    Prove analogues of the properties of $ \|f\| $ in Problem 7-14.

    Suppose $ a > 0 $. Prove that every number $ x $ can be written uniquely in the form $ x = ka + x' $, where $ k $ is an integer, and $ 0 < x' < a $.

    (a) Suppose that $ a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots $ is a sequence of positive numbers with $ a_{n+1} < \frac{a_n}{2} $. Prove that for any $ \varepsilon > 0 $ there is some $ n $ with $ a_n < \varepsilon $.

    (b) Suppose $ P $ is a regular polygon inscribed inside a circle. If $ P' $ is the inscribed regular polygon with twice as many sides, show that the difference between the area of the circle and the area of $ P' $ is less than half the difference between the area of the circle and the area of $ P $ (use Figure 7).

    (c) Prove that there is a regular polygon $ P $ inscribed in a circle with area as close as desired to the area of the circle. In order to do part (c) you will need part (a). This was clear to the Greeks, who used part (a) as the basis for their entire treatment of proportion and area. By calculating the areas of polygons, this method ("the method of exhaustion") allows computations of $ \pi $ to any desired accuracy; Archimedes used it to show that $ \frac{22}{7} < \pi < \frac{22}{7} $. But it has far greater theoretical importance:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Proof of Area Ratio Equivalence for Circles**\n\nProve that the areas of two circles have the same ratio as the square of their radii.\n\n**Instructions**:\n- Begin by considering the ratio of areas of two circles with radii r and R.\n- Use the given hint: Deduce a contradiction from the assumption that the ratio of areas is greater, or less, than the ratio of the square of the radii.\n- Apply the method of inscribing polygons to approximate the areas and use the properties of ratios.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must follow the logical structure outlined in the text and explicitly reference the method of inscribing polygons as described.\n\n**Answer**:\nAssume that the ratio of the areas of two circles is not equal to the square of the ratio of their radii. By inscribing regular polygons with an increasing number of sides, we can approximate the areas of the circles. As the number of sides increases, the area of the inscribed polygon approaches the area of the circle. Using the property that the ratio of areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear measures, we can show that the ratio of the areas must equal the square of the ratio of the radii, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the areas of two circles have the same ratio as the square of their radii.'

Therefore, sup A < y for all y in B.\n(b) The infimum of B is the greatest lower bound of B. Since sup A is less than every y in B, it follows that sup A is less than the infimum of B.

Prove that there is a point x which is in every I_n.\n\n(b) Show that this conclusion is false if we consider open intervals instead of closed intervals.\n\n**Instructions**:\n- For part (a), use the concept of nested intervals and the properties of closed intervals.\n- For part (b), consider the implications of open intervals not including their endpoints.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proofs must demonstrate a clear understanding of the Nested Interval Theorem and the difference between closed and open intervals.\n\n**Answer**:\n(a) By the Nested Interval Theorem, since the intervals are closed and nested, there exists a point x that is common to all intervals. This is because the intersection of all intervals is non-empty due to the properties of closed intervals and the decreasing nature of the sequence.\n(b) If the intervals are open, then the intersection may be empty. For example, consider intervals (0, 1), (0.5, 0.75), (0.6, 0.65), etc. The intersection of these open intervals is empty because there is no point that belongs to all of them. Hence, the conclusion fails for open intervals.'

The rationale for this terminology is indicated in Figure 9; the parallel lines are the rays of the sun rising in the east (you are facing north).

But δ also depends on a—the δ that works at a might  \nnot work at b (Figure 1). Indeed, it's clear that given ε > 0 there is no one δ > 0  \nthat works for all a, or even for all positive a. In fact, the number a + δ/2 will  \ncertainly satisfy |x — a| < δ, but if a > 0, then  \n\n(a + δ)² = a² + 2aδ + δ²  \n|f(a + δ) — a²| = |(a + δ)² — a²| = |2aδ + δ²|  \n\nand this won't be < ε once a > ε/(2δ).

    We've seen that a function can be continuous on the whole line, or on an open
    interval, without being uniformly continuous there. On the other hand, the func-
    tion f(x) = x² did turn out to be uniformly continuous on any closed interval.
    This shouldn't be too surprising—it's the same sort of thing that occurs when we
    ask whether a function is bounded on an interval —and we would be led to suspect
    that any continuous function on a closed interval is also uniformly continuous on
    that interval. In order to prove this, we'll need to deal first with one subtle point.

    Suppose that we have two intervals [a,b] and [b,c] with the common end-
    point b, and a function f that is continuous on [a,c]. Let ε > 0 and suppose that
    the following two statements hold:

    (1) if x and y are in [a, b] and |x — y| < δ1, then | f(x) — f(y)| < ε,
    (2) if x and y are in [b,c] and |x — y| < δ2, then | f(x) — f(y)| < ε.

    We'd like to know if there is some δ > 0 such that | f(x) — f(y)| < ε whenever
    x and y are points in [a,c] with |x — y| < δ. Our first inclination might be to
    choose δ as the minimum of δ1 and δ2. But it is easy to see what goes wrong
    (Figure 2): we might have x in [a,b] and y in [b,c], and then neither (1) nor (2)
    tells us anything about | f(x) — f(y)|. So we have to be a little more careful, and
    also use continuity of f at b.

    Let a < b < c and let f be continuous on the interval [a,c]. Let ε > 0, and
    suppose that statements (1) and (2) hold. Then there is a δ > 0 such that,

    if x and y are in [a,c] and |x — y| < 6, then | f(x) — f(y)| < «.

    Since f is continuous at b, there is a 63 > O such that,

    if |x — b| < 43, then | f(x) — f(b)| < =

    Choose 6 to be the minimum of 6;, 59, and 63. We claim that this 6 works. In
    fact, suppose that x and y are any two points in [a,c] with |x — y| < 6. If x and y
    are both in [a, b], then | f(x) — f(y)| < & by (i); and if x and y are both in [b, c],

    x<b<y or y<b<x.

    If f 1s continuous on [a, b], then f 1s uniformly continuous on [a, bd].

    that, for all y and z in [a, D],

    if |y —z| < 4, then | f(y) — f(z) <e.

    upper bound a@. We really should write a@,, since A and a might depend on e. But
    we won't since we intend to prove that a = b, no matter what é is.

    146 Foundations

    Suppose that we had a < b. Since f is continuous at a, there is some dg > O
    such that, f |y —a@| < do, then | f(y) — f(@)| < e/2. Consequently, if |y —a@| < do
    and |z — a| < dg, then | f(y) — f(z)| < €. So f is surely €-good on the interval
    [a — d9.a@ + do]. On the other hand, since @ is the least upper bound of A, it
    is also clear that f 1s €-good on [a,a@ — do]. Then the Lemma implies that f 1s
    e-good on [a,a + d9], so a + dg Is in A, contradicting the fact that a@ is an upper
    bound.

    To complete the proof we just have to show that a = bis actually in A. The
    argument for this 1s practically the same: Since f is continuous at b, there is some
    dg > O such that, if b — d9 < y < D, then | f(y) — f(b)| < €/2. So f is e-good on
    [b — dg, b]. But f is also e-good on [a, b — do], so the Lemma implies that f 1s
    e-good on [a, b]. fj

    "tangent line," although we are suggesting that the graph might be "bent" at a
    point where a "tangent line" cannot be drawn. You have probably already noticed
    that a tangent line cannot be defined as a line which intersects the graph only
    once—such a definition would be both too restrictive and too permissive. With
    such a definition, the straight line shown in Figure 3 would not be a tangent line
    to the graph in that picture, while the parabola would have two tangent lines at
    each point (Figure 4), and the three functions in Figure 5 would have more than
    one tangent line at the points where they are "bent."

    (a) (b) (c)

    FIGURE 5

    A more promising approach to the definition of a tangent line might start with
    "secant lines," and use the notion of limits. If h → 0, then the two distinct points
    (a, f(a)) and (a +h, f(a +h)) determine, as in Figure 6, a straight line whose
    slope is

    [f(a +h) — f(a)] / h

    (a+h, f(a+h))

    (a, f(a))

    FIGURE 6

    As Figure 7 illustrates, the "tangent line" at (a, f(a)) seems to be the limit, in
    some sense, of these "secant lines" as h approaches 0. We have never before
    talked about a "limit" of lines, but we can talk about the limit of their slopes: the
    slope of the tangent line through (a, f(a)) should be

    lim [f(a +h) — f(a)] / h

    h→0

    We are ready for a definition, and some comments.

    The function f is differentiable at a if

    lim [f(a +h) — f(a)] / h

    h→0

    exists.

    In this case the limit is denoted by f'(a) and is called the derivative of f at
    a. (We also say that f is differentiable if f is differentiable at a for every a
    in the domain of f.)

- prompt: |-
    The first comment on our definition is really an addendum; we define the tangent line to the graph of f at (a, f(a)) to be the line through (a, f(a)) with slope f'(a). This means that the tangent line at (a, f(a)) is defined only if f is differentiable at a.

    The second comment refers to notation. The symbol f'(a) is certainly reminiscent of functional notation. In fact, for any function f, we denote by f' the function whose domain is the set of all numbers a such that f is differentiable at a, and whose value at such a number a is

    lim [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h
    h→0

    (To be very precise: f is the collection of all pairs (a, f(a)) for which the limit
    lim [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h exists.) The function f' is called the derivative
    h→0

    of f.

    Our third comment, somewhat longer than the previous two, refers to the physical interpretation of the derivative. Consider a particle which is moving along a straight line (Figure 8(a)) on which we have chosen an "origin" point O, and a direction in which distances from O shall be written as positive numbers, the distance from O of points in the other direction being written as negative numbers.
    Let s(t) denote the distance of the particle from O, at time t. The suggestive notation s(t) has been chosen purposely; since a distance s(t) is determined for each

    It has a natural physical interpretation. It is the "average velocity" of the particle
    during the time interval from a to a +h. For any particular a, this average speed
    depends on h, of course. On the other hand, the limit

    . s(a+h) —s(a)
    lim
    h→0 h

    depends only on a (as well as the particular function s) and there are important
    physical reasons for considering this limit. We would like to speak of the "velocity
    of the particle at time a," but the usual definition of velocity is really a definition
    of average velocity; the only reasonable definition of "velocity at time a" (so-called
    "instantaneous velocity") is the limit

    . s(a+h) —s(a)
    lim
    h→0 h

    Thus we define the (instantaneous) velocity of the particle at a to be s'(a).
    Notice that s'(a) could easily be negative; the absolute value |s'(a)| is sometimes
    called the (instantaneous) speed.

    It is important to realize that instantaneous velocity is a theoretical concept,
    an abstraction which does not correspond precisely to any observable quantity.
    While it would not be fair to say that instantaneous velocity has nothing to do
    with average velocity, remember that s'(t) is not

    s(t +h) — s(t)
    h

    for any particular h, but merely the limit of these average velocities as h ap-
    proaches 0. ‘Thus, when velocities are measured in physics, what a physicist really
    measures is an average velocity over some (very small) time interval; such a pro-
    cedure cannot be expected to give an exact answer, but this is really no defect,
    because physical measurements can never be exact anyway.

    The velocity of a particle is often called the "rate of change of its position." This
    notion of the derivative, as a rate of change, applies to any other physical situation
    in which some quantity varies with time. For example, the "rate of change of
    mass" of a growing object means the derivative of the function m, where m(t) is
    the mass at time t.

    The function f(x) = x* happens to be quite special in this regard; usually a
    tangent line will intersect the graph more than once. Consider, for example, the
    function f(x) = x°. In this case

    Thus the tangent line to the graph of f at (a,a°) has slope 3a*. This means that
    the tangent line is the graph of

    g(x) = 3a*(x —a) +a?
    — 3a*x — 2a?.

    The graphs of f and g intersect at the point (x, f(x)) = (x, g(x)) when

    x? = 3a*x — 2a?
    or x°?—3a*x+2a? = 0.

    Although the meaning of these formulas is clear enough, attempts at literal interpretation are hindered by the reasonable stricture that an equation should not contain a function on one side and a number on the other. For example, if the third equation is to be true, then either df(x)/dx must denote f'(x), rather than f', or else 2x must denote, not a number, but the function whose value at x is 2x. It is really impossible to assert that one or the other of these alternatives is intended; in practice df(x)/dx sometimes means f' and sometimes means f'(x), while 2x may denote either a number or a function. Because of this ambiguity, most authors are reluctant to denote f'(a) by

    df(x)/dx;

    instead f'(a) is usually denoted by the barbaric, but unambiguous, symbol

    df(x)
    dx

    x=a

    * Leibniz was led to this symbol by his intuitive notion of the derivative, which he considered to be, not the limit of quotients [f(x + h) — f(x)]/h, but the "value" of this quotient when h is an "infinitely small" number. This "infinitely small" quantity was denoted by dx and the corresponding "infinitely small" difference f(x + dx) — f(x) by df(x). Although this point of view is impossible to reconcile with properties (P1)-(P13) of the real numbers, some people find this notion of the derivative congenial.

    156 Derivatives and Integrals

    In addition to these difficulties, Leibnizian notation is associated with one more ambiguity. Although the notation df/dx is absolutely standard, the notation df(x)/dx is often replaced by df/dx. This, of course, is in conformity with the practice of confusing a function with its value at x. So strong is this tendency that functions are often indicated by a phrase like the following: "consider the function y = x2." We will sometimes follow classical practice to the extent of using y as the name of a function, but we will nevertheless carefully distinguish between the function and its values—thus we will always say something like "consider the function y = x2" rather than "consider the value y = x2."

    Despite the many ambiguities of Leibnizian notation, it is used almost exclusively in older mathematical writing, and is still used very frequently today. The staunchest opponents of Leibnizian notation admit that it will be around for quite some time, while its most ardent admirers would say that it will be around for-ever, and a good thing too! In any case, Leibnizian notation cannot be ignored completely.

    The policy adopted in this book is to disallow Leibnizian notation within the text, but to include it in the Problems; several chapters contain a few (immediately recognizable) problems which are expressly designed to illustrate the vagaries of Leibnizian notation. 'Trusting that these problems will provide ample practice in this notation, we return to our basic task of examining some simple examples of derivatives.

    The few functions examined so far have all been differentiable. 'To fully appreciate the significance of the derivative it is equally important to know some examples of functions which are not differentiable. 'The obvious candidates are the three functions first discussed in this chapter, and illustrated in Figure 1; if they turn out to be differentiable at 0 something has clearly gone wrong.

    Consider first f(x) = |x|. In this case

    f(0+h) - f(0) = |h|
    h h

    Now |h|/h = 1 for h > 0, and |h|/h = -1 for h < 0. This shows that

    lim [f(h) - f(0)] / h
    h→0

    does not exist.

    In fact,

    lim [f(h) - f(0)] / h = lim |h| / h
    h→0+ h→0+

    and lim [f(h) - f(0)] / h = lim |h| / h
    h→0- h→0-

    (These two limits are sometimes called the right-hand derivative and the left-hand derivative, respectively, of f at 0.)

    $$
    f_i(x) = 1 \text{ if } x > 0,
    $$
    $$
    f_i(x) = -1 \text{ if } x < 0.
    $$

    The proof of this fact is left to you (it is easy if you remember the derivative of a
    linear function). The graphs of $ f $ and of $ f' $ are shown in Figure 11.
    For the function
    $$
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } x > 0, \\
    -1 & \text{if } x < 0.
    \end{cases}
    $$
    a similar difficulty arises in connection with $ f'(0) $. We have

    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{1}{h} \text{ if } h > 0,
    $$
    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{-1}{h} \text{ if } h < 0.
    $$

    Therefore,
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = 1,
    $$
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = -1.
    $$

    Thus $ f'(0) $ does not exist; $ f $ is not differentiable at 0. Once again, however, $ f'(x) $
    exists for $ x \neq 0 $. It is easy to see that

    $$
    f'(x) = \begin{cases}
    2 & \text{if } x > 0, \\
    -2 & \text{if } x < 0.
    \end{cases}
    $$

    The graphs of $ f $ and $ f' $ are shown in Figure 12.
    Even worse things happen for $ f(x) = \sqrt{|x|} $. For this function

    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{|h|}}{h} \text{ if } h > 0,
    $$
    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{|h|}}{h} \text{ if } h < 0.
    $$

    In this case the right-hand limit

    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h}
    $$

    does not exist; instead $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} $ becomes arbitrarily large as $ h $ approaches 0. And,
    what's more, $ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{-h}} $ becomes arbitrarily large in absolute value, but negative

    (Figure 13).
    $$
    \boxed{158} \text{ Derivatives and Integrals}
    $$

    $$
    \frac{d}{dx} \left( x \right) = 1.
    $$

    The function $ f(x) = x $, although not differentiable at 0, is at least a little
    better behaved than this. The quotient

    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h}
    $$

    simply becomes arbitrarily large as $ h $ goes to 0. Sometimes one says that $ f $ has no derivative at 0, but it does have a derivative everywhere else.

    An "infinite" derivative at 0. Geometrically this means that the graph of f has a
    "tangent line" which is parallel to the vertical axis (Figure 14). Of course, f(x) =

    — s/x has the same geometric property, but one would say that f has a derivative
    of "negative infinity" at 0.

    Remember that differentiability is supposed to be an improvement over mere
    continuity. This idea is supported by the many examples of functions which are
    continuous, but not differentiable; however, one important point remains to be
    noted:

    If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.

    f(a + h) — f(a)

    lim f(a + h) — f(a) = lim (f(a + h) — f(a)) / h
    h—0 h h—0
    = f'(a) - 0

    As we pointed out in Chapter 5, the equation lim f(a + h) — f(a) = 0 is equivalent

    to lim f(x) = f(a); thus f is continuous at a. J
    x—7a

    It is very important to remember Theorem 1, and just as important to remember
    that the converse is not true. A differentiable function is continuous, but a con-
    tinuous function need not be differentiable (keep in mind the function f(x) = |x|,
    and you will never forget which statement is true and which false).

    The continuous functions examined so far have been differentiable at all points
    with at most one exception, but it is easy to give examples of continuous functions
    which are not differentiable at several points, even an infinite number (Figure 15).
    Actually, one can do much worse than this. There is a function which is continuous

    Although such spectacular examples of nondifferentiability must be postponed, we can, with a little ingenuity, find a continuous function which is not differentiable at infinitely many points, all of which are in [0, 1]. One such function is illustrated in Figure 17. The reader is given the problem of defining it precisely; it is a straight line version of the function

    . | 0
    f(x) = x sin —, x ≠ 0,
    Q, x = 0.

    This particular function f is itself quite sensitive to the question of differentiability: Indeed, for h ≠ 0 we have
    f(h) - f(0) = h sin —.
    h h

    Long ago we proved that lim sin (|/h) does not exist, so f is not differentiable at 0.

    h—0

    Geometrically, one can see that a tangent line cannot exist, by noting that the secant line through (0,0) and (h, f(h)) in Figure 18 can have any slope between
    —1 and 1, no matter how small we require h to be.

    Figure 18

    This finding represents something of a triumph; although continuous, the func-

    This example suggests that we should seek even more restrictive conditions on a function than mere differentiability. We can actually use the derivative to formulate such conditions if we introduce another set of definitions, the last of this chapter.

    9. Derivatives 161

    FIGURE 19

    For any function f, we obtain, by taking the derivative, a new function f' (whose domain may be considerably smaller than that of f). The notion of differentiability can be applied to the function f', of course, yielding another function (f')', whose domain consists of all points a such that f' is differentiable at a. The function (f')' is usually written simply f'' and is called the second derivative of f.
    If f(a) exists, then f is said to be 2-times differentiable at a, and the number f''(a) is called the second derivative of f at a.

    In physics the second derivative is particularly important. If s(t) is the position at time t of a particle moving along a straight line, then s''(t) is called the acceleration at time t. Acceleration plays a special role in physics, because, as stated in Newton's laws of motion, the force on a particle is the product of its mass and its acceleration. Consequently you can feel the second derivative when you sit in an accelerating car.

    There is no reason to stop at the second derivative—we can define f'' = (f')', f''' = (f'')', etc. This notation rapidly becomes unwieldy, so the following abbreviation is usually adopted (it is really a recursive definition):

    f^{(1)} = f'
    f^{(2)} = f''
    f^{(3)} = f'''
    f^{(4)} = f^{(4)}
    etc.

    The various functions f^{(k)}, for k > 2, are sometimes called higher-order derivatives of f.

    Usually, we resort to the notation f^{(k)} only for k > 4, but it is convenient to have f defined for smaller k also. In fact, a reasonable definition can be made for f^{(0)}, namely,

    f^{(0)} = f.

    (a) Suppose that $ f(a) = g(a) = h(a) $, that $ f(x) < g(x) < h(x) $ for all $ x $, and that $ f'(a) = h'(a) $. Prove that $ g $ is differentiable at $ a $, and that $ f'(a) = g'(a) = h'(a) $. (Begin with the definition of $ g'(a) $.)

    (b) Show that the conclusion does not follow if we omit the hypothesis $ f(a) = g(a) = h(a) $.

    Let $ f $ be any polynomial function; we will see in the next chapter that $ f $ is differentiable. The tangent line to $ f $ at $ (a, f(a)) $ is the graph of $ g(x) = f'(a)(x - a) + f(a) $. Thus $ f(x) - g(x) $ is the polynomial function $ d(x) = f(x) - f'(a)(x - a) - f(a) $. We have already seen that if $ f(x) = x $, then $ d(x) = (x - a)^2 $, and if $ f(x) = x^2 $, then $ d(x) = (x - a)^2(x + 2a) $.

    (a) Find $ d(x) $ when $ f(x) = x^4 $, and show that it is divisible by $ (x - a) $.

    (b) "There certainly seems to be some evidence that $ d(x) $ is always divisible by $ (x - a)^2 $. Figure 22 provides an intuitive argument: usually, lines parallel to the tangent line will intersect the graph at two points; the tangent line intersects the graph only once near the point, so the intersection should be a "double intersection." 'To give a rigorous proof, first note that

    $$
    \frac{d(x)}{(x - a)^2} = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{(x - a)^2}
    $$

    Now answer the following questions. Why is $ f(x) - f(a) $ divisible by $ (x - a) $? Why is there a polynomial function $ h $ such that $ h(x) = \frac{d(x)}{(x - a)^2} $ for $ x \neq a $? Why is $ \lim_{x \to a} h(x) = 0 $? Why is $ h(a) = 0 $? Why does this solve the problem?

Can we still conclude that $ g $ is differentiable at $ a $, and that $ f''(a) = g''(a) = h''(a) $?\n\n**Task**:\n- Provide a counterexample where the conclusion fails.\n- Explain why the missing hypothesis $ f(a) = g(a) = h(a) $ is essential for the original proof.\n- Discuss the role of the equality of function values at $ a $ in establishing the condition for differentiability.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of the initial hypothesis and show that the conclusion does not hold without it.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Polynomial Remainder and Tangent Line Analysis**\n\nLet $ f(x) $ be a polynomial function, and let $ g(x) = f''(a)(x - a) + f(a) $ be the tangent line to $ f $ at $ (a, f(a)) $. Define $ d(x) = f(x) - g(x) $.\n\n(a) Find $ d(x) $ when $ f(x) = x^4 $, and show that it is divisible by $ (x - a) $.\n(b) Prove that $ d(x) $ is always divisible by $ (x - a)^2 $, using the definition of the derivative and the properties of polynomials.\n\n**Steps to Address**:\n- For part (a), compute $ d(x) = x^4 - [f''(a)(x - a) + f(a)] $.\n- For part (b), use the fact that $ d(a) = 0 $ and the definition of the derivative to show that $ (x - a)^2 $ divides $ d(x) $.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answers must integrate polynomial division, the concept of derivatives, and the behavior of polynomials near a point.

    The process of finding the derivative of a function is called differentiation. From the previous chapter you may have the impression that this process is usually laborious, requires recourse to the definition of the derivative, and depends upon successfully recognizing some limit. It is true that such a procedure is often the only possible approach—if you forget the definition of the derivative you are likely to be lost. Nevertheless, in this chapter we will learn to differentiate a large number of functions, without the necessity of even recalling the definition. A few theorems will provide a mechanical process for differentiating a large class of functions, which are formed from a few simple functions by the process of addition, multiplication, division, and composition. This description should suggest what theorems will be proved. We will first find the derivative of a few simple functions, and then prove theorems about the sum, products, quotients, and compositions of differentiable functions. The first theorem is merely a formal recognition of a computation carried out in the previous chapter.

    If f is a constant function, f(x) = c, then

    f'(a) = 0 for all numbers a.

    f(a + h) — f(a) . e - c
    = lim

    = 0.
    h → 0 .

    f(a) = fin

    The second theorem is also a special case of a computation in the last chapter.

    If f is the identity function, f(x) = x, then

    f(a) = 1 for all numbers a.

    f(a + h) — f(a)

    f(a) h > 0 h
    a + h - a
    = lim
    h → 0
    h
    = lim — = 1.

    The formula for the derivative of a product is not as simple as one might wish, but it is nevertheless pleasantly symmetric, and the proof requires only a simple algebraic trick, which we have found useful before—a number is not changed if the same quantity is added to and subtracted from it.

    If $ f $ and $ g $ are differentiable at $ a $, then $ f - g $ is also differentiable at $ a $, and

    (Notice that we have used Theorem 9-1! to conclude that $\lim_{h \to 0} f(a+h) = f(a)$. J)

    In one special case Theorem 4 simplifies considerably:

    If $ g(x) = c f(x) $ and $ f $ is differentiable at $ a $, then $ g $ is differentiable at $ a $, and

    (f - g - h)' is the sum of the three terms obtained by differentiating each of f, g, and A and multiplying by the other two.

    For example, if
    f(x) = x² sin x cosx,
    then

    f'(x) = 3x² sin x cosx + x² cos x cos x + x²(sin x)(- sin x).

    Products of more than 3 functions can be handled similarly. For example, you
    should have little difficulty deriving the formula

    (f - g - h - k)'(x) = f'(x)g(x)h(x)k(x) + f(x)g'(x)h(x)k(x)
    + f(x)g(x)h'(x)k(x) + f(x)g(x)h(x)k'(x).

    174 Derivatives and Integrals

    You might even try to prove (by induction) the general formula:

    (f₁f₂...fn)' = f'₁f₂...fn + f₁f'₂f₃...fn + ... + f₁f₂...f'n'.

    Differentiating the most interesting functions obviously requires a formula for
    (f ∘ g)'(x) in terms of f' and g'. To ensure that f ∘ g be differentiable at a, one
    reasonable hypothesis would seem to be that g be differentiable at a. Since the
    behavior of f ∘ g near a depends on the behavior of f near g(a) (not near a), it
    also seems reasonable to assume that f is differentiable at g(a). Indeed we shall
    prove that if g is differentiable at a and f is differentiable at g(a), then f ∘ g is
    differentiable at a, and

    (f ∘ g)'(a) = f'(g(a)) · g'(a).

    This extremely important formula is called the Chain Rule, presumably because
    a composition of functions might be called a "chain" of functions. Notice that
    (f ∘ g)' is practically the product of f' and g', but not quite: f' must be evaluated
    at g(a) and g' at a. Before attempting to prove this theorem we will try a few

    applications. Suppose

    f(x) = sin x².

    Let us, temporarily, use S to denote the ("squaring") function S(x) = x². Then

    With these examples as reference, you require only one thing to become a master differentiator—practice. You can be safely turned loose on the exercises at the end of the chapter, and it is now high time that we proved the Chain Rule.

    The following argument, while not a proof, indicates some of the tricks one might try, as well as some of the difficulties encountered. We begin, of course, with the definition—

    $$
    \frac{(f \circ g)(a + h) - (f \circ g)(a)}{h} = \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$

    $$
    (f \circ g)'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$

    Somewhere in here we would like the expression for $ g'(a) $. One approach is to put it in by fiat:

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$

    This does not look bad, and it looks even better if we write

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + [g(a + h) - g(a)]) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + [g(a + h) - g(a)]) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$

    The second limit is the factor $ g'(a) $ which we want. If we let $ g(a + h) - g(a) = k $ (to be precise we should write $ k(h) $), then the first limit is

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + k) - f(g(a))}{k}
    $$

    It looks as if this limit should be f'(g(a)), since continuity of g at a implies that k
    goes to 0 as h does. In fact, one can, and we soon will, make this sort of reasoning
    precise. [here is already a problem, however, which you will have noticed if you
    are the kind of person who does not divide blindly. Even for h ≠ 0 we might have
    g(a +h) — g(a) = 0, making the division and multiplication by g(a + h) — g(a)
    meaningless. True, we only care about small h, but g(a +h) — g(a) could be 0
    for arbitrarily small h. ‘The easiest way this can happen is for g to be a constant
    function, g(x) =c. Then g(a +h) — g(a) = 0 for all h. In this case, f o g is also
    a constant function, (f o g)(x) = f(c), so the Chain Rule does indeed hold:

    (fog) (a) =0= f'(g(a)) - g'(a).

    However, there are also nonconstant functions g for which g(a +h) — g(a) = 0
    for arbitrarily small h. For example, if a = 0, the function g might be
    g(x) = x² sin(1/x), for x ≠ 0,
    g(0) = 0.

    In this case, g'(0) = 0, as we showed in Chapter 9. If the Chain Rule is correct, we
    must have (f o g)'(0) = 0 for any differentiable f, and this is not exactly obvious.
    A proof of the Chain Rule can be found by considering such recalcitrant functions
    separately, but it is easier simply to abandon this approach, and use a trick.

    If g is differentiable at a, and f is differentiable at g(a), then fog is differentiable
    at a, and

    (fog)'(a) = f'(g(a)) · g'(a).

    Define a function φ as follows:

    \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h} - \frac{f'(g(a)), \text{ if } g(a + h) - g(a) = 0.}
    $$
    It should be intuitively clear that $\alpha$ is continuous at 0: When $h$ is small,
    $g(a + h) - g(a)$ is also small, so if $g(a + h) - g(a)$ is not zero, then $\alpha(h)$ will
    be close to $f'(g(a));$ and if it is zero, then $\alpha(h)$ actually equals $f'(g(a))$, which
    is even better. Since the continuity of $\alpha$ is the crux of the whole proof we will
    provide a careful translation of this intuitive argument.

    We know that $f$ is differentiable at $g(a)$. This means that
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + h) - f(g(a))}{h} = f'(g(a))
    $$
    if $g(a + h) - g(a) \neq 0$.

    $$
    = f'(g(a)).
    $$

    Thus, if $\epsilon > 0$ there is some number $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $h$,
    $$
    \frac{f(g(a) + h) - f(g(a))}{h} \to f'(g(a)).
    $$

    Now $g$ is differentiable at $a$, hence continuous at $a$, so there is a $\delta > 0$ such that,
    for all $h$,

    (1) if $0 < |h| < \delta$, then $\left| \frac{f(g(a) + h) - f(g(a))}{h} - f'(g(a)) \right| < \epsilon$.

    (2) if $|h| < \delta$, then $|g(a + h) - g(a)| < \epsilon$.

    Consider now any $h$ with $|h| < \delta$. If $k = g(a + h) - g(a) \neq 0$, then

    $$
    \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h} = \frac{f(g(a) + k) - f(g(a))}{k} \cdot \frac{k}{h}.
    $$

    It follows from (2) that $|k| < \epsilon$, and hence from (1) that

    $$
    \left| \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a)))}{h} - f'(g(a)) \right| < \epsilon.
    $$

    On the other hand, if $g(a + h) - g(a) = 0$, then $\alpha(h) = f'(g(a))$, so it is surely
    true that

    Strictly speaking, these equations may be false, because the functions on the left-hand side might have a larger domain than those on the right. Nevertheless, this is hardly worth worrying about.

    One aim in this chapter is to justify the time we have spent learning to find the
    derivative of a function. As we shall see, knowing just a little about f' tells us a
    lot about f. Extracting information about f from information about /f' requires
    some difficult work, however, and we shall begin with the one theorem which is
    really easy.

    This theorem is concerned with the maximum value of a function on an interval.
    Although we have used this term informally in Chapter 7, it is worthwhile to be
    precise, and also more general.

    Let f be a function and A a set of numbers contained in the domain of f.
    A point x in A is a maximum point for f on A if

    f(x) = f(y) for every y in A.

    The number f(x) itself is called the maximum value of f on A (and we also
    say that f "has its maximum value on A at x").

    Notice that the maximum value of f on A could be f(x) for several different x
    (Figure 1); in other words, a function f can have several different maximum points
    on A, although it can have at most one maximum value. Usually we shall be
    interested in the case where A is a closed interval [a,b]; if f is continuous, then
    Theorem 7-3 guarantees that f does indeed have a maximum value on [a, b].

    The definition of a minimum of f on A will be left to you. (One possible
    definition is the following: f has a minimum on A at x, if —f has a maximum
    on A at x.)

    We are now ready for a theorem which does not even depend upon the existence
    of least upper bounds.

    Let f be any function defined on (a, b). If x is a maximum (or a minimum) point
    for f on (a,b), and f is differentiable at x, then f'(x) = 0.

    (Notice that we do not assume differentiability, or even continuity, of f at other
    points.)

    Consider the case where f has a maximum at x. Figure 2 illustrates the simple idea
    behind the whole argument—secants drawn through points to the left of (x, f(x))
    have slopes > O, and secants drawn through points to the right of (x, f(x)) have
    slopes < 0. Analytically, this argument proceeds as follows.

    If h is any number such that x + A 1s in (a, b), then
    f(x) >= fa t+h),
    since f has a maximum on (a, b) at x. This means that
    f(x +h) — f(x) <9.

    By hypothesis, f is differentiable at x, so these two limits must be equal, in fact
    equal to f'(x). This means that

    f'(x) <0 and f(x) >0,

    from which it follows that f'(x) = 0.
    The case where f has a minimum at x is left to you (give a one-line proof). J

    Notice (Figure 3) that we cannot replace (a, b) by [a, b] in the statement of the
    theorem (unless we add to the hypothesis the condition that x 1s in (a, D).)

    Since f'(x) depends only on the values of f near x, it is almost obvious how to
    get a stronger version of Theorem |. We begin with a definition which 1s illustrated

    Let $ f $ be a function, and $ A $ a set of numbers contained in the domain of $ f $.
    A point $ x $ in $ A $ is a local maximum [minimum] point for $ f $ on $ A $ if
    there is some $ \delta > 0 $ such that $ x $ is a maximum [minimum] point for $ f $ on
    $ A \cap (x - \delta, x + \delta) $.

    If $ x $ is a local maximum or minimum for $ f $ on $ (a, b) $ and $ f $ is differentiable at $ x $,
    then $ f'(x) = 0 $.

    The converse of Theorem 2 is definitely not true—it is possible for $ f'(x) $ to be 0
    even if $ x $ is not a local maximum or minimum point for $ f $. The simplest example
    is provided by the function $ f(x) = x^3 $; in this case $ f'(0) = 0 $, but $ f $ has no local
    maximum or minimum anywhere.

    Probably the most widespread misconceptions about calculus are concerned
    with the behavior of a function $ f $ near $ x $ when $ f'(x) = 0 $. The point made in
    the previous paragraph is so quickly forgotten by those who want the world to be
    simpler than it is, that we will repeat it: the converse of "Theorem 2 is not true—the
    condition $ f'(x) = 0 $ does not imply that $ x $ is a local maximum or minimum point
    of $ f $. Precisely for this reason, special terminology has been adopted to describe
    numbers $ x $ which satisfy the condition $ f'(x) = 0 $.

    A critical point of a function $ f $ is a number $ x $ such that
    $ f'(x) = 0 $.

    The number $ f(x) $ itself is called a critical value of $ f $.

    The text provided appears to be a mix of mathematical expressions and some OCR errors. Here's the corrected version with proper formatting and spelling:

    ---

    $$ f(x) = xe^{-x} $$

    on the interval $[-1, 2]$. 'To begin with, we have

    $$ f'(x) = 3x^7 - 1 $$

    so $ f'(x) = 0 $ when $ 3x^2 - 1 = 0 $, that is, when

    $$ x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} \text{ or } -\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $$

    The numbers $ \frac{1}{3} $ and $ -\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $ both lie in $[-1, 2]$, so the first group of candidates

    for the location of the maximum and minimum are

    (1) $ \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}, -\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $

    The second group contains the end points of the interval,

    (2) $ -1, 2 $

    The third group is empty, since $ f $ is differentiable everywhere. The final step is to

    compute

    $$ f\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = 5\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

    $$ f\left(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = -4\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} $$

    $$ f(-1) = 90 $$

    $$ f(2) = 6 $$

    Clearly the minimum value is $ -3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} $, occurring at $ \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $, and the maximum value is 6, occurring at 2.

    This sort of procedure, if feasible, will always locate the maximum and minimum

    value of a continuous function on a closed interval. If the function we are dealing

    with is not continuous, however, or if we are seeking the maximum or minimum

    on an open interval or the whole line, then we cannot even be sure beforehand

    that the maximum and minimum values exist, so all the information obtained by

    this procedure may say nothing. Nevertheless, a little ingenuity will often reveal

    the nature of things. In Chapter 7 we solved just such a problem when we showed

    that if $ n $ is even, then the function

    $$ f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 $$

    has a minimum value on the whole line. This proves that the minimum value must

    occur at some number $ x $ satisfying

    $$ 0 = f'(x) = nx^{n-1} + (n - 1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_0 $$

    If we can solve this equation, and compare the values of f(x) for such x, we can actually find the minimum of f. One more example may be helpful. Suppose we wish to find the maximum and minimum, if they exist, of the function

    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x^7}
    $$

    on the open interval (−1, 1). We have

    $$
    f'(x) = \frac{2x}{(1 - x^7)^2}
    $$

    so f'(x) = 0 only for x = 0. We can see immediately that for x close to 1 or −1 the values of f(x) become arbitrarily large, so f certainly does not have a maximum. This observation also makes it easy to show that f has a minimum at 0. We just note (Figure 5) that there will be numbers a and b, with

    $$
    -1 < a < 0 \text{ and } 0 < b < 1,
    $$

    such that f(x) > f(0) for

    $$
    -1 < x < a \text{ and } b < x < 1.
    $$

    This means that the minimum of f on [a,b] is the minimum of f on all of (−1,1). Now on [a,b] the minimum occurs either at 0 (the only place where f' = 0), or at a or b, and a and b have already been ruled out, so the minimum value is f(0) = 1.

    In solving these problems we purposely did not draw the graphs of f(x) = x°−x and f(x) = 1/(1 − x7), but it is not cheating to draw the graph (Figure 6) as long as you do not rely solely on your picture to prove anything. As a matter of fact, we are now going to discuss a method of sketching the graph of a function that really gives enough information to be used in discussing maxima and minima—indeed we will be able to locate even local maxima and minima. This method involves consideration of the sign of f(x), and relies on some deep theorems.

    The theorems about derivatives which have been proved so far, always yield
    information about f' in terms of information about f. This is true even of Theo-
    rem |, although this theorem can sometimes be used to determine certain informa-
    tion about f, namely, the location of maxima and minima. When the derivative
    was first introduced, we emphasized that f'(x) is not [f(x +h) — f(x)]/hA for any
    particular h, but only a limit of these numbers as h approaches 0; this fact becomes
    painfully relevant when one tries to extract information about f from information
    about f'. The simplest and most frustrating Wlustration of the difficulties encoun-
    tered is afforded by the following question: If f'(x) = O for all x, must f be a
    constant function? It 1s impossible to imagine how f could be anything else, and
    this conviction is strengthened by considering the physical interpretation—if the
    velocity of a particle is always O, surely the particle must be standing stl! Never-
    theless it is difficult even to begin a proof that only the constant functions satisfy
    f(x) = 0 for all x. The hypothesis f'(x) = 0 only means that

    The fact that f is a constant function if f'(x) = 0 for all x, and many other facts
    of the same sort, can all be derived from a fundamental theorem, called the Mean
    Value Theorem, which states much stronger results. Figure 7 makes it plausible
    that if f is differentiable on [a, b], then there is some x in (a, b) such that

    Geometrically this means that some tangent line is parallel to the line between
    (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). The Mean Value Theorem asserts that this is true—there
    is some x in (a,b) such that f'(x), the instantaneous rate of change of f at x, is
    exactly equal to the average or "mean" change of f on [a, b], this average change
    being [ f(b) — f(a)]/[b — a]. (For example, if you travel 60 miles in one hour,
    then at some time you must have been traveling exactly 60 miles per hour.) This
    theorem is one of the most important theoretical tools of calculus—probably the
    deepest result about derivatives. From this statement you might conclude that the
    proof is difficult, but there you would be wrong—the hard theorems in this book
    have occurred long ago, in Chapter 7. It is true that if you try to prove the Mean
    Value Theorem yourself you will probably fail, but this is neither evidence that the
    theorem is hard, nor something to be ashamed of. The first proof of the theorem
    was an achievement, but today we can supply a proof which is quite simple. It
    helps to begin with a very special case.

    f(x) =

    If f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), and f(a) = f(b), then
    there is a number x in (a, b) such that f'(x) = 0.

    It follows from the continuity of f on [a, b] that f has a maximum and a minimum
    value on [a, b].

    Suppose first that the maximum value occurs at a point x in (a,b). Then
    f'(x) = 0 by Theorem 1, and we are done (Figure 8).

    Suppose next that the minimum value of f occurs at some point x in (a, b).
    Then, again, f'(x) = 0 by Theorem 1 (Figure 9).

    Finally, suppose the maximum and minimum values both occur at the end points. Since f(a) = f(b), the maximum and minimum values of f are equal, so f is a constant function (Figure 10), and for a constant function we can choose any x in (a,b). J

    Notice that we really needed the hypothesis that f is differentiable everywhere on (a,b) in order to apply Theorem |. Without this assumption the theorem 1s false (Figure 11).

    You may wonder why a special name should be attached to a theorem as easily proved as Rolle's Theorem. The reason is, that although Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, it also yields a simple proof of the Mean Value Theorem. In order to prove the Mean Value Theorem we will apply Rolle's Theorem to the function which gives the length of the vertical segment shown in

    Figure 12; this is the difference between f(x), and the height at x of the line L between (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). Since L is the graph of

    $$
    f(x) = f(a) + \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x - a)

    A function is increasing on an interval if f(a) < f(b) whenever a and b are
    two numbers in the interval with a < b. The function f is decreasing on
    an interval if f(a) > f(b) for all a and b in the interval with a < b. (We
    often say simply that f is increasing or decreasing, in which case the interval is
    understood to be the domain of f.)

    If f'(x) > O for all x in an interval, then f is increasing on the interval; if f'(x) < O
    for all x in the interval, then f is decreasing on the interval.

    Consider the case where f'(x) > 0. Let a and b be two points in the interval with
    a <b. Then there is some x in (a, b) with

    (f(b) — f(a)) = f'(x)(b—a)
    But f'(x) > 0 for all x in (a,b), so
    f(b) — f(a) > 0
    b—a

    Since b —a > O, it follows that f(b) > f(a).
    The proof when f'(x) < 0 for all x is left to you. J

    Notice that although the converses of Corollary 1 and Corollary 2 are true (and
    obvious), the converse of Corollary 3 is not true. If f is increasing, it is easy to
    see that f'(x) > O for all x, but the equality sign might hold for some x (consider
    f(x) =x^3?)

    since f' is continuous, and vanishes only at ~/1/3 and J 1/3, we know that f'
    always has the same sign on the interval (—/1/3, J1/3 ). Since f (—/1/3 )>
    f (/1/3 ), it follows that f decreases on this interval. Similarly, f' always has the
    same sign on (/1/3, oo) and f(x) is large for large x, so f must be increasing on
    (/1/3, 00). Another point worth noting: If f' is continuous, then the sign of f'
    on the interval between two adjacent critical points can be determined simply by
    finding the sign of f'(x) for any one x in this interval.

    Our sketch of the graph of f(x) = x* — x contains sufficient information
    to allow us to say with confidence that —,/1/3 is a local maximum point, and that
    J/1/3 is a local minimum point. In fact, we can give a general scheme for decid-
    ing whether a critical point is a local maximum point, a local minimum point, or
    neither (Figure 16):

    (1) if f' > O in some interval to the left of x and f' < O in some interval to
    the right of x, then x is a local maximum point.

    (2) if f' < O in some interval to the left of x and f' > 0 in some interval to
    the right of x, then x is a local minimum point.

    (3) if f' has the same sign in some interval to the left of x as it has in some
    interval to the right, then x is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum
    point.

    (There is no point in memorizing these rules—you can always draw the pictures

- prompt: |-
    The derivative, being a polynomial function of degree n — 1, has at most
    n — 1 roots. Therefore f has at most n — 1 critical points. Of course, a criti-
    cal point is not necessarily a local maximum or minimum point, but at any rate,
    if a and b are adjacent critical points of f, then f' will remain either positive or
    negative on (a,b), since f' is continuous; consequently, f will be either increasing
    or decreasing on (a,b). ‘Thus f has at most n regions of decrease or increase.

    As a specific example, consider the function

    f(x) =x^3 — 2x^2.
    Since

    the critical points of f are —1, 0, and 1, and
    f(-1) =—1,
    f(0) = 0,
    f(1) = —1
    The behavior of f on the intervals between the critical points can be determined
    by one of the methods mentioned before. In particular, we could determine the
    sign of f' on these intervals simply by examining the formula for f'(x). On the

    other hand, from the three critical values alone we can see (figure 18) that f
    increases on (—1,0) and decreases on (0,1). To determine the sign of f' on
    (—oo, —1) and (1, ©) we can compute

    f'(-2) =4*(-2)^3 — 4*(-2)^2 = 24,
    f'(2)=4*(2)^3 — 4*(2)^2=24,

    and conclude that f is decreasing on (—oo, —1) and increasing on (1, 00). These
    conclusions also follow from the fact that f(x) is large for large x and for large
    negative x.

    f(x) = 0 for x = 0, +4/9: second, it is clear that f is even, f(x) = f(— x), so the

    already sketched in Figure 15, is odd, f(x) = —f(—~x), and is consequently sym-

    Several problems in this and succeeding chapters ask you to sketch the graphs

    (1) the critical points of f,

    (2) the value of f at the critical points,

    (3) the sign of f' in the regions between critical points (if this 1s not already
    clear),

    (4) the numbers x such that f(x) = 0 (if possible),

    (5) the behavior of f(x) as x becomes large or large negative (if possible).

    Finally, bear in mind that a quick check, to see whether the function is odd or
    even, may save a lot of work.

    This sort of analysis, if performed with care, will usually reveal the basic shape
    of the graph, but sometimes there are special features which require a little more
    thought. It is impossible to anticipate all of these, but one piece of information 1s
    often very important. If f is not defined at certain points (for example, if f is a

    Thus
    (1) the critical points of f are 0, 2.
    Moreover,
    (2) $f(O) = —2$,
    $f (2) =2$.

    Because f is not defined on the whole interval (0, 2), the sign of $f'$ must be
    determined separately on the intervals $(O, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$, as well as on the intervals
    $(—oo, 0)$ and $(2, co)$. We can do this by picking particular points in each of these
    intervals, or simply by staring hard at the formula for $f'$. Either way we find that

    (3) $f(x)>0$ if $x <0$,
    $f(x) <0$ if $O<x <1$,
    $f(x) <0$ if $l<x <2$,
    $f(xy) >0O$ ff $2<x$.

    Finally, we must determine the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ becomes large or large
    negative, as well as when $x$ approaches $|$ (this information will also give us another
    way to determine the regions on which $f$ increases and decreases). ‘To examine
    the behavior as $x$ becomes large we write

    $\frac{x^2 — 2x + 2}{x - 1}$

    Clearly $f(x)$ is close to $x — 1$ (and slightly larger) when $x$ is large, and $f(x)$ is close
    to $x — |$ (but slightly smaller) when $x$ is large negative. ‘The behavior of $f$ near $|$ is also easy to determine; since

    $\lim_{x \to |} (x^2 — 2x + 2) = 140$,

    the fraction
    $$\frac{x^2 — 2x + 2}{x - 1}$$
    becomes large as $x$ approaches $|$ from above and large negative as $x$ approaches $|$ from below.

    a good idea of the appearance of the graph.

    Although the location of local maxima and minima of a function 1s always re-
    vealed by a detailed sketch of its graph, it is usually unnecessary to do so much
    work. ‘There is a popular test for local maxima and minima which depends on the
    behavior of the function only at its critical points.

    THEOREM 6

    PROOF

    Suppose now that f"(a) > 0. Then f'(a + h)/h must be positive for sufficiently
    small h. ‘Therefore:

    f'(a +h) must be positive for sufficiently small h > 0
    and f'(a +h) must be negative for sufficiently small h < 0.

    This means (Corollary 3) that f is increasing in some interval to the right of a
    and f 1s decreasing in some interval to the left of a. Consequently, f has a local
    minimum at a.

    The proof for the case f(a) < 0 is similar. J

    f'(-1/3) = -6x^1/3 < 0,
    f'(1/3) = 6x^1/3 > 0.

    Consequently, -1/3 is a local maximum point and 1/3 is a local minimum
    point.

    Although Theorem 5 will be found quite useful for polynomial functions, for
    many functions the second derivative is so complicated that it is easier to consider
    the sign of the first derivative. Moreover, if a is a critical point of f it may happen
    that f''(a) = 0. In this case, Theorem 5 provides no information: it is possible
    that a is a local maximum point, a local minimum point, or neither, as shown

    (Figure 21) by the functions
    f(x)=−x^3, f(x)=x^3, f(x)=x^5:

    in each case f'(0) = f''(0) = 0, but 0 is a local maximum point for the first, a
    local minimum point for the second, and neither a local maximum nor minimum
    point for the third. This point will be pursued further in Part IV.

    It is interesting to note that Theorem 5 automatically proves a partial converse
    of itself.

    Suppose f'(a) exists. If f has a local minimum at a, then f''(a) > 0; if f has a
    local maximum at a, then f''(a) < 0.

    Suppose f has local minimum at a. If f''(a) < 0, then f would also have a
    local maximum at a, by Theorem 5. Thus f would be constant in some interval
    containing a, so that f(a) = 0, a contradiction. Thus we must have f''(a) = 0.

    The case of a local maximum is handled similarly. J

    The remainder of this chapter deals, not with graph sketching, or maxima and
    minima, but with three consequences of the Mean Value Theorem. The first is a
    simple, but very beautiful, theorem which plays an important role in Chapter 15,
    and which also sheds light on many examples which have occurred in previous
    chapters.

    Suppose that f is continuous at a, and that f'(x) exists for all x in some interval
    containing a, except perhaps for x = a. Suppose, moreover, that lim f'(x) exists.

    h—0 h
    For sufficiently small h > O the function f will be continuous on [a,a +h] and

    differentiable on (a,a +h) (a similar assertion holds for sufficiently small h < 0).
    By the Mean Value Theorem there is a number c in (a, a + h) such that

    f(a+h) — f(a)
    h

    Now c approaches a as h approaches 0, because c is in (a,a +h); since
    lim f'(x) exists, it follows that

    = f'(c).

    h—0 h

    = lim f'(c) = lim f'(x).

    (It is a good idea to supply a rigorous ε-δ argument for this final step, which we
    have treated somewhat informally.) §

    Even if f is an everywhere differentiable function, it is still possible for f' to be
    discontinuous. This happens, for example, if

    1
    x*sin(1/x), x ≠ 0
    f(x) =
    0, x = 0.

    According to Theorem 7, however, the graph of f' can never exhibit a discontinuity
    of the type shown in Figure 22. Problem 61 outlines the proof of another
    beautiful theorem which gives further information about the function f', and Prob-
    lem 62 uses this result to strengthen Theorem 7.

    THEOREM 8 (THE CAUCHY MEAN VALUE THEOREM)

    PROOF

    THEOREM 9 (L'HÔPITAL'S RULE)

    If f and g are continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there is a
    number x in (a, b) such that

    [ f(b) — f(a)] = [g(b) — g(a)] f'(x).
    (If g(b) ≠ g(a), and g'(x) ≠ 0, this equation can be written

    [ f(b)—f(a)] = [g(b)—g(a)] [f'(x)/g'(x)]
    Notice that if g(x) = x for all x, then g'(x) = 1, and we obtain the Mean Value

    Theorem. On the other hand, applying the Mean Value Theorem to f and g
    separately, we find that there are x and y in (a, b) with

    [ f(b)—f(a)] = [g(b)—g(a)] [f'(x)/g'(y)]
    but there is no guarantee that the x and y found in this way will be equal. These

    remarks may suggest that the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem will be quite difficult
    to prove, but actually the simplest of tricks suffices.)

    Let
    h(x) = f(x)[g(b) — g(a) — g(x)] [f(b) — f(a)].

    Then h is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and

    h(a) = f(a)g(b) — g(a) f(b) = h(b).

    It follows from Rolle's Theorem that h'(x) = 0 for some x in (a, b), which means
    that

    0= f'(x)[g(b) — g(a)] — g(x) [f(b) — f(a)]. 1

    The Cauchy Mean Value Theorem is the basic tool needed to prove a theorem
    which facilitates evaluation of limits of the form

    lim f(x)/g(x)

    lim f(x)=0 and lim g(x) =0.

    PROOF

    11. Significance of the Derivative 205

    The hypothesis that lim f'(x)/g'(x) exists contains two implicit assumptions:
    Xa—a

    (1) there is an interval (a —5,a+ 4) such that f'(x) and g'(x) exist for all x in
    (a —5,a +54) except, perhaps, for x = a,

    (2) in this interval g'(x) ≠ 0 with, once again, the possible exception
    of x =a.

    On the other hand, f and g are not even assumed to be defined at a. If we define
    f(a) = g(a) = 0 (changing the previous values of f(a) and g(a), if necessary),
    then f and g are continuous at a. If a < x < a+, then the Mean Value
    Theorem and the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem apply to f and g on the interval
    [a,x] (and a similar statement holds for a — 6 < x <a). First applying the Mean
    Value Theorem to g, we see that g(x) ≠ 0, for if g(x) = 0 there would be some x
    in (a, x) with g'(x;) = 0, contradicting (2). Now applying the Cauchy Mean Value
    Theorem to f and g, we see that there is a number a@, 1n (a, x) such that

    Prove the following (which we often use implicitly): If $ f $ is increasing on $ (a, b) $ and continuous at $ a $ and $ b $, then $ f $ is increasing on $ [a, b] $. In particular, if $ f $ is continuous on $ [a,b] $ and $ f' > 0 $ on $ (a,b) $, then $ f $ is increasing on $ [a, b] $.

    A straight line is drawn from the point $ (0,a) $ to the horizontal axis, and then back to $ (1,5) $, as in Figure 23. Prove that the total length is shortest when the angles $ a $ and $ \theta $ are equal. (Naturally you must bring a function into the picture: express the length in terms of $ x $, where $ (x, y) $ is the point on the horizontal axis. 'The dashed line in Figure 23 suggests an alternative geometric proof; in either case the problem can be solved without actually finding the point $ (x, 0) $.)

    (a) Let $ (x_0, y_0) $ be a point of the plane, and let $ L $ be the graph of the function $ f(x) = mx + b $. Find the point $ x $ such that the distance from $ (x_0, y_0) $ to $ (x, f(x)) $ is smallest. [Notice that minimizing this distance is the same as minimizing its square. This may simplify the computations somewhat. ]

    (b) Also find $ x $ by noting that the line from $ (x_0, y_0) $ to $ (x, f(x)) $ is perpendicular to $ L $.

    (c) Find the distance from $ (x_0, y_0) $ to $ L $, i.e., the distance from $ (x_0, y_0) $ to $ (x, f(x)) $. [It will make the computations easier if you first assume that $ b = 0 $; then apply the result to the graph of $ f(x) = mx $ and the point $ (x_0, y_0 - b) $.] Compare with Problem 4-22.

    f'(x) = \frac{\lim_{y \to b^-} f(y) - \lim_{y \to a^+} f(y)}{b - a}.

    Prove that if $ f $ and $ g $ are continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, and $ g'(x) \neq 0 $ for $ x \in (a, b) $, then there is some $ x \in (a, b) $ with

    It is easy to find a function $ f $ such that $ |f| $ is differentiable but $ f $ is not. For example, we can choose $ f(x) = 1 $ for $ x $ rational and $ f(x) = -1 $ for $ x $ irrational. In this example $ f $ is not even continuous, nor is this a mere coincidence: Prove that if $ |f| $ is differentiable at $ a $, and $ f $ is continuous at $ a $, then $ f $ is also differentiable at $ a $. Hint: It suffices to consider only a with $ f(a) = 0 $. Why? In this case, what must $ |f|'(a) $ be?

    (b) Prove that if $ y \neq 0 $ and $ n $ is odd, then $ x^n + y^n = (x + y)^n $ only if $ x = 0 $ or $ x = -y $.

    Suppose that $ f(0) = 0 $ and $ f $ is increasing. Prove that the function $ g(x) = \frac{f(x)}{x} $ is increasing on $(0, \infty)$. Hint: Obviously you should look at $ g'(x) $. Prove that it is positive by applying the Mean Value Theorem to $ f $ on the right interval (it will help to remember that the hypothesis $ f(0) = 0 $ is essential, as shown by the function $ f(x) = 1 + x^7 $).

    Use derivatives to prove that if $ n > 1 $, then
    $$
    (1 + x)^n \leq 1 + nx \quad \text{for} \quad -1 < x < \infty \quad \text{and} \quad 0 < x

    Let $ f(x) = x^4 \sin^2(1/x) $ for $ x \neq 0 $, and let $ f(0) = 0 $ (Figure 33).

    (a) Prove that $ 0 $ is a local minimum point for $ f $.

    (b) Prove that $ f'(0) = f''(0) = 0 $.

    This function thus provides another example to show that Theorem 6 cannot be improved. It also illustrates a subtlety about maxima and minima that often goes unnoticed: a function may not be increasing in any interval to the right of a local minimum point, nor decreasing in any interval to the left.

It is quite possible for this to happen even if f is not a constant function: for example, if f(x) = 0 for x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for x > 0. But prove, using Problem 8-4, that if f is continuous on [a, b] and every point of [a,b] is a local maximum point, then f is a constant function. The same result holds, of course, if every point of [a,b] is a local minimum point.

    APPENDIX. CONVEXITY AND CONCAVITY

    Although the graph of a function can be sketched quite accurately on the basis
    of the information provided by the derivative, some subtle aspects of the graph are
    revealed only by examining the second derivative. These details were purposely
    omitted previously because graph sketching is complicated enough without wor-
    rying about them, and the additional information obtained is often not worth the
    effort. Also, correct proofs of the relevant facts are sufficiently difficult to be placed
    in an appendix. Despite these discouraging remarks, the information presented
    here is well worth assimilating, because the notions of convexity and concavity are
    far more important than as mere aids to graph sketching. Moreover, the proofs
    have a pleasantly geometric flavor not often found in calculus theorems. Indeed,
    the basic definition 1s geometric in nature (see Figure 1).

    A function f is convex on an interval, if for all a and b in the interval, the line

    segment joining (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) lies above the graph of f.

    The geometric condition appearing in this definition can be expressed in an
    analytic way that is sometimes more useful in proofs. The straight line between

    (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) 1s the graph of the function g defined by

    _ f(b) — fla)
    = (

    we obtain the definition of a concave function (Figure 2). It is not hard to see that
    the concave functions are precisely the ones of the form —f, where f is convex.
    For this reason, the next three theorems about convex functions have immediate
    corollaries about concave functions, so simple that we will not even bother to
    state them.

    Figure 3 shows some tangent lines of a convex function. ‘Two things seem to be
    true:

    (1) The graph of f lies above the tangent line at (a, f(a)) except at the point
    (a, f(a)) itself (this point is called the point of contact of the tangent line).

    (2) If a < b, then the slope of the tangent line at (a, f(a)) is less than the slope
    of the tangent line at (b, f(b)); that is, f' is increasing,

    As a matter of fact these observations are true, and the proofs are not difficult.

    Consider, for example, the function

    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{(1 + x^7)^4}
    $$

    Thus $ f'(x) = 0 $ only for $ x = 0 $, and $ f(0) = 1 $, while

    $ f(x) > 0 $ if $ x < 0 $,
    $ f(x) < 0 $ if $ x > 0 $.

    Moreover,

    $ f(x) > 0 $ for all $ x $,
    $ f(x) > 0 $ as $ x \to \infty $ or $ -\infty $,
    $ f $ is even.

    FIGURE 9

    The graph of $ f $ therefore looks something like Figure 9. We now compute

    $$
    \frac{(1 + x^7)^2(—2) + 2x - [2(1 + x) - 2x]}{(1 + x^7)^4}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{2(3x^2 — 1)}{(1 + x^2)^3}
    $$

    It is not hard to determine the sign of $ f''(x) $. Note first that $ f''(x) = 0 $ only when
    $ x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $. Since $ f'' $ is clearly continuous, it must keep the same sign

    on each of the sets

    $$
    (-\infty, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}), \quad (-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}), \quad (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \infty).
    $$

    Since we easily compute, for example, that

    $ f''(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = 5 > 0 $,
    $ f''(0) = -\frac{2}{3} < 0 $,
    $ f''(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = 4 > 0 $,

    we conclude that

    $$
    f'' > 0 \text{ on } (-\infty, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \text{ and } (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \infty),
    $$
    $$
    f'' < 0 \text{ on } (-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}).
    $$

    Since $ f'' > 0 $ means $ f' $ is increasing, it follows from Theorem 2 that $ f $ is convex on

    $$
    (-\infty, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \text{ and } (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \infty),

    while on $ (-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) $, $ f $ is concave (Figure 10).

    Right, since f is convex on (1/3, ∞), and above the part of the graph to the left,
    since f is concave on (−1/3, 1/3); thus the tangent line crosses the graph. In

    general, a number a is called an inflection point of f if the tangent line to the

    graph of f at (a, f(a)) crosses the graph; thus ±1/3 are inflection
    points of f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2). Note that the condition f'(a) = 0 does not ensure
    that a is an inflection point of f; for example, if f(x) = x^4, then f''(0) = 0, but
    f is convex, so the tangent line at (0, 0) certainly doesn't cross the graph of f. In
    order to conclude that a is an inflection point of a function f, we need to know
    that f'' has different signs to the left and right of a.

    This example illustrates the procedure which may be used to analyze any func-
    tion f. After the graph has been sketched, using the information provided by f',
    the zeros of f'' are computed and the sign of f'' is determined on the intervals
    between consecutive zeros. On intervals where f'' > 0 the function is convex;
    on intervals where f'' < 0 the function is concave. Knowledge of the regions of
    convexity and concavity of f can often prevent absurd misinterpretation of other
    data about f. Several functions, which can be analyzed in this way, are given in
    the problems, which also contain some theoretical questions.

    If f is differentiable on an interval and intersects each of its tangent lines just once, then f is either convex or concave on that interval.

    There are two parts to the proof.

    (1) First we claim that no straight line can intersect the graph of f in three different points. Suppose, on the contrary, that some straight line did intersect the graph of f at (a, f(a)), (b, f(b)) and (c, f(c)), with a < b < c (Figure 11). Then we would have

    $$
    \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = \frac{f(c) - f(a)}{c - a}
    $$

    (1)

    Consider the function

    $$
    g(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \quad \text{for } x \in [b,c].
    $$

    Equation (1) says that $ g(b) = g(c) $. So by Rolle's Theorem, there is some number $ x $ in (b,c) where 0 = g'(x), and thus

    $$
    0 = \frac{(x - a)f'(x) - (f(x) - f(a))}{(x - a)^2}
    $$

    or

    $$
    f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)f'(x)
    $$

    But this says (Figure 12) that the tangent line at (x, f(x)) passes through (a, f(a)), contradicting the hypotheses.

    (2) Suppose that $ a_1 < b_1 < c_1 $ and $ a_2 < b_2 < c_2 $; are points in the interval. Let

    $$
    x_1 = (1 - t)a_1 + ta_2, \quad y_1 = (1 - t)b_1 + tb_2, \quad z_1 = (1 - t)c_1 + tc_2
    $$

    for $ 0 < t < 1 $. Then $ x_1 = a_1 $ and $ x_2 = a_2 $, and (Problem 4-2) the points $ x_1 $ all lie between $ a_1 $ and $ a_2 $, with analogous statements for $ y_1 $ and $ z_1 $. Moreover,

    $$
    x < y < 2 \quad \text{for } 0 < t < 1.
    $$

    Now consider the function

    $$
    g(t) = \frac{y_1 - x_1}{z_1 - x_1}
    $$

    By step (1), $ g(t) \neq 0 $ for all $ t $ in [0,1]. So either $ g(t) > 0 $ for all $ t $ in [0,1] or $ g(t) < 0 $ for all $ t $ in [0,1]. Thus, either f is convex or f is concave. J

    Sketch, indicating regions of convexity and concavity and points of inflection,
    the functions in Problem 11-1 (consider (iv) as double starred).

    Figure 30 in Chapter 11 shows the graph of f'. Sketch the graph of f.

    Show that f is convex on an interval if and only if for all x and y in the
    interval we have

    f(tx + (1 - t)y) < tf(x) + (1 - t)f(y), for 0 < t < 1.

    (This is just a restatement of the definition, but a useful one.)

    (a) Prove that if f and g are convex and f is increasing, then f o g is convex.
    (It will be easiest to use Problem 3.)

    (b) Give an example where g o f is not convex.

    (c) Suppose that f and g are twice differentiable. Give another proof of the
    result of part (a) by considering second derivatives.

    (a) Suppose that f is differentiable and convex on an interval. Show that
    either f is increasing, or else f is decreasing, or else there is a number c
    such that f is decreasing to the left of c and increasing to the right of c.

    (b) Use this fact to give another proof of the result in Problem 4(a) when f
    and g are (one-time) differentiable. (You will have to be a little careful
    when comparing f'(g(x)) and f"(g(y)) for x < y.)

    (c) Prove the result in part (a) without assuming f differentiable. You will
    have to keep track of several different cases, but no particularly clever
    ideas are needed. Begin by showing that if a < b and f(a) < f(b), then
    f is increasing to the right of b; and if f(a) > f(b), then f is decreasing
    to the left of a.

    Let f be a twice-differentiable function with the following properties:
    f(x) > O for x > O, and f is decreasing, and f'(O) = 0. Prove that
    f(x) = 0 for some x > 0 (so that in reasonable cases f will have an inflec-
    tion point at x—an example is given by f(x) = 1/(1 +x²)). Every hypothesis
    in this theorem is essential, as shown by f(x) = 1 — x⁷, which is not positive
    for all x; by f(x) = x², which is not decreasing; and by f(x) = 1/(x + 1),
    which does not satisfy f'(0) = 0. Hint: Choose x9 > O with f'(x9) < 0. We
    cannot have f'(y) < f'(xo) for all y > x9. Why not? So f(x) > f'(xo) for
    some x1 > x9. Consider f' on [0, x1].

    We now have at our disposal quite powerful methods for investigating functions;
    what we lack is an adequate supply of functions to which these methods may
    be applied. We have studied various ways of forming new functions from old—
    addition, multiplication, division, and composition—but using these alone, we can
    produce only the rational functions (even the sine function, although frequently
    used for examples, has never been defined). In the next few chapters we will
    begin to construct new functions in quite sophisticated ways, but there is one
    important method which will practically double the usefulness of any other method
    we discover.

    If we recall that a function is a collection of pairs of numbers, we might hit upon
    the bright idea of simply reversing all the pairs. Thus from the function

    f ={(1, 2), (3,4), (6, 9), (13, 8) },

    we obtain

    While f(1) = 2 and f(3) = 4, we have g(2) = 1 and g(4) =3.
    Unfortunately, this bright idea does not always work. If

    f ={(1, 2), (3,4), (3,9), (13, 4) },

    then the collection

    { (2, 1), (4, 3), (9, 5), (4, 13)}

    is not a function at all, since it contains both (4, 3) and (4, 13). It is clear where
    the trouble is: f(3) = f(13), even though 3 ≠ 13. This is the only sort of thing
    that can go wrong, and it is worthwhile giving a name to the functions for which
    this does not happen.

    A function f is one-one (read "one-to-one") if f(a) ≠ f(b) whenever a ≠ b.

    The identity function I is obviously one-one, and so is the following modification:

    x, x ≠ 3,5
    g(x) = { 3, x =5
    5, x=3.

    The function f(x) = x² is not one-one, since f(—1) = f(1), but if we define
    g(x) = x³, x >0

    (and leave g undefined for x < 0), then g is one-one, because g is increasing (since
    g'(x) = 2x > 0, for x > 0). This observation is easily generalized: If n is a natural
    number and

    f(x) =x", x >0,
    then f is one-one. If n is odd, one can do better: the function
    f(x) = x" for all x

    is one-one (since f'(x) =nx"—! > 0, for all x 4 0).

    It is particularly easy to decide from the graph of f whether f is one-one: the
    condition f(a) # f(b) for a 4 b means that no horizontal line intersects the graph
    of f twice (Figure 1).

    If we reverse all the pairs in (a not necessarily one-one function) f we obtain, in
    any case, some collection of pairs. It is popular to abstain from this procedure un-
    less f is one-one, but there is no particular reason to do so—instead of a definition
    with restrictive conditions we obtain a definition and a theorem.

    For any function f, the inverse of f, denoted by f~}, is the set of all pairs
    (a,b) for which the pair (b, a) is in f.

    f—' is a function if and only if f is one-one.

    Suppose first that f is one-one. Let (a, b) and (a,c) be two pairs in f~'. Then
    (b,a) and (c,a) are in f, soa = f(b) and a = f(c); since f 1s one-one this
    implies that b = c. Thus f~! is a function.

    Conversely, suppose that f~! is a function. If f(b) = f(c), then f contains
    the pairs (b, f(b)) and (c, f(c)) = (c, f(b)), so (f(b), b) and (f(b), c) are in fo!.

    Reflecting through the diagonal twice will clearly leave us right back where we started; this means that (f~!)~! = f, which is also clear from the definition. In conjunction with Theorem |, this equation has a significant consequence: if f is a one-one function, then the function f~! is also one-one (since (f~!)~! is a function).

    There are a few other simple manipulations with inverse functions of which you should be aware. Since (a, b) is in f precisely when (5, a) 1s in f —l it follows that

    b= f(a) means the same as a= f7'(b).

    Thus f~!(b) is the (unique) number a such that f(a) = b; for example, if f(x) = x?, then f~!(b) is the unique number a such that a' = b, and this number is, by definition, Vb.

    The fact that f~!(x) is the number y such that f(y) = x can be restated in a much more compact form:

    ff '@)) =x, for all x in the domain of f7!.

    Moreover,

    f '(f(x)) = X, for all x in the domain of f;

    this follows from the previous equation upon replacing f by f~!. These two important equations can be written

    fofl=l,
    fllofsl

    (except that the right side will have a bigger domain if the domain of f or f7! is not all of R).

    THEOREM 2

    PROOF

    Since many standard functions will be defined as the inverses of other functions,
    it is quite important that we be able to tell which functions are one-one. We have
    already hinted which class of functions are most easily dealt with—increasing and
    decreasing functions are obviously one-one. Moreover, if f is increasing, then f~!
    is also increasing, and if f is decreasing, then f~! is decreasing (the proof is left
    to you). In addition, f is increasing if and only if —f is decreasing, a very useful
    fact to remember.

    It is certainly not true that every one-one function is either increasing or decreas-
    ing. One example has already been mentioned, and is now graphed in Figure 6:

    x, x #3,5
    g(x)= 43, x=5
    5, x=3.

    Figure 7 shows that there are even continuous one-one functions which are neither
    increasing nor decreasing. But if you try drawing a few pictures you will soon
    suspect that every one-one continuous function defined on an interval is either
    increasing or decreasing.

    If f is continuous and one-one on an interval, then f 1s either increasing or
    decreasing on that interval.

    The proof proceeds in three easy steps:

    (1) If a < b <c are three points in the interval, then

    either (1) f(a) < f(b) < fc)
    or ii) fla) > f(b) > flo).

    Suppose, for example, that f(a) < f(c). If we had f(b) < f(a) (Figure 8), then
    the Intermediate Value Theorem applied to the interval [b, c] would give an x with

    Similarly, f(b) > f(c) would lead to a contradiction, so f(a) < f(b) < f(c).

    Naturally, the same sort of argument works for the case f(a) > f(c).

    (2) If a < b <c <d are four points in the interval, then

    (3) 'Take any a < b in the interval, and suppose that f(a) < f(b). Then f is increasing: For if c and d are any two points, we can apply (2) to the collection {a, b, c, d} (after arranging them in increasing order).'

    Henceforth we shall be concerned almost exclusively with continuous increasing or decreasing functions which are defined on an interval. If f is such a function, it is possible to say quite precisely what the domain of f! will be like.

    Suppose first that f is a continuous increasing function on the closed interval [a, b]. Then, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, f takes on every value between f(a) and f(b). Therefore, the domain of f! is the closed interval [f(a), f(b)].
    Similarly, if f is continuous and decreasing on [a, b], then the domain of f! is [f(b), f(a)].

    If f is a continuous increasing function on an open interval (a, b) the analysis becomes a bit more difficult. To begin with, let us choose some point c in (a, b). We will first decide which values > f(c) are taken on by f. One possibility is that f takes on arbitrarily large values (Figure 9). In this case f takes on all values > f(c), by the Intermediate Value Theorem. If, on the other hand, f does not take on arbitrarily large values, then A = {f(x): c < x < b} is bounded above, so A has a least upper bound α (Figure 10). Now suppose y is any number with f(c) < y < α. Then f takes on some value f(x) > y (because α is the least upper bound of A). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, f actually takes on the value y. Notice that f cannot take on the value α itself; for if α = f(x) for a < x < b and we choose t with x < t < b, then f(t) > α, which is impossible.

    Precisely the same arguments work for values less than f(c): either f takes on all values less than f(c) or there is a number f < f(c) such that f takes on all values between B and f(c), but not B itself.

    This entire argument can be repeated if f is decreasing, and if the domain of f is R or (a,c) or (—oo, a). Summarizing: if f is a continuous increasing, or decreasing, function whose domain is an interval having one of the forms (a, b), (—oo, b), (a, oo), or R, then the domain of f^{-1} is also an interval which has one of these four forms, and we can easily fit the remaining types of intervals, (a, b], [a,b], (—oo, b], and [a, oo), into this discussion also.

    Now that we have completed this preliminary analysis of continuous one-one functions, it is possible to begin asking which important properties of a one-one function are inherited by its inverse. For continuity there is no problem.

    If f is continuous and one-one on an interval, then f^{-1} is also continuous.

    We know by Theorem 2 that f is either increasing or decreasing. We might as well assume that f is increasing, since we can then take care of the other case by applying the usual trick of considering —f. We might as well assume our interval is open, since it is easy to see that a continuous increasing or decreasing function on any interval can be extended to one on a larger open interval.

    We must show that

    $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f^{-1}(x) = f^{-1}(a)
    $$

    for each b in the domain of f^{-1}. Such a number b is of the form f(a) for some a in the domain of f. For any ε > 0, we want to find a δ > 0 such that, for all x,

    if f(a) - δ < x < f(a) + δ, then a - ε < f^{-1}(x) < a + ε.

    (a, f(a)). If this entire picture is reflected through the diagonal, it shows the graph

    AFT)
    Unfortunately, this is not a proof that f~! is differentiable, since the Chain Rule
    cannot be applied unless f—! is already known to be differentiable. But this argu-

    ment does show what (f~!)/(x) will have to be if f7! is differentiable, and it can
    also be used to obtain some important preliminary information.

    (f-')'(x) =

    If f is a continuous one-one function defined on an interval and f'(f~!(a)) = 0,
    then f~! is not differentiable at a.

    We have
    f(f-' (x) =x.

    If f—! were differentiable at a, the Chain Rule would imply that
    f'(f-'@)(f'Y@ = 1,

    hence
    0-(f-'Y(@) =1,
    which is absurd. J

    A simple example to which Theorem 4 applies is the function f(x) = x°. Since
    f'(0) =0 and 0 = f~!(0), the function f~! is not differentiable at 0 (Figure 13).

    Having decided where an inverse function cannot be differentiable, we are now
    ready for the rigorous proof that in all other cases the derivative is given by the
    formula which we have already "derived" in two different ways. Notice that the
    following argument uses continuity of f—!, which we have already proved.

    Let f be a continuous one-one function defined on an interval, and suppose that
    f is differentiable at f—!(b), with derivative f'(f~'(b)) 40. Then f7! is differ-

    entiable at b, and

    Now every number b + A in the domain of f~! can be written in the form
    b+h= f(at+k)

    for a unique k (we should really write k(h), but we will stick with k for simplicity).

    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-a}{h}
    $$

    $$
    \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(a+k)-a}{k}
    $$

    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
    $$

    We are clearly on the right track! It is not hard to get an explicit expression for $k$;

    since

    $$
    b+h = f(a+k)
    $$

    we have

    $$
    f(b+h) = a + k
    $$

    or

    $$
    k = f(b+h) - f(a)
    $$

    Now by Theorem 3, the function $f^{-1}$ is continuous at $b$. This means that $k$
    approaches 0 as $h$ approaches 0. Since

    $$
    \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(a+k)-f(a)}{k}
    = f'(a)
    $$

    this implies that

    $$
    (f^{-1})'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(b))}
    $$

    The work we have done on inverse functions will be amply repaid later, but here
    is an immediate dividend. For $n$ odd, let

    $$
    f_n(x) = x^n \text{ for all } x;
    $$

    for $n$ even, let

    $$
    f_n(x) = x^n, \quad x > 0.
    $$

    Then $f$ is a continuous one-one function, whose inverse function is

    $$
    B_n(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^{1/n}
    $$

    $$
    \frac{d}{dx} B_n(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{1}{2} x^{(n-1)/n}
    $$

    Thus, if $f(x) = x^n$, and $a$ is an integer or the reciprocal of a natural number, then

    $$
    f'(x) = ax^{n-1}
    $$

    It is now easy to check that this formula is true if $a$ is any rational
    number: Let $a = \frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ is an integer, and $n$ is a natural number; if

    $$
    f(x) = x^{m/n}
    $$

    then, by the Chain Rule,

    $$
    \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m/n)-1}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m - n)/n}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m/n)-1}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m - n)/n}

    Although we now have a formula for f'(x) when f(x) = x^a and a is rational, the treatment of the function f(x) = x^a for irrational a will have to be saved for later—at the moment we do not even know the meaning of a symbol like x^√2. Actually, inverse functions will be involved crucially in the definition of x^a for irrational a. Indeed, in the next few chapters several important functions will be defined in terms of their inverse functions.

     equation y>+y+x = 0. The situation for this equation is quite special, however. As
    the next problem shows, an equation does not usually define a function implicitly
    on the whole line, and in some regions more than one function may be defined

    implicitly.

    In general, determining on what intervals a differentiable function is defined im-
    plicitly by a particular equation may be a delicate affair, and is best discussed in the
    context of advanced calculus. If we assume that f is such a differentiable solution,
    however, then a formula for f'(x) can be derived, exactly as in Problem 14(c), by

    APPENDIX. PARAMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF CURVES

    The material in this chapter serves to emphasize something that we noticed a long time ago—a perfectly nice looking curve need not be the graph of a function (Figure 1). In other words, we may not be able to describe it as the set of all points (x, f(x)). Of course, we might be able to describe the curve as the set of all points (f(x), x); for example, the curve in Figure | 1s the set of all points (x*,x). But even this trick doesn't work in most cases. It won't allow us to describe the circle, consisting of all points (x, y) with x* + y* = 1, or an ellipse, and it can't be used to describe a curve like the one in Figure 2.

- prompt: "The simplest way of describing curves in the plane in general harks back to the  \nphysical conception of a curve as the path of a particle moving in the plane. At  \neach time t, the particle is at a certain point, which has two coordinates; to indicate  \nthe dependence of these coordinates on the time t, we can call them u(t) and v(t).  \nThus, we end up with two functions. Conversely, given two functions u and v, we  \ncan consider the curve consisting of all points (u(t), v(t)). This curve is said to  \nbe represented parametrically by u and v, and the pair of functions u, v is called a  \nparametric representation of the curve. The curve represented parametrically by  \nu and v thus consists of all pairs (x, y) with x = u(t) and y = v(t). It is often  \ndescribed briefly as \"the curve x = u(t), y = v(t).\" Notice that the graph of a  \nfunction f can always be described parametrically, as the curve x = t, y = f(t).\n\nInstead of considering a curve in the plane as defined by two functions, we  \ncan obtain a conceptually simpler picture if we broaden our original definition of  \nfunction somewhat. Instead of considering a rule which associates a number with  \nanother number, we can consider a \"function c from real numbers to the plane,\"  \ni.e., a rule c that associates, to each number t, a point in the plane, which we can  \ndenote by c(t). With this notion, a curve is just a function from some interval of  \nreal numbers to the plane.\n\nOf course, these two different descriptions of a curve are essentially the same:  \nA pair of (ordinary) functions u and v determines a single function c from the real  \nnumbers to the plane by the rule\n\nc(t) = (u(t), v(t)),\n\nand, conversely, given a function c from the real numbers to the plane, each c(t)  \nis a point in the plane, so it is a pair of numbers, which we can call u(t) and v(t),  \nso that we have unique functions u and v satisfying this equation.\n\nThe text is from Calculus by Michael Spivak."

    In Appendix | to Chapter 4, we used the term "vector" to describe a point in
    the plane. In conformity with this usage, a curve in the plane may also be called
    a "vector-valued function." The conventions of that Appendix would lead us to
    write c(t) = (c(t), c2(t)), but in this Appendix we'll continue to use notation like
    c(t) = (u(t), v(t)) to minimize the use of subscripts.

    A simple example of a vector-valued function that is quite useful is

    e(t) = (cost, sin fF),

    which goes round and round the unit circle (Figure 3).

    For two (ordinary) functions f and g, we defined new functions f +g and f-g
    by the rules

    (1) (f + g8)(x) = f(x) + g(x),
    (2) (f - g)(x) = f(x): g(x).

    Since we have defined a way of adding vectors, we can imitate the first of these def-
    initions for vector-valued functions c and d: we define the vector-valued function
    c+d by

    (c+d)(t)=c(t)+d(t),

    where the + on the right-hand side is now the sum of vectors. ‘This simply amounts
    to saying that if

    Recall that we have also defined a - v for a number a and a vector v. To

    Notice that the curve $ a -e $,
    $$
    (a -e)(t) = (a(t) \cos t, a(t) \sin f),
    $$
    is already quite general (Figure 4). In the notation of Appendix 3 to Chapter 4,
    the point $ (a -e)(t) $ has polar coordinates $ a(t) $ and $ \theta(t) $, so that $ (a -e)(t) $ is the "graph of $ \alpha $ in polar coordinates."

    Even more generally, given any vector-valued function $ c $, we can define new
    functions $ r $ and $ \theta $ by

    $$
    c(t) = r(t) - e(\alpha(t)),
    $$

    where $ r(t) $ is just the distance from the origin to $ c(t) $, and $ \alpha(t) $ is some choice of
    the angle of $ c(t) $ (as usual, the function $ \alpha $ isn't defined unambiguously, so one has
    to be careful when using this way of writing an arbitrary curve $ c $).

    We aren't in a position to extend (2) to vector-valued functions in general, since

    Beyond imitating simple arithmetic operations on functions, we can consider

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:

    ---

    $$ c(t) = \left( u(Z), v(t) \right) $$

    We can define $ c' $ by the straightforward definition:

    $$
    c'(a) = \left( u'(a), v'(a) \right).
    $$

    We could also try to imitate the basic definition:

    $$
    c'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c(a + h) - c(a)}{h}
    $$

    where the fraction on the right-hand side is understood to mean:

    $$
    \frac{1}{h} [c(a + h) - c(a)].
    $$

    As a matter of fact, these two definitions are equivalent, because:

    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c(a + h) - c(a)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{u(a + h) - u(a)}{h} + \frac{v(a + h) - v(a)}{h}.
    $$

    By our definition (*) of limits:

    $$
    = \left( u'(a), v'(a) \right).
    $$

    Figure 5 shows $ c(a + h) $ and $ c(a) $, as well as the arrow from $ c(a) $ to $ c(a + h) $; as we showed in Appendix I to Chapter 4, this arrow is $ c(a + h) - c(a) $, except moved over so that it starts at $ c(a) $. As $ h \to 0 $, this arrow would appear to move closer and closer to the tangent of our curve, so it seems reasonable to define the tangent line of $ c $ at $ c(a) $ to be the straight line along $ c'(a) $, when $ c'(a) $ is moved over so that it starts at $ c(a) $. In other words, we define the tangent line of $ c $ at $ c(a) $ as the set of all points

    $$
    c(a) + s \cdot c'(a);
    $$

    for $ s = 0 $ we get the point $ c(a) $ itself, for $ s = 1 $ we get $ c(a) + c'(a) $, etc. (Note, however, that this definition does not make sense when $ c'(a) = (0, 0) $.)

    Problem 1 shows that this definition agrees with the old one when our curve $ c $ is defined by

    $$
    c(t) = (t, f(t)),
    $$

    so that we simply have the graph of $ f $.

    (c + d)'(a) = c'(a) + d(a),
    (α - c)'(a) = a'(a) - c(a) + α(a) - c'(a),
    or, as equations involving functions,
    (c + d)' = c' + d',
    (α - c)' = α' - c'.

    These formulas can be derived immediately from the definition in terms of the
    component functions. They can also be derived from the definition as a limit,
    by imitating previous proofs; for the second, we would of course use the standard
    trick of writing

    a(a + h)c(a + h) - a(a)c(a) =
    a(a + h) - [c(a + h) - c(a)] + [a(a + h) - a(a)] - c(a).

    We can also consider the function
    d(t) = c(p(t)) = (c ◦ p)(t),

    where p is now an ordinary function, from numbers to numbers. The new curve d
    passes through the same points as c, except at different times; thus p corresponds
    to a "reparameterization" of c. For

    c = (u, v),
    d = (u ◦ p, v ◦ p),

    we obtain
    d'(a) = ((u ◦ p)'(a), (v ◦ p)'(a))
    = (p'(a)u'(p(a)), p'(a)v'(p(a)))
    = p'(a)(u'(p(a)), v'(p(a)))
    = p'(a) - c'(p(a)),
    or simply

    d' = p' ◦ c'.

    Notice that if p(a) = a, so that d and c actually pass through the same point at
    time a, then d'(a) = p'(a) - c'(a), so that the tangent vector d'(a) is just a multiple
    of c'(a). This means that the tangent line to c at c(a) is the same as the tangent
    line to the reparameterized curve d at d(a) = c(a). The one exception occurs

- prompt: |-
    When p'(a) = O, since the tangent line for d is then undefined, even though the
    tangent line for c may be defined. For example, d(t) = c(t?) won't have a tangent
    line defined at t = 0, even though it's merely a reparameterization of c.

    Finally, since we can define real-valued functions

    (c-d)(t) =c(t)-d(t),
    det(c, d)(t) = det(c(t), d(t)),

    we ought to have formulas for the derivatives of these new functions. As you might
    guess, the proper formulas are

    (c-d)'(a) =c(a)-d'(a) + c'(a) + d(a),
    [det(c, d)]‘(a) = det(c', d)(a) + det(c, d')(a).

    These can be derived by straightforward calculations from the definitions in terms
    of the component functions. But it is more elegant to imitate the proof of the or-
    dinary product rule, using the simple formulas in Problems 2 and 4 of Appendix 1
    to Chapter 4, and, of course, the "standard trick" referred to above.

    The next problem uses the material from Chapter 15, in particular, radian measure, and the inverse trigonometric functions and their properties.

    8. A cycloid is defined as the path traced out by a point on the rim of a rolling wheel of radius $ a $. You can see a beautiful cycloid by pasting a reflector on the edge of a bicycle wheel and having a friend ride slowly in front of the headlights of your car at night. Lacking a car, bicycle, or trusting friend, you can settle instead for Figure 9.

    (a) Let $ u(t) $ and $ v(t) $ be the coordinates of the point on the rim after the wheel has rotated through an angle of $ t $ (radians). This means that the arc of the wheel rim from P to Q in Figure 10 has length $ at $. Since the wheel is rolling, $ at $ is also the distance from O to Q. Show that we have the parametric representation of the cycloid

    $$ u(t) = a(t - \sin t) $$
    $$ v(t) = a(1 - \cos t) $$.

    Figure 11 shows the curves we obtain if the distance from the point to the center of the wheel is (a) less than the radius or (b) greater than the radius. In the latter case, the curve is not the graph of a function; at certain times the point is moving backwards, even though the wheel is moving forwards!

    (b)

    In Figure 9 we drew the cycloid as the graph of a function, but we really need to check that this is the case:

    (b) Compute $ u'(t) $ and conclude that $ u $ is increasing. Problem 3 then shows that the cycloid is the graph of $ f = v/u $, and allows us to compute

    $ f(t) $.

    (c) Show that the tangent lines of the cycloid at the "vertices" are vertical.

    It isn't possible to get an explicit formula for $ f $, but we can come close.

    Let $ u $ and $ v $ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$; then $ u $ and $ v $ give a parametric representation of a curve from $ P = (u(a), v(a)) $ to $ Q = (u(b), v(b)) $. Geometrically, it seems clear (Figure 12) that at some point on the curve the tangent line is parallel to the line segment from $ P $ to $ Q $. Prove this analytically. Hint: This problem will give a geometric interpretation for one of the theorems in Chapter 11. You will also need to assume that we don't have $ u'(x) = v'(x) = 0 $ for any $ x $ in $(a,b)$ (compare Problem 2).

    The following definition of a limit for a vector-valued function is the direct analogue of the definition for ordinary functions:

    $$
    \lim_{t \to a} c(t) = \mathbf{L}
    $$

    means that for every $ \epsilon > 0 $ there is some $ \delta > 0 $ such that, for all $ t $, if $ 0 < |t - a| < \delta $, then $ ||c(t) - \mathbf{L}|| < \epsilon $.

    Here $ ||\cdot|| $ is the norm, defined in Problem 2 of Appendix 1 to Chapter 4. If $ \mathbf{L} = (L_1, L_2) $, then

    $$
    c(t) - \mathbf{L} = (u(t) - L_1, v(t) - L_2).

    and show that if $ \lim_{t \to a} c(t) = \mathbf{L} $ according to the above definition, then we also have
    $$
    \lim_{t \to a} u(t) = L_1, \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{t \to a} v(t) = L_2,

    The derivative does not display its full strength until allied with the "integral," the
    second main concept of Part III. At first this topic may seem to be a complete
    digression—in this chapter derivatives do not appear even once! The study of
    integrals does require a long preparation, but once this preliminary work has been
    completed, integrals will be an invaluable tool for creating new functions, and the
    derivative will reappear in Chapter 14, more powerful than ever.

    Although ultimately to be defined in a quite complicated way, the integral for-
    malizes a simple, intuitive concept—that of area. By now it should come as
    no surprise to learn that the definition of an intuitive concept can present great
    difficulties—"area" is certainly no exception.

    In elementary geometry, formulas are derived for the areas of many plane fig-
    ures, but a little reflection shows that an acceptable definition of area is seldom
    given. The area of a region is sometimes defined as the number of squares, with
    sides of length 1, which fit in the region. But this definition is hopelessly inadequate
    for any but the simplest regions. For example, a circle of radius 1 supposedly has
    an area the irrational number π, but it is not at all clear what "π squares" means.
    Even if we consider a circle of radius √(1/2), which supposedly has area 1, it is hard
    to say in what way a unit square fits in this circle, since it does not seem possible
    to divide the unit square into pieces which can be arranged to form a circle.

    In this chapter we will only try to define the area of some very special regions
    (Figure 1)—those which are bounded by the horizontal axis, the vertical lines
    through (a,0) and (b,0), and the graph of a function f such that f(x) > 0
    for all x in [a, b]. It is convenient to indicate this region by R(f, a, b). Notice that
    these regions include rectangles and triangles, as well as many other important
    geometric figures.

    The number which we will eventually assign as the area of R(f, a,b) will be
    called the integral of f on [a,b]. Actually, the integral will be defined even for
    functions f which do not satisfy the condition f(x) > 0 for all x in [a,b]. If f is
    the function graphed in Figure 2, the integral will represent the difference of the
    area of the lightly shaded region and the area of the heavily shaded region (the
    "algebraic area" of R(f,a, b)).

    The idea behind the prospective definition is indicated in Figure 3. The interval
    [a, b] has been divided into four subintervals

    [fo, t1], [t1, t2], [t2, t3], [t3, t4]
    by means of numbers fo, f1, t2, t3, t4 with
    a = t0 < t1 < t2 < t3 < t4 = b

    (the numbering of the subscripts begins with 0 so that the largest subscript will
    equal the number of subintervals).

    DEFINITION

    On the first interval [t0, t1] the function f has the minimum value m1, and the
    maximum value M1; similarly, on the second interval [t1, t2] let the minimum value
    of f be m2 and let the maximum value be M2; on the third interval [t2, t3] let the minimum value
    of f be m3 and let the maximum value be M3; on the fourth interval [t3, t4] let the minimum value
    of f be m4 and let the maximum value be M4. The sum

    s = m1(t1 - t0) + m2(t2 - t1) + m3(t3 - t2) + m4(t4 - t3)

    represents the total area of rectangles lying inside the region R(f, a,b), while the
    sum

    S = M1(t1 - t0) + M2(t2 - t1) + M3(t3 - t2) + M4(t4 - t3)

    represents the total area of rectangles lying outside the region R(f, a,b).

    represents the total area of rectangles containing the region R(f, a,b). The guiding principle of our attempt to define the area A of R(f,a, b) is the observation that A should satisfy

    s < A and A < S,

    and that this should be true, no matter how the interval {a, b} is subdiided. It is to be hoped that these requirements will determine A. The following definitions begin to formalize, and eliminate some of the implicit assumptions in, this discussion.

    Let a < b. A partition of the interval [a, b] is a finite collection of points in
    [a, b], one of which is a, and one of which is b.

    The points in a partition can be numbered t1, ..., tn, so that
    a = t0 < t1 < ... < tn = b;

    we shall always assume that such a numbering has been assigned.

    Suppose f is bounded on [a, b] and P = {t0, ..., tn} is a partition of [a, b]. Let

    m_i = inf{ f(x): t_{i-1} < x < t_i},
    M_i = sup{ f(x) : t_{i-1} < x < t_i}.

    The lower sum of f for P, denoted by L(f, P), is defined as
    L(f, P) = Σ m_i (t_i - t_{i-1}).
    i=1
    The upper sum of f for P, denoted by U(f, P), is defined as

    U(f, P) = Σ M_i (t_i - t_{i-1}).
    i=1

    The lower and upper sums correspond to the sums s and S in the previous
    example; they are supposed to represent the total areas of rectangles lying below
    and above the graph of f. Notice, however, that despite the geometric motivation,
    these sums have been defined precisely without any appeal to a concept of "area."

    PROOF

    13. Integrals 257

    There is a partition P which contains both P; and P) (let P consist of all points
    in both P; and P). According to the lemma,

    L(f, P\) < L(f, P) < U(f, P) < U(f. Po). §

    It follows from Theorem | that any upper sum U(f, P') 1s an upper bound for
    the set of all lower sums L(f, P). Consequently, any upper sum U(f, P') is greater
    than or equal to the least upper bound of all lower sums:

    sup{L(f, P) : P a partition of [a, b]} < UCf, P'),

    for every P'. ‘This, in turn, means that sup{L(f, P)} is a lower bound for the set
    of all upper sums of f. Consequently,

    sup{L(f, P)} < inf {U(f, P)}.

    It is clear that both of these numbers are between the lower sum and upper sum
    of f for all partitions:

    L(f, P') < sup{L(f, P)} < UC, P'),
    L(f, P') <mf{U(f, P)} < Uf, P'),

    for all partitions P'.
    It may well happen that

    sup{L(f, P)} = inf {U(f, P};

    in this case, this is the only number between the lower sum and upper sum of f
    for all partitions, and this number is consequently an ideal candidate for the area

    DEFINITION

    In this case, all lower sums and upper sums are equal, and
    sup{L(f, P)} = inf {U(f, P)} =c(b —a).

    Now consider (Figure 7) the function f defined by

    0, if x is irrational
    f(x) = 1, if x is rational.
    If P = {t0,...,tn} is any partition, then

    mi = 0, since there is an irrational number in [ti-1, ti],
    and
    M; = 1, since there is a rational number in [ti-1, ti].

    Therefore,

    L(f, P) = Σ 0*(ti — ti-1) = 0,
    i=1

    U(f,P) = Σ 1*(ti — ti-1) = b-a.

- prompt: |-
    Thus, in this case it is certainly not true that sup{L(f, P)} = inf {U(f, P)}. The
    principle upon which the definition of area was to be based provides insufficient
    information to determine a specific area for R(f, a, b)—any number between 0
    and b — a seems equally good. On the other hand, the region R(f, a, b) is so
    weird that we might with justice refuse to assign it any area at all. In fact, we can
    maintain, more generally, that whenever

    sup{L(f, P)} ≠ inf {U(f, P)},

    the region R(f,a,b) is too unreasonable to deserve having an area. As our ap-
    peal to the word "unreasonable" suggests, we are about to cloak our ignorance in
    terminology.

    A function f which is bounded on [a, b] is integrable on [a, b] if
    sup{L(f, P) : P a partition of [a, b]} = inf{U(f, P) : P a partition of [a, b]}.

    In this case, this common number is called the integral of f on [a,b] and is

    denoted by
    b
    ∫
    +
    (The symbol ∫ is called an integral sign and was originally an elongated s, for
    "sum;" the numbers a and b are called the lower and upper limits of integration.)
    The integral ∫ f is also called the area of R(f,a,b) when f(x) > 0 for all x
    in [a, b].

    THEOREM 2

    PROOF

    13. Integrals 259

    If f is integrable, then according to this definition,
    b
    L(f, P) < ∫ f < U(f, P) for all partitions P of [a, b].

    Moreover, ∫ f is the unique number with this property.

    This definition merely pinpoints, and does not solve, the problem discussed
    before: we do not know which functions are integrable (nor do we know how to
    find the integral of f on [a,b] when f is integrable). At present we know only
    two examples:

    The computations of ∫ f(x) dx and ∫ g(x) dx may suggest that evaluating integrals is generally difficult or impossible. As a matter of fact, the integrals of most functions are impossible to determine exactly (although they may be computed to any degree of accuracy desired by calculating lower and upper sums). Nevertheless, as we shall see in the next chapter, the integral of many functions can be computed very easily.

    Even though most integrals cannot be computed exactly, it is important at least to know when a function f is integrable on [a,b]. Although it is possible to say precisely which functions are integrable, the criterion for integrability is a little too difficult to be stated here, and we will have to settle for partial results. The next Theorem gives the most useful result, but the proof given here uses material from the Appendix to Chapter 8. If you prefer, you can wait until the end of the next chapter, when a totally different proof will be given.

    * Lest chaos overtake the reader when consulting other books, equation (1) requires an important qualification. This equation interprets ∫[a,b] f(x) dx to mean the integral of the function f such that each value f(x) is the number y. But classical notation often uses y for y(x), so ∫[a,b] y dx might mean the integral of some arbitrary function y.

    THEOREM 3

    PROOF

    If f is continuous on [a,b], then f is integrable on [a, b].

    Notice, first, that f is bounded on [a, b], because it is continuous on [a, b]. To prove that f is integrable on [a, b], we want to use Theorem 2, and show that for every ε > 0 there is a partition P of [a, b] such that

    U(f, P) − L(f, P) < ε.

    Now we know, by Theorem 1 of the Appendix to Chapter 8, that f is uniformly continuous on [a,b]. So there is some δ > 0 such that for all x and y in [a, b], if |x − y| < δ, then |f(x) − f(y)| < ε.

    Although this theorem will provide all the information necessary for the use of
    integrals in this book, it 1s more satisfying to have a somewhat larger supply of
    integrable functions. Several problems treat this question in detail. It wul help to
    know the following three theorems, which show that f is integrable on [a, b], if it
    is integrable on [a,c] and [c, b]; that f + g 1s integrable if f and g are; and that
    c- f is integrable if f is integrable and c 1s any number.

    As a simple application of these theorems, recall that if f 1s O except at one
    point, where its value is 1, then f is integrable. Multiplying this function by c, it
    follows that the same is true if the value of f at the exceptional point 1s c. Adding
    such a function to an integrable function, we see that the value of an integrable
    function may be changed arbitrarily at one point without destroying integrability.
    By breaking up the interval into many subintervals, we see that the value can be
    changed at finitely many points.

    The proofs of these theorems usually use the alternative criterion for integrability
    in [heorem 2; as some of our previous demonstrations illustrate, the details of the

    L(f, P) + L(g, P) < L(f + g, P) < U(f + g, P) < U(f, P) + U(g, P).

    If P contains both P' and P", then
    U(f, P) + U(g, P) - [L(f, P) + L(g, P)] < ε,

    and consequently
    U(f + g, P) - L(f + g, P) < ε.

    Since U(f, P) - L(f, P) and U(g, P) - L(g, P) can both be made as small as
    desired, it follows that

    U(f, P) + U(g, P) - [L(f, P) + L(g, P)]

    (Theorem 6 is just a special case of the more general theorem that f - g is integrable on [a,b], if f and g are, but this result is quite hard to prove (see Problem 38).)

    In this chapter we have acquired only one complicated definition, a few simple theorems with intricate proofs, and one theorem which required material from the Appendix to Chapter 8. This is not because integrals constitute a more difficult topic than derivatives, but because powerful tools developed in previous chapters have been allowed to remain dormant. The most significant discovery of calculus is the fact that the integral and the derivative are intimately related—once we learn the connection, the integral will become as useful as the derivative, and as easy to use. The connection between derivatives and integrals deserves a separate chapter, but the preparations which we will make in this chapter may serve as a hint. We first state a simple inequality concerning integrals, which plays a role in many important theorems.

    m < f(x) <M forall x in [a, b].
    Then
    b
    m(b—a) < | f < M(b—-a).

    It is clear that
    m(b—a)<L(f,P) and U(f, P) < M(b—a)

    for every partition P. Since is f = sup{L(f, P)} = nf {UCf, P)}, the desired
    inequality follows immediately. §
    Suppose now that f is integrable on [a, b]. We can define a new function f on

    [a, 5} by
    Fi = | =f f(t) dt.
    (This depends on Theorem 4.) We have seen that f may be integrable even if it

    is not continuous, and the Problems give examples of integrable functions which
    are quite pathological. ‘The behavior of F is therefore a very pleasant surprise.

    Suppose $ c \in [a,b] $. Since $ f $ is integrable on $[a, b]$ it is, by definition, bounded on $[a, b]$; let $ M $ be a number such that

    $$
    |f(x)| < M \text{ for all } x \in [a, b].
    $$

    If $ h > 0 $, then (Figure 13)

    $$
    F(c + h) - F(c) = \int_{c}^{c+h} f(x) dx.
    $$

    Then $ F $ is continuous on $[a, b]$.

    Since

    $$
    -M < f(x) < M \text{ for all } x,
    $$

    it follows from Theorem 7 that

    $$
    \text{cth}
    $$

    $$

    $$

    in other words,

    $$
    (1) -M-h < F(c+h)— F(c) < M -h.
    $$

    If $ h < 0 $, a similar inequality can be derived: Note that

    Applying Theorem 7 to the interval $[c + h, c]$, of length $-h$, we obtain

    $$
    Mh < f < -Mh;
    $$

    $$
    \text{ct+h}
    $$

    multiplying by $-1$, which reverses all the inequalities, we have

    $$
    (2) Mh < F_i(c+h) — F(c) < -Mh.
    $$

    Inequalities (1) and (2) can be combined:

    $$
    |F(c+h)— F(c)| < M|h|.
    $$

    Therefore, if $ \epsilon > 0 $, we have

    $$
    |F(c +h) — F(c)| < \epsilon,
    $$

    provided that $ |h| < \frac{\epsilon}{M} $. This proves that

    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} F(c + h) = F(c);
    $$

    in other words $ F $ is continuous at $ c $. $ \blacksquare $

    Figure 14 compares $ f $ and $ F(x) = \int f $ for various functions $ f $; it appears

    that $ F $ is always better behaved than $ f $. In the next chapter we will see how true
    this is.

    Prove, similarly, that ∫ₓ⁴ dx = b⁵/(p + 1).

    a) Using Problem 2-7, show that the sum ∑ k⁴/n⁵ can be made as close to 1/(p + 1) as desired, by choosing n large enough.

    (b) Prove that ∫ₓ⁴ dx = b⁵/(p + 1).

    This problem outlines a clever way to find ∫ x⁴ dx for 0 < a < b. (The result for a = 0 will then follow by continuity.) The trick is to use partitions P = {t₀, ..., tₙ} for which all ratios r = tᵢ/tᵢ₋₁ are equal, instead of using partitions for which all differences tᵢ - tᵢ₋₁ are equal.

    (a) Show that for such a partition P we have

    tᵢ = a + (b - a) * (i/n) for i = 0, ..., n.

    (b) If f(x) = x⁴, show, using the formula in Problem 2-5, that

    U(f, P) - L(f, P) ≤ (b⁵ - a⁵)/(n(p + 1)).

    Then show that

    U(f, P) - L(f, P) = (b⁵ - a⁵)(1 - (c/p)ⁿ/(p + 1)).

    And find a similar formula for L(f, P).

    LEMMA II

    Tf in any figure Aack, terminated by the right lines Aa, AE, and the curve ack,
    there be inscribed any number of parallelograms Ab, Bc, Cd, &c., comprehended
    under equal bases AB, BC, CD, &c., and the sides, Bb, Cc, Dd, &c., parallel
    to one side Aa of the figure; and the parallelograms Abbl, Bcmm, Cden, &c., are
    completed: then if the breadth of those parallelograms be supposed to be diminished,
    and their number to be augmented in infinitum, I say, that the ultimate ratios
    which the inscribed figure AbblCmDnD, the circumscribed figure AalbmcndoE,
    and curvilinear figure AabcdE, will have to one another, are ratios of equality.

    For the difference of the inscribed and circumscribed figures is the
    sum of the parallelograms Bl, Cm, Dn, Eo, that is (from the equality
    of all their bases), the rectangle under one of their bases Bl and the
    sum of their altitudes Aa, that is, the rectangle ABla. But this rectangle,
    because its breadth AB is supposed diminished in infinitum, becomes less
    than any given space. And therefore (by Lem. 1) the figures inscribed
    and circumscribed become ultimately equal one to another; and much
    more will the intermediate curvilinear figure be ultimately equal to either.

    a
    bases of all the rectangles are narrow enough, then the Riemann sum ought to be
    close to the integral. The following theorem states this precisely.

    Suppose that f is integrable on [a,b]. Then for every ε > 0 there is some δ > 0
    such that, if P = {x0,...,xn} is any partition of [a, b] with all lengths Δxi < δ,
    then

    ∑_{i=1}^n f(x_i)Δx_i ≈ ∫_a^b f(x) dx

    for any Riemann sum formed by choosing x_i in [x_{i-1}, x_i].

    Since the Riemann sum and the integral both lie between L(f, P) and U(f, P),
    this amounts to showing that for any given ε we can make U(f, P) — L(f, P) < ε
    by choosing a δ such that U(f, P) — L(f, P) < ε for any partition with all lengths
    Δx_i < δ.

    The definition of f being integrable on [a, b] includes the condition that |f| < M for some M. First choose some particular partition P* = {x0, ..., xn} for
    which

    U(f, P*)— L(f, P*) < ε/2,

    and then choose a δ such that

    δ < ε/(2M).

    For any partition P with all Δx_i < δ, we can break the sum

    U(f, P) - L(f, P) = ∑_{i=1}^n (M - m_i)(x_i - x_{i-1})

    as

    into two sums. The first involves those i for which the interval [x_{i-1}, x_i] is completely contained within one of the intervals [x_{j-1}, x_j]. This sum is clearly <
    U(f, P*) — L(f, P*) < ε/2. For all other i we will have x_{i-1} < x_j < x_i for some j = 1,..., K — 1, so there are at most K — 1 of them. Consequently, the sum for these terms is < (K —1)·2M·δ < ε/2. J

    lengths t; — t;_; small enough. Hint: Estimate the difference between such a
    sum and a Riemann sum; you will need to use uniform continuity (Chapter
    8, Appendix).

    Notice that in either case, differentiability of F at c is ensured by continuity of f at c alone. Nevertheless, 'Theorem | is most interesting when f is continuous at all points in [a,b]. In this case F is differentiable at all points in [a, b] and

    F' = f.

    In general, it is extremely difficult to decide whether a given function f 1s the derivative of some other function; for this reason Theorem I11-7 and Problems 11-60 and 11-61 are particularly interesting, since they reveal certain properties which f must have. If f 1s continuous, however, there is no problem at all—according to Theorem 1, f zs the derivative of some function, namely the

    function .
    F(x) -|/ f.

    Theorem | has a simple corollary which frequently reduces computations of
    integrals to a triviality.

    If f is continuous on [a,b] and f = g' for some function g, then

    b
    | f = g(b) — g(a).

    Foy = f f.

    Then F' = f = g' on [a, b]. Consequently, there 1s a number c such that

    Let

    The number c can be evaluated easily: note that
    O = F(a) = g(a) +c,

    so c = —g(a); thus
    F(x) = g(x) — g(a).

    This is true, in particular, for x = b. Thus

    b

    The proof of this corollary tends, at first sight, to make the corollary seem useless:
    after all, what good is it to know that

    b
    | f = g(b) — g(a)

    if g is, for example, g(x) = f. f ? The point, of course, is that one might happen
    to know a quite different function g with this property. For example, if
    x?
    g(x) = z and f(x)= x,
    then g'(x) = f(x) so we obtain, without ever computing lower and upper sums:

There are, however, more substantial problems of a logical nature—we have thus far defined the areas of some very special regions only, which do not even include some of the regions whose areas have just been computed! We have simply assumed that area makes sense for these regions, and that certain reasonable properties of \"area\" do hold. These remarks are not meant to suggest that you should regard exercising ingenuity to compute areas as beneath you, but are meant to indicate that a better approach to the definition of area is available, although its proper place is somewhere in advanced calculus. The desire to define area was the motivation, both in this book and historically, for the definition of the integral, but the integral does not really provide the best method of defining areas, although it is frequently the proper tool for computing them.\n\n It may be discouraging to learn that integrals are not suitable for the very purpose for which they were invented, but we will soon see how essential they are for other purposes. The most important use of integrals has already been emphasized: if f is continuous, the integral provides a function y such that\n\n y (x) = f(x).\n\n This equation is the simplest example of a \"differential equation\" (an equation for a function y which involves derivatives of y). The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that this differential equation has a solution, if f is continuous. In succeeding chapters, and in various problems, we will solve more complicated equations, but the solution almost always depends somehow on the integral; in order to solve a differential equation it is necessary to construct a new function, and the integral is one of the best ways of doing this.\n\n Since the differentiable functions provided by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus will play such a prominent role in later work, it is very important to realize that these functions may be combined, like less esoteric functions, to yield still more functions, whose derivatives can be found by the Chain Rule.\n\n Suppose, for example, that\n - |-\n (x) = | at.\n I a | + sin? t\n\n 14.

For this reason, this chapter begins with some informal and intuitive definitions, which should not be scrutinized too carefully, as they shall soon be replaced by the formal definitions which we really intend to use.\n\n In elementary geometry an angle is simply the union of two half-lines with a common initial point (Figure 1).\n\n More useful for trigonometry are \"directed angles,\" which may be regarded as pairs (J), /2) of half-lines with the same initial point, visualized as in Figure 2.\n\n ---\n\n ly\n ly\n ly\n ly\n ly\n ly\n\n FIGURE 1]\n\n ly\n ly\n 4 FIGURE 2\n If for 1; we always choose the positive half of the horizontal axis, a directed angle is described completely by the second half-line (Figure 3).\n ly Since each half-line intersects the unit circle precisely once, a directed angle is described, even more simply, by a point on the unit circle (Figure 4), that is, by a\n FIGURE 3 point (x, y) with x*4+ y* = 1.\n\n 303\n\n 304 Derivatives and Integrals\n\n Z\n\n FIGURE 4\n\n (7)\n\n +\n\n - (x, y)\n\n sin A\n\n FIGURE 5\n\n 180\n\n (|)\n\n cosA\n\n FIGURE 6\n\n (—\n\n 360\n\n The sine and cosine of a directed angle can now be defined as follows (Figure 5):\n a directed angle is determined by a point (x, y) with x* + y? = 1; the sine of the\n angle is defined as y, and the cosine as x.\n - |-\n Despite the aura of precision surrounding the previous paragraph, we are not yet finished with the definitions of sin and cos. Indeed, we have barely begun. What we have defined is the sine and cosine of a directed angle; what we want to define is sinx and cosx for each number x. The usual procedure for doing this depends on associating an angle to every number. The oldest method is to \"measure angles in degrees.\" An angle \"all the way around\" is associated to 360, an angle \"half-way around\" is associated to 180, an angle \"a quarter way around\" to 90, etc. (Figure 6). The angle associated, in this manner, to the number x, is called \"the angle of x degrees.\" 'The angle of 0 degrees is the same as the angle of 360 degrees, and this ambiguity is purposely extended further, so that an angle of 90 degrees is also an angle of 360 + 90 degrees, etc. One can now define a function, which we will denote by sin', as follows:\n\n sin' (x) = sine of the angle of x degrees.\n\n There are two difficulties with this approach. Although it may be clear what we mean by an angle of 90 or 45 degrees, it is not quite clear what an angle of √2 degrees is, for example. Even if this difficulty could be circumvented, it is unlikely that this system, depending as it does on the arbitrary choice of 360, will lead to elegant results—it would be sheer luck if the function sin' had mathematically pleasing properties.\n\n \"Radian measure\" appears to offer a remedy for both these defects. Given any number x, choose a point P on the unit circle such that x is the length of the arc of the circle beginning at (1, 0) and running counterclockwise to P (Figure 7). The directed angle determined by P is called \"the angle of x radians.\" Since the length of the whole circle is 2π, the angle of x radians and the angle of 2π + x radians are identical. A function sin' can now be defined as follows:\n\n sin' (x) = sine of the angle of x radians.\n - |-\n This same method can easily be adopted to define sin\"; since we want to have\n sin' 360 = sin' 27, we can define\n\n _ , 2UX . , Wx\n\n - O r\n sn xX =sm =—,— =-sinNn —_=\n\n 360 180°\n\n We shall soon drop the superscript r in sin', since sin\" (and not sin*) is the only\n function which will interest us; before we do, a few words of warning are advisable.\n The expressions sin® x and sin\" x are sometimes written\n\n sin x°\n sin x radians,\n\n but this notation is quite misleading; a number x is simply a number—it does not\n carry a banner indicating that it is \"in degrees\" or \"in radians.\" If the meaning\n (1, 0)\n\n P\n length x\n\n FIGURE 7\n P\n a length Xx\n 8\n Xx\n ar€a =\n o\n FIGURE 8\n DEFINITION\n f(x) =V1—-x?\n 14\n area —\n 2,\n FIGURE 9\n\n 15.

This entire chapter is devoted to an elementary proof that z is irrational. Like many \"elementary\" proofs of deep theorems, the motivation for many steps in our proof cannot be supplied; nevertheless, it is still quite possible to follow the proof step-by-step.\n\n Two observations must be made before the proof. The first concerns the function\n\n x^n(1—x)^n\n n!\n\n fn (x) = ————\n\n which clearly satisfies\n\n 0 < fn(x) < — for 0 < x < 1.\n n!\n\n An important property of the function fn is revealed by considering the expression obtained by actually multiplying out x^n(1 —x)^n. The lowest power of x appearing will be n and the highest power will be 2n. Thus fn can be written in the form\n\n 2n\n fn(x) = — Σ cix^i\n n! i=n\n\n where the numbers c_i are integers. It is clear from this expression that\n\n fn^(k)(0) = 0 if k < n or k > 2n.\n\n Moreover,\n\n fn^(n)(x) = C_n + terms involving x\n n! \n\n fn^(n+1)(x) = -[(n + 1)!c_{n+1} + terms involving x]\n n!\n\n fn^(2n)(x) = (2n)!c_{2n}.\n\n This means that\n\n fn^(k)(0) = c_n if k = n,\n fn^(k)(0) = (n + 1)!c_{n+1} if k = n + 1,\n\n fn^(k)(0) = (2n)(2n — 1)...(2n - k + 1)c_{2n} if k = 2n,\n\n where the numbers on the right are all integers. Thus fn^(k)(0) is an integer for all k.\n\n The relation\n\n fn(x) = (-1)^n fn(1 - x)\n\n implies that\n fn^(k)(A) is also an integer for all k.\n\n The proof that z is irrational requires one further observation: if a is any positive number, and ε > 0, then for sufficiently large n we will have\n\n a^n < ε,\n n!\n - |-\n To prove this, notice that if n > 2a, then\n\n $$\n \\frac{(n + 1)!}{n!} < \\frac{2^n}{n!}\n $$\n\n Now let $ n $ be any natural number with $ n > 2a $. Then, whatever value\n\n $$\n \\frac{(n + 1)!}{n!}\n $$\n\n may have, the succeeding values satisfy\n\n $$\n \\frac{(n + 1)!}{n!} < \\frac{2^n}{n!}\n $$\n\n $$\n \\frac{(n + 2)!}{(n + 1)!} < \\frac{2^{n+1}}{(n + 1)!}\n $$\n\n $$\n \\frac{(n + k)!}{(n + k - 1)!} < \\frac{2^{n+k}}{(n + k - 1)!}\n $$\n\n If $ k $ is so large that\n\n $$\n \\frac{(n + k)!}{(n + k - 1)!} < \\frac{2^k}{(n + k - 1)!}\n $$\n\n then\n\n $$\n \\frac{(n + k)!}{(n + k - 1)!} < \\frac{2^k}{(n + k - 1)!}\n $$\n\n which is the desired result. Having made these observations, we are ready for the\n one theorem in this chapter.\n\n The number $ \\pi $ is irrational; in fact, $ e $ is irrational. (Notice that the irrationality\n\n of $ e $ implies the irrationality of $ \\pi $, for if $ \\pi $ were rational, then $ e $ certainly would\n\n be.)\n\n Suppose $ \\pi $\n\n $$\n = \\frac{a}{b}\n $$\n\n for some positive integers $ a $ and $ b $. Let\n\n (1) $ G(x) = b^2[2x f(x) - \\pi^2 f'(x) + \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} f''(x)] $\n\n Notice that each of the factors\n\n $$\n n_2^n - 2k __ p_n 2^{n-k} - p_n (4^n - n - k)y^k\n $$\n\n is an integer. Since $ f^{(n)}(0) $ and $ f^{(n)}(1) $ are integers, this shows that\n $ G(0) $ and $ G(1) $ are integers.\n\n Differentiating $ G $ twice yields\n\n $$\n 2) G(x) = b^2[2x f'(x) - \\pi^2 f''(x) + \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} f'''(x)]\n $$\n\n The last term, $ (-1)^n f^{(n)}(x) $, is zero. Thus, adding (1) and (2) gives\n - |-\n (3) G\" (x) + 27G(x) = b'n7\"** f(x) = 17a\" fy(x).\n\n Now let\n H(x) = G'(x)sinax — mG(x)cosxx.\n\n Then\n\n H'(x) = rG'(x) cosax + G(x) sinax — 1G' (x) cosmx +2°G(x) sin rx\n = [G\"(x) +2°G(x)] sinax\n = 7a\" f,(x)sinwx, by (3).\n\n By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,\n\n ]\n x? | a\" f,(x)snawx dx = H(1) — H(Q)\n 0)\n\n = G(1)sinaz — 2G(1)cosx — G'(0) sin0 + 2 G(0) cosO\n = x[G(1) + G(0)).\n\n Thus\n\n l\n It | a\" f,(x)sinawxdx 1s an integer.\n 0\n\n 16. x 1s Irrational 327\n\n On the other hand, 0 < f,(x) < 1/n! for 0 < x < 1, so\n\n n\n\n O < ma\" f,(x)sinax < forO <x < 1.\n\n Consequently,\n\n za\"\n\n |\n O< | a\" f,(x)sinawx dx <\n 0\n\n n!\n This reasoning was completely independent of the value of n.

Thus our original assumption must have been incorrect: 7? is irrational. J\n\n This proof is admittedly mysterious; perhaps most mysterious of all is the way\n that a enters the proof—t almost looks as if we have proved z irrational without\n ever mentioning a definition of 2. A close reexamination of the proof will show\n that precisely one property of 2 1s essential—\n\n sin(z) = 0.\n - |-\n The proof really depends on the properties of the function sin, and proves the irrationality of the smallest positive number x with sinx = Q. In fact, very few properties of sin are required, namely,\n\n sin' = cos,\n\n cos = —sin,\n sin(O) = O,\n cos(O) = 1.\n\n Even this list could be shortened; as far as the proof is concerned, cos might just as well be defined as sin'. The properties of sin required in the proof may then be written\n\n sin' + sin = 0,\n sin(Q) = QO,\n sin (0) = 1.\n\n Of course, this is not really very surprising at all, since, as we have seen in the previous chapter, these properties characterize the function sin completely.\n\n PROBLEMS\n\n 1.

The first law\n describes the shape of planetary orbits:\n\n The planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus.\n\n The second law involves the area swept out by the segment from the sun to the\n planet (the ‘radius vector from the sun to the planet') in various time intervals\n\n (Figure 1):\n\n Equal areas are swept out by the radius vector in equal times. (Equivalently, the area\n swept out in time t 1s proportional to t.)\n\n Kepler's third law, published in 1619, relates the motions of different planets. If a\n is the major axis of a planet's elliptical orbit and T 1s its period, the time it takes\n the planet to return to a given position, then:\n\n The ratio a> /T* is the same for all planets.\n - |-\n Newton's great accomplishment was to show (using his general law that the  \n force on a body is its mass times its acceleration) that Kepler's laws follow from the  \n assumption that the planets are attracted to the sun by a force (the gravitational  \n force of the sun) always directed toward the sun, proportional to the mass of the  \n planet, and satisfying an inverse square law; that is, by a force directed toward  \n the sun whose magnitude varies inversely with the square of the distance from the  \n sun to the planet and directly with the mass of the planet. Since force is mass  \n times acceleration, this is equivalent simply to saying that the magnitude of the  \n acceleration is a constant divided by the square of the distance from the sun.\n\n Newton's analysis actually established three results that correlate with Kepler's  \n individual laws. The first of Newton's results concerns Kepler's second law (which  \n was actually discovered first, nicely preserving the symmetry of the situation):\n\n 330\n\n P3  \n P2  \n P1  \n §  \n (a)  \n P3  \n R P2  \n Py  \n R)  \n (b)  \n FIGURE 2\n\n 17.

Instead of considering a force that varies continuously as the  \n planet moves, Newton first considers short equal time intervals and assumes that  \n a momentary force is exerted at the ends of each of these intervals.\n\n ‘To be specific, let us imagine that during the first time interval the planet moves  \n along the line P1P2, with uniform velocity (Figure 2a). If, during the next equal  \n time interval, the planet continued to move along this line, it would end up at  \n P3, where the length of P1P2 equals the length of P2P3. ‘This would imply that  \n the triangle SP1P2 has the same area as the triangle SP2P3 (since they have equal  \n bases, and the same height)—this just says that Kepler's law holds in the special  \n case where the force is 0.\n - |-\n Now suppose (Figure 2b) that at the moment the planet arrives at P2 it experi-\n ences a force exerted along the line from S to Pz, which by itself would cause the planet\n to move to the pot Q. Combined with the motion that the planet already has,\n this causes the planet to move to R, the vertex opposite P) in the parallelogram\n whose sides are P> P3 and PoQ.\n\n Thus, the area swept out in the second time interval is actually the triangle\n SPR. But the area of triangle SP)R is equal to the area of triangle SP3 P , since\n they have the same base SP, and the same heights (since R P3 1s parallel to SP).\n Hence, finally, the area of triangle SP)R is the same as the area of the original\n triangle SP; P2! Conversely, if the triangle SRP 2 has the same area as SP; P2, and\n hence the same area as SP3P2, then RP3 must be parallel to SP), and this implies\n that Q must lie along SP.\n\n Of course, this isn't quite the sort of argument one would expect to find in a\n modern book, but in its own charming way it shows physically just why the result\n should be true.\n\n To analyze planetary motion we will be using the material in the Appendix to\n Chapter 12, and the \"determinant\" det defined in Problem 4 of Appendix | to\n Chapter 4. We describe the motion of the planet by the parameterized curve\n\n c(t) = r(t)(cos @(t), sin O(t)),\n\n so that r always gives the length of the line from the sun to the planet, while 6\n gives the angle, which we will assume is increasing (the case where @ 1s decreasing\n then follows easily). It will be convenient to write this also as\n\n (1) c(t) =r(t)- e(@(t)),\n\n where\n e(t) = (cost, sin fr)\n\n is Just the parameterized curve that runs along the unit circle.

Using (2) we then get  \n (4) det(c, c') = 76'.  \n\n As we will see, r76' turns out to have another important interpretation.  \n\n Suppose that A(t) is the area swept out from time 0 to ¢ (Figure 3). We want  \n to get a formula for A'(t), and, in the spirit of Newton, we'll begin by making  \n an educated guess. Figure 4 shows A(t +h) — A(t), together with a straight line  \n segment between c(t) and c(t +h). It is easy to write down a formula for the area  \n of the triangle A(h) with vertices O, c(t), and c(t +h): according to Problems 4  \n and 5 of Appendix 1 to Chapter 4, the area is  \n\n area(A(h)) = 5 det(c(t), c(t + h) — c(t)).  \n\n Since the triangle A(h) has practically the same area as the region A(t+h) — A(t),  \n this shows (or practically shows) that  \n\n A(t+h)—-—A(t  \n A(t) = lim (ti +n) (it)  \n h-0 h  \n _ area A(h)  \n a h—0 h  \n t+h)—c(t  \n = det (ca lim SUF A) et ')  \n h-0 h  \n\n = } det(c(t), c/(t)).\n - |-\n A rigorous derivation, establishing more in the process, can be made using Problem 13-24, which gives a formula for the area of a region determined by the graph of a function in polar coordinates. According to this Problem, we can write\n\n $$\n A(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\theta_0}^{\\theta(t)} r(\\theta) \\, d\\theta\n $$\n\n if our parameterized curve $ c(t) = r(t) \\, e^{i\\theta(t)} $ is the graph of the function $ r $ in polar coordinates (here we've used $ \\theta $ for the angular polar coordinate, to avoid confusion with the function $ \\theta $ used to describe the curve $ c $).\n $$\n \\text{THEOREM 1}\n $$\n\n $$\n \\text{PROOF}\n $$\n\n 17.

Although the presence of the inverse function might look a bit forbidding, it's actually quite innocent: Applying the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Chain Rule to (*) we immediately get\n\n $$\n A(t) = \\frac{1}{2} r(\\theta(t))^2 \\cdot \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\n = \\frac{1}{2} r(t)^2 \\cdot \\theta'(t), \\text{ since } r = r(\\theta)\n $$\n\n Briefly,\n $$\n A' = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta'.\n $$\n\n Combining with (4), we thus have\n\n (5) $ A' = \\frac{1}{2} \\det(c, c') = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta' $. \n\n Now we're ready to consider Kepler's second law. Notice that Kepler's second law is equivalent to saying that $ A' $ is constant, and thus it is equivalent to $ A'' = 0 $. But\n\n $$\n A'' = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\det(c, c') \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\det(c', c'') + \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\det(c, c') \\right) \\text{ (see page 248)}\n $$\n\n $$\n - \\frac{1}{2} \\det(c, c'').\n $$\n\n So\n\n Kepler's second law is equivalent to $ \\det(c, c'') = 0 $.\n\n Putting this all together we have:\n\n Kepler's second law is true if and only if the force is central, and in this case each planetary path $ c(t) = r(t) \\, e^{i\\theta(t)} $ satisfies the equation\n\n $$\n (r^2 \\theta') = \\det(c, c') = \\text{constant}. \n $$\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

J\n\n R THE LOGARITHM AND\n CHAPTER EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS\n - |-\n In Chapter 15 the integral provided a rigorous formulation for a preliminary def-\n inition of the functions sin and cos. In this chapter the integral plays a more\n essential role. For certain functions even a preliminary definition presents difficul-\n ties. For example, consider the function\n\n f(x) = 10°.\n This function is assumed to be defined for all x and to have an inverse function,\n defined for positive x, which is the \"logarithm to the base 10,\"\n f'(x) = logy) x.\n\n In algebra, 10* is usually defined only for rational x, while the definition for 1r-\n rational x is quietly ignored. A brief review of the definition for rational x will\n not only explain this omission, but also recall an important principle behind the\n\n definition of 10%.\n\n The symbol 10\" is first defined for natural numbers n. This notation turns out\n to be extremely convenient, especially for multiplying very large numbers, because\n\n 10\" - 10\" = 10\"*\".\n\n The extension of the definition of 10* to rational x is motivated by the desire\n to preserve this equation; this requirement actually forces upon us the customary\n definition. Since we want the equation\n\n 10° - 10\" = 10°*\" = 10\"\n to be true, we must define 10° = 1; since we want the equation\n\n 107\". 10\" = 10° = 1\n\n to be true, we must define 107\" = 1/10\"; since we want the equation\n 101\"... 10\" = 10\" F1/\" = 10! = 10\n sem a,\n n times n times\n\n to be true, we must define 10!/\" = 10; and since we want the equation\n\n 10!/\" Loo, 19!/\" _ 1Q Wirt +l /n _ 107/\"\n a / a\n m times m times\n\n to be true, we must define 10\"/\" = (V10)\".\n\n Unfortunately, at this point the program comes to a dead halt. We have been\n guided by the principle that 10* should be defined so as to ensure that 10*** =\n 10* 10\"; but this principle does not suggest any simple algebraic way of defining\n\n 339\n\n 340 = Derwwatives and Integrals\n - |-\n Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:\n\n 10* for irrational x. For this reason we will try some more sophisticated ways of  \n finding a function f such that\n\n (*) f(ty) = fx): f(y) for all x and y.\n\n Of course, we are interested in a function which is not always zero, so we might  \n add the condition f(1) ≠ 0. If we add the more specific condition f(1) = 10,  \n then (*) will imply that f(x) = 10^x for rational x, and 10^x could be defined as f(x)  \n for other x; in general f(x) will equal [f(1)]^x for rational x.\n\n One way to find such a function is suggested if we try to solve an apparently  \n more difficult problem: find a differentiable function f such that\n\n f(x + y) = f(x) · f(y) for all x and y,  \n f(1) = 10.\n\n Assuming that such a function exists, we can try to find f'—knowing the derivative  \n of f might provide a clue to the definition of f itself. Now\n\n f(x + h) - f(x)  \n f'(x) = lim  \n h→0 h  \n\n = lim [f(x) · f(h)] / h - f(x)/h  \n = f(x) · lim [f(h)/h] - f(x)/h  \n\n for the moment assume this limit exists, and denote it by a. Then  \n f(x) = a · f(x) for all x.\n\n Even if a could be computed, this approach seems self-defeating. The derivative  \n of f has been expressed in terms of f again.\n\n If we examine the inverse function f^{-1} = log_{10}, the whole situation appears in  \n a new light:\n\n log_{10}(x) =  \n\n The derivative of f^{-1} is about as simple as one could ask! And, what is even  \n more interesting, of all the integrals ∫ x^n dx examined previously, the integral  \n ∫ x^{-1} dx is the only one which we cannot evaluate. Since log_{10} 1 = 0 we should  \n\n have\n\n ∫_{1}^{x} (1/t) dt = ∫_{1}^{x} log_{10}(t) dt = log_{10}(x)\n\n DEFINITION\n\n THEOREM 1\n - |-\n 18.

J\n\n This theorem, and the discussion at the beginning of this chapter, suggest that\n exp(1) is particularly important. There is, in fact, a special symbol for this number.\n\n e = exp(1).\n\n 344 Derivatives and Integrals\n\n va!\n f= -\n\n FIGURE 3\n\n WW --\n =\n\n DEFINITION\n\n This definition is equivalent to the equation\n\n |\n | = log e = [ — dt.\n 1 &\n\n As illustrated in Figure 3,\n\n 2\n J\n | —dt < 1, since |- (2 — 1) is an upper sum for\n 1! f(t) = 1/t on [1,2],\n\n and\n 4]\n | —dt > 1, since 5 -(2—1)+4-(4—2) = 1 is a lower\n 1 f sum for f(t) = 1/t on [1, 4].\n Thus\n\n which shows that\n\n 2 < e < 4.\n\n In Chapter 20 we will find much better approximations for e, and also prove that\n e is irrational (the proof is much easier than the proof that π is irrational!).\n\n As we remarked at the beginning of the chapter, the equation\n exp(x + y) = exp(x) - exp(y)\n implies that\n\n exp(x) = [exp(1)]^x\n = e^x, for all rational x.\n\n Since exp is defined for all x and exp(x) = e^x for rational x, it is consistent with\n our earlier use of the exponential notation to define e^x as exp(x) for all x.\n\n For any number x,\n e^x = exp(x).\n - |-\n The terminology \"exponential function\" should now be clear.

The Logarithm and Exponential Functions 347  \n\n There is one special case of the above formula which is worth remembering.  \n The function f(x) = x^a was previously defined only for rational a. We can now  \n define and find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^a for any number a; the  \n result is just what we would expect:  \n\n f(x) = x^a = e^{a log x}  \n\n SO  \n\n f'(x) = a \\cdot e^{a \\log x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = a \\cdot x^{a-1}  \n\n Algebraic manipulations with the exponential functions will become second na-  \n ture after a little practice—just remember that all the rules which ought to work  \n actually do. The basic properties of exp are still those stated in Theorems 2 and 3:  \n\n exp(x) = e^x,  \n exp(x + y) = exp(x) \\cdot exp(y).  \n\n In fact, each of these properties comes close to characterizing the function exp.  \n Naturally, exp is not the only function f satisfying f' = f, for if f = c e^x, then  \n f'(x) = c e^x = f(x); these functions are the only ones with this property, however.  \n\n If f is differentiable and  \n f'(x) = f(x) for all x,  \n\n then there is a number c such that  \n f(x) = c e^x for all x.  \n\n Let  \n f(x) = e^x  \n g(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{e^x}  \n\n (This is permissible, since e^x ≠ 0 for all x.) Then  \n \\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{f'(x) e^x - f(x) e^x}{(e^x)^2} = 0.  \n\n Therefore there is a number c such that  \n g(x) = c = c for all x.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

'The\n function exp is clearly not the only function f which satisfies\n\n f(x +y) = f(x): f(y).\n\n In fact, f(x) = 0 or any function of the form f(x) = a\" also satisfies this equation.\n But the true story is much more complex than this—there are infinitely many other\n functions which satisfy this property, but it is impossible, without appealing to more\n advanced mathematics, to prove that there is even one function other than those\n 348 Derivatives and Integrals\n\n THEOREM 6\n\n PROOF\n\n l\n f= -\n\n FIGURE 6\n\n already mentioned!

One thing is true however—any\n continuous function f satisfying\n\n f(x+y)= f(x): fy)\n\n must be of the form f(x) = a* or f(x) = 0. (Problem 38 indicates the way to\n prove this, and also has a few words to say about discontinuous functions with this\n property.)\n\n In addition to the two basic properties stated in Theorems 2 and 3, the function\n exp has one further property which is very important—exp \"grows faster than any\n polynomial.\" In other words,\n\n For any natural number n,\n\n e~\n\n lim — = oo.\n x00 x\"\n\n The proof consists of several steps.\n\n Step 1. e* > x for all x, and consequently lim e* = oo (this may be considered\n\n to be the case n = 0).\n To prove this statement (which is clear for x < Q) it suffices to show that\n\n x >logx forall x > 0.\n\n If x < 1 this is clearly true, since log x < 0.

This preoccupation with elementary functions can be justified by\n three considerations:\n\n (1) Integration is a standard topic in calculus, and everyone should know\n about it.\n\n (2) Every once in a while you might actually need to evaluate an integral, under\n conditions which do not allow you to consult any of the standard integral\n tables (for example, you might take a (physics) course in which you are\n expected to be able to integrate).\n\n (3) The most useful \"methods\" of integration are actually very important the-\n orems (that apply to all functions, not just elementary ones).\n\n Naturally, the last reason is the crucial one. Even if you intend to forget how\n to integrate (and you probably will forget some details the first time through), you\n must never forget the basic methods.\n\n These basic methods are theorems which allow us to express primitives of one\n function in terms of primitives of other functions. ‘To begin integrating we will\n therefore need a list of primitives for some functions; such a list can be obtained\n simply by differentiating various well-known functions.

Integration in Elementary Terms 365\n\n This \"equation\" means that the function F(x) = x⁴/4 satisfies F'(x) = x³. It\n cannot be interpreted literally because the right side is a number, not a function,\n but in this one context we will allow such discrepancies; our aim is to make the\n integration process as mechanical as possible, and we will resort to any possible\n device. Another feature of the equation deserves mention. Most people write\n\n ∫x² dx = x³/3\n to emphasize that the primitives of f(x) = x² are precisely the functions of the\n form F(x) = x³/3 + C for some number C. Although it is possible (Problem 14)\n to obtain contradictions if this point is disregarded, in practice such difficulties do\n not arise, and concern for this constant is merely an annoyance.\n\n There is one important convention accompanying this notation: the letter appearing\n on the right side of the equation should match with the letter appearing after the \"d\"\n on the left side—thus\n\n ∫u³ du = u⁴/4,\n ∫x dx = x²/2.\n\n A function in ∫f(x)dx, i.e., a primitive of f, is often called an \"indefinite\n integral\" of f, while ∫a^b f(x)dx is called, by way of contrast, a \"definite integral.\"\n This suggestive notation works out quite well in practice, but it is important not to\n be led astray. At the risk of boring you, the following fact is emphasized once again:\n the integral ∫f(x)dx is not defined as \"F(b) − F(a), where F is an indefinite\n integral of f\" (if you do not find this statement repetitious, it is time to reread\n Chapter 13).\n\n We can verify the formulas in the following short table of indefinite integrals\n simply by differentiating the functions indicated on the right side.\n - |-\n [adx = ax\n\n ntl\n \"ax = , n#-—l\n | * n+ 1 7\n l I, . ax . a\n —dx = log x —dx is often written {| — for convenience; similar\n x x x\n abbreviations are used in the last two examples of this\n table.)\n | e dx =e\n J sin xdx = —cosx\n 366 Derivatives and Integrals\n\n THEOREM 1 (INTEGRATION BY PARTS)\n\n cosx dx = sinx\n 2 _\n sec' x dx = tanx\n\n sec x tanx dx = secx\n\n | dx ,\n = arctan\n 1+ x2 *\n\n ———_ ~~,\n\n | dx\n = arcsin x\n V1 — x2\n\n Two general formulas of the same nature are consequences of theorems about\n differentiation:\n\n [tre + eo) dx = | tenax+ | gear,\n\n [c-fendx =e: f fondx,\n\n These equations should be interpreted as meaning that a primitive of f + g can\n be obtained by adding a primitive of f to a primitive of g, while a primitive of\n c+ f can be obtained by multiplying a primitive of f by c.\n\n Notice the consequences of these formulas for definite integrals: If f and g are\n continuous, then\n\n b b b\n [ (re + ecax= | fxd + f g(x)dx,\n\n b b\n | c- f(xydx =e: | f(x) dx.\n\n These follow from the previous formulas, since each definite integral may be writ-\n ten as the difference of the values at a and b of a corresponding primitive.

The \"Second Mean Value Theorem for Integrals\" states the following. Suppose that $ f $ is integrable on $ [a,b] $ and that $ g $ is either nondecreasing or nonincreasing on $ [a, b] $.

THE COSMOPOLITAN INTEGRAL\n - |-\n We originally introduced integrals in order to find the area under the graph of  \n a function, but the integral is considerably more versatile than that. For example,  \n Problem 13-24 used the integral to express the area of a region of quite another  \n sort. Moreover, Problem 13-25 showed that the integral can also be used to ex-  \n press the lengths of curves—though, as we've seen in Appendix to Chapter 13, a  \n lot of work may be necessary to consider the general case! This result was prob-  \n ably a little more surprising, since the integral seems, at first blush, to be a very  \n two-dimensional creature. Actually, the integral makes its appearance in quite a  \n few geometric formulas, which we will present in this Appendix. ‘To derive these  \n C formulas we will assume some results from elementary geometry (and allow a little  \n\n fudging).\n\n Instead of going down to one-dimensional objects, we'll begin by tackling some  \n three-dimensional ones. There are some very special solids whose volumes can  \n be expressed by integrals. The simplest such solid V is a \"solid of revolution,\"  \n obtained by revolving the region under the graph of f > 0 on [a,b] around  \n FIGURE 1 the horizontal axis, when we regard the plane as situated in space (Figure 1).  \n If P = {t,...,t,} 1s any partition of [a,b], and m; and M; have their usual  \n meanings, then  \n\n 2  \n f wm; (t; — ti-1)  \n\n \\ \\ is the volume of a disc that lies inside the solid V (Figure 2).

Before we tackle complicated regions, a little review of elementary geometric formulas may be appreciated here.\n\n Figure 7 shows a right pyramid made up of triangles with bases of length $ l $ and altitude $ s $. The total surface area of the sides of the pyramid is thus\n\n $$\n 2P s\n $$\n\n where $ P $ is the perimeter of the base. By choosing the base to be a regular polygon with a large number of sides we see that the area of a right circular cone (Figure 8) must be\n\n $$\n \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi s) = \\pi s,\n $$\n\n where $ s $ is the \"slant height.\" Finally, consider the frustum of a cone with slant height $ s $ and radii $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $ shown in Figure 9(a). Completing this to a cone, as in Figure 9(b), we have\n\n $$\n S = \\frac{1}{2} r_1 s + \\frac{1}{2} r_2 s\n $$\n\n so that\n\n $$\n S = \\frac{1}{2} s (r_1 + r_2)\n $$\n\n Consequently, the surface area is\n\n $$\n \\pi (r_1^2 - r_2^2) = \\pi s (r_1 + r_2)\n $$\n\n Now consider the surface formed by revolving the graph of $ f $ around the horizontal axis. For a partition $ P = \\{ t_0, t_1, ..., t_n \\} $ we can inscribe a series of frustums of cones, as in Figure 10. The total surface area of these frustums is\n\n $$\n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 \\pi \\left( \\frac{f(t_i) + f(t_{i-1})}{2} \\right) \\sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}\n $$\n\n $$\n = 2 \\pi \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \\right) \\sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}\n $$\n\n $$\n = 2 \\pi \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \\right) \\sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}\n $$\n\n By the Mean Value Theorem, this is\n\n $$\n 2 \\pi \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f'(x_i) (t_i - t_{i-1}) \\sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}\n $$\n\n for some $ x_i $ in $ (t_{i-1}, t_i) $.

If\n f^{(n)}(a) > 0, this means that\n\n f(x) > 0 = f(a)\n\n for x close to a. Consequently, f has a local minimum at a. A similar proof works\n for the case f^{(n)}(a) < 0.\n\n Now suppose that n is odd. The same argument as before shows that if x is\n sufficiently close to a, then\n\n f(x)\n (x — a)^n \n has the same sign as f^{(n)}(a)/n! for x sufficiently close to a. Since n is odd, (x — a)^n\n changes sign as x crosses a.

J\n\n always has the same sign.\n\n Although Theorem 2 will settle the question of local maxima and minima for\n just about any function which arises in practice, it does have some theoretical\n limitations, because f\\)(a) may be 0 for all k.

J\n\n The second illustration is merely a straightforward demonstration of a fact\n\n proved in Chapter 15: If\n\n f''(x) = -f(x),\n f(0) = 9,\n f'(0) = 0,\n then f = 0. To prove this, observe first that f'' exists for every k; in fact\n f(k) = (-1)^k f(x),\n f(0) = (f(0))' = (-f') = -f'' = f\n f'(0) = (f(0))' = f\n\n etc.\n 430 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series\n\n This shows, not only that all f'' exist, but also that there are at most 4 different\n ones: f, f', -f, -f'. Since f(0) = f'(0) = 0, all f(0) are 0. Now Taylor's\n\n Theorem states, for any n, that\n\n f(x) = Σ f^(k)(0)/k! (x - 0)^k + R_n(x)\n\n for some t in [0, x]. Each function f^(k) exists (since f^(n) exists)), so for\n any particular x there is a number M such that\n\n |f^(k)(t)| < M for 0 < t < x, and all n\n\n (we can add the phrase \"and all n\" because there are only four different f^(k)?).\n\n Thus\n\n |f(x)| < M |x|^n / (n+1)! .\n Since this is true for every n, and since |x|^n /n! can be made as small as desired by\n choosing n sufficiently large, this shows that | f(x)| < ε for any ε > 0; consequently,\n\n f(x) = 0.\n\n The other uses to which Taylor's Theorem will be put in succeeding chapters\n are closely related to the computational considerations which have concerned us\n for much of this chapter. If the remainder term R_n(x) can be made as small as\n desired by choosing n sufficiently large, then f(x) can be computed to any degree\n of accuracy desired by using the polynomials P_n(x). As we require greater and\n greater accuracy we must add on more and more terms. If we are willing to add\n up infinitely many terms (in theory at least!), then we ought to be able to ignore\n the remainder completely.

Several special cases have already received detailed treatment, either in the text or in other problems; in particular, we have found all functions satisfying $ f' = f $, or $ f'' + f = 0 $, or $ f''' - f = 0 $. The trick in Problem 18-42 enables us to find many solutions for such equations, but doesn't say whether these are the only solutions. This requires a uniqueness result, which will be supplied by this problem. At the end you will find some (necessarily sketchy) remarks about the general solution.\n\n (a) Derive the following formula for $ f^{(n)} (x) $ (let us agree that \"a_{-1}\" will be 0):\n\n $$\n f^{(n)} (x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (a_j f^{(j)}(x) + a_{j+1} f^{(j+1)}(x))\n $$\n\n (b) Deduce a formula for $ f^{(n)} (x) $.\n\n The formula in part (b) is not going to be used; it was inserted only to convince you that a general formula for $ f^{(n)} (x) $ is out of the question. On the other hand, as part (c) shows, it is not very hard to obtain estimates on the size of $ f^{(n)} (x) $.\n\n (c) Let $ N = \\max(\\lvert a_0 \\rvert, \\ldots, \\lvert a_{n-1} \\rvert) $. Then $ \\lvert a_j + a_{j+1} \\rvert < 2N $. This means that\n\n $$\n f^{(n)} (x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} b_j f^{(j)} (x),\n $$\n\n where $ \\lvert b_j \\rvert < 2N $.\n\n Show that\n\n $$\n \\lvert f^{(n)} (x) \\rvert \\leq \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 4N^3.\n $$\n\n ---\n\n Let me know if you need further clarification or additional parts of the problem.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

Just how a number might be even worse than irrational\n is suggested by a slight rewording of definitions. A number x is irrational if it is\n not possible to write x = a/b for any integers a and b, with b ≠ 0. This is the\n same as saying that x does not satisfy any equation\n\n bx —a = 0\n\n for integers a and b, except for a = 0, b = 0. Viewed in this light, the irrationality\n of √2 does not seem to be such a terrible deficiency; rather, it appears that √2 just\n barely manages to be irrational—although √2 is not the solution of an equation\n\n a x + a g = 0,\n it is the solution of the equation\n x² - 2 = 0,\n\n of one higher degree. Problem 2-18 shows how to produce many irrational numbers x which satisfy higher-degree equations\n\n Anxⁿ + yxⁿ⁻¹ + ... + aₙ = 0,\n\n where the a; are integers not all 0. A number which satisfies an \"algebraic\" equation of this sort is called an algebraic number, and practically every number we\n have ever encountered is defined in terms of solutions of algebraic equations (7\n and e are the great exceptions in our limited mathematical experience). All roots,\n\n such as\n\n are clearly algebraic numbers, and even complicated combinations, like\n\n 34541434 %\n\n are algebraic (although we will not try to prove this). Numbers which cannot be\n obtained by the process of solving algebraic equations are called transcendental;\n the main result of this chapter states that e is a number of this anomalous sort.\n The proof that e is transcendental is well within our grasp, and was theoretically\n possible even before Chapter 20. Nevertheless, with the inclusion of this proof, we\n can justifiably classify ourselves as something more than novices in the study of\n higher mathematics; while many irrationality proofs depend only on elementary\n properties of numbers, the proof that a number is transcendental usually involves\n - |-\n 442  \n 21. e is Transcendental 443  \n\n some really high-powered mathematics. Even the dates connected with the transcendence of e are impressively recent—the first proof that e is transcendental, due to Hermite, dates from 1873. The proof that we will give is a simplification, due to Hilbert.\n\n Before tackling the proof itself, it is a good idea to map out the strategy, which depends on an idea used even in the proof that e is irrational. 'Two features of the expression  \n\n | | |  \n I! 2!  \n\n were important for the proof that e is irrational: On the one hand, the number  \n , | |  \n\n can be written as a fraction p/q with q <n! (so that n! (p/q) is an integer); on the other hand, 0 < R, < 3/(n+ 1)! (so n!R, is not an integer). These two facts show that e can be approximated particularly well by rational numbers. Of course, every number x can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers—if ¢ > O there is a rational number r with |x —r| < €; the catch, however, is that it may be necessary to allow a very large denominator for r, as large as |/e perhaps. For e we are assured that this is not the case: there is a fraction p/g within 3/(n + 1)! of e, whose denominator gq is at most n!. If you look carefully at the proof that e is irrational, you will see that only this fact about e is ever used. The number e is by no means unique in this respect: generally speaking, the better a number can be approximated by rational numbers, the worse it is (some evidence for this assertion is presented in Problem 3). The proof that e is transcendental depends on a natural extension of this idea: not only e, but any finite number of powers e, e? can be simultaneously approximated especially well by rational numbers.

This requires nothing more\n than some simple estimates; for the remainder of the argument remember that n\n is a certain fixed number (the degree of the assumed polynomial equation (+)). To\n begin with, if $ 1 < k < n $, then\n\n $$ \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$\n\n $$ = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$\n\n $$ = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$\n\n $$ = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$\n\n $$ = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$\n\n Now let A be the maximum of $ |(x - 1)...-(x - n)| $ for x in [0,7].

J\n\n This proof, like the proof that $ e $ is irrational, deserves some philosophic afterthoughts. At first sight, the argument seems quite \"advanced\"—after all, we\n use integrals, and integrals from 0 to ∞ at that. Actually, as many mathematicians have observed, integrals can be eliminated from the argument completely;\n the only integrals essential to the proof are of the form\n\n $$ \\int_0^\\infty x^k e^{-x} dx $$\n - |-\n for integral k, and these integrals can be replaced by k! whenever they occur.\n Thus M, for example, could have been defined initially as\n\n $$\n M = \\frac{(p-1+a)!}{(p-1)!}\n $$\n\n where $ C_y $ are the coefficients of the polynomial\n $$\n [((x-1)-\\cdots-(a_n))]^2.\n $$\n\n If this idea is developed consistently, one obtains a \"completely elementary\" proof\n that $ e $ is transcendental, depending only on the fact that\n\n $$\n | I I \n $$\n\n Unfortunately, this \"elementary\" proof is harder to understand than the original\n one—the whole structure of the proof must be hidden just to eliminate a few\n integral signs! ‘This situation is by no means peculiar to this specific theorem—\n \"elementary\" arguments are frequently more difficult than \"advanced\" ones. Our\n proof that $ \\zeta $ is irrational is a case in point. You probably remember nothing\n about this proof except that it involves quite a few complicated functions. There is\n actually a more advanced, but much more conceptual proof, which shows that $ \\pi $\n is transcendental, a fact which is of great historical, as well as intrinsic, interest. One\n of the classical problems of Greek mathematics was to construct, with compass\n and straightedge alone, a square whose area is that of a circle of radius 1. This\n requires the construction of a line segment whose length is $ \\pi $, which can be\n accomplished if a line segment of length $ \\pi $ is constructible. The Greeks were\n totally unable to decide whether such a line segment could be constructed, and\n even the full resources of modern mathematics were unable to settle this question\n until 1882. In that year Lindemann proved that $ \\pi $ is transcendental; since the\n length of any segment that can be constructed with straightedge and compass can\n be written in terms of $ +, -, \\times, \\div, $ and $ \\sqrt{} $, and is therefore algebraic, this proves\n that a line segment of length $ \\pi $ cannot be constructed.\n\n The proof that $ \\pi $ is transcendental requires a sizable amount of mathematics\n which is too advanced to be reached in this book. Nevertheless, the proof is not\n much more difficult than the proof that $ e $ is transcendental. In fact, the proof\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

Such numbers were first considered by Liouville (1809-1882), and the inequality in Problem 3 is often called Liouville's inequality. None of the transcendental numbers constructed in this way happens to be particularly interesting, but for a long time Liouville's transcendental numbers were the only ones known. This situation was changed quite radically by the work of Cantor (1845-1918), who showed, without exhibiting a single transcendental number, that most numbers are transcendental. The next two problems provide an introduction to the ideas that allow us to make sense of such statements. The basic definition with which we must work is the following: A set A is called countable if its elements can be arranged in a sequence\n\n a1, a2, a3, a4, ....\n\n The obvious example (in fact, more or less the Platonic ideal of) a countable set is N, the set of natural numbers; clearly the set of even natural numbers is also countable:\n\n 2, 4, 6, 8, ....\n\n It is a little more surprising to learn that Z, the set of all integers (positive, negative and 0) is also countable, but seeing it is believing:\n\n 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ....\n\n The next two problems, which outline the basic features of countable sets, are really a series of examples to show that (1) a lot more sets are countable than one might think and (2) nevertheless, some sets are not countable.\n\n **5.

There is one important criterion which is very easy to prove, but\n which is the basis for all other results. 'This criterion is stated in terms of concepts\n defined for functions, which therefore apply also to sequences: a sequence {a_n} is\n increasing if a_{n+1} > a_n for all n, nondecreasing if a_{n+1} > a_n for all n, and\n bounded above if there is a number M such that a_n < M for all n; there are sim-\n ilar definitions for sequences which are decreasing, nonincreasing, and bounded\n below.\n\n If {a_n} is nondecreasing and bounded above, then {a_n} converges (a similar state-\n ment is true if {a_n} is nonincreasing and bounded below).\n\n The set A consisting of all numbers a_n is, by assumption, bounded above, so A has\n a least upper bound a.

Upon first consideration, it might appear that there should be little\n trouble deciding whether or not a given nondecreasing sequence {a_n} is bounded\n above, and consequently whether or not {a_n} converges. In the next chapter such\n sequences will arise very naturally and, as we shall see, deciding whether or not\n they converge is hardly a trivial matter.

This is not an entirely straightforward matter, for the sum of  \n infinitely many numbers is as yet completely undefined. What can be defined are  \n the \"partial sums\"\n\n Sn = a1 + a2 + ... + an,\n\n and the infinite sum must presumably be defined in terms of these partial sums.  \n Fortunately, the mechanism for formulating this definition has already been devel-  \n oped in the previous chapter. If there is to be any hope of computing the infinite  \n sum a1 + a2 + a3 + ..., the partial sums s_n should represent closer and closer ap-  \n proximations as n is chosen larger and larger. This last assertion amounts to little  \n more than a sloppy definition of limits: the \"infinite sum\" a1 + a2 + a3 + ... ought  \n to be lim s_n. This approach will necessarily leave the \"sum\" of many sequences  \n N → ∞\n\n undefined, since the sequence {s_n} may easily fail to have a limit. For example, the  \n sequence\n\n 1, -1, 1, -1, ...\n with a_n = (-1)^{n+1} yields the new sequence\n\n S_1 = a_1 = 1,\n\n S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 0,\n\n S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1,\n\n S_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 0,\n\n ... for which lim s_n does not exist. Although there happen to be some clever ex-  \n tensions of the definition suggested here (see Problems 12 and 24-20) it seems  \n unavoidable that some sequences will have no sum. For this reason, an acceptable  \n definition of the sum of a sequence should contain, as an essential component,  \n terminology which distinguishes sequences for which sums can be defined from  \n less fortunate sequences.\n - |-\n 471  \n 472 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series  \n\n DEFINITION  \n\n The sequence {a_n} is summable if the sequence {S_n} converges, where  \n S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n.  \n\n In this case, lim S_n is denoted by  \n n→∞  \n\n ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n (or, less formally, a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ...)  \n\n and is called the sum of the sequence {a_n}.  \n\n The terminology introduced in this definition is usually replaced by less precise  \n expressions; indeed the title of this chapter is derived from such everyday language.  \n\n An infinite sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n is usually called an infinite series, the word \"series\" emphasiz-  \n ing the connection with the infinite sequence {a_n}. ‘The statement that {a_n} is, or  \n is not, summable is conventionally replaced by the statement that the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n  \n does, or does not, converge. ‘This terminology is somewhat peculiar, because at  \n best the symbol ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n denotes a number (so it can't \"converge''), and it doesn't de-  \n note anything at all unless {a_n} is summable. Nevertheless, this informal language  \n is convenient, standard, and unlikely to yield to attacks on logical grounds.  \n\n Certain elementary arithmetical operations on infinite series are direct conse-  \n quences of the definition. It is a simple exercise to show that if {a_n} and {b_n} are  \n summable, then  \n\n ∑_{n=1}^∞ (a_n + b_n) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n + ∑_{n=1}^∞ b_n,  \n ∑_{n=1}^∞ c a_n = c ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n.  \n\n As yet these equations are not very interesting, since we have no examples of  \n summable sequences (except for the trivial examples in which the terms are even-  \n tually all 0). Before we actually exhibit a summable sequence, some general con-  \n ditions for summability will be recorded.  \n\n There is one necessary and sufficient condition for summability which can be  \n stated immediately. The sequence {a_n} is summable if and only if the sequence {S_n}  \n converges, which happens, according to Theorem 22-3, if and only if lim S_n -  \n n→∞\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

Another difficulty is illustrated by the sequence {f_n} shown in Figure 4; on the interval [0, 1/n] the graph of f_n forms an isosceles triangle of altitude n, while f_n(x) = 0 for x > 1/n. These functions may be defined explicitly as follows:  \n f_n(x) = { 2n x, 0 < x < 1/(2n)  \n           2n - 2n x, 1/(2n) < x < 1/n  \n           0, x > 1/n }\n\n Figure 5  \n f_3\n\n f_2\n\n \"Wa\n\n \\[— qT  \n —e+l 1  \n\n 8 3 1\n\n FIGURE 6  \n It  \n fa  \n fi vk)\n\n FIGURE 5  \n 24, Uniform Convergence and Power Series 301\n\n f_n(x) = { 2n x, 0 < x < 1/(2n)  \n           2n - 2n x, 1/(2n) < x < 1/n  \n           0, x > 1/n }\n\n Because this sequence varies so erratically near 0, our primitive mathematical instincts might suggest that lim f_n(x) does not always exist.

Nevertheless, the\n real numbers do have a great deficiency—not every polynomial function has a\n root. The simplest and most notable example is the fact that no number x can\n satisfy x² + 1 = 0. This deficiency is so severe that long ago mathematicians\n felt the need to \"invent\" a number i with the property that i² + 1 = 0. For a\n long time the status of the \"number\" i was quite mysterious: since there is no\n number x satisfying x² + 1 = 0, it is nonsensical to say \"let i be the number\n satisfying i² + 1 = 0.\" Nevertheless, admission of the \"imaginary\" number i to\n the family of numbers seemed to simplify greatly many algebraic computations,\n especially when \"complex numbers\" a + bi (for a and b in R) were allowed, and\n all the laws of arithmetical computation enumerated in Chapter 1 were assumed\n to be valid. For example, every quadratic equation\n\n ax² + bx + c = 0 (a ≠ 0)\n\n can be solved formally to give\n\n - b + √(b² - 4ac)   - b - √(b² - 4ac)\n x =        , x =          .\n 2a           2a\n\n If b² - 4ac > 0, these formulas give correct solutions; when complex numbers are\n allowed the formulas seem to make sense in all cases. For example, the equation\n\n x² + x + 1 = 0\n has no real root, since\n x² + x + 1 = (x + ½)² + ¾ > 0, for all x.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

Thus a cubic equation will have either three real roots\n or one real root and 2 complex roots. The existence of the real root is guaranteed\n by our theorem that every odd degree equation has a real root, but it is not really\n necessary to appeal to this theorem (which 1s of no use at all if the coefficients\n are complex); in the case of a cubic equation we can, with sufficient cleverness,\n actually find a formula for all the roots. The following derivation is presented not\n only as an interesting illustration of the ingenuity of early mathematicians, but as\n further evidence for the importance of complex numbers (whatever they may be).\n\n ‘To solve the most general cubic equation, it obviously suffices to consider only\n equations of the form\n\n xo 4+ bx7+ex+d=0.\n\n It is even possible to eliminate the term involving x', by a fairly straight-forward\n manipulation.

(If you are still not convinced, try para-\n phrasing the solution of the cubic equation.) If we really intend to use complex\n numbers consistently, however, it is going to be necessary to present some reason-\n\n able definition.\n\n then 4\n\n One possibility has been implicit in this whole discussion. All mathematical\n properties of a complex number a + bi are determined completely by the real\n numbers a and b; any mathematical object with this same property may reasonably\n be used to define a complex number. The obvious candidate is the ordered pair\n (a,b) of real numbers; we shall accordingly define a complex number to be a pair\n of real numbers, and likewise define what addition and multiplication of complex\n numbers is to mean.\n\n A complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers; if z = (a, b) is a com-\n plex number, then a 1s called the real part of z, and b is called the umaginary\n part of z. The set of all complex numbers is denoted by C. If (a, b) and (c, d)\n\n are two complex numbers we define\n - |-\n (a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)\n (a,b) - (c,d) = (a-c, b-d)\n\n (The + and - appearing on the left side are new symbols being defined, while the\n + and - appearing on the right side are the familiar addition and multiplication\n\n for real numbers.)\n\n When complex numbers were first introduced, it was understood that real num-\n bers were, in particular, complex numbers; if our definition is taken seriously this\n is not true— a real number is not a pair of real numbers, after all. This difficulty\n 532 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series\n\n DEFINITION\n\n is only a minor annoyance, however. Notice that\n\n (a,0) + (b,0) = (a+ b, 0+0) = (a +b,0),\n (a,0)-(b,0) = (a-b, 0-0,a-0 + 0-b) = (a-b,0);\n\n this shows that the complex numbers of the form (a, 0) behave precisely the same\n with respect to addition and multiplication of complex numbers as real numbers\n do with their own addition and multiplication. For this reason we will adopt the\n convention that (a, 0) will be denoted simply by a. The familiar a + bi notation\n for complex numbers can now be recovered if one more definition is made.\n\n 1 = (0, 1).\n\n Notice that i² = (0, 1) - (0,1) = (-1,0) = -1 (the last equality sign depends\n\n on our convention). Moreover\n\n (a,b) = (a, 0) + (0, b)\n = (a, 0) + (0, 0) - (0, 1)\n = a + bi.\n - |-\n You may feel that our definition was merely an elaborate device for defining complex numbers as \"expressions of the form a + bi.\" ‘That is essentially correct; it is a firmly established prejudice of modern mathematics that new objects must be defined as something specific, not as \"expressions.\" Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that mathematicians were sincerely worried about using complex numbers until the modern definition was proposed. Moreover, the precise definition emphasizes one important point. Our aim in introducing complex numbers was to avoid the necessity of paraphrasing statements about complex numbers in terms of their real and imaginary parts. ‘This means that we wish to work with complex numbers in the same way that we worked with rational or real numbers. For example, the solution of the cubic equation required writing x = w — p/3w, so we want to know that 1/w makes sense. Moreover, w> was found by solving a quadratic equation, which requires numerous other algebraic manipulations. In short, we are likely to use, at some time or other, any manipulations performed on real numbers. We certainly do not want to stop each time and justify every step. Fortunately this is not necessary. Since all algebraic manipulations performed on real numbers can be justified by the properties listed in Chapter 1, it is only necessary to check that these properties are also true for complex numbers. In most cases this is quite easy, and these facts will not be listed as formal theorems. For example, the proof of P1,\n\n [(a,b) + (c, d)| + (e, f) = (a,b) + [(c, da) + (e, f)]\n\n requires only the application of the definition of addition for complex numbers. The left side becomes\n\n (la+c|]t+e,[b+d]+ f),\n and the right side becomes\n (a+ [c+e],b+[d+ f]);\n - |-\n These two are equal because P1 is true for real numbers. It's a good idea to check P2—P6 and P8 and P9. Notice that the complex numbers playing the role of 0 and | in P2 and P6 are (0, 0) and (1, 0), respectively. It is not hard to figure out what —(a, b) is, but the multiplicative inverse for (a, b) required in P7 is a little trickier: if (a,b) ≠ (0, 0), then a* + b* ≠ 0 and\n\n a —b\n ,b ° ' — 1,0).\n (4,9) (ap zp) Ow\n\n This fact could have been guessed in two ways. 'To find (x, y) with\n\n it is only necessary to solve the equations\n\n ax — by = 1,\n bx + ay = 0.\n The solutions are x = a/(a* + b), y = —b/(a* + b'). It is also possible to reason\n that if 1/(a@ + bi) means anything, then it should be true that\n l l a— bi a—bi\n\n a+bi ~~ atbi a—bi qt 4 2'\n\n Once the existence of inverses has actually been proved (after guessing the inverse\n by some method), it follows that this manipulation is really valid; it is the easiest one\n to remember when the inverse of a complex number is actually being sought—1it\n was precisely this trick which we used to evaluate\n\n 15 15 6—-3i\n 643i 6431 6—3i\n 90 — 457\n ~ 3649 -\n - |-\n Unlike P1—P9, the rules P10—P12 do not have analogues: it is easy to prove that\n there is no set P of complex numbers such that P10—P12 are satisfied for all complex\n numbers. In fact, if there were, then P would have to contain 1 (since 1 = 1*) and\n also -1 (since -1 = i\"), and this would contradict P10. The absence of P10—P12\n will not have disastrous consequences, but it does mean that we cannot define\n z < w for complex z and w. Also, you may remember that for the real numbers,\n P10—P12 were used to prove that 1+ 1 ≠ 0. Fortunately, the corresponding fact\n for complex numbers can be reduced to this one: clearly (1,0) + (1,0) = (0, 0).\n\n Although we will usually write complex numbers in the form a + bi, it is worth\n remembering that the set of all complex numbers C is just the collection of all\n pairs of real numbers. Long ago this collection was identified with the plane, and\n for this reason the plane is often called the \"complex plane.\" The horizontal axis,\n which consists of all points (a, 0) for a in R, is often called the real axis, and the\n vertical axis is called the imaginary axis. Two important definitions are also related\n to this geometric picture.\n\n If z = x + iy is a complex number (with x and y real), then the conjugate $\\overline{z}$ of z is defined as\n\n $$\n \\overline{z} = x - iy,\n $$\n\n and the absolute value or modulus $|z|$ of z is defined as\n\n $$\n |z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.\n $$\n\n (Notice that $x^2 + y^2 > 0$, so that $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ is defined unambiguously; it denotes\n the nonnegative real square root of $x^2 + y^2$.)\n - |-\n Geometrically, z is simply the reflection of z in the real axis, while |z| is the distance from z to (0,0) (Figure 1). Notice that the absolute value notation for complex numbers is consistent with that for real numbers. The distance between two complex numbers z and w can be defined quite easily as |z - w|. The following theorem lists all the important properties of conjugates and absolute values.\n\n Let z and w be complex numbers. Then\n\n $$\n \\overline{\\overline{z}} = z \\text{ if and only if } z \\text{ is real (i.e., is of the form } a + 0i, \\text{ for some real number } a).\n $$\n\n Assertions (1) and (2) are obvious. Equations (3) and (5) may be checked by straightforward calculations and (4) and (6) may then be proved by a trick:\n\n $$\n z + (-z) = z - z, \\text{ so } -z = -\\overline{z}.\n $$\n\n $$\n |z - z| = 2 \\text{ Re}(z), \\text{ so } |z| = \\text{Re}(z).\n $$\n\n Equations (7) and (8) may also be proved by a straightforward calculation. The only difficult part of the theorem is (9). This inequality has, in fact, already occurred (Problem 4-9), but the proof will be repeated here, using slightly different terminology.\n\n It is clear that equality holds in (9) if z = 0 or w = 0. It is also easy to see that (9) is true if z = Aw for any real number A (consider separately the cases A > 0 and A < 0). Suppose, on the other hand, that z ≠ Aw for any real number A, and that w ≠ 0. Then, for all real numbers A,\n\n $$\n |z - Aw|^2 = (z - Aw)(\\overline{z} - \\overline{Aw})\n = (z - Aw)\\overline{(z - Aw)}\n = |z|^2 + |Aw|^2 - A(w\\overline{z} + \\overline{w}z).\n $$\n\n Notice that wz + zw is real, since\n - |-\n w2t7w=w7t+7w=wr7t+Z7w = w7z+ Zw.\n\n ‘Thus the right side of (*) 1s a quadratic equation in A with real coefficients and no\n real solutions; its discriminant must therefore be negative. Thus\n\n (wz + zw)? —4|w/? - |z\\? < 0;\n it follows, since wz + zw and |w| - |z| are real numbers, and |w] - |z| > 0, that\n (wz + zw) < 2|w|- |zI.\n From this inequality it follows that\n\n z+ wl? =(zt+tw)-(2+0)\n = Fale + \\w|? + (wz + zw)\n < |z|? + |wl* + 2|w] - |zI\n = (|z| + |w)',\n\n which implies that\n Iz + wl <|zi+lwl. E\n\n The operations of addition and multiplication of complex numbers both have\n important geometric interpretations. Ihe picture for addition is very simple (Fig-\n ure 2). Two complex numbers z = (a,b) and w = (c,d) determine a paral-\n lelogram having for two of its sides the line segment from (0,0) to z, and the\n line segment from (0, 0) to w; the vertex opposite (0,0) is z + w (a proof of this\n geometric fact is left to you [compare Appendix | to Chapter 4]).\n\n The interpretation of multiplication is more involved. If z = O or w = OQ,\n then z-w = O(a one-line computational proof can be given, but even this is\n unnecessary—the assertion has already been shown to follow from P1—P9), so we\n may restrict our attention to nonzero complex numbers. We begin by putting every\n nonzero complex number into a special form (compare Appendix 3 to Chapter 4).\n\n For any complex number z 4 O we can write\n <\n\n z= [2] 7:\n Fd\n\n in this expression, |z| is a positive real number, while\n\n Cd\n /\n\n ~~ =],\n\n [Z|\n\n z\n\n Z|\n - |-\n So that z/|z| is a complex number of absolute value 1. Now any complex number  \n a = x + iy with 1 = ja] = x*+ y* can be written in the form  \n\n length a = (cos@,sin@) = cos@ + i sin@  \n\n for some number @. Thus every nonzero complex number z can be written  \n\n angle of @ radians z = r(cosé + i sin@)  \n\n for some r > 0 and some number 6. The number r is unique (it equals |z|), but 4  \n is not unique; if 99 is one possibility, then the others are 69 + 2km for k in Z—any  \n FIGURE 3 one of these numbers is called an argument of z. Figure 3 shows z in terms of r  \n and @. (To find an argument 6 for z = x + /y we may note that the equation  \n\n x + iy = z = |z| (cosé + i sin@)  \n means that  \n\n x = |z| cos@,  \n y = |z| sin@.  \n\n So, for example, if x > 0 we can take 6 = arctan y/x; if x = O, we can take  \n 0 = 7/2 when y > 0 and 6 = 3π/2 when y < 0.)  \n Now the product of two nonzero complex numbers  \n\n z = r(cos@ + i sin8@),  \n w = s(cos¢? + i sinγ),  \n\n is  \n z · w = rs (cos@ + i sin@)(cos¢@ + i sinγ)  \n\n = rs [(cos@ cos @ — sin @ sin γ) + i (sin @ cos γ + cos @ sin γ)]  \n = rs {cos(@ + γ) + i sin(@ + γ)}.  \n\n Thus, the absolute value of a product is the product of the absolute values of the  \n factors, while the sum of any argument for each of the factors will be an argument  \n for the product. For a nonzero complex number  \n\n z = r(cosé + i sin@)  \n\n it is now an easy matter to prove by induction the following very important formula  \n (sometimes known as De Moivre's Theorem):\n - |-\n z\" = [z|\"(cosn@ +7 sinn@), for any argument 6 of z.\n This formula describes z\" so explicitly that it is easy to decide just when z\" = w:\n THEOREM 2 Every nonzero complex number has exactly n complex nth roots.\n\n More precisely, for any complex number w # OQ, and any natural number n,\n there are precisely n different complex numbers z satisfying 2\" = w.\n\n PROOF Let\n w= s(cos@+isnd)\n —V3+4i V3 +i\n 2 2\n <i\n FIGURE 4\n\n 25.

Why?\n\n **CHAPTER**\n\n COMPLEX FUNCTIONS\n - |-\n You will probably not be surprised to learn that a deeper investigation of complex numbers depends on the notion of functions. Until now a function was (intuitively) a rule which assigned real numbers to certain other real numbers. But there is no reason why this concept should not be extended; we might just as well consider a rule which assigns complex numbers to certain other complex numbers. A rigorous definition presents no problems (we will not even accord it the full honors of a formal definition): a function is a collection of pairs of complex numbers which does not contain two distinct pairs with the same first element. Since we consider real numbers to be certain complex numbers, the old definition is really a special case of the new one. Nevertheless, we will sometimes resort to special terminology in order to clarify the context in which a function is being considered. A function f is called real-valued if f(z) is a real number for all z in the domain of f, and complex-valued to emphasize that it is not necessarily real-valued. Similarly, we will usually state explicitly that a function f is defined on [a subset of] R in those cases where the domain of f is [a subset of] R; in other cases we sometimes mention that f is defined on [a subset of ] C to emphasize that f(z) is defined for complex z as well as real z.\n\n Among the multitude of functions defined on C, certain ones are particularly important. Foremost among these are the functions of the form\n\n f(z) = a_nz^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1z + a_0,\n\n where a_0, ..., a_n are complex numbers. These functions are called, as in the real case, polynomial functions; they include the function f(z) = z (the \"identity function\") and functions of the form f(z) = a for some complex number a (\"constant functions\"). Another important generalization of a familiar function is the \"absolute value function\" f(z) = |z| for all z in C.\n\n Two functions of particular importance for complex numbers are Re (the \"real part function\") and Im (the \"imaginary part function\"), defined by\n\n Re(x + iy) = x,\n\n Im(x + iy) = y, for x and y real.\n - |-\n The \"conjugate function\" is defined by  \n f(z) = \\overline{z} = \\text{Re}(z) - i \\text{Im}(z).  \n\n Familiar real-valued functions defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ may be combined in many ways to  \n produce new complex-valued functions defined on $G$—an example is the function  \n\n $$f(x + iy) = e^{x} \\sin(x - y) + i x^2 \\cos y.$$  \n 541  \n $$\n \\text{Figure 1: } f(z)\n $$\n\n 542 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series  \n\n The formula for this particular function illustrates a decomposition which is always  \n possible. Any complex-valued function $f$ can be written in the form  \n\n $$f(z) = u(z) + i v(z)$$  \n\n for some real-valued functions $u$ and $v$—simply define $u(z)$ as the real part of $f(z)$,  \n and $v(z)$ as the imaginary part. This decomposition is often very useful, but not  \n always; for example, it would be inconvenient to describe a polynomial function  \n in this way.  \n\n One other function will play an important role in this chapter. Recall that an  \n argument of a nonzero complex number $z$ is a (real) number $\\theta$ such that  \n\n $$z = |z|(\\cos\\theta + i \\sin\\theta).$$\n\n There are infinitely many arguments for $z$, but just one which satisfies $0 < \\theta < 2\\pi$. If we call this unique argument $\\theta(z)$, then $\\theta$ is a (real-valued) function (the  \n \"argument function\") on $\\{z \\in G: z \\neq 0\\}$.  \n\n \"Graphs\" of complex-valued functions defined on $G$, since they lie in 4-dimensional space, are presumably not very useful for visualization. The alternative  \n picture of a function mentioned in Chapter 4 can be used instead: we draw two copies of $\\mathbb{C}$, and arrows from $z$ in one copy, to $f(z)$ in the other (Figure 1).  \n\n $$\n \\begin{array}{c}\n \\text{Y} \\\\\n e \\\\\n ww \\\\\n on o \\\\\n ~\n \\end{array}\n $$\n\n FIGURE 1: $f(z)$  \n\n The most common pictorial representation of a complex-valued function is pro-  \n duced by labeling a point in the plane with the value $f(z)$, instead of with $z$ (which  \n can be estimated from the position of the point in the picture). Figure 2 shows this  \n sort of picture for several different functions. Certain features of the function are  \n illustrated very clearly by such a \"graph.\" For example, the absolute value function  \n is constant on concentric circles around $0$, the functions $\\text{Re}$ and $\\text{Im}$ are constant\n - |-\n on the vertical and horizontal lines, respectively, and the function f(z) = z² wraps  \n the circle of radius r twice around the circle of radius r.  \n\n Despite the problems involved in visualizing complex-valued functions in general, it is still possible to define analogues of important properties previously defined for real-valued functions on R, and in some cases these properties may be easier to visualize in the complex case. For example, the notion of limit can be defined as follows:  \n\n lim f(z) = L means that for every (real) number ε > 0 there is a (real) number  \n δ > 0 such that, for all z, if 0 < |z − a| < δ, then |f(z) − L| < ε.  \n 26.

For real\n numbers the function / had as domain only the nonnegative real numbers. If\n complex numbers are allowed, then every number has two square roots (except 0,\n which has only one). Although this situation may seem better, it is in some ways\n worse; since the square roots of z are complex numbers, there is no clear criterion\n for selecting one root to be f(z), in preference to the other.\n\n [a, b] x [c, d]\n\n FIGURE 5\n\n —\n\n 26. Complex Functions 547\n - |-\n One way to define f is the following. We set f (0) = 0, and for z ≠ 0 we set  \n $$\n f(z) = \\overline{z} = \\text{Vil } (\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta).\n $$\n\n Clearly $(f(z))^* = z$, but the function f is discontinuous, since $\\theta$ is discontinuous.  \n As a matter of fact, it is impossible to find a continuous f such that $(f(z))^* = z$ for  \n all z. In fact, it is even impossible for f(z) to be defined for all z with $|z| = 1$. To  \n prove this by contradiction, we can assume that f(1) = 1 (since we could always  \n replace f by −f). Then we claim that for all $\\theta$ with $0 < \\theta < 2\\pi$ we have  \n\n $$\n (*) \\quad f(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) = \\cos 5\\theta + i\\sin 5\\theta.\n $$\n\n The argument for this is left to you (it is a standard type of least upper bound  \n argument). But (*) implies that  \n\n $$\n \\lim_{\\theta \\to 2\\pi} f(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) = \\cos 5\\theta + i\\sin 5\\theta,\n $$\n\n which is  \n $$\n f(1) = -1,\n $$\n\n even though $\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\to 1$ as $\\theta \\to 2\\pi$.

A similar argument shows that it is impossible to define continuous \"nth-root\"  \n functions for any $n > 2$.\n\n For continuous complex functions there are important analogues of certain the-  \n orems which describe the behavior of real-valued functions on closed intervals. A  \n natural analogue of the interval $[a, b]$ is the set of all complex numbers $z = x + iy$  \n with $a < x < b$ and $c < y < d$ (Figure 5).

It follows from Theorem 4 that ∑ a_n z^n  \n n=0  \n converges absolutely. Therefore, in this case possibility (2) is true.  \n\n Now suppose that S is bounded, and let R be the least upper bound of S. If  \n R = 0, then ∑ a_n z^n converges only for z = 0, so possibility (1) is true. Suppose,  \n n=0  \n\n on the other hand, that R > 0. Then if z is a complex number with |z| < R, there  \n is a number x in S with |z| < x. Once again, this means that ∑ a_n w^n converges  \n n=0  \n for some w with |z| < |w|, so that ∑ a_n z^n converges absolutely. Moreover, if  \n n=0  \n OO  \n |z| > R, then ∑ a_n z^n does not converge, since |z| is not in S.  \n n=0  \n\n The number R which occurs in case (3) is called the radius of convergence of  \n ∑ a_n z^n. In cases (1) and (2) it is customary to say that the radius of convergence  \n n=0  \n is 0 and ∞, respectively.

And yet there are still several basic facts about power series which have not\n been mentioned. Thus far, we have seldom considered power series centered at a,\n\n OO\n\n f(z) — Yo an(zZ —_ a)\",\n\n n=0\n FIGURE 6\n\n 27. Complex Power Series 565\n\n except for a = 0. This omission was adopted partly to simplify the exposition.\n For power series centered at a there are obvious versions of all the theorems in\n\n this chapter (the proofs require only trivial modifications): there is a number R\n OO\n\n (possibly O or \"‘oo\"') such that the series So an(z — a)\" converges absolutely for z\n - |-\n Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:\n\n n = 0  \n with |z − a| < R, and has unbounded terms for z with |z − a| > R; moreover, for  \n all z with |z − a| < R the function  \n $$\n f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n (z - a)^n\n $$  \n has derivative  \n $$\n f'(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n (z - a)^{n-1}\n $$  \n It is less straightforward to investigate the possibility of representing a function  \n as a power series centered at b, if it is already written as a power series centered  \n at a. If  \n $$\n f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n (z - a)^n\n $$  \n has radius of convergence R, and b is a point with |b − a| < R (Figure 6), then it  \n is true that f(z) can also be written as a power series centered at b,  \n $$\n f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n (z - b)^n\n $$  \n (the numbers $b_n$ are necessarily $f^{(n)}(b)/n!$); moreover, this series has radius of  \n convergence at least R − |b − a| (it may be larger).  \n\n We will not prove the facts mentioned in the previous paragraph, and there are  \n several other important facts we shall not prove. For example, if  \n $$\n f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n (z - a)^n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n (z - b)^n,\n $$  \n and g(b) = a, then we would expect that f ◦ g can be written as a power series  \n centered at b. All such facts could be proved now without introducing any basic  \n new ideas, but the proofs would not be as easy as the proofs about sums, products  \n and reciprocals of power series. The possibility of changing a power series centered  \n at a into one centered at b is quite a bit more involved, and the treatment of  \n f ◦ g requires still more skill. Rather than end this section with a tour de force  \n of computations, we will instead give a preview of \"complex analysis,\" one of  \n the most beautiful branches of mathematics, where all these facts are derived as  \n straightforward consequences of some fundamental results.\n - |-\n Power series were introduced in this chapter in order to provide complex functions which are differentiable. Since these functions are actually infinitely differentiable, it is natural to suppose that we have therefore selected only a very special collection of differentiable complex functions. The basic theorems of complex analysis show that this is not at all true:\n\n If a complex function is defined in some region A of the plane and is differentiable in A, then it is automatically infinitely differentiable in A. Moreover, for each point a in A the Taylor series for f at a will converge to f in any circle contained in A (Figure 7).\n\n These facts are among the first to be proved in complex analysis. It is impossible to give any idea of the proofs themselves—the methods used are quite different from anything in elementary calculus. If these facts are granted, however, then the facts mentioned before can be proved very easily.\n\n Suppose, for example, that f and g are functions which can be written as power series. Then, as we have shown, f and g are differentiable—it then follows from easy general theorems that f + g, f - g, 1/g and fg are also differentiable. Appealing to the results from complex analysis, it follows that they can be written as power series.\n\n We already know how to compute the power series for f + g, f - g and 1/g from those for f and g. It is also easy to guess how one would compute an expression for f ◦ g as a power series in (z — b) when we are given the power series expansions\n\n $$\n f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n (z - a)^n\n $$\n $$\n g(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k (z - b)^k\n $$\n with a = g(b) = b_0, so that\n\n $$\n g(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} b_k (z - b)^k\n $$\n\n First of all, we know how to compute the power series\n\n $$\n f(g(z) - a) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n (g(z) - a)^n\n $$\n\n and this power series will begin with (z - b)^1. Consequently, the coefficient of z^n in f(g(z)) can be determined from the coefficients of the power series for f and g.\n - |-\n f(g(z)) =) ar(g(z) — a)'\n 1=0\n can be calculated as a finite sum, involving only coefficients arising from the first n\n powers of g(z) —a.\n Similarly, if\n\n le @)\n\n f(z) = Do an(z — a)\"\n\n n=0\n\n has radius of convergence R, then f is differentiable in the region A = {z : |z—a| <\n R}. Thus, if b is in A, it is possible to write f as a power series centered at b,\n (A\n\n FIGURE 8\n\n 27. Complex Power Series 567\n\n which will converge in the circle of radius R — |b — a|.

This series may actually converge in a larger circle, because\n\n Yo anlz — a)\" may be the series for a function differentiable in a larger region\n n=0\n than A. For example, suppose that f(z) = 1/(1 + z*). Then f is differentiable,\n\n except at 7 and —1, where it 1s not defined.

We can easily predict the radius of convergence of this\n\n series: it 1S Vv I+ (5), the distance from 5 to i or —i (Figure 8).\n\n As an added incentive to investigate complex analysis further, one more result\n will be mentioned, which les quite near the surface, and which will be found in\n any treatment of the subject.\n\n For real z the values of sinz always lie between —1 and 1, but for complex z\n this is not at all true.

A result which comes quite early in complex analysis 1s\n the following:\n\n Liouville's Theorem: The only bounded entire functions are the constant functions.\n\n As a simple application of Liouville's Theorem, consider a polynomial function\n f(z) = 2\" +ay_1z\"\"| +++» +409,\n\n where n > I, so that f 1s not a constant.

But consider\n the function |\n\n fF)\n\n If f(z) were never 0, then g would be entire; since f(z) becomes large for large z,\n the function g would also be bounded, contradicting Liouville's Theorem.

But $ \\mathbb{Q} $ and $ \\mathbb{R} $, the two main protagonists of this story,\n have only been named, never defined. What has never been defined can never be analyzed thoroughly, and \"properties\" $ P_1—P_{13} $ must be considered assumptions,\n not theorems, about numbers. Nevertheless, the term \"axiom\" has been purposely\n avoided, and in this chapter the logical status of $ P_1-P_{13} $ will be scrutinized more\n carefully.\n - |-\n Like Q and R, the sets N and Z have also remained undefined. True, some\n talk about all four was inserted in Chapter 2, but those rough descriptions are far\n from a definition. 'I say, for example, that N consists of 1, 2, 3, etc., merely\n names some elements of N without identifying them (and the \"etc.\" is useless).\n The natural numbers can be defined, but the procedure is involved and not quite\n pertinent to the rest of the book. The Suggested Reading list contains references\n to this problem, as well as to the other steps that are required if one wishes to\n develop calculus from its basic logical starting point. 'The further development\n of this program would proceed with the definition of Z, in terms of N, and the\n definition of Q in terms of Z. This program results in a certain well-defined\n set Q, certain explicitly defined operations + and -, and properties P1—P12 as\n theorems. 'The final step in this program is the construction of R, in terms of Q.\n It is this last construction which concerns us. Assuming that Q has been defined,\n and that PI—P12 have been proved for Q, we shall ultimately define R and prove all\n of P1—P13 for R.\n\n Our intention of proving P!—P13 means that we must define not only real num-\n bers, but also addition and multiplication of real numbers. Indeed, the real num-\n bers are of interest only as a set together with these operations: how the real\n numbers behave with respect to addition and multiplication is crucial; what the\n real numbers may actually be is quite irrelevant. 'This assertion can be expressed in\n a meaningful mathematical way, by using the concept of a \"field,\" which includes\n as special cases the three important number systems of this book. This extraordi-\n nary important abstraction of modern mathematics incorporates the properties\n P1—P9 common to Q, R, and C. A field is a set F (of objects of any sort what-\n soever), together with two \"binary operations\" + and « defined on F (that is, two\n rules which associate to elements a and b in F, other elements a + b and a« b\n in F') for which the following conditions are satisfied:\n - |-\n (1) (a+b) +c=a+t+(b+c) for all a,b, and cin F.\n (2) 'There is some element 0 in F such that\n\n i)a+O0=a _ for all a in F,\n (1) for every a in F, there 1s some element b in F such that a +b = 0.\n\n 58 |\n\n 582 Epilogue\n\n (3) a+b=b+a _ for all a and bin F.\n (4) (aeb)*c=ae(bec) for all a,b, and c in F.\n (5) 'There is some element 1 in F such that 1 4 0 and\n GQ) ael=a_ for all a in F,\n (1) For every a in F with a # O, there is some element b in F such that\n aeb=1.\n (66)a*b=bea_ for all a and b in F.\n (7) as(b+c) =aeb+a-c for all a,b, and c in F.\n\n The familiar examples of fields are, as already indicated, Q, R, and C, with\n + and ~ being the familiar operations of + and -. It 1s probably unnecessary to\n explain why these are fields, but the explanation 1s, at any rate, quite brief. When\n + and « are understood to mean the ordinary + and -, the rules (1), (3), (4), (6), (7)\n are simply restatements of P1, P4, P5, P8, P9; the elements which play the role of 0\n and 1 are the numbers 0 and | (which accounts for the choice of the symbols 0, 1);\n and the number b in (2) or (5) is —a or a~!, respectively. (For this reason, in an\n arbitrary field F we denote by —a the element such that a + (—a) = 0, and by\n a~' the element such that a+ a7! = 1, for a £0.)\n\n In addition to Q, R, and G, there are several other fields which can be described\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\n It is easily. One example is the collection F; of all numbers a + bV/2 for a, b in Q.\n The operations + and + will, once again, be the usual + and - for real numbers.\n It is necessary to point out that these operations really do produce new elements\n of F; \n\n (a+ bV2) + (c+dvV2) =(a+c)+(b+d)V2, which is in F);\n (a 4+ bV2) (c+ dv2) = (ac + 2bd) + (be + ad)V2, which is in F}.\n\n Conditions (1), (3), (4), (6), (7) for a field are obvious for F;: since these hold for\n all real numbers, they certainly hold for all real numbers of the form a + b/2.\n Condition (2) holds because the number 0 = 0+0V2 is in F; and, for a =a+bv2\n in F,; the number B = (—a) + (—b)V2 in F; satisfies a + 6B = 0. Similarly,\n 1=1+40V2 is in Fj, so (51) is satisfied. ‘The verification of (51) is the only slightly\n\n difficult point. If a + b/2 # 0), then\n\n l\n a+bv2. = |:\n a+bvV2\n\n it is therefore necessary to show that |/(a + bV/2 )is in Fy. This is true because\n\n | Z a —bV2 _ a 4 (—b) J3\n a+bV2 (a—bV2)a+bV2) a%— 2b?  a®?—2b*\n\n (The division by a — b/2 is valid because the relation a — bV2 = 0 could be true\n only if a = b = 0 (since V2 is irrational) which is ruled out by the hypothesis\n a+bV24 0.)\n\n The next example of a field, F2, is considerably simpler in one respect: it con-\n tains only two elements, which we might as well denote by 0 and 1. ‘The operations\n - |-\n + and « are described by the following tables.\n\n + 0 ] ° 0 ]\n 0 0 ] 0 0 0\n ] ] 0 ] 0 ]\n\n The verification of conditions (1)—(7) are straightforward, case-by-case checks. For\n example, condition (1) may be proved by checking the 8 equations obtained by\n setting a, b,c =0 or 1. Notice that in this field 1 + 1 = 0; this equation may also\n be written 1 = -1.\n\n Our final example of a field is rather silly: F3 consists of all pairs (a, a) for a\n in R, and + and « are defined by\n\n (a,a) + (b,b) =(a+b,a+b),\n (a,a)*(b,b) = (a-b,a-b).\n\n (The + and - appearing on the right side are ordinary addition and multiplication\n for R.) The verification that F3 is a field is left to you as a simple exercise.\n\n A detailed investigation of the properties of fields is a study in itself, but for our\n purposes, fields provide an ideal framework in which to discuss the properties of\n numbers in the most economical way. For example, the consequences of P1—P9\n which were derived for \"numbers\" in Chapter 1 actually hold for any field; in\n particular, they are true for the fields Q, R, and C.\n\n Notice that certain common properties of Q, R, and C do not hold for all fields.\n For example, it is possible for the equation 1 + 1 = 0 to hold in some fields, and\n consequently a = b = b—a does not necessarily imply that a = b. For the field\n C the assertion 1 + 1 ≠ 0 was derived from the explicit description of Q; for the\n fields Q and R, however, this assertion was derived from further properties which\n do not have analogues in the conditions for a field. There is a related concept\n which does use these properties. An ordered field is a field F (with operations +\n and «) together with a certain subset P of F (the \"positive\" elements) with the\n following properties:\n - |-\n (8) For all a in F, one and only one of the following 1s true:\n (i) a=0,\n (1) a is in P,\n (ill) —a is in P.\n (9) If a and b are in P, then a + b is in P.\n (10) If a and b are in P, then a+ b is in P.\n\n We have already seen that the field C cannot be made into an ordered field.\n The field F2, with only two elements, likewise cannot be made into an ordered\n field: in fact, condition (8), applied to 1 = —1, shows that 1 must be in P; then (9)\n implies that 1 + 1 = 0 is in P, contradicting (8). On the other hand, the field F3,\n\n consisting of all numbers a + b√2 with a,b in Q, certainly can be made into\n an ordered field: let P be the set of all a + b√2 which are positive real numbers\n (in the ordinary sense). The field F3 can also be made into an ordered field; the\n description of P is left to you.\n\n It is natural to introduce notation for an arbitrary ordered field which corre-\n sponds to that used for Q and R: we define\n\n a > b if a − b is in P,\n a < b if b > a,\n\n a ≤ b if a < b or a = b,\n a ≥ b iff a > b or a = b.\n\n Using these definitions we can reproduce, for an arbitrary ordered field F,\n the definitions of Chapter 7:\n\n A set A of elements of F is bounded above if there is some x in F such\n that x ≥ a for all a in A. Any such x is called an upper bound for A. An\n element x of F is a least upper bound for A if x is an upper bound for A\n and x ≤ y for every y in F which is an upper bound for A.\n\n Finally, it is possible to state an analogue of property P13 for R; this leads to the\n last abstraction of this chapter:\n\n A complete ordered field is an ordered field in which every nonempty set\n which is bounded above has a least upper bound.\n - |-\n The consideration of fields may seem to have taken us far from the goal of constructing the real numbers. However, we are now provided with an intelligible means of formulating this goal. There are two questions which will be answered in the remaining two chapters:\n\n 1. Is there a complete ordered field?\n 2. Is there only one complete ordered field?\n\n Our starting point for these considerations will be Q, assumed to be an ordered field, containing N and Z as certain subsets. At one crucial point it will be necessary to assume another fact about Q:\n\n Let x be an element of Q with x > 0. Then for any y in Q there is some n in N such that nx > y.\n\n This assumption, which asserts that the rational numbers have the Archimedean property of the real numbers, does not follow from the other properties of an ordered field (for the example that demonstrates this conclusively see reference [14] of the Suggested Reading). The important point for us is that when Q is explicitly constructed, properties PI—P12 appear as theorems, and so does this additional\n assumption; if we really began from the beginning, no assumptions about Q would be necessary.\n\n PROBLEMS\n\n I.\n\n 4.\n\n Let F be the set {0, 1, 2} and define operations + and × on F by the following\n tables.

In order to prove that a complete ordered field exists we will\n have to explicitly describe one in detail; verifying conditions (1)—(10) for an ordered\n field will be a straightforward ordeal, but the description of the field itself, of the\n elements in it, is ingenious indeed.\n - |-\n At our disposal is the set of rational numbers, and from this raw material it is\n necessary to produce the field which will ultimately be called the real numbers.\n ‘To the uninitiated this must seem utterly hopeless—if only the rational numbers\n are known, where are the others to come from? By now we have had enough\n experience to realize that the situation may not be quite so hopeless as that casual\n consideration suggests. [he strategy to be adopted in our construction has already\n been used effectively for defining functions and complex numbers. Instead of\n trying to determine the \"real nature\" of these concepts, we settled for a definition\n that described enough about them to determine their mathematical properties\n completely.\n\n A simular proposal for defining real numbers requires a description of real num-\n bers in terms of rational numbers. The observation, that a real number ought to\n be determined completely by the set of rational numbers less than it, suggests a\n strikingly simple and quite attractive possibility: a real number might (and in fact\n eventually will) be described as a collection of rational numbers. In order to make\n this proposal effective, however, some means must be found for describing \"the\n set of rational numbers less than a real number\" without mentioning real num-\n bers, which are still nothing more than heuristic figments of our mathematical\n imagination.\n\n If A is to be regarded as the set of rational numbers which are less than the\n real number @, then A ought to have the following property: If x 1s in A and y\n is a rational number satisfying y < x, then y is in A. In addition to this property,\n the set A should have a few others. Since there should be some rational number\n x < a, the set A should not be empty. Likewise, since there should be some\n rational number x > a@, the set A should not be all of Q. Finally, if x < a, then\n there should be another rational number y with x < y < a@, so A should not\n contain a greatest member.\n - |-\n If we temporarily regard the real numbers as known, then it is not hard to  \n check (Problem 8-17) that a set A with these properties is indeed the set of rational  \n numbers less than some real number a. Since the real numbers are presently  \n in limbo, your proof, if you supply one, must be regarded only as an unofficial  \n comment on these proceedings. It will serve to convince you, however, that we  \n have not failed to notice any crucial property of the set A. There appears to be  \n no reason for hesitating any longer.\n\n 588  \n\n DEFINITION\n\n 29. Construction of the Real Numbers 589  \n\n A real number is a set @, of rational numbers, with the following four proper-  \n ties:  \n\n is some y nq with y > x.  \n\n The set of all real numbers is denoted by R.  \n\n Just to remind you of the philosophy behind our definition, here is an explicit  \n example of a real number:  \n\n a ={xinQ:x <Oorx' <2}.  \n\n It should be clear that @ is the real number which will eventually be known as √2,  \n but it is not an entirely trivial exercise to show that @ actually is a real number.  \n The whole point of such an exercise is to prove this using only facts about Q;  \n the hard part will be checking condition (4), but this has already appeared as a  \n problem in a previous chapter (finding out which one is up to you). Notice that  \n condition (4), although quite bothersome here, is really essential in order to avoid  \n ambiguity; without it both  \n\n {x inQ:x < √2}  \n and  \n\n {x inQ:x< 1}  \n\n would be candidates for the \"real number 1.\"\n - |-\n The shift from A to @ in our definition indicates both a conceptual and a no-\n tational concern. Henceforth, a real number 1s, by definition, a set of rational\n numbers. ‘This means, in particular, that a rational number (a member of Q)\n is not a real number; instead every rational number x has a natural counterpart\n which is a real number, namely, {y in Q.: y < x}. After completing the construc-\n tion of the real numbers, we can mentally throw away the elements of Q and\n agree that Q wil henceforth denote these special sets. For the moment, however,\n it will be necessary to work at the same time with rational numbers, real numbers\n (sets of rational numbers) and even sets of real numbers (sets of sets of rational\n numbers). Some confusion 1s perhaps inevitable, but proper notation should keep\n this to a minimum. Rational numbers will be denoted by lower case Roman letters\n (x, y, Z, a, b, c) and real numbers by lower case Greek letters (@, B, y); capital\n Roman letters (A, B, C) will be used to denote sets of real numbers.\n\n The remainder of this chapter 1s devoted to the definition of +, +, and P for R,\n and a proof that with these structures R is indeed a complete ordered field.\n\n We shall actually begin with the definition of P, and even here we shall work\n backwards. We first define a < f; later, when +, -, and 0 are available, we shall\n define P as the set of all @ with 0 <a, and prove the necessary properties for P.\n\n 590) = Epilogue\n\n THEOREM\n\n PROOF\n\n The reason for beginning with the definition of < is the simplicity of this concept\n in Our present setup:\n\n Defintion. If @ and B are real numbers, then a < B means that @ is contained in\n B (that is, every element of @ 1s also an element of 8), but a ¥ B.\n\n A repetition of the definitions of <, >, 2 would be stultifying, but it is interesting\n to note that < can now be expressed more simply than <; if @ and 8 are real\n numbers, then a S 6 if and only if @ 1s contained in £.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\n If A is a bounded collection of real numbers, it is almost obvious that A should\n have a least upper bound. Each @ in A 1s a collection of rational numbers; if these\n rational numbers are all put in one collection 6, then 6 is presumably sup A. In\n the proof of the following theorem we check all the little detauls which have not\n been mentioned, not least of which is the assertion that B zs a real number. (We\n will not bother numbering theorems in this chapter, since they all add up to one\n big Theorem: There is a complete ordered field.)\n\n If A is a set of real numbers and A ¥ @ and A is bounded above, then A has a\n least upper bound.\n\n Let B = {x : x isinsome ain A}. Then # 1s certainly a collection of rational\n numbers; the proof that 6 is a real number requires checking four facts.\n\n (1) Suppose that x is in B and y < x. The first condition means that x 1s in @\n for some a@ in A. Since @ is a real number, the assumption y < x implies\n that y is in qa. [Therefore it is certainly true that y 1s in B.\n\n (2) Since A 4 @, there is some @ in A. Since @ is a real number, there is some\n x nq. This means that x is in B, so B 4.\n\n (3) Since A 1s bounded above, there is some real number y such that a < y\n for every a in A. Since y 1s a real number, there is some rational number\n x which is not in y. Nowa < y means that @ is contained in y, so it 1s\n also true that x is not in @ for any a in A. This means that x 1s not in 6;\n sop #Q.\n\n (4) Suppose that x is in B. Then x 1s in @ for some @ in A. Since @ does not\n have a greatest member, there is some rational number y with x < y and y\n ina. But this means that y 1s in 6; thus 6 does not have a greatest member.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\n These four observations prove that B is a real number. The proof that 6 is the least upper bound of A is easier. If @ is in A, then clearly @ is contained in B; this means that a < f, so B is an upper bound for A. On the other hand, if y is an upper bound for A, then a@ ≤ y for every @ in A; this means that @ is contained in y, for every a in A, and this surely implies that B is contained in y. Thus, in turn, means that B ≤ y; thus £ is the least upper bound of A.\n\n The definition of + is both obvious and easy, but it must be complemented with a proof that this \"obvious\" definition makes any sense at all.\n\n 29. Construction of the Real Numbers 591\n\n Definition. If a and f are real numbers, then\n\n a + B = {x : x = y + z for some y in a and some z in f}.\n\n THEOREM. If a and f are real numbers, then a + B is a real number.\n\n PROOF. Once again four facts must be verified.\n\n (1) Suppose w < x for some x in a + B. Then x = y + z for some y in a and some z in B, which means that w < y + z, and consequently, w − y < z. This shows that w − y is in B (since z is in B, and B is a real number). Since w = y + (w − y), it follows that w is in a + B.\n\n (2) It is clear that a + B ≠ ∅, since a ∈ a and B ≠ ∅.\n\n (3) Since a ⊆ Q and B ⊆ Q, there are rational numbers a and b with a not in a and b not in B. Any x in a satisfies x < a (for if a < x, then condition (1) for a real number would imply that a is in a); similarly any y in B satisfies y < b. Thus x + y < a + b for any x ∈ a and y ∈ B. This shows that a + B ≠ Q, so a + B ⊆ Q.\n\n (4) Suppose that x and y are in a + B. Then x = y₁ + z₁ and y = y₂ + z₂ for some y₁, y₂ ∈ a and z₁, z₂ ∈ B. Then x + y = (y₁ + y₂) + (z₁ + z₂). Since y₁ + y₂ ∈ a and z₁ + z₂ ∈ B, it follows that x + y is in a + B. Thus, a + B is closed under addition.\n\n Therefore, a + B is a real number.\n - |-\n (4) If x is in a + B, then x = y + z for y in a@ and z in Bf. There are y' in a@ and z' in B with y < y' and z < z'; then x < y' + z' and y' + z' is in a + B. Thus a + B has no greatest member. J\n\n By now you can see how tiresome this whole procedure is going to be. Every time we mention a new real number, we must prove that it is a real number; this requires checking four conditions, and even when trivial they require concentration. \"There is really no help for this (except that it will be less boring if you check the four conditions for yourself). Fortunately, however, a few points of interest will arise now and then, and some of our theorems will be easy. In particular, two properties of + present no problems.\n\n THEOREM If a, b, and y are real numbers, then (a + b) + y = a + (b + y).\n\n PROOF Since (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) for all rational numbers x, y, and z, every member of (a + b) + y is also a member of a + (b + y), and vice versa. J\n\n THEOREM If a and b are real numbers, then a + b = b + a.\n PROOF — Left to you (even easier). J\n\n To prove the other properties of + we first define 0.\n Definition. 0 = {x ∈ Q: x < 0}.\n\n It is, thank goodness, obvious that 0 is a real number, and the following theorem is also simple.\n 592 Epilogue\n\n THEOREM\n PROOF\n If a is a real number, then a + 0 = a.\n\n If x is in a@ and y is in 0, then y < 0, so x + y < x. This implies that x + y is in a.\n Thus every member of a + 0 is also a member of a.\n - |-\n On the other hand, if x is in a, then there 1s a rational number y in @ such that\n y > x. Since x = y + (x — y), where y is in a, and x — y < O (so that x — y is\n in 0), this shows that x is in a + 0. Thus every member of @ is also a member\n\n of a +0. fj\n\n The reasonable candidate for —a would seem to be the set\n {x in Q : —x 1s not in @}\n\n (since —x not in a means, intuitively, that —x > a, so that x < —q@). But in certain\n cases this set will not even be a real number. Although a real number a@ does not\n have a greatest member, the set\n\n Q -a= {x nQ:x 1s not ing}\n\n may have a least element x9; when @ is a real number of this kind, the set\n {x : —x 1s not in a} will have a greatest element —xg. It 1s therefore necessary to\n introduce a slight modification into the definition of —a, which comes equipped\n with a theorem.\n\n Definition. If a is a real number, then\n\n —a = {x inQ :—-x 1s not ina, but — x is not the least element of Q — a}.\n\n If w is a real number, then —a@ 1s a real number.\n\n (1) Suppose that x isin —a@ and y < x. Then —y > —x. Since —x 1s not ina,\n it is also true that —y is not in a. Moreover, it is clear that —y is not the\n smallest element of Q — a, since —x 1s a smaller element. ‘This shows that\n yisin =a.\n\n (2) Since a # Q, there is some rational number y which is not in a. We can\n assume that y is not the smallest rational number in Q — @ (since y can\n always be replaced by any y' > y). Then —y 1s in —a. Thus —a ¥ @.\n - |-\n (3) Since a 4 @, there is some x in a. Then —x cannot possibly be in —a, so\n -« £Q.\n\n (4) If x is in —a@, then —x 1s not in a, and there 1s a rational number y < —x\n which is also not in a. Let z be a rational number with y < z < —x. Then\n z is also not in qa, and z 1s clearly not the smallest element of Q — a. So\n —z 1s in —a@. Since —z > x, this shows that —a does not have a greatest\n element. J\n\n The proof that a + (—a) = 0 is not entirely straightforward. The difficulties\n are not caused, as you might presume, by the finicky details in the definition\n of —a. Rather, at this point we require the Archimedean property of Q stated on\n page 584, which does not follow from P1—P12. This property 1s needed to prove\n the following lemma, which plays a crucial role in the next theorem.\n\n LEMMA\n\n Let a be a real number, and z a positive rational number. Then there are (Figure 1)\n rational numbers x in @, and y not in a, such that y — x = z. Moreover, we may\n assume that y is not the smallest element of Q — a.\n\n Suppose first that z is in a. If the numbers\n\n z, 2z, 3Z,...\n\n were all in a, then every rational number would be in @, since every rational num-\n ber w satisfies w < nz for some n, by the additional assumption on page 584. This\n contradicts the fact that a is a real number, so there is some k such that x = kz 1s\n in a@ and y = (k + 1)z is not in a. Clearly y — x = z.\n\n Moreover, if y happens to be the smallest element of Q — a@, let x\" > x be an\n element of a, and replace x by x', and y by y + (x' — x).\n - |-\n If z is not in a, there is a similar proof, based on the fact that the numbers (—n)z\n cannot all fail to be in a. J\n\n Z\n —\n a\n FIGURE | x y\n If @ is a real number, then\n a + (—a) — 0.\n\n Suppose x is in @ and y is in —a@. Then —y is not in a, so —y > x. Hence\n x+y <0,sox+yisin 0. Thus every member of a + (=a) is in 0.\n\n It is a little more difficult to go in the other direction. If z is in 0, then —z > 0.\n According to the lemma, there is some x in a, and some y not in q@, with y not the\n smallest element of Q — a, such that y — x = —z. This equation can be written\n x+(—y) =z. Since x is in a, and —y is in —a, this proves that z is in a + (—a). J\n\n Before proceeding with multiplication, we define the \"positive elements\" and\n prove a basic property:\n\n Definition. P = {a in R: a > O}.\n\n Notice that @ + 6 is clearly in P if a and 6 are.\n\n 994 Epilogue\n\n THEOREM\n\n PROOF\n\n THEOREM\n\n PROOF\n\n THEOREM\n\n If @ is a real number, then one and only one of the following conditions holds:\n\n (ai) a= 0,\n (1) @ is in P,\n (il) —a@ is in P.\n\n If @ contains any positive rational number, then @ certainly contains all negative\n rational numbers, so @ contains 0 and a # Q, i.e., a is in P. If @ contains no\n positive rational numbers, then one of two possibilities must hold:\n\n (1) @ contains all negative rational numbers; then a = 0.\n - |-\n (2) there is some negative rational number x which is not in a; it can be assumed that x 1s not the least element of Q — a (since x could be replaced by x/2 > x); then —a@ contains the positive rational number —x, so, as we have just proved, —a@ 1s in P.\n\n This shows that at least one of (1)-Qn) must hold. If @ = 0, it is clearly impossible for condition (11) or (1) to hold. Moreover, it 1s impossible that a > 0 and —a > 0 both hold, since this would imply that 0 = a + (—a) > 0. J\n\n Recall that @ > B was defined to mean that @ contains B, but is unequal to B. This definition was fine for proving completeness, but now we have to show that it is equivalent to the definition which would be made in terms of P. 'Thus, we must show that a — B > O 1s equivalent to a > B. This is clearly a consequence of the next theorem.\n\n If a, B, and y are real numbers and a > B, then a + y > B + y.\n\n The hypothesis a > B implies that B is contained in a; it follows immediately from the definition of + that B + y is contained in a + y. This shows that a + y = B + y. We can easily rule out the possibility of equality, for if\n\n a + y = B + y,\n\n then\n a = (a + y) + (—y) = (B + y) + (—y) = B,\n\n which is false. Thus a — y > B + y. §\n\n Multiplication presents difficulties of its own. If a, B > 0, then a + B can be defined as follows.\n\n Definition. If @ and B are real numbers and a, B > 0, then\n\n a · B = {z: z < 0 or z = x − y for some x in @ and y in B with x, y > 0}.\n\n If a and B are real numbers with a, B > 0, then @ · B is a real number.\n\n 29. Construction of the Real Numbers 595\n\n PROOF — As usual, we must check four conditions.\n - |-\n (1) Suppose $ w < z $, where $ z $ is a real number. If $ w < 0 $, then $ w $ is automatically in $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $. Suppose that $ w > 0 $. Then $ z > 0 $, so $ z = x - y $ for some positive $ x $ in $ \\mathbb{Q} $ and positive $ y $ in $ \\mathbb{B} $. Now\n\n $$\n wz = w(x - y)\n $$\n\n Since $ 0 < w < z $, we have $ \\frac{w}{z} < 1 $, so $ \\frac{w}{z} - x $ is negative. Thus $ w $ is in $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $.\n\n (2) Clearly $ \\mathbb{Q} - \\mathbb{B} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q} $.\n\n (3) If $ x $ is not in $ \\mathbb{Q} $, and $ y $ is not in $ \\mathbb{B} $, then $ x > x' $ for all $ x' \\in \\mathbb{Q} $, and $ y > y' $ for all $ y' \\in \\mathbb{B} $. Hence $ xy > x'y' $ for all such positive $ x' $ and $ y' $. So $ xy $ is not in $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $; thus $ \\mathbb{Q} - \\mathbb{B} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q} $.\n\n (4) Suppose $ w $ is in $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $, and $ w < 0 $. There is some $ x $ in $ \\mathbb{Q} $ with $ x > 0 $ and some $ y $ in $ \\mathbb{B} $ with $ y > 0 $. Then $ z = xy $ is in $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $ and $ z > w $. Now suppose $ w > 0 $. Then $ w = xy $ for some positive $ x $ in $ \\mathbb{Q} $ and some positive $ y $ in $ \\mathbb{B} $. Moreover, $ \\mathbb{Q} $ contains some $ x' > x $; if $ z = x'y $, then $ z > xy = w $, and $ z $ is in $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $. Thus $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $ does not have a greatest element.\n\n Notice that $ \\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbb{B} $ is clearly in $ P $ if $ \\mathbb{Q} $ and $ \\mathbb{B} $ are. This completes the verification of all properties of $ P $. To complete the definition of $ + $ we first define $ [a] $.\n\n Definition.

This proves that a - 1 = a if a > 0.\n If a < 0, then, applying the result just proved, we have\n\n a - 1 = - (a - 1) = - (a) = a.\n\n Finally, the theorem is obvious when a = 0. J\n\n Definition.

Four conditions must be checked.\n - |-\n (1) Suppose y < x, and x is in a@!. If y < 0, then y is in a. If y > 0, then x > 0, so 1/x is not in a. Since 1/y > 1/x, it follows that 1/y is not in a, and 1/y is clearly not the smallest element of Q — a, so y is in a@!.\n\n (2) Clearly a@! ≠ @.\n\n (3) Since a > 0, there is some positive rational number x in a. Then 1/x is not in a@!, so a@! ≠ Q.\n\n (4) Suppose x is in a@!. If x < 0, there is clearly some y in a@! with y > x because a@! contains some positive rationals. If x > 0, then 1/x is not in a. Since 1/x is not the smallest member of Q — a, there is a rational number y not in a, with y < 1/x. Choose a rational number z with y < z < 1/x. Then 1/z is in a@!, and 1/z > x. Thus a@! does not contain a largest member.\n\n In order to prove that a@! is really the multiplicative inverse of a, it helps to have another lemma, which is the multiplicative analogue of our first lemma.\n\n Let a be a real number with a > 0, and z a rational number with z > 1. Then there are rational numbers x in a, and y not in a, such that y/x = z.

Since all rational numbers x < 0 are also in 1, this shows that every member\n of aea7! isin 1.\n\n To prove the converse assertion, let z be in 1. If z < 0, then clearly z is in\n a+a-!.

Once again\n we must consider many cases, but do not despair. ‘The case when all numbers are\n positive contains an interesting point, and the other cases can all be taken care of\n very neatly.\n\n If a, B, and y are real numbers, thena-(B+y)=a-B+tacy.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\n Assume first that a, B, y > 0. Then both numbers in the equation contain all\n rational numbers < 0. A positive rational number in a + (B + y) is of the form\n x - (y + z) for positive x in a, y in B, and z in y. Since x - (y + z) = x - y + x - z,\n where x - y is a positive element of a + B, and x - z is a positive element of a + y,\n this number is also in a + B # a + y. Thus, every element of a + (B + y) is also in\n a + B # a + y.\n\n On the other hand, a positive rational number in a + B + a y is of the form\n x1 + y + x2 - z2 for positive x1, x2 in a, y in B, and z2 in y. If x1 < x2, then\n (x1 / x2) + y < y, so (x1 / x2) - y is in B. Thus\n\n x1 + y + x2 - z2 = x2[(x1 / x2) y + z2]\n\n is in a + (B + y). Of course, the same trick works if x2 < x1.\n To complete the proof it is necessary to consider the cases when a, B, and y\n are not all > 0. If any one of the three equals 0, the proof is easy and the cases\n involving a < 0 can be derived immediately once all the possibilities for B and\n y have been accounted for. Thus we assume a > 0 and consider three cases:\n B < 0, and B < 0, y > 0, and B > 0, y < 0. The first follows immediately from\n the case already proved, and the third follows from the second by interchanging B\n and y. Therefore we concentrate on the case B < 0, y > 0. There are then two\n possibilities:\n\n (1) B + y = 0. Then\n a * y = a * (|B| + y) + a * (-|B|),\n SO\n\n a - (B + y) = - (a - |B|) + a - y\n as B + y.\n - |-\n (2) B + y < 0.

Although long and frequently  \n tedious, this chapter contains results sufficiently important to be read in detail at  \n least once (and preferably not more than once!). For the first time we know that we  \n have not been operating in a vacuum—there is indeed a complete ordered field, the  \n theorems of this book are not based on assumptions which can never be realized. One interesting and horrid possibility remains: there may be several complete  \n ordered fields. If this is true, then the theorems of calculus are unexpectedly rich  \n in content, but the properties P1—P13 are disappointingly incomplete. The last  \n chapter disposes of this possibility; properties P1-P13 completely characterize the  \n real numbers—anything that can be proved about real numbers can be proved on  \n the basis of these properties alone.\n\n PROBLEMS\n\n There are only two problems in this set, but each asks for an entirely different  \n construction of the real numbers! The detailed examination of another construc-  \n tion is recommended only for masochists, but the main idea behind these other  \n constructions is worth knowing. The real numbers constructed in this chapter  \n might be called \"the algebraist's real numbers,\" since they were purposely defined  \n so as to guarantee the least upper bound property, which involves the ordering <,  \n an algebraic notion. The real number system constructed in the next problem  \n might be called \"the analyst's real numbers,\" since they are devised so that Cauchy  \n sequences will always converge.\n\n 1. Since every real number ought to be the limit of some Cauchy sequence  \n of rational numbers, we might try to define a real number to be a Cauchy  \n sequence of rational numbers. Since two Cauchy sequences might converge  \n to the same real number, however, this proposal requires some modifications.\n - |-\n (a) Define two Cauchy sequences of rational numbers $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$ to be equivalent (denoted by $\\{a_n\\} \\sim \\{b_n\\}$) if $\\lim (a_n - b_n) = 0$. Prove that  \n $\\{a_n\\} \\sim \\{a_n\\}$, that $\\{b_n\\} \\sim \\{a_n\\}$ if $\\{a_n\\} \\sim \\{b_n\\}$, and that $\\{a_n\\} \\sim \\{b_n\\}$ if $\\{a_n\\} \\sim \\{c_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\} \\sim \\{c_n\\}$.\n\n (b) Suppose that $\\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all sequences equivalent to $\\{a_n\\}$, and $\\mathcal{B}$ is the set of all sequences equivalent to $\\{b_n\\}$. Prove that either $\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B} = \\emptyset$ or $\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{B}$. If $\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B} \\neq \\emptyset$, then there is some $\\{c_n\\}$ in both $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$. Show that in this case $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ both consist precisely of those sequences equivalent to $\\{c_n\\}$.\n\n Part (b) shows that the collection of all Cauchy sequences can be split up into disjoint sets, each set consisting of all sequences equivalent to some fixed sequence. We define a real number to be such a collection, and denote the set of all real numbers by $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n (c) If $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ are real numbers, let $\\{a_n\\}$ be a sequence in $\\mathcal{A}$, and $\\{b_n\\}$ a sequence in $\\mathcal{B}$. Define $a + b$ to be the collection of all sequences equivalent to the sequence $\\{a_n + b_n\\}$. Show that $\\{a_n + b_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence and also show that this definition does not depend on the particular sequences $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$ chosen for $a$ and $b$. Check also that the analogous definition of multiplication is well defined.\n\n (d) Show that $\\mathbb{R}$ is a field with these operations; existence of a multiplicative inverse is the only interesting point to check.\n\n (e) Define the positive real numbers $\\mathbb{P}$ so that $\\mathbb{R}$ will be an ordered field.\n\n (f) Prove that every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges. Remember that if $\\{\\alpha_n\\}$ is a sequence of real numbers, then each $\\alpha_n$ is itself a collection of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\n This problem outlines a construction of \"the high-school student's real numbers.\" We define a real number to be a pair (a, {b,}), where a is an integer and {b,} is a sequence of natural numbers from 0 to 9, with the proviso that the sequence is not eventually 9; intuitively, this pair represents a + Σ b,10^{-n}. With this definition, a real number is a very concrete object, but the difficulties involved in defining addition and multiplication are formidable (how do you add infinite decimals without worrying about carrying digits infinitely far out?). A reasonable approach is outlined below; the trick is to use least upper bounds right from the start.\n\n (a) Define (a, {b,}) < (c, {d,}) if a < c, or if a = c and for some n we have b_n < d_n but b_j = d_j for j < n. Using this definition, prove the least upper bound property.\n\n (b) Given a = (a, {b_n}), define a_n = a + Σ b_n 10^{-n}; intuitively, a_n is the rational number obtained by changing all decimal places after the kth to 0. Conversely, given a rational number r of the form a + Σ b_n 10^{-n}, let r' denote the real number (a, {b'_n}), where b'_n = b_n for 1 ≤ n ≤ k and b'_n = 0 for n > k. Now for a = (a, {b_n}) and B = (c, {d_n}), define a + B = sup{(a_n + B_n)': : k a natural number} (the least upper bound exists by part (a)). If multiplication is defined similarly, then the verification of all conditions for a field is a straightforward task, not highly recommended. Once more, however, existence of multiplicative inverses will be the hardest.\n\n CHAPTER\n\n UNIQUENESS OF THE REAL NUMBERS\n - |-\n We shall now revert to the usual notation for real numbers, reserving boldface\n symbols for other fields which may turn up. Moreover, we will regard integers and\n rational numbers as special kinds of real numbers, and forget about the specific\n way in which real numbers were defined. In this chapter we are interested in only\n one question: are there any complete ordered fields other than R? The answer\n to this question, if taken literally, is \"yes.\" For example, the field F3 introduced in\n Chapter 28 is a complete ordered field, and it is certainly not R. This field is a\n \"silly\" example because the pair (a, a) can be regarded as just another name for\n the real number a; the operations\n\n (a,a) + (b,b) =(a+b,a+b),\n (a,a)·(b,b) =(a·b,a·b),\n\n are consistent with this renaming. This sort of example shows that any intelligent\n consideration of the question requires some mathematical means of discussing such\n renaming procedures.\n\n If the elements of a field F are going to be used to rename elements of R, then\n for each a in R there should correspond a \"name\" f(a) in F. The notation f(a)\n suggests that renaming can be formulated in terms of functions. In order to do\n this we will need a concept of function much more general than any which has\n occurred until now; in fact, we will require the most general notion of \"function\"\n used in mathematics. A function, in this general sense, is simply a rule which\n assigns to some things, other things. To be formal, a function is a collection of\n ordered pairs (of objects of any sort) which does not contain two distinct pairs with\n the same first element. The domain of a function f is the set A of all objects a\n such that (a, b) is in f for some b; this (unique) b is denoted by f(a). If f(a) is\n in the set B for all a in A, then f is called a function from A to B. For example,\n\n if f(x) = sinx for all x in R (and f is defined only for x in R), then f is a\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

This\n definition is so important that we restate it formally.\n - |-\n DEFINITION If F, and Fy are two fields, an isomorphism from F; to Fy is a function f\n from F, to Fy with the following properties:\n\n (1) If x ≡ y, then f(x) ≡ f(y).\n (2) If z is in F,, then z = f(x) for some x in F}.\n (3) If x and y are in F}, then\n\n f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y),\n f(x · y) = f(x) · f(y).\n\n If F, and Fy are ordered fields we also require:\n\n (4) If x < y, then f(x) < f(y).\n\n The fields F, and Fy are called isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between\n them. Isomorphic fields may be regarded as essentially the same—any important\n property of one will automatically hold for the other. Therefore, we can, and\n should, reformulate the question asked at the beginning of the chapter; if F is a\n complete ordered field it is silly to expect F to equal R —rather, we would like to\n know if F is isomorphic to R. In the following theorem, F will be a field, with\n operations + and ·, and \"positive elements\" P; we write a < b to mean that b—a\n is in P, and so forth.\n\n THEOREM\n\n PROOF\n\n 30. Uniqueness of the Real Numbers 603\n\n If F is a complete ordered field, then F is isomorphic to R.\n\n Since two fields are defined to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between\n them, we must actually construct a function f from R to F which is an isomor-\n phism. We begin by defining f on the integers as follows:\n\n f(0) = 0,\n f(n) = 1 + ... + 1 for n > 0,\n n times\n f(n) = - (1 + ... + 1) for n < 0.\n n times\n\n It is easy to check that\n\n f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n),\n f(m · n) = f(m) · f(n),\n\n for all integers m and n, and it is convenient to denote f(n) by n. We then\n define f on the rational numbers by\n\n f(m/n) = f(m) / f(n).\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled.

Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\n  (notice that the n-fold sum 1 +--- +140 if n > 0, since F 1s an ordered field).\n This definition makes sense because if m/n = k/1, then ml = nk, somel = ken, so\n m+n! =k-I7!. It is easy to check that\n\n fri +r2) = flr) & f(r2),\n fri -r2) = fri) * f(r2),\n\n for all rational numbers r; and rz, and that f(r;) < f(r2) if ry <r.\n\n The definition of f(x) for arbitrary x 1s based on the now familar idea that\n any real number is determined by the rational numbers less than it. For any x\n in R, let A, be the subset of F consisting of all f(r), for all rational numbers\n r <x. The set A, is certainly not empty, and it 1s also bounded above, for if ro\n is a rational number with ro > x, then f(ro) > f(r) for all f(r) in Ay. Since F\n is a complete ordered field, the set A, has a least upper bound; we define f(x) as\n sup Ax.\n\n We now have f(x) defined in two different ways, first for rational x, and then for\n any x. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to show that these two definitions\n agree for rational x. In other words, if x is a rational number, we want to show\n that\n\n sup A, = f(x),\n\n where f(x) here denotes m/n, for x = m/n. This is not automatic, but depends\n on the completeness of F; a slight digression 1s thus required.\n Since F is complete, the elements\n\n 1+...4+1 for natural numbers n\n ee\n\n n umes\n 604 Lpilogue\n\n form a set which 1s not bounded above; the proof is exactly the same as the proof\n for R (Theorem 8-2). The consequences of this fact for R have exact analogues\n in F: in particular, if a and b are elements of F with a < 5, then there is a rational\n\n number r such that\n a< f(r) <b.\n - |-\n Having made this observation, we return to the proof that the two definitions of f(x) agree for rational x. If y is a rational number with y < x, then we have already seen that f(y) < f(x). Thus every element of A, is < f(x). Consequently,\n\n sup A, ≤ f(x).\n\n On the other hand, suppose that we had\n sup A, < f(x).\n\n Then there would be a rational number r such that\n\n sup A, < f(r) < f(x).\n\n But the condition f(r) < f(x) means that r < x, which means that f(r) is in the set A,; this clearly contradicts the condition sup A, < f(r). This shows that the original assumption is false, so\n\n sup A, = f(x).\n\n We thus have a certain well-defined function f from R to F. In order to show that f is an isomorphism we must verify conditions (1)—(4) of the definition. We will begin with (4).\n\n If x and y are real numbers with x < y, then clearly A, is contained in A,y. Thus\n\n f(x) = sup A, ≤ sup A,y = f(y).\n\n To rule out the possibility of equality, notice that there are rational numbers r and s with\n x < r < s < y.\n\n We know that f(r) < f(s). It follows that\n\n f(x) ≤ f(r) < f(s) ≤ f(y).\n\n This proves (4).\n\n Condition (1) follows immediately from (4): If x ≠ y, then either x < y or y < x; in the first case f(x) < f(y), and in the second case f(y) < f(x); in either case f(x) ≠ f(y).\n\n To prove (2), let a be an element of F, and let B be the set of all rational numbers r with f(r) < a. The set B is not empty, and it is also bounded above, because there is a rational number s with f(s) > a, so that f(s) > f(r) for r in B, which implies that s > r. Let x be the least upper bound of B; we claim that f(x) = a. In order to prove this it suffices to eliminate the alternatives\n - |-\n f(x) < a,  \n a < f(x).  \n 30. Uniqueness of the Real Numbers 605  \n\n In the first case there would be a rational number r with  \n\n I(x) < f(r) < a.  \n\n But this means that x < r and that r is in B, which contradicts the fact that  \n x = sup B. In the second case there would be a rational number r with  \n\n a < f(r) < f(x).  \n\n This implies that r < x. Since x = sup B, this means that r < s for some s in B.  \n Hence  \n\n f(r) < f(s) < a,  \n\n again a contradiction. Thus f(x) = a, proving (2).  \n To check (3), let x and y be real numbers and suppose that f(x + y) ≠  \n f(x) + f(y). Then either  \n\n f(x + y) < f(x) + f(y) or f(x) + f(y) < f(x + y).  \n\n In the first case there would be a rational number r such that  \n\n f(x + y) < f(r) < f(x) + f(y).  \n\n But this would mean that  \n x + y < r.  \n\n Therefore r could be written as the sum of two rational numbers  \n r = r1 + r2, where x < r1 and y < r2.  \n Then, using the facts checked about f for rational numbers, it would follow that  \n\n f(r) = f(r1 + r2) = f(r1) + f(r2) > f(x) + f(y),  \n\n a contradiction. The other case is handled similarly.  \n Finally, if x and y are positive real numbers, the same sort of reasoning shows  \n that  \n\n f(x − y) = f(x) − f(y);  \n\n the general case is then a simple consequence.\n - |-\n This theorem brings to an end our investigation of the real numbers, and resolves\n any doubts about them: ‘There is a complete ordered field and, up to isomorphism,\n only one complete ordered field. It is an important part of a mathematical educa-\n tion to follow a construction of the real numbers in detail, but it is not necessary\n to refer ever again to this particular construction. It is utterly irrelevant that a real\n number happens to be a collection of rational numbers, and such a fact should\n never enter the proof of any important theorem about the real numbers. Reason-\n able proofs should use only the fact that the real numbers are a complete ordered\n field, because this property of the real numbers characterizes them up to isomor-\n phism, and any significant mathematical property of the real numbers will be true\n for all isomorphic fields. ‘To be candid I should admit that this last assertion is just\n a prejudice of the author, but it is one shared by almost all other mathematicians.\n\n 606 Epilogue\n\n PROBLEMS\n\n I.\n\n Let f be an isomorphism from F to F'.\n\n (a) Show that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1.

Consequently, there is an attempt to achieve diversity, but no pretense of being complete. The present plethora of mathematics books would make such an undertaking almost hopeless in any case, and since I have tried to encourage independent reading, the more standard a text, the less likely it is to appear here. In some cases, this philosophy may seem to have been carried to extremes, as some entries in the list cannot be read by a student just finishing a first course of calculus until several years have elapsed. Nevertheless, there are many selections which can be read now, and I can't believe that it hurts to have some idea of what lies ahead.\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

The article in the original French is in\n\n [60] Oeuvres Completes d'Abel.\n\n It first appeared in a German translation in the Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, Volume 1, 1826. \"To compound the difficulties, these references will usually be available only in university libraries. Yet the study of this paper will probably be as valuable as any other reading mentioned here. The reason is suggested by a remark of Abel himself, who attributed his profound knowledge of mathematics to the fact that he read the masters, rather than the pupils.\n\n ANSWERS\n TO SELECTED\n PROBLEMS\n CHAPTER 1\n\n 10.\n\n 11.\n\n 12.\n\n 619\n\n (1)\n (2)\n (iii)\n (iv)\n (v)\n (vi)\n\n $ l = a^{-1}a = a^7(a x) = (a^7a)x = 1 \\cdot x = x $.\n If $ x^* = y^* $, then $ 0 = x^* - y^* = (x - y)(x + y) $, so either $ x - y = 0 $ or\n $ x + y = 0 $, that is, either $ x = -y $ or $ x = y $.\n\n Replace $ y $ by $ -y $ in (iv).\n\n One step requires dividing by $ x - y = 0 $.\n\n (1)\n (2)\n (iii)\n (iv)\n (v)\n - |-\n The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF.

This requires that 1 — x > 0, and then our inequality is equivalent to x² + y² < (1 — x)², or  \n x < (1 — y²)/2 (and conversely this inequality implies that x < (1 — y²)/2 so that 1 — x > 0 holds). The set of points x + iy with x = (1 — y²)/2 is the  \n parabola pointing along the second axis, with the point 5 + Oi closest to the origin, and which passes through the points 0 + i and 0 — i; the  \n desired set of complex numbers is the set of points inside this parabola.\n\n | x + iy |² = x² + y² = x² + (-y)² = |x — iy|².\n\n (7 + 2)/2 = [(x + iy) + (-iy)]/2 = x.\n\n (z — z̄)/2i = [(x + iy) — (x — iy)]/2i = y.\n\n |z|² + |z — w|² = (z + z̄ + w + w̄)/2 + (2 — ww̄ — w) = 2|z|² + 2|w|² = 2(|z|² + |w|²). Geometrically, this says that the sum of the squares of the  \n diagonals of a parallelogram equal the sum of the squares of the sides.\n\n 662 Answers to Selected Problems\n\n CHAPTER 27\n\n (ii)  \n Converges absolutely, since |(1 + i)/n!| = (2ⁿ)/n!, and Σ(2ⁿ)/n!

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Properties of Real Numbers**\n\nUsing the definitions of the properties of addition and multiplication provided in the text, simplify the expression $ 3x + 2(5 - x) $.\n- **Step 1**: Apply the distributive property to expand the terms.\n- **Step 2**: Use the associative and commutative properties to combine like terms.\n- **Step 3**: Justify each step by referencing the specific property (e.g., "The distributive property states that...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final simplified expression must be correct, and you must explicitly identify at least two distinct properties used in your reasoning.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rational Exponent Definitions**\n\nEvaluate $ 16^{3/4} $ using the three definitions of rational exponents provided in the text:\n- **Definition 1**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^{1/n})^m $\n- **Definition 2**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $ \n- **Definition 3**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Compute the value using Definition 1. Show all intermediate steps, including simplifying radicals and exponents.\n- **Part B**: Verify that your result matches the value obtained using Definition 2. Explain why Definitions 1 and 2 yield the same outcome despite their different order of operations.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s repeated emphasis on equivalent forms (e.g., $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $) ensures consistency in simplifying expressions with rational exponents.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of all three definitions and explicitly link their equivalence to the properties of exponents.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Number Classifications**\n\nThe text defines natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. Consider the number $ \sqrt{16} $.\n- **Part A**: Determine which sets (natural, whole, integer, rational, or irrational) this number belongs to. Justify your answer using definitions from the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why $ \sqrt{16} $ is not classified as an irrational number, despite involving a square root. Use logical reasoning based on the distinction between rational and irrational numbers provided in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All numbers with exponents are irrational." Your example must reference at least two sets from the text (e.g., integers, rationals) and clarify how they relate to exponentiation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the hierarchy of real number classifications and demonstrate an understanding of why certain numbers fall into specific categories.'
