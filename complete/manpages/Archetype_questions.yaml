This can come in handy when using widgets to build\n\t      applications.\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The Archetype class is the basis for all [incr Tk] mega-widgets.  It\n       keeps track of component widgets and provides methods like \"configure\"\n       and \"cget\" that are used to access the composite configuration options.\n       Each component widget must be registered with the Archetype base class\n       using the \"itk_component add\" method.  When the component is\n       registered, its configuration options are integrated into the composite\n       option list.  Configuring a composite option like \"-background\" causes\n       all of the internal components to change their background color.\n\n       It is not used as a widget by itself, but is used as a base class for\n       more specialized widgets.  The Widget base class inherits from\n       Archetype, and adds a Tk frame which acts as the \"hull\" for the mega-\n       widget.\tThe Toplevel base class inherits from Archetype, but adds a Tk\n       toplevel which acts as the \"hull\".\n\n       Each derived class must invoke the itk_initialize method within its\n       constructor, so that all options are properly integrated and\n       initialized in the composite list."

Individual components integrate their own\n\t      configuration options onto the composite list when they are\n\t      registered by the \"itk_component add\" method.\n\n       pathName component ?name? ?command arg arg ...?\n\t      Used to query or access component widgets within a mega-widget.\n\t      With no arguments, this returns a list of symbolic names for\n\t      component widgets that are accessible in the current scope.  The\n\t      symbolic name for a component is established when it is\n\t      registered by the \"itk_component add\" method.  Note that\n\t      component widgets obey any public/protected/private access\n\t      restriction that is in force when the component is created.\n\n\t      If a symbolic name is specified, this method returns the window\n\t      path name for that component.\n\n\t      Otherwise, the command and any remaining arg arguments are\n\t      invoked as a method on the component with the symbolic name\n\t      name.  This provides a well-defined way of accessing internal\n\t      components without relying on specific window path names, which\n\t      are really details of the implementation.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.\n\n\t      In this case, the options refer to composite configuration\n\t      options for the mega-widget.  Individual components integrate\n\t      their own configuration options onto the composite list when\n\t      they are registered by the \"itk_component add\" method."

It can contain any\n\t      of the following commands:\n\n\t      ignore option ?option option ...?\n\t\t     Removes one or more configuration options from the\n\t\t     composite list.  All options are ignored by default, so\n\t\t     the ignore command is only used to negate the effect of a\n\t\t     previous keep or rename command.  This is useful, for\n\t\t     example, when the some of the options added by the usual\n\t\t     command should not apply to a particular component, and\n\t\t     need to be ignored.\n\n\t      keep option ?option option ...?\n\t\t     Integrates one or more configuration options into the\n\t\t     composite list, keeping the name the same.  Whenever the\n\t\t     mega-widget option is configured, the new value is also\n\t\t     applied to the current component.\tOptions like\n\t\t     \"-background\" and \"-cursor\" are commonly found on the\n\t\t     keep list.\n\n\t      rename option switchName resourceName resourceClass\n\t\t     Integrates the configuration option into the composite\n\t\t     list with a different name.  The option will be called\n\t\t     switchName on the composite list.\tIt will also be\n\t\t     modified by setting values for resourceName and\n\t\t     resourceClass in the X11 resource database.  The\n\t\t     \"-highlightbackground\" option is commonly renamed to\n\t\t     \"-background\", so that when the mega-widget background\n\t\t     changes, the background of the focus ring will change as\n\t\t     well.\n\n\t      usual ?tag?\n\t\t     Finds the usual option-handling commands for the\n\t\t     specified tag name and executes them.  If the tag is not\n\t\t     specified, then the widget class name is used as the tag\n\t\t     name.  The \"usual\" option-handling commands are\n\t\t     registered via the usual command.\n\n       If the optionCmds script is not specified, the usual option-handling\n       commands associated with the class of the component widget are used by\n       default."
