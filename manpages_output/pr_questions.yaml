When\n     multiple input files are specified, each is read, formatted, and written\n     to standard output.  By default, the input is separated into 66-line\n     pages, each with\n\n     •\t A 5-line header with the page number, date, time, and the pathname of\n\t the file.\n\n     •\t A 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines.\n\n     If standard output is associated with a terminal, diagnostic messages are\n     suppressed until the pr utility has completed processing.\n\n     When multiple column output is specified, text columns are of equal\n     width.  By default text columns are separated by at least one <blank>.\n     Input lines that do not fit into a text column are truncated.  Lines are\n     not truncated under single column output."
