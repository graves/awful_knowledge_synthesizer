All functionality\n       provided here can be reached through a subcommand of this command.\n\n       Note: As of version 2.2 of this package a critcl based C implementation\n       is available. This implementation however requires Tcl 8.4 to run.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::struct::set empty set\n\t      Returns a boolean value indicating if the set is empty (true),\n\t      or not (false).\n\n       ::struct::set size set\n\t      Returns an integer number greater than or equal to zero. This is\n\t      the number of elements in the set. In other words, its\n\t      cardinality.\n\n       ::struct::set contains set item\n\t      Returns a boolean value indicating if the set contains the\n\t      element item (true), or not (false).\n\n       ::struct::set union ?set1...?\n\t      Computes the set containing the union of set1, set2, etc., i.e.\n\t      \"set1 + set2 + ...\", and returns this set as the result of the\n\t      command.\n\n       ::struct::set intersect ?set1...?\n\t      Computes the set containing the intersection of set1, set2,\n\t      etc., i.e. \"set1 * set2 * ...\", and returns this set as the\n\t      result of the command.\n\n       ::struct::set difference set1 set2\n\t      Computes the set containing the difference of set1 and set2,\n\t      i.e. (\"set1 - set2\") and returns this set as the result of the\n\t      command.\n\n       ::struct::set symdiff set1 set2\n\t      Computes the set containing the symmetric difference of set1 and\n\t      set2, i.e. (\"(set1 - set2) + (set2 - set1)\") and returns this\n\t      set as the result of the command.\n\n       ::struct::set intersect3 set1 set2\n\t      This command is a combination of the methods intersect and\n\t      difference.  It returns a three-element list containing\n\t      \"set1*set2\", \"set1-set2\", and \"set2-set1\", in this order. In\n\t      other words, the intersection of the two parameter sets, and\n\t      their differences.\n\n       ::struct::set equal set1 set2\n\t      Returns a boolean value indicating if the two sets are equal\n\t      (true) or not (false).\n\n       ::struct::set include svar item\n\t      The element item is added to the set specified by the variable\n\t      name in svar. The return value of the command is empty. This is\n\t      the equivalent of lappend for sets. If the variable named by\n\t      svar does not exist it will be created.\n\n       ::struct::set exclude svar item\n\t      The element item is removed from the set specified by the\n\t      variable name in svar. The return value of the command is empty.\n\t      This is a near-equivalent of lreplace for sets.\n\n       ::struct::set add svar set\n\t      All the element of set are added to the set specified by the\n\t      variable name in svar. The return value of the command is empty.\n\t      This is like the method include, but for the addition of a whole\n\t      set. If the variable named by svar does not exist it will be\n\t      created.\n\n       ::struct::set subtract svar set\n\t      All the element of set are removed from the set specified by the\n\t      variable name in svar. The return value of the command is empty.\n\t      This is like the method exclude, but for the removal of a whole\n\t      set.\n\n       ::struct::set subsetof A B\n\t      Returns a boolean value indicating if the set A is a true subset\n\t      of or equal to the set B (true), or not (false).\n\nREFERENCES\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
