Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `basename`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nBASENAME(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t   BASENAME(1)\n\nNAME\n     basename, dirname – return filename or directory portion of pathname\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     basename string [suffix]\n     basename [-a] [-s suffix] string [...]\n     dirname string [...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The basename utility deletes any prefix ending with the last slash ‘/’\n     character present in string (after first stripping trailing slashes), and\n     a suffix, if given.  The suffix is not stripped if it is identical to the\n     remaining characters in string.  The resulting filename is written to the\n     standard output.  A non-existent suffix is ignored.  If -a is specified,\n     then every argument is treated as a string as if basename were invoked\n     with just one argument.  If -s is specified, then the suffix is taken as\n     its argument, and all other arguments are treated as a string.\n\n     The dirname utility deletes the filename portion, beginning with the last\n     slash ‘/’ character to the end of string (after first stripping trailing\n     slashes), and writes the result to the standard output."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the basename command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use basename to extract the filename from a full path such as '/home/user/document.txt'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using basename with the -s option to remove a specific suffix from a filename like 'report_2023.csv'?
