Defaults to 1,2, i.e., uses any SPF\n       records that are available.  Records of a higher version are preferred.\n\n   Legacy Usage\n       spfquery versions before 2.500 featured the following usage forms,\n       which are discouraged but still supported for backwards compatibility:\n\n       The --helo form checks if the given ip-address is an authorized SMTP\n       sender for the \"HELO\" hostname given as the identity (so-called \"HELO\"\n       check).\n\n       The --mfrom form checks if the given ip-address is an authorized SMTP\n       sender for the envelope sender email-address (or domain) given as the\n       identity (so-called \"MAIL FROM\" check).\tIf a domain is given instead\n       of an e-mail address, \"postmaster\" will be substituted for the\n       localpart.\n\n       The --pra form checks if the given ip-address is an authorized SMTP\n       sender for the PRA (Purported Responsible Address) e-mail address given\n       as the identity.\n\n   Other Usage\n       The --version form prints version information of spfquery.  The --help\n       form prints usage information for spfquery.\n\nOPTIONS\n   Standard Options\n       The preferred and legacy forms optionally take any of the following\n       OPTIONS:\n\n       --default-explanation string\n       --def-exp string\n\t   Use the specified string as the default explanation if the\n\t   authority domain does not specify an explanation string of its own.\n\n       --hostname hostname\n\t   Use hostname as the host name of the local system instead of auto-\n\t   detecting it.\n\n       --keep-comments\n       --no-keep-comments\n\t   Do (not) print any comments found when reading from a file or from\n\t   standard input.\n\n       --sanitize (currently ignored)\n       --no-sanitize (currently ignored)\n\t   Do (not) sanitize the output by condensing consecutive white-space\n\t   into a single space and replacing non-printable characters with\n\t   question marks.  Enabled by default.\n\n       --debug (currently ignored)\n\t   Print out debug information.\n\n   Black Magic Options\n       Several options that were supported by earlier versions of spfquery are\n       considered black magic (i.e. potentially dangerous for the innocent\n       user) and are thus disabled by default.\tIf the Mail::SPF::BlackMagic\n       Perl module is installed, they may be enabled by specifying\n       --enable-black-magic.\n\n       --max-dns-interactive-terms n\n\t   Evaluate a maximum of n DNS-interactive mechanisms and modifiers\n\t   per SPF check.  Defaults to 10.  Do not override the default unless\n\t   you know what you are doing!\n\n       --max-name-lookups-per-term n\n\t   Perform a maximum of n DNS name look-ups per mechanism or modifier.\n\t   Defaults to 10.  Do not override the default unless you know what\n\t   you are doing!\n\n       --authorize-mxes-for email-address|domain,...\n\t   Consider all the MXes of the comma-separated list of email-\n\t   addresses and domains as inherently authorized.\n\n       --tfwl\n\t   Perform \"trusted-forwarder.org\" accreditation checking.\n\n       --guess spf-terms\n\t   Use spf-terms as a default record if no SPF record is found.\n\n       --local spf-terms\n\t   Process spf-terms as local policy before resorting to a default\n\t   result (the implicit or explicit \"all\" mechanism at the end of the\n\t   domain's SPF record).  For example, this could be used for white-\n\t   listing one's secondary MXes: \"mx:mydomain.example.org\".\n\n       --override domain=spf-record\n       --fallback domain=spf-record\n\t   Set overrides and fallbacks.  Each option can be specified multiple\n\t   times.  For example:\n\n\t       --override example.org='v=spf1 -all'\n\t       --override '*.example.net'='v=spf1 a mx -all'\n\t       --fallback example.com='v=spf1 -all'\n\nRESULT CODES\n       pass\t   The specified IP address is an authorized SMTP sender for\n\t\t   the identity.\n\n       fail\t   The specified IP address is not an authorized SMTP sender\n\t\t   for the identity.\n\n       softfail    The specified IP address is not an authorized SMTP sender\n\t\t   for the identity, however the authority domain is still\n\t\t   testing out its SPF policy.\n\n       neutral\t   The identity's authority domain makes no assertion about\n\t\t   the status of the IP address.\n\n       permerror   A permanent error occurred while evaluating the authority\n\t\t   domain's policy (e.g., a syntax error in the SPF record).\n\t\t   Manual intervention is required from the authority domain.\n\n       temperror   A temporary error occurred while evaluating the authority\n\t\t   domain's policy (e.g., a DNS error).  Try again later.\n\n       none\t   There is no applicable SPF policy for the identity domain.\n\nEXIT CODES\n\t Result    | Exit code\n\t-----------+-----------\n\t pass\t   |\t 0\n\t fail\t   |\t 1\n\t softfail  |\t 2\n\t neutral   |\t 3\n\t permerror |\t 4\n\t temperror |\t 5\n\t none\t   |\t 6\n\nEXAMPLES\n\t   spfquery --scope mfrom --id user@example.com --ip 1.2.3.4\n\t   spfquery --file test_data\n\t   echo \"127.0.0.1 user@example.com helohost.example.com\" | spfquery -f -\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n       spfquery has undergone the following interface changes compared to\n       earlier versions:\n\n       2.500\n\t   •   A new preferred usage style for performing individual SPF\n\t       checks has been introduced.  The new style accepts a unified\n\t       --identity option and an optional --scope option that specifies\n\t       the type (scope) of the identity.  In contrast, the legacy\n\t       usage style requires a separate usage form for every supported\n\t       scope.  See \"Preferred usage\" and \"Legacy usage\" for details.\n\n\t   •   The former \"unknown\" and \"error\" result codes have been renamed\n\t       to \"permerror\" and \"temperror\", respectively, in order to\n\t       comply with RFC 4408 terminology.\n\n\t   •   SPF checks with an empty identity are no longer supported.  In\n\t       the case of an empty \"MAIL FROM\" SMTP transaction parameter,\n\t       perform a check with the \"helo\" scope directly.\n\n\t   •   The --debug and --(no-)sanitize options are currently ignored\n\t       by this version of spfquery.  They will again be supported in\n\t       the future.\n\n\t   •   Several features that were supported by earlier versions of\n\t       spfquery are considered black magic and thus are now disabled\n\t       by default.  See \"Black Magic Options\".\n\n\t   •   Several option names have been deprecated.  This is a list of\n\t       them and their preferred synonyms:\n\n\t\t Deprecated options  | Preferred options\n\t\t---------------------+-----------------------------\n\t\t --sender, -s\t     | --mfrom\n\t\t --ipv4, -i\t     | --ip-address, --ip\n\t\t --name \t     | --hostname\n\t\t --max-lookup-count, | --max-dns-interactive-terms\n\t\t   --max-lookup      |\n\t\t --rcpt-to, -r\t     | --authorize-mxes-for\n\t\t --trusted\t     | --tfwl\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Mail::SPF, spfd(8)\n\n       <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4408>\n\nAUTHORS\n       This version of spfquery is a complete rewrite by Julian Mehnle\n       <julian@mehnle.net>, based on an earlier version written by Meng Weng\n       Wong <mengwong+spf@pobox.com> and Wayne Schlitt <wayne@schlitt.net>.\n\nperl v5.34.0\t\t\t  2024-12-14\t\t\t   SPFQUERY(1)"
