It has 5 different modes,\n     as shown in the SYNOPSIS above:\n\n     1.   Create a product archive from a bundle (e.g. for the Mac App Store).\n\t  If you have a self-contained bundle (e.g. an app) that always gets\n\t  installed to the same location (e.g.\t/Applications), specify the\n\t  bundle and install path using the --component option. You can\n\t  specify additional requirements using a PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS\n\t  PROPERTY LIST.  When you specify a bundle, productbuild\n\t  automatically creates a component package, much like pkgbuild(1),\n\t  and synthesizes a distribution file."

When you use\n\t  xcodebuild(1) with the install action, the result is a destination\n\t  root, either under /tmp, or in whatever location you specify with\n\t  the Xcode DSTROOT setting. Use the productbuild --root option to\n\t  specify that destination root directory and its install path.  You\n\t  can specify additional requirements using a PRE-INSTALL REQUIREMENTS\n\t  PROPERTY LIST.  When you specify a root, productbuild automatically\n\t  creates a component package, much like pkgbuild(1), and synthesizes\n\t  a distribution file.\n\n     4.   Create a product archive using a distribution file. If you have a\n\t  distribution file, use the --distribution option to specify the path\n\t  to it, and the --package-path option to specify the directory where\n\t  the component packages are found (if they are not in the current\n\t  working directory). All packages referenced by the distribution will\n\t  be incorporated into the resulting product archive."

    Manpage text:

    productbuild will embed the signing certificate in the product archive,
         as well as any intermediate certificates that are found in the keychain.
         If you need to embed additional certificates to form a chain of trust
         between the signing certificate and a trusted root certificate on the
         system, use the --cert option to give the Common Name of the intermediate
         certificate. Multiple --cert options may be used to embed multiple
         intermediate certificates.

         The signature can optionally include a trusted timestamp. This is enabled
         by default when signing with a Developer ID identity, but it can be
         enabled explicitly using the --timestamp option. A timestamp server must
         be contacted to embed a trusted timestamp. If you aren't connected to the
         Internet, you can use --timestamp=none to disable timestamps, even for a
         Developer ID identity.

         Note that component packages do not need to be signed (e.g. with
         pkgbuild(1)) before adding them to a signed product archive. The
         signature on the product archive protects the entire product, including
         the added packages.
