Locales are collections of OpenDirectory servers to assist\n     clients in locating the nearest OpenDirectory Server.\n\n     To use OpenDirectory Server Locales, simply create a locale on an OD\n     server with the createLocale operation.  Then add servers and subnets to\n     the locale.  All localemanager operations are performed on the local\n     OpenDirectory node.\n\n     The first time a locale is created, a DefaultLocale will automatically be\n     created as well.  The DefaultLocale will be used for any clients that\n     don't match a subnet in any other locale.\n\n     Before a locale can be configured, the server must already be an\n     OpenDirectory server."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the localemanager tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use localemanager to create a new locale named 'en_US' and add the subnet 192.168.1.0/24 to it?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using localemanager to add a server with IP address 10.0.0.5 to the DefaultLocale?

This command requires\n\t     the -l option.\n\n     showLocale\n\t     Displays the current locale(s).  The -l option can be used to\n\t     display a specific locale.
