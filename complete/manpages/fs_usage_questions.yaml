It requires root\n     privileges due to the kernel tracing facility it uses to operate.\tBy\n     default, the activity monitored includes all system processes except the\n     running fs_usage process, Terminal, telnetd, telnet, sshd, rlogind, tcsh,\n     csh, sh, and zsh.\tThese defaults can be overridden such that output is\n     limited to include or exclude a list of processes specified by the user.\n\n     The output presented by fs_usage is formatted according to the size of\n     your window.  A narrow window will display fewer columns of data.\tUse a\n     wide window for maximum data display.  You may override the window\n     formatting restrictions by forcing a wide display with the -w option.  In\n     this case, the data displayed will wrap when the window is not wide\n     enough."

If a list of process IDs or\n\t     commands is also given, then those processes are also excluded\n\t     from the sampled output.\n\n     -w      Specifying the -w option forces a wider, more detailed output,\n\t     regardless of the window size.\n\n     -f      Specifying the -f option turns on output filtering based on the\n\t     mode provided.  Multiple filtering options can be specified.  By\n\t     default, no output filtering occurs.  The supported modes are:\n\n\t     network Network-related events are displayed.\n\n\t     filesys Filesystem-related events are displayed.\n\n\t     pathname Pathname-related events are displayed.\n\n\t     exec Exec and spawn events are displayed.\n\n\t     diskio Disk I/O events are displayed.\n\n\t     cachehit In addition, show cache hits.\n\n     -b      Specifying the -b option annotates disk I/O events with BootCache\n\t     info (if available)."
