No\n       temporary files are created.\n\n       The zip container written to \"stdout\" is, by necessity, written in\n       streaming format. Most programs that read Zip files can cope with a\n       streamed zip file, but if interoperability is important, and your\n       workflow allows you to write the zip file directly to disk you can\n       create a non-streamed zip file using the \"zipfile\" option.\n\n   OPTIONS\n       -zip64\n\t    Create a Zip64-compliant zip container. Use this option if the\n\t    input is greater than 4Gig.\n\n\t    Default is disabled.\n\n       -zipfile=F\n\t    Write zip container to the filename \"F\".\n\n\t    Use the \"Stream\" option to force the creation of a streamed zip\n\t    file.\n\n       -member-name=M\n\t    This option is used to name the \"file\" in the zip container.\n\n\t    Default is '-'.\n\n       -stream\n\t    Ignored when writing to \"stdout\".\n\n\t    If the \"zipfile\" option is specified, including this option will\n\t    trigger the creation of a streamed zip file.\n\n\t    Default: Always enabled when writing to \"stdout\", otherwise\n\t    disabled.\n\n       -method=M\n\t    Compress using method \"M\".\n\n\t    Valid method names are\n\n\t\t* store    Store without compression\n\t\t* deflate  Use Deflate compression [Deflault]\n\t\t* bzip2    Use Bzip2 compression\n\t\t* lzma\t   Use LZMA compression\n\t\t* xz\t   Use xz compression\n\t\t* zstd\t   Use Zstandard compression\n\n\t    Note that Lzma compress needs \"IO::Compress::Lzma\" to be\n\t    installed.\n\n\t    Note that Zstd compress needs \"IO::Compress::Zstd\" to be\n\t    installed.\n\n\t    Default is \"deflate\".\n\n       -0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9\n\t    Sets the compression level for \"deflate\". Ignored for all other\n\t    compression methods.\n\n\t    \"-0\" means no compression and \"-9\" for maximum compression.\n\n\t    Default is 6\n\n       -version\n\t    Display version number\n\n       -help\n\t    Display help\n\n   Examples\n       Create a zip file bt reading daa from stdin\n\n\t   $ echo Lorem ipsum dolor sit | perl ./bin/streamzip >abcd.zip\n\n       Check the contents of \"abcd,zip\" with the standard \"unzip\" utility\n\n\t   Archive:  abcd.zip\n\t     Length\t Date\t Time\t Name\n\t   ---------  ---------- -----\t ----\n\t\t  22  2021-01-08 19:45\t -\n\t   ---------\t\t\t -------\n\t\t  22\t\t\t 1 file\n\n       Notice how the \"Name\" is set to \"-\".  That is the default for a few zip\n       utilities whwre the member name is not given.\n\n       If you want to explicitly name the file, use the \"-member-name\" option\n       as follows\n\n\t   $ echo Lorem ipsum dolor sit | perl ./bin/streamzip -member-name latin >abcd.zip\n\n\t   $ unzip -l abcd.zip\n\t   Archive:  abcd.zip\n\t     Length\t Date\t Time\t Name\n\t   ---------  ---------- -----\t ----\n\t\t  22  2021-01-08 19:47\t latin\n\t   ---------\t\t\t -------\n\t\t  22\t\t\t 1 file\n\n   When to write a Streamed Zip File\n       A Streamed Zip File is useful in situations where you cannot seek\n       backwards/forwards in the file.\n\n       A good examples is when you are serving dynamic content from a Web\n       Server straight into a socket without needing to create a temporary zip\n       file in the filesystsm.\n\n       Similarly if your workfow uses a Linux pipelined commands.\n\nSUPPORT\n       General feedback/questions/bug reports should be sent to\n       <https://github.com/pmqs/IO-Compress/issues> (preferred) or\n       <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=IO-Compress>.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Paul Marquess pmqs@cpan.org.\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2019-2021 Paul Marquess.

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the streamzip tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use streamzip to convert a stream of data into a zip file named 'output.zip' with the member name set to 'datafile'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using streamzip to create a streamed zip file from standard input, specifying the compression method as 'lzma' and setting the compression level to 5?
