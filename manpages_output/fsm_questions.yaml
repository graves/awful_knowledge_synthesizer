It is also used for I/O bandwidth and storage pool\n       management functions. The default Xsan volume name is default, and the\n       default host name is the system's hostname as found by the\n       gethostname(2) library call.\n\n       The optional cluster_admin argument has the syntax:\n\n\t      @cluster_name/admin_domain\n\n       The @ distinguishes the cluster_admin argument from the host_name\n       argument.\n\n       Multiple FSM processes may co-exist on one system, as long as they have\n       unique volume names. The volume name is used by the mount(8) command,\n       along with the hostname separated by a colon (:). For example, if an\n       FSM process was started on host fsmhost and the volume name was\n       declared projecta and the mount point was /usr/clips, then the mount\n       command would be:"

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the fsm command to manage a Xsan volume named 'projecta' on a host called 'fsmhost'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the fsm command with a cluster admin argument to specify a custom cluster name and admin domain?

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `fsm`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nmount -t acfs fsmhost:projecta /usr/clips\n\n       This process runs in the background and is started at boot time. It is\n       enabled or disabled via chkconfig(8) or init.d(7) using the cvfs key\n       word.\n\n       To start multiple FSM daemons (therefore multiple volumes) on a single\n       system the fsmlist file must be created to describe which FSM daemons\n       to start. See fsmpm(8) and fsmlist(4) for details.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n       FSM_KEEP_ALIVE_TIME\n\t      This variable can be used to change the rate that the FSM\n\t      process sends a keep alive message to each connected client.\n\t      The value is in seconds, with a default of 5 seconds.  It can be\n\t      set between 1 and 7200 seconds (2 hours).\n\n\t      Note:  This variable is not intended for general use, and should\n\t\t     only be used when recommended by Apple Support.\n\n       FSM_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT\n\t      This variable can be used to change the timeout value that the\n\t      FSM process uses after sending a keep alive to a client.\tThe\n\t      value is in seconds, with a default of 3 seconds.  It can be set\n\t      between 1 and 30 seconds.  Note that there are other factors\n\t      that are also considered by the FSM process before timing out a\n\t      client, so the actual timeout may be somewhat longer."
