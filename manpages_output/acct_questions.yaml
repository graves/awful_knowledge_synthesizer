If the argument file is a nil pointer, accounting is disabled.\n     If file is an existing pathname (null-terminated), record collection is\n     enabled and for every process initiated which terminates under normal\n     conditions an accounting record is appended to file.  Abnormal conditions\n     of termination are reboots or other fatal system problems.  Records for\n     processes which never terminate can not be produced by acct().\n\n     For more information on the record structure used by acct(), see\n     /usr/include/sys/acct.h and acct(5).\n\n     This call is permitted only to the super-user.\n\nNOTES\n     Accounting is automatically disabled when the file system the accounting\n     file resides on runs out of space; it is enabled when space once again\n     becomes available."
