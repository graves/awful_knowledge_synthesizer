By default, cmp is silent if the files are the\n     same; if they differ, the byte and line number at which the first\n     difference occurred is reported.\n\n     Bytes and lines are numbered beginning with one.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -b, --print-bytes\n\t     Print each byte when a difference is found.\n\n     -h      Do not follow symbolic links.\n\n     -i num1[:num2], --ignore-initial=num1[:num2]\n\t     Skip num1 bytes from file1, and optionally skip num2 bytes from\n\t     file2.  If num2 is not specified, then num1 is applied for both\n\t     file1 and file2.\n\n     -l, --verbose\n\t     Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing byte values\n\t     (octal) for each difference."
