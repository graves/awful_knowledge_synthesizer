GB 11383-1981 (ASCII) characters are represented by single bytes\n     in the range 0x00 to 0x7F.  Chinese characters are represented by two\n     bytes, beginning with a byte in the range 0x80-0xFE and ending with a\n     byte in the range 0x40-0xFE.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     euc(5), gb18030(5), gb2312(5), utf8(5)\n\n     The Unicode Standard, Version 2.1, The Unicode Consortium, 1999.\n\n     Chinese National Standard GB 18030-2000: Information Technology --\n     Chinese ideograms coded character set for information interchange --\n     Extension for the basic set, March 2000."
