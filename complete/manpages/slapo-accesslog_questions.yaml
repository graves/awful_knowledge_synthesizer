This allows all of the\n       activity on a given database to be reviewed using arbitrary LDAP\n       queries, instead of just logging to local flat text files.\n       Configuration options are available for selecting a subset of operation\n       types to log, and to automatically prune older log records from the\n       logging database.  Log records are stored with audit schema (see below)\n       to assure their readability whether viewed as LDIF or in raw form.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       These slapd.conf options apply to the Access Logging overlay.  They\n       should appear after the overlay directive.\n\n       logdb <suffix>\n\t      Specify the suffix of a database to be used for storing the log\n\t      records.\tThe specified database must be defined elsewhere in\n\t      the configuration.  The access controls on the log database\n\t      should prevent general access. The suffix entry of the log\n\t      database will be created automatically by this overlay. The log\n\t      entries will be generated as the immediate children of the\n\t      suffix entry.\n\n       logops <operations>\n\t      Specify which types of operations to log. The valid operation\n\t      types are abandon, add, bind, compare, delete, extended, modify,\n\t      modrdn, search, and unbind. Aliases for common sets of\n\t      operations are also available:\n\n\t      writes add, delete, modify, modrdn\n\n\t      reads  compare, search\n\n\t      session\n\t\t     abandon, bind, unbind\n\n\t      all    all operations\n\n       logbase <operations> <baseDN>\n\t      Specify a set of operations that will only be logged if they\n\t      occur under a specific subtree of the database. The operation\n\t      types are as above for the logops setting, and delimited by a\n\t      '|' character.\n\n       logold <filter>\n\t      Specify a filter for matching against Deleted and Modified\n\t      entries. If the entry matches the filter, the old contents of\n\t      the entry will be logged along with the current request.\n\n       logoldattr <attr> ...\n\t      Specify a list of attributes whose old contents are always\n\t      logged in Modify and ModRDN requests. Usually only the contents\n\t      of attributes that were actually modified will be logged; by\n\t      default no old attributes are logged for ModRDN requests.\n\n       logpurge <age> <interval>\n\t      Specify the maximum age for log entries to be retained in the\n\t      database, and how often to scan the database for old entries.\n\t      Both the age and interval are specified as a time span in days,\n\t      hours, minutes, and seconds. The time format is [ddd+]hh:mm[:ss]\n\t      i.e., the days and seconds components are optional but hours and\n\t      minutes are required. Except for days, which can be up to 5\n\t      digits, each numeric field must be exactly two digits. For\n\t      example\n\t\t     logpurge 2+00:00 1+00:00\n\t      would specify that the log database should be scanned every day\n\t      for old entries, and entries older than two days should be\n\t      deleted. When using a log database that supports ordered\n\t      indexing on generalizedTime attributes, specifying an eq index\n\t      on the reqStart attribute will greatly benefit the performance\n\t      of the purge operation.\n\n       logsuccess TRUE | FALSE\n\t      If set to TRUE then log records will only be generated for\n\t      successful requests, i.e., requests that produce a result code\n\t      of 0 (LDAP_SUCCESS).  If FALSE, log records are generated for\n\t      all requests whether they succeed or not. The default is FALSE."

It is also noted that the schema\n       described here is a work in progress, and hence subject to change\n       without notice.\tThe schema is loaded automatically by the overlay.\n\n       The schema includes a number of object classes and associated attribute\n       types as described below.\n\n       There is a basic auditObject class from which two additional classes,\n       auditReadObject and auditWriteObject are derived. Object classes for\n       each type of LDAP operation are further derived from these classes.\n       This object class hierarchy is designed to allow flexible yet efficient\n       searches of the log based on either a specific operation type's class,\n       or on more general classifications. The definition of the auditObject\n       class is as follows:\n\n\t   (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.1\n\t       NAME 'auditObject'\n\t       DESC 'OpenLDAP request auditing'\n\t       SUP top STRUCTURAL\n\t       MUST ( reqStart $ reqType $ reqSession )\n\t       MAY ( reqDN $ reqAuthzID $ reqControls $ reqRespControls $\n\t\t   reqEnd $ reqResult $ reqMessage $ reqReferral ) )\n\n       Note that all of the OIDs used in the logging schema currently reside\n       under the OpenLDAP Experimental branch. It is anticipated that they\n       will migrate to a Standard branch in the future.\n\n       An overview of the attributes follows: reqStart and reqEnd provide the\n       start and end time of the operation, respectively. They use\n       generalizedTime syntax. The reqStart attribute is also used as the RDN\n       for each log entry.\n\n       The reqType attribute is a simple string containing the type of\n       operation being logged, e.g.  add, delete, search, etc. For extended\n       operations, the type also includes the OID of the extended operation,\n       e.g.  extended(1.1.1.1)\n\n       The reqSession attribute is an implementation-specific identifier that\n       is common to all the operations associated with the same LDAP session.\n       Currently this is slapd's internal connection ID, stored in decimal.\n\n       The reqDN attribute is the distinguishedName of the target of the\n       operation. E.g., for a Bind request, this is the Bind DN. For an Add\n       request, this is the DN of the entry being added. For a Search request,\n       this is the base DN of the search.\n\n       The reqAuthzID attribute is the distinguishedName of the user that\n       performed the operation.  This will usually be the same name as was\n       established at the start of a session by a Bind request (if any) but\n       may be altered in various circumstances.\n\n       The reqControls and reqRespControls attributes carry any controls sent\n       by the client on the request and returned by the server in the\n       response, respectively. The attribute values are just uninterpreted\n       octet strings.\n\n       The reqResult attribute is the numeric LDAP result code of the\n       operation, indicating either success or a particular LDAP error code.\n       An error code may be accompanied by a text error message which will be\n       recorded in the reqMessage attribute.\n\n       The reqReferral attribute carries any referrals that were returned with\n       the result of the request.\n\n       Operation-specific classes are defined with additional attributes to\n       carry all of the relevant parameters associated with the operation:"
