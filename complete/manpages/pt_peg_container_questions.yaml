Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package provides a container class for parsing expression\n       grammars, with each instance storing a single grammar and allowing the\n       user to manipulate and query its definition.\n\n       It resides in the Storage section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools,\n       and is one of the three pillars the management of parsing expression\n       grammars resides on.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_container\n\n       The other two pillars are, as shown above\n\n       [1]    PEG Import, and\n\n       [2]    PEG Export\n\n       Packages related to this are:\n\n       pt::rde\n\t      This package provides an implementation of PARAM, a virtual\n\t      machine for the parsing of a channel, geared towards the needs\n\t      of handling PEGs.\n\n       pt::peg::interp\n\t      This package implements an interpreter for PEGs on top of the\n\t      virtual machine provided by pt::peg::rde\n\n   CLASS API\n       The package exports the API described here.\n\n       ::pt::peg objectName ?=|:=|<--|as|deserialize src?\n\t      The command creates a new container object for a parsing\n\t      expression grammar and returns the fully qualified name of the\n\t      object command as its result. The API of this object command is\n\t      described in the section Object API. It may be used to invoke\n\t      various operations on the object.\n\n\t      The new container will be empty if no src is specified.\n\t      Otherwise it will contain a copy of the grammar contained in the\n\t      src.  All operators except deserialize interpret src as a\n\t      container object command. The deserialize operator interprets\n\t      src as the serialization of a parsing expression grammar\n\t      instead, as specified in section PEG serialization format.\n\n\t      An empty grammar has no nonterminal symbols, and the start\n\t      expression is the empty expression, i.e. epsilon. It is valid,\n\t      but not useful.\n\n   OBJECT API\n       All objects created by this package provide the following methods for\n       the manipulation and querying of their contents:\n\n       objectName destroy\n\t      This method destroys the object, releasing all claimed memory,\n\t      and deleting the associated object command.\n\n       objectName clear\n\t      This method resets the object to contain the empty grammar. It\n\t      does not destroy the object itself.\n\n       objectName importer\n\t      This method returns the import manager object currently attached\n\t      to the container, if any.\n\n       objectName importer object\n\t      This method attaches the object as import manager to the\n\t      container, and returns it as the result of the command.  Note\n\t      that the object is not put into ownership of the container.\n\t      I.e., destruction of the container will not destroy the object.\n\n\t      It is expected that object provides a method named import text\n\t      which takes a text and a format name, and returns the canonical\n\t      serialization of the table of contents contained in the text,\n\t      assuming the given format.\n\n       objectName exporter\n\t      This method returns the export manager object currently attached\n\t      to the container, if any.\n\n       objectName exporter object\n\t      This method attaches the object as export manager to the\n\t      container, and returns it as the result of the command.  Note\n\t      that the object is not put into ownership of the container.\n\t      I.e., destruction of the container will not destroy the object.\n\n\t      It is expected that object provides a method named export object\n\t      which takes the container and a format name, and returns a text\n\t      encoding table of contents stored in the container, in the given\n\t      format. It is further expected that the object will use the\n\t      container's method serialize to obtain the serialization of the\n\t      table of contents from which to generate the text.\n\n       objectName = source\n\t      This method assigns the contents of the PEG object source to\n\t      ourselves, overwriting the existing definition. This is the\n\t      assignment operator for grammars.\n\n\t      This operation is in effect equivalent to"

This is the sequence.\n\n\t\t     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list *\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    kleene closure, describing zero or more\n\t\t\t    repetitions.\n\n\t\t     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list +\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    positive kleene closure, describing one or more\n\t\t\t    repetitions.\n\n\t\t     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list &\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    and lookahead predicate.\n\n\t\t     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list !\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    not lookahead predicate.\n\n\t\t     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ?\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.

I.e. it does not\n\t\t     contain superfluous whitespace.\n\n\t      [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end\n\t\t     of the range are identical).\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the\n       rule"
