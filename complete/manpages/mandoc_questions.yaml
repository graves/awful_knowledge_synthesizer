    Manpage text:

    If the input format of a file is man(7), the input is copied to the
         output.  The parser is also run, and as usual, the -W level controls
         which DIAGNOSTICS are displayed before copying the input to the output.

       Markdown Output
         Use -T markdown to translate mdoc(7) input to the markdown format
         conforming to John Gruber's 2004 specification:
         http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text. The output also
         almost conforms to the CommonMark: http://commonmark.org/ specification.

         The character set used for the markdown output is ASCII.  Non-ASCII
         characters are encoded as HTML entities.  Since that is not possible in
         literal font contexts, because these are rendered as code spans and code
         blocks in the markdown output, non-ASCII characters are transliterated to
         ASCII approximations in these contexts.

         Markdown is a very weak markup language, so all semantic markup is lost,
         and even part of the presentational markup may be lost.  Do not use this
         as an intermediate step in converting to HTML; instead, use -T html
         directly.

    Mdocdate missing
         (mdoc, OpenBSD) The Dd macro does not use CVS Mdocdate keyword
         substitution, but using it is conventionally expected in the OpenBSD base

         any of the architectures this operating system is running on.

         operating system explicitly specified
         (mdoc, OpenBSD, NetBSD) The Os macro has an argument.  In the base
         system, it is conventionally left blank.

         RCS id missing
         (OpenBSD, NetBSD) The manual page lacks the comment line with the RCS
         identifier generated by CVS OpenBSD or NetBSD keyword substitution as
         conventionally used in these operating systems.

       Style suggestions
         legacy man(7) date format
         (mdoc) The Dd macro uses the legacy man(7) date format “yyyy-dd-mm”.
         Consider using the conventional mdoc(7) date format “Month dd, yyyy”
         instead.

         normalizing date format to: ...

         (roff) Macro arguments can be enclosed in double quote characters such

         need not be escaped.  The closing quote of the last argument of a macro

         (mdoc) The first argument of an Fc or Fn macro contains an opening or

         (mdoc) An Sm macro has an argument other than on or off.  The invalid

         (roff) An escape sequence has an invalid opening argument delimiter,

         escaped character not allowed in a name

         argument of an am, as, de, ds, nr, or rr request, or any argument of an
         rm request, or the name of a request or user defined macro being called,
         is terminated by an escape sequence.  In the cases of as, ds, and nr, the
         request has no effect at all.  In the cases of am, de, rr, and rm, what
         was parsed up to this point is used as the arguments to the request, and
         the rest of the input line is discarded including the escape sequence.
         When parsing for a request or a user-defined macro name to be called,

         cause information loss or considerable misformatting.

         unsupported roff request
         (roff) An input file contains a roff(7) request supported by GNU troff or
         Heirloom troff but not by mandoc, and it is likely that this will cause
         information loss or considerable misformatting.

         eqn delim option in tbl
         (eqn, tbl) The options line of a table defines equation delimiters.  Any
         equation source code contained in the table will be printed unformatted.

         unsupported table layout modifier
         (tbl) A table layout specification contains an ‘m’ modifier.  The
         modifier is discarded.

         ignoring macro in table
         (tbl, mdoc, man) A table contains an invocation of an mdoc(7) or man(7)
         macro or of an undefined macro.  The macro is ignored, and its arguments
         are handled as if they were a text line.

    Manpage text:

    skipping tbl in -Tman mode
         (mdoc, tbl) An input file contains the TS macro.  This message is only
         generated in -T man output mode, where tbl(7) input is not supported.

         skipping eqn in -Tman mode
         (mdoc, eqn) An input file contains the EQ macro.  This message is only
         generated in -T man output mode, where eqn(7) input is not supported.

       Bad command line arguments
         bad command line argument
         The argument following one of the -IKMmOTW command line options is
         invalid, or a file given as a command line argument cannot be opened.

         duplicate command line argument
         The -I command line option was specified twice.

         option has a superfluous value
         An argument to the -O option has a value but does not accept one.

         missing option value
         An argument to the -O option has no argument but requires one.

         bad option value
         An argument to the -O indent or width option has an invalid value.

         duplicate option value
         The same -O option is specified more than once.
