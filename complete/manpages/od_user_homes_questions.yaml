Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `od_user_homes`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOD_USER_HOMES(8)\t    System Manager's Manual\t      OD_USER_HOMES(8)\n\nNAME\n     od_user_homes â€“ executable map program for auto_home records synthesized\n     from user records\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     /usr/libexec/od_user_homes [username]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     od_user_homes is a program that takes a user name specified by username\n     and, if there's a user record for that user in Open Directory, and that\n     user record contains a HomeDirectory attribute, and the <path> portion of\n     the HomeDirectory attribute is empty or just /, prints the URL from that\n     attribute, and exits with an exit status of 0.  If there is no user\n     record for that user, or the user record doesn't contain a HomeDirectory\n     attribute, or the <path> portion is neither empty nor just /, or if an\n     error occurs, nothing is printed, and od_user_homes exits with a user\n     status of 1.  This is intended to be used as an executable map for\n     auto_home.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     auto_master(5), automountd(8)\n\nDarwin\t\t\t       September 6, 2010\t\t\tDarwin"
