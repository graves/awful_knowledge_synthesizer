See section Snit Parser.\n\n       Of the seven possible results four are parsers outright (c, critcl, oo,\n       and snit), one (container) provides code which can be used in\n       conjunction with a generic parser (also known as a grammar\n       interpreter), and the last two (json and peg) are doing double-duty as\n       input formats, allowing the transformation of grammars for exchange,\n       reformatting, and the like.\n\n       The created parsers fall into three categories:\n\n       IMAGE: gen_options\n\n       Specialized parsers implemented in C\n\t      The fastest parsers are created when using the result formats c\n\t      and critcl. The first returns the raw C code for the parser,\n\t      while the latter wraps it into a Tcl package using CriTcl.\n\n\t      This makes the latter much easier to use than the former. On the\n\t      other hand, the former can be adapted to the users' requirements\n\t      through a multitude of options, allowing for things like usage\n\t      of the parser outside of a Tcl environment, something the critcl\n\t      format doesn't support. As such the c format is meant for more\n\t      advanced users, or users with special needs.\n\n\t      A disadvantage of all the parsers in this section is the need to\n\t      run them through a C compiler to make them actually executable.\n\t      This is not something everyone has the necessary tools for. The\n\t      parsers in the next section are for people under such\n\t      restrictions.\n\n       Specialized parsers implemented in Tcl\n\t      As the parsers in this section are implemented in Tcl they are\n\t      quite a bit slower than anything from the previous section. On\n\t      the other hand this allows them to be used in pure-Tcl\n\t      environments, or in environments which allow only a limited set\n\t      of binary packages. In the latter case it will be advantageous\n\t      to lobby for the inclusion of the C-based runtime support (notes\n\t      below) into the environment to reduce the impact of Tcl's on the\n\t      speed of these parsers.\n\n\t      The relevant formats are snit and oo. Both place their result\n\t      into a Tcl package containing a snit::type, or TclOO class\n\t      respectively.\n\n\t      Of the supporting runtime, which is the package pt::rde, the\n\t      user has to know nothing but that it does exist and that the\n\t      parsers are dependent on it. Knowledge of the API exported by\n\t      the runtime for the parsers' consumption is not required by the\n\t      parsers' users.\n\n       Interpreted parsing implemented in Tcl\n\t      The last category, grammar interpretation. This means that an\n\t      interpreter for parsing expression grammars takes the\n\t      description of the grammar to parse input for, and uses it guide\n\t      the parsing process.  This is the slowest of the available\n\t      options, as the interpreter has to continually run through the\n\t      configured grammar, whereas the specialized parsers of the\n\t      previous sections have the relevant knowledge about the grammar\n\t      baked into them.\n\n\t      The only places where using interpretation make sense is where\n\t      the grammar for some input may be changed interactively by the\n\t      user, as the interpretation allows for quick turnaround after\n\t      each change, whereas the previous methods require the generation\n\t      of a whole new parser, which is not as fast.  On the other hand,\n\t      wherever the grammar to use is fixed, the previous methods are\n\t      much more advantageous as the time to generate the parser is\n\t      minuscule compared to the time the parser code is in use.\n\n\t      The relevant result format is container.\tIt (quickly) generates\n\t      grammar descriptions (instead of a full parser) which match the\n\t      API expected by ParserTools' grammar interpreter.  The latter is\n\t      provided by the package pt::peg::interp.\n\n       All the parsers generated by critcl, snit, and oo, and the grammar\n       interpreter share a common API for access to the actual parsing\n       functionality, making them all plug-compatible.\tIt is described in the\n       Parser API specification document.\n\nPEG SPECIFICATION LANGUAGE\n       peg, a language for the specification of parsing expression grammars is\n       meant to be human readable, and writable as well, yet strict enough to\n       allow its processing by machine. Like any computer language. It was\n       defined to make writing the specification of a grammar easy, something\n       the other formats found in the Parser Tools do not lend themselves too.\n\n       For either an introduction to or the formal specification of the\n       language, please go and read the PEG Language Tutorial.\n\n       When used as a result-format this format supports the following\n       options:\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -template string\n\t      The value of this option is a string into which to put the\n\t      generated text and the values of the other options. The various\n\t      locations for user-data are expected to be specified with the\n\t      placeholders listed below. The default value is \"@code@\".\n\n\t      @user@ To be replaced with the value of the option -user.\n\n\t      @format@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the the constant PEG.\n\n\t      @file@ To be replaced with the value of the option -file.\n\n\t      @name@ To be replaced with the value of the option -name.\n\n\t      @code@ To be replaced with the generated text.\n\nJSON GRAMMAR EXCHANGE\n       The json format for parsing expression grammars was written as a data\n       exchange format not bound to Tcl. It was defined to allow the exchange\n       of grammars with PackRat/PEG based parser generators for other\n       languages.\n\n       For the formal specification of the JSON grammar exchange format,\n       please go and read The JSON Grammar Exchange Format.\n\n       When used as a result-format this format supports the following\n       options:\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -indented boolean\n\t      If this option is set the system will break the generated JSON\n\t      across lines and indent it according to its inner structure,\n\t      with each key of a dictionary on a separate line.\n\n\t      If the option is not set (the default), the whole JSON object\n\t      will be written on a single line, with minimum spacing between\n\t      all elements.\n\n       -aligned boolean\n\t      If this option is set the system will ensure that the values for\n\t      the keys in a dictionary are vertically aligned with each other,\n\t      for a nice table effect.\tTo make this work this also implies\n\t      that -indented is set.\n\n\t      If the option is not set (the default), the output is formatted\n\t      as per the value of indented, without trying to align the values\n\t      for dictionary keys.\n\nC PARSER EMBEDDED IN TCL\n       The critcl format is executable code, a parser for the grammar. It is a\n       Tcl package with the actual parser implementation written in C and\n       embedded in Tcl via the critcl package.\n\n       This result-format supports the following options:\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -class string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the class to generate,\n\t      without leading colons.  The default value is CLASS.\n\n\t      For a simple value X without colons, like CLASS, the parser\n\t      command will be X::X. Whereas for a namespaced value X::Y the\n\t      parser command will be X::Y.\n\n       -package string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the package to generate.\n\t      The default value is PACKAGE.\n\nC PARSER\n       The c format is executable code, a parser for the grammar. The parser\n       implementation is written in C and can be tweaked to the users' needs\n       through a multitude of options.\n\n       The critcl format, for example, is implemented as a canned\n       configuration of these options on top of the generator for c.\n\n       This result-format supports the following options:\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -template string\n\t      The value of this option is a string into which to put the\n\t      generated text and the other configuration settings. The various\n\t      locations for user-data are expected to be specified with the\n\t      placeholders listed below. The default value is \"@code@\".\n\n\t      @user@ To be replaced with the value of the option -user.\n\n\t      @format@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the the constant C/PARAM.\n\n\t      @file@ To be replaced with the value of the option -file.\n\n\t      @name@ To be replaced with the value of the option -name.\n\n\t      @code@ To be replaced with the generated Tcl code.\n       The following options are special, in that they will occur within the\n       generated code, and are replaced there as well.\n\n\t      @statedecl@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the value of the option state-decl.\n\n\t      @stateref@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the value of the option state-ref.\n\n\t      @strings@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the value of the option string-\n\t\t     varname.\n\n\t      @self@ To be replaced with the value of the option self-command.\n\n\t      @def@  To be replaced with the value of the option fun-\n\t\t     qualifier.\n\n\t      @ns@   To be replaced with the value of the option namespace.\n\n\t      @main@ To be replaced with the value of the option main.\n\n\t      @prelude@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the value of the option prelude.\n\n       -state-decl string\n\t      A C string representing the argument declaration to use in the\n\t      generated parsing functions to refer to the parsing state. In\n\t      essence type and argument name.  The default value is the string\n\t      RDE_PARAM p.\n\n       -state-ref string\n\t      A C string representing the argument named used in the generated\n\t      parsing functions to refer to the parsing state.\tThe default\n\t      value is the string p.\n\n       -self-command string\n\t      A C string representing the reference needed to call the\n\t      generated parser function (methods ...) from another parser\n\t      fonction, per the chosen framework (template).  The default\n\t      value is the empty string.\n\n       -fun-qualifier string\n\t      A C string containing the attributes to give to the generated\n\t      functions (methods ...), per the chosen framework (template).\n\t      The default value is static.\n\n       -namespace string\n\t      The name of the C namespace the parser functions (methods, ...)\n\t      shall reside in, or a general prefix to add to the function\n\t      names.

The default value is the empty string.\n\n       -indent integer\n\t      The number of characters to indent each line of the generated\n\t      code by.\tThe default value is 0.\n\nSNIT PARSER\n       The snit format is executable code, a parser for the grammar. It is a\n       Tcl package holding a snit::type, i.e. a class, whose instances are\n       parsers for the input grammar.\n\n       This result-format supports the following options:\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -class string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the class to generate,\n\t      without leading colons. Note, it serves double-duty as the name\n\t      of the package to generate too.  The default value is CLASS.\n\nTCLOO PARSER\n       The oo format is executable code, a parser for the grammar. It is a Tcl\n       package holding a TclOO class, whose instances are parsers for the\n       input grammar.\n\n       This result-format supports the following options:\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -class string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the class to generate,\n\t      without leading colons. Note, it serves double-duty as the name\n\t      of the package to generate too.  The default value is CLASS.\n\nGRAMMAR CONTAINER\n       The container format is another form of describing parsing expression\n       grammars. While data in this format is executable it does not\n       constitute a parser for the grammar. It always has to be used in\n       conjunction with the package pt::peg::interp, a grammar interpreter.\n\n       The format represents grammars by a snit::type, i.e. class, whose\n       instances are API-compatible to the instances of the pt::peg::container\n       package, and which are preloaded with the grammar in question.\n\n       This result-format supports the following options:\n\n       -file string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity\n\t      from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The\n\t      default value is unknown.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are\n\t      processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.\n\n       -user string\n\t      The value of this option is the name of the user for which the\n\t      command is run. The default value is unknown.\n\n       -mode bulk|incremental\n\t      The value of this option controls which methods of\n\t      pt::peg::container instances are used to specify the grammar,\n\t      i.e. preload it into the container. There are two legal values,\n\t      as listed below. The default is bulk.\n\n\t      bulk   In this mode the methods start, add, modes, and rules are\n\t\t     used to specify the grammar in a bulk manner, i.e. as a\n\t\t     set of nonterminal symbols, and two dictionaries mapping\n\t\t     from the symbols to their semantic modes and parsing\n\t\t     expressions.\n\n\t\t     This mode is the default.\n\n\t      incremental\n\t\t     In this mode the methods start, add, mode, and rule are\n\t\t     used to specify the grammar piecemal, with each\n\t\t     nonterminal having its own block of defining commands.\n\n       -template string\n\t      The value of this option is a string into which to put the\n\t      generated code and the other configuration settings. The various\n\t      locations for user-data are expected to be specified with the\n\t      placeholders listed below. The default value is \"@code@\".\n\n\t      @user@ To be replaced with the value of the option -user.\n\n\t      @format@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the the constant CONTAINER.\n\n\t      @file@ To be replaced with the value of the option -file.\n\n\t      @name@ To be replaced with the value of the option -name.\n\n\t      @mode@ To be replaced with the value of the option -mode.\n\n\t      @code@ To be replaced with the generated code.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       In this section we are working a complete example, starting with a PEG\n       grammar and ending with running the parser generated from it over some\n       input, following the outline shown in the figure below:\n\n       IMAGE: flow\n\n       Our grammar, assumed to the stored in the file \"calculator.peg\" is\n\n       PEG calculator (Expression)\n\t   Digit      <- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;\n\t   Sign       <- '-' / '+'\t\t\t ;\n\t   Number     <- Sign? Digit+\t\t\t      ;\n\t   Expression <- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)\t;\n\t   MulOp      <- '*' / '/'\t\t\t ;\n\t   Factor     <- Term (AddOp Term)*\t\t      ;\n\t   AddOp      <- '+'/'-'\t\t\t ;\n\t   Term       <- Number \t\t    ;\n       END;\n\n       From this we create a snit-based parser via\n\n       pt generate  snit calculator.tcl  -class calculator  -name  calculator  peg calculator.peg\n\n       which leaves us with the parser package and class written to the file\n       \"calculator.tcl\".  Assuming that this package is then properly\n       installed in a place where Tcl can find it we can now use this class\n       via a script like\n\n\t   package require calculator\n\n\t   lassign $argv input\n\t   set channel [open $input r]\n\n\t   set parser [calculator]\n\t   set ast [$parser parse $channel]\n\t   $parser destroy\n\t   close $channel\n\n\t   ... now process the returned abstract syntax tree ...\n\n       where the abstract syntax tree stored in the variable will look like"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pt`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nset ast {Expression 0 4\n\t   {Factor 0 4\n\t       {Term 0 2\n\t\t   {Number 0 2\n\t\t       {Digit 0 0}\n\t\t       {Digit 1 1}\n\t\t       {Digit 2 2}\n\t\t   }\n\t       }\n\t       {AddOp 3 3}\n\t       {Term 4 4\n\t\t   {Number 4 4\n\t\t       {Digit 4 4}\n\t\t   }\n\t       }\n\t   }\n       }\n\n\n       assuming that the input file and channel contained the text\n\t120+5\n       A more graphical representation of the tree would be\n\n       IMAGE: expr_ast\n\n       Regardless, at this point it is the user's responsibility to work with\n       the tree to reach whatever goal she desires. I.e. analyze it, transform\n       it, etc. The package pt::ast should be of help here, providing commands\n       to walk such ASTs structures in various ways.\n\n       One important thing to note is that the parsers used here return a data\n       structure representing the structure of the input per the grammar\n       underlying the parser. There are no callbacks during the parsing\n       process, i.e. no parsing actions, as most other parsers will have.\n\n       Going back to the last snippet of code, the execution of the parser for\n       some input, note how the parser instance follows the specified Parser\n       API.\n\nINTERNALS\n       This section is intended for users of the application which wish to\n       modify or extend it. Users only interested in the generation of parsers\n       can ignore it.\n\n       The main functionality of the application is encapsulated in the\n       package pt::pgen. Please read it for more information.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category pt of the\n       Tcllib SF Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].\n       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either\n       package and/or documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       EBNF, LL(k), PEG, TDPL, context-free languages, expression, grammar,\n       matching, parser, parsing expression, parsing expression grammar, push\n       down automaton, recursive descent, state, top-down parsing languages,\n       transducer\n\nCATEGORY\n       Parsing and Grammars\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2009 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
