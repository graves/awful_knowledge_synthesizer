Must be either\n\t      horizontal or vertical.\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The iwidgets::toolbar command creates a new window (given by the\n       pathName argument) and makes it into a toolbar widget. Additional\n       options, described above may be specified on the command line or in the\n       option database to configure aspects of the toolbar such as its colors,\n       font, and orientation. The iwidgets::toolbar command returns its\n       pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not\n       exist a window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A toolbar is a widget that displays a collection of widgets arranged\n       either in a row or a column (depending on the value of the -orient\n       option).  This collection of widgets is usually for user convenience to\n       give access to a set of commands or settings. Any widget may be placed\n       on a toolbar.  However, command or value-oriented widgets (such as\n       button, radiobutton, etc.) are usually the most useful kind of widgets\n       to appear on a toolbar.\n\n       In addition, the toolbar adds two new options to all widgets that are\n       added to it. These are the helpStr and balloonStr options. See the\n       discussion for the widget command add below."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `iwidgets_toolbar`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       The iwidgets::toolbar command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget. It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n       Many of the widget commands for a toolbar take as one argument an\n       indicator of which widget item of the toolbar to operate on. The\n       indicator is called an index and may be specified in any of the\n       following forms:\n\n       number Specifies the widget numerically, where 0 corresponds to the\n\t      first widget in the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on. (For\n\t      horizontal, 0 is the leftmost; for vertical, 0 is the topmost).\n\n       end    Specifes the last widget in the toolbar's index. If the toolbar\n\t      is empty this will return -1.\n\n       last   Same as end.\n\n       pattern\n\t      If the index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms, then this\n\t      form is used. Pattern is pattern-matched against the widgetName\n\t      of each widget in the toolbar, in order from the first to the\n\t      last widget, until a matching entry is found. An exact match\n\t      must occur.\n\n       The following commands are possible for toolbar widgets:\n\n       pathName add widgetCommand widgetName ?option value?\n\t      Adds a widget with the command widgetCommand whose name is\n\t      widgetName to the toolbar. If widgetCommand is radiobutton or\n\t      checkbutton, its packing is slightly padded to match the\n\t      geometry of button widgets. In addition, the indicatorOn option\n\t      is false by default and the selectColor is that of the toolbar\n\t      background by default. This allows Radiobutton and Checkbutton\n\t      widgets to be added as icons by simply setting their bitmap or\n\t      image options. If additional arguments are present, they are the\n\t      set of available options that the widget type of widgetCommand\n\t      supports. In addition they may also be one of the following\n\t      options:\n\n\t      -helpstr value\n\t\t     Specifes the help string to associate with the widget.\n\t\t     When the mouse moves over the widget, the variable\n\t\t     denoted by helpVariable is set to helpStr. Another widget\n\t\t     can bind to the helpVariable and thus track status help.\n\n\t      -balloonstr value\n\t\t     Specifes the string to display in a balloon window for\n\t\t     this widget. A balloon window is a small popup window\n\t\t     centered at the bottom of the widget. Usually the\n\t\t     balloonStr value is the name of the item on the toolbar.\n\t\t     It is sometimes known as a hint window.\n\n\t\t     When the mouse moves into an item on the toolbar, a timer\n\t\t     is set based on the value of balloonDelay1. If the mouse\n\t\t     stays inside the item for balloonDelay1, the balloon\n\t\t     window will pop up displaying the balloonStr value. Once\n\t\t     the balloon window is posted, a new timer based on\n\t\t     balloonDelay2 is set. This is typically a shorter timer.\n\t\t     If the mouse is moved to another item, the window is\n\t\t     unposted and a new window will be posted over the item if\n\t\t     the shorter delay time is satisfied.\n\n\t\t     While the balloon window is posted, it can also be\n\t\t     unposted if the item is selected. In this case the timer\n\t\t     is reset to balloonDelay1.  Whenever the mouse leaves the\n\t\t     toolbar, the timer is also reset to balloonDelay1.\n\n\t\t     This window posting/unposting model is the same model\n\t\t     used in the Windows95 environment.\n\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.\n\n       pathName configure ?option value?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list). If option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.\n\n       pathName delete index ?index2?\n\t      This command deletes all items between index and index2\n\t      inclusive. If index2 is omitted then it defaults to index.\n\t      Returns an empty string.\n\n       pathName index index\n\t      Returns the widget's numerical index for the entry corresponding\n\t      to index. If index is not found, -1 is returned.\n\n       pathName insert beforeIndex widgetCommand widgetName ?option value?\n\n       Insert a new item named widgetName with the\n\t      command widgetCommand before the item specified by beforeIndex.\n\t      If widgetCommand is radiobutton or checkbutton, its packing is\n\t      slightly padded to match the geometry of button widgets. In\n\t      addition, the indicatorOn option is false by default and the\n\t      selectColor is that of the toolbar background by default. This\n\t      allows Radiobutton and Checkbutton widgets to be added as icons\n\t      by simply setting their bitmap or image options. The set of\n\t      available options is the same as specified in the ad command.\n\n       pathName itemcget index option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option for index. The item type of index determines the valid\n\t      available options.\n\n       pathName itemconfigure index ?option value?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget of the\n\t      toolbar specified by index. If no option is specified, returns a\n\t      list describing all of the available options for index (see\n\t      Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of this list). If\n\t      option is specified with no value, then the command returns a\n\t      list describing the one named option (this list will be\n\t      identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if\n\t      no option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are\n\t      specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s)\n\t      to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an\n\t      empty string. The item type of index determines the valid\n\t      available options. The set of available options is the same as\n\t      specified in the ad command.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\t       package require Iwidgets 4.0\n\t       iwidgets::toolbar .tb -helpvariable statusVar\n\n\t       .tb add button item1 \\\n\t\t  -helpstr \"Save It\" -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_box.xbm \\\n\t\t  -balloonstr \"Save\" -command {puts 1}\n\t       .tb add button item2 \\\n\t\t  -helpstr \"Save It\" -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_brush.xbm \\\n\t\t  -balloonstr \"Save\" -command {puts 1}\n\t       .tb add button item3 \\\n\t\t  -helpstr \"Save It\" -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_cut.xbm \\\n\t\t  -balloonstr \"Save\" -command {puts 1}\n\t       .tb add button item4 \\\n\t\t  -helpstr \"Save It\" -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_draw.xbm \\\n\t\t  -balloonstr \"Save\" -command {puts 1}\n\t       .tb add button item5 \\\n\t\t  -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_erase.xbm -helpstr \"Play It\" \\\n\t\t  -command {puts 2}\n\t       .tb add frame filler \\\n\t\t  -borderwidth 1 -width 10 -height 10\n\t       .tb add radiobutton item6 \\\n\t\t  -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_oval.xbm -command {puts 4} \\\n\t\t  -variable result -value OPEN -helpstr \"Radio Button # 1\" \\\n\t\t  -balloonstr \"Radio\"\n\t       .tb add radiobutton item7 \\\n\t\t  -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_line.xbm -command {puts 5} \\\n\t\t  -variable result -value CLOSED\n\t       .tb add checkbutton item8 \\\n\t\t  -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_text.xbm -command {puts 6} \\\n\t\t  -variable checkit -onvalue yes -offvalue no\n\t       .tb add checkbutton check2 \\\n\t\t  -bitmap @./icons/Tool_32_points.xbm -command {puts 7} \\\n\t\t   -variable checkit2 -onvalue yes -offvalue no\n\n\t       pack .tb -side top -anchor nw"
