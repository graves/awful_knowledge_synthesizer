One or more\n       object identifiers (OIDs) can be given as arguments on the command\n       line.  A type and a value must accompany each object identifier.  Each\n       variable name is given in the format specified in variables(5).\n\nOPTIONS\n       -c contextName\n\t     if the -c option is present then the notification is sent in the\n\t     nondefault name context.\n       -U uptime\n\t     if the -U option is present then that value, parsed as\n\t     centiseconds, is taken to be the sysUpTime field of the\n\t     application.\n       -x ADDRESS\n\t     if the -x option is present then contact the AgentX master at\n\t     ADDRESS and not the default one.\n\n       Additionally all the options described in snmpcmd(1) under the MIB\n       PARSING OPTIONS, LOGGING OPTIONS and INPUT OPTIONS headers as well as\n       the -d, -D, -m and -M options are supported."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the agentxtrap command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use agentxtrap to send a trap with an OID '1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1' and its value as an integer 42?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using agentxtrap to send a trap with a custom context name and specify the uptime as 123456 centiseconds?
