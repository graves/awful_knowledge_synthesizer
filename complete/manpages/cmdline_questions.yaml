This\n       variable has a companion ::argc which is initialized to the number of\n       elements in ::argv at the beginning of the application.\n\n       The commands in this package will not modify the ::argc companion when\n       called with ::argv. Keeping the value consistent, if such is desired or\n       required, is the responsibility of the caller.\n\nAPI\n       ::cmdline::getopt argvVar optstring optVar valVar\n\t      This command works in a fashion like the standard C based getopt\n\t      function.  Given an option string and a pointer to an array of\n\t      args this command will process the first argument and return\n\t      info on how to proceed. The command returns 1 if an option was\n\t      found, 0 if no more options were found, and -1 if an error\n\t      occurred.\n\n\t      argvVar contains the name of the list of arguments to process.\n\t      If options are found the list is modified and the processed\n\t      arguments are removed from the start of the list.\n\n\t      optstring contains a list of command options that the\n\t      application will accept.\tIf the option ends in \".arg\" the\n\t      command will use the next argument as an argument to the option.\n\t      Otherwise the option is a boolean that is set to 1 if present.\n\n\t      optVar refers to the variable the command will store the found\n\t      option into (without the leading '-' and without the .arg\n\t      extension).\n\n\t      valVar refers to the variable to store either the value for the\n\t      specified option into upon success or an error message in the\n\t      case of failure. The stored value comes from the command line\n\t      for .arg options, otherwise the value is 1.\n\n       ::cmdline::getKnownOpt argvVar optstring optVar valVar\n\t      Like ::cmdline::getopt, but ignores any unknown options in the\n\t      input.\n\n       ::cmdline::getoptions arglistVar optlist ?usage?\n\t      Processes the set of command line options found in the list\n\t      variable named by arglistVar and fills in defaults for those not\n\t      specified.  This also generates an error message that lists the\n\t      allowed flags if an incorrect flag is specified. The optional\n\t      usage-argument contains a string to include in front of the\n\t      generated message. If not present it defaults to \"options:\".\n\n\t      optlist contains a list of lists where each element specifies an\n\t      option in the form: flag default comment.\n\n\t      If flag ends in \".arg\" then the value is taken from the command\n\t      line. Otherwise it is a boolean and appears in the result if\n\t      present on the command line. If flag ends in \".secret\", it will\n\t      not be displayed in the usage.\n\n       ::cmdline::getKnownOptions arglistVar optlist ?usage?\n\t      Like ::cmdline::getoptions, but ignores any unknown options in\n\t      the input.\n\n       ::cmdline::usage optlist ?usage?\n\t      Generates and returns an error message that lists the allowed\n\t      flags. optlist is defined as for ::cmdline::getoptions. The\n\t      optional usage-argument contains a string to include in front of\n\t      the generated message. If not present it defaults to \"options:\".\n\n       ::cmdline::getfiles patterns quiet\n\t      Given a list of file patterns this command computes the set of\n\t      valid files.  On windows, file globbing is performed on each\n\t      argument.  On Unix, only file existence is tested.  If a file\n\t      argument produces no valid files, a warning is optionally\n\t      generated (set quiet to true).\n\n\t      This code also uses the full path for each file.\tIf not given\n\t      it prepends the current working directory to the filename. This\n\t      ensures that these files will never conflict with files in a\n\t      wrapped zip file. The last sentence refers to the pro-tools.\n\n       ::cmdline::getArgv0\n\t      This command returns the \"sanitized\" version of argv0.  It will\n\t      strip off the leading path and removes the extension \".bin\". The\n\t      latter is used by the pro-apps because they must be wrapped by a\n\t      shell script.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\t       set options {\n\t\t   {a\t       \"set the atime only\"}\n\t\t   {m\t       \"set the mtime only\"}\n\t\t   {c\t       \"do not create non-existent files\"}\n\t\t   {r.arg  \"\"  \"use time from ref_file\"}\n\t\t   {t.arg  -1  \"use specified time\"}\n\t       }\n\t       set usage \": MyCommandName \\[options] filename ...\\noptions:\"\n\t       array set params [::cmdline::getoptions argv $options $usage]\n\n\t       if {  $params(a) } { set set_atime \"true\" }\n\t       set has_t [expr {$params(t) != -1}]\n\t       set has_r [expr {[string length $params(r)] > 0}]\n\t       if {$has_t && $has_r} {\n\t\t   return -code error \"Cannot specify both -r and -t\"\n\t       } elseif {$has_t} {\n\t\t...\n\t       }"
