Each mach object, regardles\n     of whether it is an executable, bundle, dylib, or dylib shared cache, is\n     inspected for a valid code directory.  If found, the code directory is\n     hashed, and the resulting hash is added to the trust cache.  If the mach\n     object has no code signature, it is impossible to add it to the trust\n     cache, and it is ignored.\n\n     If a fat mach file is encountered, each slice is examined with the above\n     logic.\n\n     The implementation expects well-formed mach objects, whose load command\n     counts are accurate, and will not attempt to work around poorly-formed\n     inputs just for the sake of a single user's tooling."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use cryptexctl generate-trust-cache to generate a trust cache for a directory containing Mach-O files with the type 'static' and output the result to a file named 'trustcache.output'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using cryptexctl generate-trust-cache to create a trust cache from a directory named 'myapp' with a base trust cache path of '/base/trustcache' and type 'development'?

Valid types are:\n\n\t      static - a static trust cache, of which there may only be one on\n\t      a given device.  This option is generally not useful, but is\n\t      included for completeness.\n\n\t      loadable - a trust cache which may be loaded at runtime and\n\t      persisted on the device\n\n\t      development - a trust cache which may only be loaded on devices\n\t      with development fusing while running a DEVELOPMENT iBoot\n\n\t      [default: loadable]\n\n     -b | --base-trust-cache TRUST-CACHE-PATH\n\t      The path to an existing trust cache of any type whose cdhashes\n\t      should be incorporated into the one being generated. This flag\n\t      may be specified multiple times."
