    User Authentication
           The sudoers security policy requires that most users authenticate
           themselves before they can use sudo.  A password is not required if the
           invoking user is root, if the target user is the same as the invoking
           user, or if the policy has disabled authentication for the user or
           command.  Unlike su(1), when sudoers requires authentication, it
           validates the invoking user's credentials, not the target user's (or
           root's) credentials.  This can be changed via the rootpw, targetpw and
           runaspw flags, described later.

           If a user who is not listed in the policy tries to run a command via
           sudo, mail is sent to the proper authorities.  The address used for
           such mail is configurable via the mailto Defaults entry (described
           later) and defaults to root.

           No mail will be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the
           -l or -v option unless there is an authentication error and either the
           mail_always or mail_badpass flags are enabled.  This allows users to
           determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use sudo.
           By default, all attempts to run sudo (successful or not) are logged,
           regardless of whether or not mail is sent.

    Manpage text:

    If sudo is run by root and the SUDO_USER environment variable is set,
           the sudoers policy will use this value to determine who the actual user
           is.  This can be used by a user to log commands through sudo even when
           a root shell has been invoked.  It also allows the -e option to remain
           useful even when invoked via a sudo-run script or program.  Note,
           however, that the sudoers file lookup is still done for root, not the
           user specified by SUDO_USER.

           sudoers uses per-user time stamp files for credential caching.  Once a
           user has been authenticated, a record is written containing the user-ID
           that was used to authenticate, the terminal session ID, the start time
           of the session leader (or parent process) and a time stamp (using a
           monotonic clock if one is available).  The user may then use sudo
           without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless
           overridden by the timestamp_timeout option).  By default, sudoers uses
           a separate record for each terminal, which means that a user's login
           sessions are authenticated separately.  The timestamp_type option can
           be used to select the type of time stamp record sudoers will use.

    Logging
           By default, sudoers logs both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as
           well as errors).  The log_allowed and log_denied flags can be used to
           control this behavior.  Messages can be logged to syslog(3), a log
           file, or both.  The default is to log to syslog(3) but this is
           configurable via the syslog and logfile settings.  See EVENT LOGGING
           for a description of the log file format.

           sudoers is also capable of running a command in a pseudo-terminal and
           logging input and/or output.  The standard input, standard output, and
           standard error can be logged even when not associated with a terminal.
           For more information about I/O logging, see the I/O LOGGING section.

           Starting with version 1.9, the log_servers setting may be used to send
           event and I/O log data to a remote server running sudo_logsrvd or
           another service that implements the protocol described by
           sudo_logsrv.proto(5).

       Command environment
           Since environment variables can influence program behavior, sudoers
           provides a means to restrict which variables from the user's
           environment are inherited by the command to be run.  There are two
           distinct ways sudoers can deal with environment variables.

    By default, the env_reset flag is enabled.  This causes commands to be
           executed with a new, minimal environment.  On AIX (and Linux systems
           without PAM), the environment is initialized with the contents of the
           /etc/environment file.  The HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME and USER
           environment variables are initialized based on the target user and the
           SUDO_* variables are set based on the invoking user.  Additional
           variables, such as DISPLAY, PATH and TERM, are preserved from the
           invoking user's environment if permitted by the env_check, or env_keep
           options.  A few environment variables are treated specially.  If the
           PATH and TERM variables are not preserved from the user's environment,
           they will be set to default values.  The LOGNAME and USER are handled
           as a single entity.  If one of them is preserved (or removed) from the
           user's environment, the other will be as well.  If LOGNAME and USER are
           to be preserved but only one of them is present in the user's
           environment, the other will be set to the same value.  This avoids an
           inconsistent environment where one of the variables describing the user
           name is set to the invoking user and one is set to the target user.
           Environment variables with a value beginning with ‘()’ are removed
           unless both the name and value parts are matched by env_keep or
           env_check, as they may be interpreted as functions by the bash shell.
           Prior to version 1.8.11, such variables were always removed.

    If, however, the env_reset flag is disabled, any variables not
           explicitly denied by the env_check and env_delete options are allowed
           and their values are inherited from the invoking process.  Prior to
           version 1.8.21, environment variables with a value beginning with ‘()’
           were always removed.  Beginning with version 1.8.21, a pattern in
           env_delete is used to match bash shell functions instead.  Since it is
           not possible to block all potentially dangerous environment variables,
           use of the default env_reset behavior is encouraged.

           Environment variables specified by env_check, env_delete, or env_keep
           may include one or more ‘*’ characters which will match zero or more
           characters.  No other wildcard characters are supported.

           By default, environment variables are matched by name.  However, if the
           pattern includes an equal sign (‘=’), both the variables name and value
           must match.  For example, a bash shell function could be matched as
           follows:

           Without the ‘=()*’ suffix, this would not match, as bash shell
           functions are not preserved by default.

           The complete list of environment variables that are preserved or
           removed, as modified by global Defaults parameters in sudoers, is
           displayed when sudo is run by root with the -V option.  The list of
           environment variables to remove varies based on the operating system
           sudo is running on.

           Other sudoers options may influence the command environment, such as
           always_set_home, secure_path, set_logname, and set_home.

           On systems that support PAM where the pam_env module is enabled for
           sudo, variables in the PAM environment may be merged in to the
           environment.  If a variable in the PAM environment is already present
           in the user's environment, the value will only be overridden if the
           variable was not preserved by sudoers.  When env_reset is enabled,
           variables preserved from the invoking user's environment by the
           env_keep list take precedence over those in the PAM environment.  When
           env_reset is disabled, variables present the invoking user's
           environment take precedence over those in the PAM environment unless
           they match a pattern in the env_delete list.

    SUDOERS FILE FORMAT
           The sudoers file is composed of two types of entries: aliases
           (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may
           run what).

           When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order.
           Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not
           necessarily the most specific match).

           The sudoers file grammar will be described below in Extended Backus-
           Naur Form (EBNF).  Don't despair if you are unfamiliar with EBNF; it is
           fairly simple, and the definitions below are annotated.

       Resource limits
           By default, sudoers uses the operating system's native method of
           setting resource limits for the target user.  On Linux systems,
           resource limits are usually set by the pam_limits.so PAM module.  On
           some BSD systems, the /etc/login.conf file specifies resource limits
           for the user.  On AIX systems, resource limits are configured in the
           /etc/security/limits file.  If there is no system mechanism to set per-
           user resource limits, the command will run with the same limits as the
           invoking user.  The one exception to this is the core dump file size,
           which is set by sudoers to 0 by default.  Disabling core dumps by
           default makes it possible to avoid potential security problems where
           the core file is treated as trusted input.

    Manpage text:

    If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, the arguments in the
           Cmnd must match those given by the user on the command line.  If the
           arguments in a Cmnd begin with the ‘^’ character, they will be
           interpreted as a regular expression and matched accordingly.
           Otherwise, shell-style wildcards are used when matching.  Unless a
           regular expression is specified, the following characters must be
           escaped with a ‘\’ if they are used in command arguments: ‘,’, ‘:’,
           ‘=’, ‘\’.  To prevent arguments in a Cmnd that begin with a ‘^’
           character from being interpreted as a regular expression, the ‘^’ must
           be escaped with a ‘\’.

           There are two commands built into sudo itself: “list” and “sudoedit”.
           Unlike other commands, these two must be specified in the sudoers file
           without a leading path.

           The “list” built-in can be used to permit a user to list another user's
           privileges with sudo's -U option.  For example, “sudo -l -U otheruser”.
           A user with the “list” privilege is able to list another user's
           privileges even if they don't have permission to run commands as that
           user.  By default, only root or a user with the ability to run any
           command as either root or the specified user on the current host may
           use the -U option.  No command line arguments may be specified with the

    Files are parsed in sorted lexical order.  That is,

           Be aware that because the sorting is lexical, not numeric,
           /etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops would be loaded after /etc/sudoers.d/10_second.
           Using a consistent number of leading zeroes in the file names can be
           used to avoid such problems.  After parsing the files in the directory,
           control returns to the file that contained the @includedir directive.

           Unlike files included via @include, visudo will not edit the files in a
           @includedir directory unless one of them contains a syntax error.  It
           is still possible to run visudo with the -f flag to edit the files

This can be used to implement support for the\n       nonunix_group syntax described earlier.\n\n       Group provider plugins are specified via the group_plugin setting.  The\n       argument to group_plugin should consist of the plugin path, either\n       fully-qualified or relative to the /usr/local/libexec/sudo directory,\n       followed by any configuration options the plugin requires.  These\n       options (if specified) will be passed to the plugin's initialization\n       function.  If options are present, the string must be enclosed in\n       double quotes (\"\").\n\n       The following group provider plugins are installed by default:\n\n       group_file\n\t     The group_file plugin supports an alternate group file that uses\n\t     the same syntax as the /etc/group file.  The path to the group\n\t     file should be specified as an option to the plugin.  For\n\t     example, if the group file to be used is /etc/sudo-group:\n\n\t     Defaults group_plugin=\"group_file.so /etc/sudo-group\"\n\n       system_group\n\t     The system_group plugin supports group lookups via the standard C\n\t     library functions getgrnam(3) and getgrid(3).  This plugin can be\n\t     used in instances where the user belongs to groups not present in\n\t     the user's supplemental group vector.  This plugin takes no\n\t     options:\n\n\t     Defaults group_plugin=system_group.so\n\n       The group provider plugin API is described in detail in sudo_plugin(5).\n\nEVENT LOGGING\n       sudoers can log events in either JSON or sudo format, this section\n       describes the sudo log format.  Depending on sudoers configuration,\n       sudoers can log events via syslog(3), to a local log file, or both.\n       The log format is almost identical in both cases.  Any control\n       characters present in the log data are formatted in octal with a\n       leading ‘#’ character.  For example, a horizontal tab is stored as\n       ‘#011’ and an embedded carriage return is stored as ‘#015’.  In\n       addition, space characters in the command path are stored as ‘#040’.\n       Command line arguments that contain spaces are enclosed in single\n       quotes ('').  This makes it possible to distinguish multiple command\n       line arguments from a single argument that contains spaces.  Literal\n       single quotes and backslash characters (‘\\’) in command line arguments\n       are escaped with a backslash.\n\n   Accepted command log entries\n       Commands that sudo runs are logged using the following format (split\n       into multiple lines for readability):\n\n\t   date hostname progname: username : TTY=ttyname ; CHROOT=chroot ; \\\n\t       PWD=cwd ; USER=runasuser ; GROUP=runasgroup ; TSID=logid ; \\\n\t       ENV=env_vars COMMAND=command\n\n       Where the fields are as follows:\n\n       date\t     The date the command was run.  Typically, this is in the\n\t\t     format “MMM, DD, HH:MM:SS”.  If logging via syslog(3),\n\t\t     the actual date format is controlled by the syslog\n\t\t     daemon.  If logging to a file and the log_year option is\n\t\t     enabled, the date will also include the year.\n\n       hostname      The name of the host sudo was run on.  This field is only\n\t\t     present when logging via syslog(3).\n\n       progname      The name of the program, usually sudo or sudoedit.  This\n\t\t     field is only present when logging via syslog(3).\n\n       username      The login name of the user who ran sudo.\n\n       ttyname\t     The short name of the terminal (e.g., “console”, “tty01”,\n\t\t     or “pts/0”) sudo was run on, or “unknown” if there was no\n\t\t     terminal present.\n\n       chroot\t     The root directory that the command was run in, if one\n\t\t     was specified.\n\n       cwd\t     The current working directory that sudo was run in.\n\n       runasuser     The user the command was run as.\n\n       runasgroup    The group the command was run as if one was specified on\n\t\t     the command line.\n\n       logid\t     An I/O log identifier that can be used to replay the\n\t\t     command's output.\tThis is only present when the\n\t\t     log_input or log_output option is enabled.\n\n       env_vars      A list of environment variables specified on the command\n\t\t     line, if specified.\n\n       command\t     The actual command that was executed, including any\n\t\t     command line arguments.\n\n       Messages are logged using the locale specified by sudoers_locale, which\n       defaults to the ‘C’ locale.\n\n   Denied command log entries\n       If the user is not allowed to run the command, the reason for the\n       denial will follow the user name.  Possible reasons include:\n\n       user NOT in sudoers\n\t  The user is not listed in the sudoers file.\n\n       user NOT authorized on host\n\t  The user is listed in the sudoers file but is not allowed to run\n\t  commands on the host.\n\n       command not allowed\n\t  The user is listed in the sudoers file for the host but they are not\n\t  allowed to run the specified command.\n\n       3 incorrect password attempts\n\t  The user failed to enter their password after 3 tries.  The actual\n\t  number of tries will vary based on the number of failed attempts and\n\t  the value of the passwd_tries option.\n\n       a password is required\n\t  The -n option was specified but a password was required.\n\n       sorry, you are not allowed to set the following environment variables\n\t  The user specified environment variables on the command line that\n\t  were not allowed by sudoers.\n\n   Error log entries\n       If an error occurs, sudoers will log a message and, in most cases, send\n       a message to the administrator via email.  Possible errors include:\n\n       parse error in /private/etc/sudoers near line N\n\t  sudoers encountered an error when parsing the specified file.  In\n\t  some cases, the actual error may be one line above or below the line\n\t  number listed, depending on the type of error.\n\n       problem with defaults entries\n\t  The sudoers file contains one or more unknown Defaults settings.\n\t  This does not prevent sudo from running, but the sudoers file should\n\t  be checked using visudo.\n\n       timestamp owner (username): No such user\n\t  The time stamp directory owner, as specified by the timestampowner\n\t  setting, could not be found in the password database.\n\n       unable to open/read /private/etc/sudoers\n\t  The sudoers file could not be opened for reading.  This can happen\n\t  when the sudoers file is located on a remote file system that maps\n\t  user-ID 0 to a different value.  Normally, sudoers tries to open the\n\t  sudoers file using group permissions to avoid this problem.\n\t  Consider either changing the ownership of /private/etc/sudoers or\n\t  adding an argument like “sudoers_uid=N” (where ‘N’ is the user-ID\n\t  that owns the sudoers file) to the end of the sudoers Plugin line in\n\t  the sudo.conf(5) file.\n\n       unable to open /private/etc/sudoers\n\t  The /private/etc/sudoers file is missing.\n\n       /private/etc/sudoers is not a regular file\n\t  The /private/etc/sudoers file exists but is not a regular file or\n\t  symbolic link.\n\n       /private/etc/sudoers is owned by uid N, should be 0\n\t  The sudoers file has the wrong owner.  If you wish to change the\n\t  sudoers file owner, add “sudoers_uid=N” (where ‘N’ is the user-ID\n\t  that owns the sudoers file) to the sudoers Plugin line in the\n\t  sudo.conf(5) file.\n\n       /private/etc/sudoers is world writable\n\t  The permissions on the sudoers file allow all users to write to it.\n\t  The sudoers file must not be world-writable, the default file mode\n\t  is 0440 (readable by owner and group, writable by none).  The\n\t  default mode may be changed via the “sudoers_mode” option to the\n\t  sudoers Plugin line in the sudo.conf(5) file.\n\n       /private/etc/sudoers is owned by gid N, should be 1\n\t  The sudoers file has the wrong group ownership.  If you wish to\n\t  change the sudoers file group ownership, add “sudoers_gid=N” (where\n\t  ‘N’ is the group-ID that owns the sudoers file) to the sudoers\n\t  Plugin line in the sudo.conf(5) file.\n\n       unable to open /var/db/sudo/ts/username\n\t  sudoers was unable to read or create the user's time stamp file.\n\t  This can happen when timestampowner is set to a user other than root\n\t  and the mode on /var/db/sudo is not searchable by group or other.\n\t  The default mode for /var/db/sudo is 0711.\n\n       unable to write to /var/db/sudo/ts/username\n\t  sudoers was unable to write to the user's time stamp file.\n\n       /var/db/sudo/ts is owned by uid X, should be Y\n\t  The time stamp directory is owned by a user other than\n\t  timestampowner.  This can occur when the value of timestampowner has\n\t  been changed.  sudoers will ignore the time stamp directory until\n\t  the owner is corrected.\n\n       /var/db/sudo/ts is group writable\n\t  The time stamp directory is group-writable; it should be writable\n\t  only by timestampowner.  The default mode for the time stamp\n\t  directory is 0700.  sudoers will ignore the time stamp directory\n\t  until the mode is corrected.\n\n   Notes on logging via syslog\n       By default, sudoers logs messages via syslog(3).  The date, hostname,\n       and progname fields are added by the system's syslog(3) function, not\n       sudoers itself.\tAs such, they may vary in format on different systems.\n\n       The maximum size of syslog messages varies from system to system.  The\n       syslog_maxlen setting can be used to change the maximum syslog message\n       size from the default value of 980 bytes.  For more information, see\n       the description of syslog_maxlen.\n\n   Notes on logging to a file\n       If the logfile option is set, sudoers will log to a local file, such as\n       /var/log/sudo.  When logging to a file, sudoers uses a format similar\n       to syslog(3), with a few important differences:\n\n       1.   The progname field is not present.\n\n       2.   The hostname is only logged if the log_host option is enabled.\n\n       3.   The date does not include the year unless the log_year option is\n\t    enabled.\n\n       4.   Lines that are longer than loglinelen characters (80 by default)\n\t    are word-wrapped and continued on the next line with a four\n\t    character indent.  This makes entries easier to read for a human\n\t    being, but makes it more difficult to use grep(1) on the log\n\t    files.  If the loglinelen option is set to 0 (or negated with a\n\t    ‘!’), word wrap will be disabled.\n\nI/O LOGGING\n       When I/O logging is enabled, sudo will runs the command in a pseudo-\n       terminal, logging user input and/or output, depending on which sudoers\n       flags are enabled.  There are five distinct types of I/O that can be\n       logged, each with a corresponding sudoers flag."

The intercept_type\n\t\t  setting can be used to select between them.\n\n\t\t  The first mechanism, dso, overrides the standard C library\n\t\t  functions that are used to execute a command.  It does this\n\t\t  by setting an environment variable (usually LD_PRELOAD) to\n\t\t  the path of a dynamic shared object, or shared library,\n\t\t  containing custom versions of the execve(2), execl(3),\n\t\t  execle(3), execlp(3), execv(3), execvp(3), execvpe(3), and\n\t\t  system(3) library functions that connect back to sudo for a\n\t\t  policy decision.  Note, however, that this applies only to\n\t\t  dynamically-linked executables.  It is not possible to\n\t\t  intercept commands for statically-linked executables or\n\t\t  executables that run under binary emulation this way.\n\t\t  Because most dynamic loaders ignore LD_PRELOAD (or the\n\t\t  equivalent) when running set-user-ID and set-group-ID\n\t\t  programs, sudoers will not permit such programs to be run in\n\t\t  intercept mode by default.  The dso mechanism is\n\t\t  incompatible with sudo's SELinux RBAC support (but see\n\t\t  below).

    Time stamp file checks
           sudoers will check the ownership of its time stamp directory
           (/var/db/sudo/ts by default) and ignore the directory's contents if it
           is not owned by root or if it is writable by a user other than root.
           Older versions of sudo stored time stamp files in /tmp; this is no
           longer recommended as it may be possible for a user to create the time
           stamp themselves on systems that allow unprivileged users to change the
           ownership of files they create.

           While the time stamp directory should be cleared at reboot time, not
           all systems contain a /run or /var/run directory.  To avoid potential
           problems, sudoers will ignore time stamp files that date from before
           the machine booted on systems where the boot time is available.

           Some systems with graphical desktop environments allow unprivileged
           users to change the system clock.  Since sudoers relies on the system
           clock for time stamp validation, it may be possible on such systems for
           a user to run sudo for longer than timestamp_timeout by setting the
           clock back.  To combat this, sudoers uses a monotonic clock (which
           never moves backwards) for its time stamps if the system supports it.

    sudoers will not honor time stamps set far in the future.  Time stamps
           with a date greater than current_time + 2 * TIMEOUT will be ignored and
           sudoers will log and complain.

           If the timestamp_type option is set to “tty”, the time stamp record
           includes the device number of the terminal the user authenticated with.
           This provides per-terminal granularity but time stamp records may still
           outlive the user's session.

           Unless the timestamp_type option is set to “global”, the time stamp
           record also includes the session ID of the process that last
           authenticated.  This prevents processes in different terminal sessions
           from using the same time stamp record.  On systems where a process's
           start time can be queried, the start time of the session leader is
           recorded in the time stamp record.  If no terminal is present or the
           timestamp_type option is set to “ppid”, the start time of the parent
           process is used instead.  In most cases this will prevent a time stamp
           record from being re-used without the user entering a password when
           logging out and back in again.

           people who have contributed to sudo.

    CAVEATS
           The sudoers file should always be edited by the visudo utility which
           locks the file and checks for syntax errors.  If sudoers contains
           syntax errors, sudo may refuse to run, which is a serious problem if
           sudo is your only method of obtaining superuser privileges.  Recent
           versions of sudoers will attempt to recover after a syntax error by
           ignoring the rest of the line after encountering an error.  Older
           versions of sudo will not run if sudoers contains a syntax error.

           When using netgroups of machines (as opposed to users), if you store
           fully qualified host name in the netgroup (as is usually the case), you
           either need to have the machine's host name be fully qualified as
           returned by the hostname command or use the fqdn option in sudoers.
