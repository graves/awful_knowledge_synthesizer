It can\n     tunnel IPv6 traffic over IPv4, as specified in RFC3056.\n\n     For ordinary nodes in 6to4 site, you do not need stf interface.  The stf\n     interface is necessary for site border router (called “6to4 router” in\n     the specification).\n\n     Due to the way 6to4 protocol is specified, stf interface requires certain\n     configuration to work properly.  Single (no more than 1) valid 6to4\n     address needs to be configured to the interface.  “A valid 6to4 address”\n     is an address which has the following properties.\tIf any of the\n     following properties are not satisfied, stf raises runtime error on\n     packet transmission.  Read the specification for more details.\n\n     •\t matches 2002:xxyy:zzuu::/48 where xxyy:zzuu is a hexadecimal notation\n\t of an IPv4 address for the node.  IPv4 address can be taken from any\n\t of interfaces your node has.  Since the specification forbids the use\n\t of IPv4 private address, the address needs to be a global IPv4\n\t address."

If you would like to\n     restrict 6to4 peers to be inside certain IPv4 prefix, you may want to\n     configure IPv6 prefix length as “16 + IPv4 prefix length”.  stf interface\n     will check the IPv4 source address on packets, if the IPv6 prefix length\n     is larger than 16.\n\n     stf can be configured to be ECN friendly.\tThis can be configured by\n     IFF_LINK1.  See gif(4) for details.\n\n     Please note that 6to4 specification is written as “accept tunnelled\n     packet from everyone” tunnelling device.  By enabling stf device, you are\n     making it much easier for malicious parties to inject fabricated IPv6\n     packet to your node.  Also, malicious party can inject an IPv6 packet\n     with fabricated source address to make your node generate improper\n     tunnelled packet.\tAdministrators must take caution when enabling the\n     interface.  To prevent possible attacks, stf interface filters out the\n     following packets.  Note that the checks are no way complete:"
