The -c and -p flags, and options which\n     modify the behavior of those flags, still work.  The -s flag has no\n     effect.\n\n     See DirectoryService(8) for information on identity management in macOS.\n\nLEGACY DESCRIPTION\n     The pwd_mkdb utility creates db(3) style secure and insecure databases\n     for the specified file.  These databases are then installed into\n     /etc/spwd.db and /etc/pwd.db respectively.  The file is installed into\n     /etc/master.passwd.  The file must be in the correct format (see\n     passwd(5)).  It is important to note that the format used in this system\n     is different from the historic Version 7 style format.\n\n     The options are as follows:"

  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using pwd_mkdb to generate a password database with a specific cache size?

Do not\n\t   change, add, or remove any files.\n\n     -d directoryO\n\t   Store databases into specified destination directory instead of\n\t   /etc.\n\n     -i    Ignore locking failure of the master.passwd file.  This option is\n\t   intended to be used to build password files in the release process\n\t   over NFS where no contention can happen.  A non-default directory\n\t   must also be specified with the -d option for locking to be\n\t   ignored.  Other use of this option is strongly discouraged.\n\n     -N    Tell pwd_mkdb to exit with an error if it cannot obtain a lock on\n\t   the file.  By default, we block waiting for a lock on the source\n\t   file.  The lock is held through the rebuilding of the database.\n\n     -p    Create a Version 7 style password file and install it into\n\t   /etc/passwd.  Cannot be used in conjunction with the -s flag.\n\n     -S cachesize\n\t   Specify in megabytes the size of the memory cache used by the\n\t   hashing library.  On systems with a large user base, a small cache\n\t   size can lead to prohibitively long database file rebuild times.\n\t   As a rough guide, the memory usage of pwd_mkdb in megabytes will be\n\t   a little bit more than twice the figure specified here.  The\n\t   default is 2 megabytes."

This is most\n\t   commonly used in conjunction with the -u flag during a password\n\t   change.  Because the insecure database doesn't contain the password\n\t   there is no reason to update it if the only change is in the\n\t   password field.  Cannot be used in conjunction with the -p flag.\n\n     -u username\n\t   Only update the record for the specified user.  Utilities that\n\t   operate on a single user can use this option to avoid the overhead\n\t   of rebuilding the entire database.\n\n     The two databases differ in that the secure version contains the user's\n     encrypted password and the insecure version has an asterisk (``*'')\n\n     The databases are used by the C library password routines (see\n     getpwent(3)).\n\n     The pwd_mkdb utility exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     If the PW_SCAN_BIG_IDS environment variable is set, pwd_mkdb will\n     suppress the warning messages that are normally generated for large user\n     and group IDs.  Such IDs can cause serious problems with software that\n     makes assumptions about the values of IDs."
