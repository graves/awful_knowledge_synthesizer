The b64encode utility is synonymous with uuencode with the -m flag\n     specified.  The b64decode utility is synonymous with uudecode with the -m\n     flag specified.\n\n     The base64 utility acts as a base64 decoder when passed the --decode (or\n     -d) flag and as a base64 encoder otherwise.  As a decoder it only accepts\n     raw base64 input and as an encoder it does not produce the framing lines.\n     base64 reads standard input or file if it is provided and writes to\n     standard output.  Options --wrap (or -w) and --ignore-garbage (or -i) are\n     accepted for compatibility with GNU base64, but the latter is\n     unimplemented and silently ignored."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use uuencode to encode a file named 'data.txt' with the name 'mydata.txt' and output it to a file called 'encoded.txt'?

The encoding uses only printing ASCII characters and\n     includes the mode of the file and the operand name for use by uudecode.\n\n     The uudecode utility transforms uuencoded files (or by default, the\n     standard input) into the original form.  The resulting file is named\n     either name or (depending on options passed to uudecode) output_file and\n     will have the mode of the original file except that setuid and execute\n     bits are not retained.  The uudecode utility ignores any leading and\n     trailing lines.\n\n     The following options are available for uuencode:\n\n     -m     Use the Base64 method of encoding, rather than the traditional\n\t    uuencode algorithm.\n\n     -r     Produce raw output by excluding the initial and final framing\n\t    lines.\n\n     -o output_file\n\t    Output to output_file instead of standard output."
