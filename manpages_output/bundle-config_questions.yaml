Local config (app/.bundle/config)\n\n       2.  Environmental variables (ENV)\n\n       3.  Global config (~/.bundle/config)\n\n       4.  Bundler default config\n\n\n\n\n       Executing bundle config with no parameters will print a list of all\n       bundler configuration for the current bundle, and where that\n       configuration was set.\n\n       Executing bundle config <name> will print the value of that\n       configuration setting, and where it was set.\n\n       Executing bundle config <name> <value> will set that configuration to\n       the value specified for all bundles executed as the current user. The\n       configuration will be stored in ~/.bundle/config. If name already is\n       set, name will be overridden and user will be warned.\n\n       Executing bundle config --global <name> <value> works the same as\n       above.\n\n       Executing bundle config --local <name> <value> will set that\n       configuration to the local application. The configuration will be\n       stored in app/.bundle/config.\n\n       Executing bundle config --delete <name> will delete the configuration\n       in both local and global sources. Not compatible with --global or\n       --local flag.\n\n       Executing bundle with the BUNDLE_IGNORE_CONFIG environment variable set\n       will cause it to ignore all configuration.\n\n       Executing bundle config disable_multisource true upgrades the warning\n       about the Gemfile containing multiple primary sources to an error.\n       Executing bundle config --delete disable_multisource downgrades this\n       error to a warning.\n\nREMEMBERING OPTIONS\n       Flags passed to bundle install or the Bundler runtime, such as --path\n       foo or --without production, are not remembered between commands. If\n       these options must be remembered,they must be set using bundle config\n       (e.g., bundle config path foo).\n\n       The options that can be configured are:\n\n       bin    Creates a directory (defaults to ~/bin) and place any\n\t      executables from the gem there. These executables run in\n\t      Bundler´s context. If used, you might add this directory to your\n\t      environment´s PATH variable. For instance, if the rails gem\n\t      comes with a rails executable, this flag will create a bin/rails\n\t      executable that ensures that all referred dependencies will be\n\t      resolved using the bundled gems.\n\n       deployment\n\t      In deployment mode, Bundler will ´roll-out´ the bundle for\n\t      production use. Please check carefully if you want to have this\n\t      option enabled in development or test environments.\n\n       path   The location to install the specified gems to. This defaults to\n\t      Rubygems´ setting. Bundler shares this location with Rubygems,\n\t      gem install ... will have gem installed there, too. Therefore,\n\t      gems installed without a --path ... setting will show up by\n\t      calling gem list. Accordingly, gems installed to other locations\n\t      will not get listed.\n\n       without\n\t      A space-separated list of groups referencing gems to skip during\n\t      installation.\n\n       with   A space-separated list of groups referencing gems to include\n\t      during installation.\n\nBUILD OPTIONS\n       You can use bundle config to give Bundler the flags to pass to the gem\n       installer every time bundler tries to install a particular gem.\n\n       A very common example, the mysql gem, requires Snow Leopard users to\n       pass configuration flags to gem install to specify where to find the\n       mysql_config executable.\n\n\n\n\t   gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bundle-config`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSince the specific location of that executable can change from machine\n       to machine, you can specify these flags on a per-machine basis.\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config build.mysql --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config\n\n\n\n\n       After running this command, every time bundler needs to install the\n       mysql gem, it will pass along the flags you specified.\n\nCONFIGURATION KEYS\n       Configuration keys in bundler have two forms: the canonical form and\n       the environment variable form.\n\n       For instance, passing the --without flag to bundle install(1)\n       bundle-install.1.html prevents Bundler from installing certain groups\n       specified in the Gemfile(5). Bundler persists this value in\n       app/.bundle/config so that calls to Bundler.setup do not try to find\n       gems from the Gemfile that you didn´t install. Additionally, subsequent\n       calls to bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html remember this setting\n       and skip those groups.\n\n       The canonical form of this configuration is \"without\". To convert the\n       canonical form to the environment variable form, capitalize it, and\n       prepend BUNDLE_. The environment variable form of \"without\" is\n       BUNDLE_WITHOUT.\n\n       Any periods in the configuration keys must be replaced with two\n       underscores when setting it via environment variables. The\n       configuration key local.rack becomes the environment variable\n       BUNDLE_LOCAL__RACK.\n\nLIST OF AVAILABLE KEYS\n       The following is a list of all configuration keys and their purpose.\n       You can learn more about their operation in bundle install(1)\n       bundle-install.1.html.\n\n       •   allow_bundler_dependency_conflicts\n\t   (BUNDLE_ALLOW_BUNDLER_DEPENDENCY_CONFLICTS): Allow resolving to\n\t   specifications that have dependencies on bundler that are\n\t   incompatible with the running Bundler version.\n\n       •   allow_deployment_source_credential_changes\n\t   (BUNDLE_ALLOW_DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE_CREDENTIAL_CHANGES): When in\n\t   deployment mode, allow changing the credentials to a gem´s source.\n\t   Ex: https://some.host.com/gems/path/ ->\n\t   https://user_name:password@some.host.com/gems/path\n\n       •   allow_offline_install (BUNDLE_ALLOW_OFFLINE_INSTALL): Allow Bundler\n\t   to use cached data when installing without network access.\n\n       •   auto_clean_without_path (BUNDLE_AUTO_CLEAN_WITHOUT_PATH):\n\t   Automatically run bundle clean after installing when an explicit\n\t   path has not been set and Bundler is not installing into the system\n\t   gems.\n\n       •   auto_install (BUNDLE_AUTO_INSTALL): Automatically run bundle\n\t   install when gems are missing.\n\n       •   bin (BUNDLE_BIN): Install executables from gems in the bundle to\n\t   the specified directory.

As\n\t   a result, gems with native extensions will be compiled from source.\n\n       •   frozen (BUNDLE_FROZEN): Disallow changes to the Gemfile. When the\n\t   Gemfile is changed and the lockfile has not been updated, running\n\t   Bundler commands will be blocked. Defaults to true when\n\t   --deployment is used.\n\n       •   gem.push_key (BUNDLE_GEM__PUSH_KEY): Sets the --key parameter for\n\t   gem push when using the rake release command with a private\n\t   gemstash server.\n\n       •   gemfile (BUNDLE_GEMFILE): The name of the file that bundler should\n\t   use as the Gemfile. This location of this file also sets the root\n\t   of the project, which is used to resolve relative paths in the\n\t   Gemfile, among other things. By default, bundler will search up\n\t   from the current working directory until it finds a Gemfile.\n\n       •   global_gem_cache (BUNDLE_GLOBAL_GEM_CACHE): Whether Bundler should\n\t   cache all gems globally, rather than locally to the installing Ruby\n\t   installation.\n\n       •   global_path_appends_ruby_scope\n\t   (BUNDLE_GLOBAL_PATH_APPENDS_RUBY_SCOPE): Whether Bundler should\n\t   append the Ruby scope (e.g. engine and ABI version) to a\n\t   globally-configured path.\n\n       •   ignore_messages (BUNDLE_IGNORE_MESSAGES): When set, no post install\n\t   messages will be printed. To silence a single gem, use dot notation\n\t   like ignore_messages.httparty true.\n\n       •   init_gems_rb (BUNDLE_INIT_GEMS_RB) Generate a gems.rb instead of a\n\t   Gemfile when running bundle init.\n\n       •   jobs (BUNDLE_JOBS): The number of gems Bundler can install in\n\t   parallel. Defaults to 1.\n\n       •   list_command (BUNDLE_LIST_COMMAND) Enable new list command feature\n\n       •   major_deprecations (BUNDLE_MAJOR_DEPRECATIONS): Whether Bundler\n\t   should print deprecation warnings for behavior that will be changed\n\t   in the next major version.\n\n       •   no_install (BUNDLE_NO_INSTALL): Whether bundle package should skip\n\t   installing gems.\n\n       •   no_prune (BUNDLE_NO_PRUNE): Whether Bundler should leave outdated\n\t   gems unpruned when caching.\n\n       •   only_update_to_newer_versions\n\t   (BUNDLE_ONLY_UPDATE_TO_NEWER_VERSIONS): During bundle update, only\n\t   resolve to newer versions of the gems in the lockfile.\n\n       •   path (BUNDLE_PATH): The location on disk where all gems in your\n\t   bundle will be located regardless of $GEM_HOME or $GEM_PATH values.\n\t   Bundle gems not found in this location will be installed by bundle\n\t   install. Defaults to Gem.dir. When --deployment is used, defaults\n\t   to vendor/bundle.\n\n       •   path.system (BUNDLE_PATH__SYSTEM): Whether Bundler will install\n\t   gems into the default system path (Gem.dir).\n\n       •   path_relative_to_cwd (PATH_RELATIVE_TO_CWD) Makes --path relative\n\t   to the CWD instead of the Gemfile.\n\n       •   plugins (BUNDLE_PLUGINS): Enable Bundler´s experimental plugin\n\t   system.\n\n       •   prefer_gems_rb (BUNDLE_PREFER_GEMS_RB) Prefer gems.rb to Gemfile\n\t   when Bundler is searching for a Gemfile.\n\n       •   print_only_version_number (BUNDLE_PRINT_ONLY_VERSION_NUMBER) Print\n\t   only version number from bundler --version.\n\n       •   redirect (BUNDLE_REDIRECT): The number of redirects allowed for\n\t   network requests.

Defaults to the ruby install name used to\n\t   generate the binstub.\n\n       •   silence_root_warning (BUNDLE_SILENCE_ROOT_WARNING): Silence the\n\t   warning Bundler prints when installing gems as root.\n\n       •   skip_default_git_sources (BUNDLE_SKIP_DEFAULT_GIT_SOURCES): Whether\n\t   Bundler should skip adding default git source shortcuts to the\n\t   Gemfile DSL.\n\n       •   specific_platform (BUNDLE_SPECIFIC_PLATFORM): Allow bundler to\n\t   resolve for the specific running platform and store it in the\n\t   lockfile, instead of only using a generic platform. A specific\n\t   platform is the exact platform triple reported by\n\t   Gem::Platform.local, such as x86_64-darwin-16 or\n\t   universal-java-1.8. On the other hand, generic platforms are those\n\t   such as ruby, mswin, or java. In this example, x86_64-darwin-16\n\t   would map to ruby and universal-java-1.8 to java.\n\n       •   ssl_ca_cert (BUNDLE_SSL_CA_CERT): Path to a designated CA\n\t   certificate file or folder containing multiple certificates for\n\t   trusted CAs in PEM format.\n\n       •   ssl_client_cert (BUNDLE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT): Path to a designated file\n\t   containing a X.509 client certificate and key in PEM format.\n\n       •   ssl_verify_mode (BUNDLE_SSL_VERIFY_MODE): The SSL verification mode\n\t   Bundler uses when making HTTPS requests. Defaults to verify peer.\n\n       •   suppress_install_using_messages\n\t   (BUNDLE_SUPPRESS_INSTALL_USING_MESSAGES): Avoid printing Using ...\n\t   messages during installation when the version of a gem has not\n\t   changed.\n\n       •   system_bindir (BUNDLE_SYSTEM_BINDIR): The location where RubyGems\n\t   installs binstubs. Defaults to Gem.bindir.\n\n       •   timeout (BUNDLE_TIMEOUT): The seconds allowed before timing out for\n\t   network requests. Defaults to 10.\n\n       •   unlock_source_unlocks_spec (BUNDLE_UNLOCK_SOURCE_UNLOCKS_SPEC):\n\t   Whether running bundle update --source NAME unlocks a gem with the\n\t   given name. Defaults to true.\n\n       •   update_requires_all_flag (BUNDLE_UPDATE_REQUIRES_ALL_FLAG) Require\n\t   passing --all to bundle update when everything should be updated,\n\t   and disallow passing no options to bundle update.\n\n       •   user_agent (BUNDLE_USER_AGENT): The custom user agent fragment\n\t   Bundler includes in API requests.\n\n       •   with (BUNDLE_WITH): A :-separated list of groups whose gems bundler\n\t   should install.\n\n       •   without (BUNDLE_WITHOUT): A :-separated list of groups whose gems\n\t   bundler should not install.\n\n\n\n\n       In general, you should set these settings per-application by using the\n       applicable flag to the bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html or\n       bundle package(1) bundle-package.1.html command.\n\n       You can set them globally either via environment variables or bundle\n       config, whichever is preferable for your setup. If you use both,\n       environment variables will take preference over global settings.\n\nLOCAL GIT REPOS\n       Bundler also allows you to work against a git repository locally\n       instead of using the remote version. This can be achieved by setting up\n       a local override:\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config local.GEM_NAME /path/to/local/git/repository\n\n\n\n\n       For example, in order to use a local Rack repository, a developer could\n       call:\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config local.rack ~/Work/git/rack\n\n\n\n\n       Now instead of checking out the remote git repository, the local\n       override will be used. Similar to a path source, every time the local\n       git repository change, changes will be automatically picked up by\n       Bundler. This means a commit in the local git repo will update the\n       revision in the Gemfile.lock to the local git repo revision. This\n       requires the same attention as git submodules. Before pushing to the\n       remote, you need to ensure the local override was pushed, otherwise you\n       may point to a commit that only exists in your local machine. You´ll\n       also need to CGI escape your usernames and passwords as well.\n\n       Bundler does many checks to ensure a developer won´t work with invalid\n       references. Particularly, we force a developer to specify a branch in\n       the Gemfile in order to use this feature. If the branch specified in\n       the Gemfile and the current branch in the local git repository do not\n       match, Bundler will abort. This ensures that a developer is always\n       working against the correct branches, and prevents accidental locking\n       to a different branch.\n\n       Finally, Bundler also ensures that the current revision in the\n       Gemfile.lock exists in the local git repository. By doing this, Bundler\n       forces you to fetch the latest changes in the remotes.\n\nMIRRORS OF GEM SOURCES\n       Bundler supports overriding gem sources with mirrors. This allows you\n       to configure rubygems.org as the gem source in your Gemfile while still\n       using your mirror to fetch gems.\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config mirror.SOURCE_URL MIRROR_URL\n\n\n\n\n       For example, to use a mirror of rubygems.org hosted at\n       rubygems-mirror.org:\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config mirror.http://rubygems.org http://rubygems-mirror.org\n\n\n\n\n       Each mirror also provides a fallback timeout setting. If the mirror\n       does not respond within the fallback timeout, Bundler will try to use\n       the original server instead of the mirror.\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config mirror.SOURCE_URL.fallback_timeout TIMEOUT\n\n\n\n\n       For example, to fall back to rubygems.org after 3 seconds:\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config mirror.https://rubygems.org.fallback_timeout 3\n\n\n\n\n       The default fallback timeout is 0.1 seconds, but the setting can\n       currently only accept whole seconds (for example, 1, 15, or 30).\n\nCREDENTIALS FOR GEM SOURCES\n       Bundler allows you to configure credentials for any gem source, which\n       allows you to avoid putting secrets into your Gemfile.\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config SOURCE_HOSTNAME USERNAME:PASSWORD\n\n\n\n\n       For example, to save the credentials of user claudette for the gem\n       source at gems.longerous.com, you would run:\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config gems.longerous.com claudette:s00pers3krit\n\n\n\n\n       Or you can set the credentials as an environment variable like this:\n\n\n\n\t   export BUNDLE_GEMS__LONGEROUS__COM=\"claudette:s00pers3krit\"\n\n\n\n\n       For gems with a git source with HTTP(S) URL you can specify credentials\n       like so:\n\n\n\n\t   bundle config https://github.com/bundler/bundler.git username:password\n\n\n\n\n       Or you can set the credentials as an environment variable like so:\n\n\n\n\t   export BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM=username:password\n\n\n\n\n       This is especially useful for private repositories on hosts such as\n       Github, where you can use personal OAuth tokens:\n\n\n\n\t   export BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM=abcd0123generatedtoken:x-oauth-basic\n\n\n\n\nCONFIGURE BUNDLER DIRECTORIES\n       Bundler´s home, config, cache and plugin directories are able to be\n       configured through environment variables. The default location for\n       Bundler´s home directory is ~/.bundle, which all directories inherit\n       from by default. The following outlines the available environment\n       variables and their default values\n\n\n\n\t   BUNDLE_USER_HOME : $HOME/.bundle\n\t   BUNDLE_USER_CACHE : $BUNDLE_USER_HOME/cache\n\t   BUNDLE_USER_CONFIG : $BUNDLE_USER_HOME/config\n\t   BUNDLE_USER_PLUGIN : $BUNDLE_USER_HOME/plugin"
