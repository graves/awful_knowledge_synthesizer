It\n     returns successive pseudo-random numbers in the range from 0 to\n     (2**31)−1.  The period of this random number generator is very large,\n     approximately 16*((2**31)−1).\n\n     The random() and srandom() functions have (almost) the same calling\n     sequence and initialization properties as the rand(3) and srand(3)\n     functions.  The difference is that rand(3) produces a much less random\n     sequence — in fact, the low dozen bits generated by rand go through a\n     cyclic pattern.  All of the bits generated by random() are usable.  For\n     example, ‘random()&01’ will produce a random binary value."

    Manpage text:

    Once a state has been initialized, the setstate() routine provides for
         rapid switching between states.  The setstate() function returns a
         pointer to the previous state array; its argument state array is used for
         further random number generation until the next call to initstate() or
         setstate().

         Once a state array has been initialized, it may be restarted at a
         different point either by calling initstate() (with the desired seed, the
         state array, and its size) or by calling both setstate() (with the state
         array) and srandom() (with the desired seed).  The advantage of calling
         both setstate() and srandom() is that the size of the state array does
         not have to be remembered after it is initialized.

         With 256 bytes of state information, the period of the random number
         generator is greater than 2**69 , which should be sufficient for most
         purposes.

    DIAGNOSTICS
         If initstate() is called with less than 8 bytes of state information, or
         if setstate() detects that the state information has been garbled, error
         messages are printed on the standard error output.
