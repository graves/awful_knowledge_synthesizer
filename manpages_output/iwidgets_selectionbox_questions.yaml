The user may choose any of the items\n       displayed in the scrolled list of alternatives and the selection field\n       will be filled with the choice.\tThe user is also free to enter a new\n       value in the selection entry field.  Both the list and entry areas have\n       labels.\tA child site is also provided in which the user may create\n       other widgets to be used in conjunction with the selection box.\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::selectionbox command creates a new Tcl command whose name\n       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on\n       the widget.  It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n\nASSOCIATED METHODS\n       curselection    delete\t      index\t      nearest\n       scan\t       selection      size\n\n       See the \"listbox\" widget class manual entry for details on the\n       associated methods."
