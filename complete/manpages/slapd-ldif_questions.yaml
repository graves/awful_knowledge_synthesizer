It is intended as a cheap,\n       low performance easy to use backend, and it is exploited by higher-\n       level internal structures to provide a permanent storage.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       These slapd.conf options apply to the LDIF backend database.  That is,\n       they must follow a \"database ldif\" line and come before any subsequent\n       \"backend\" or \"database\" lines.  Other database options are described in\n       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\n       directory <dir>\n\t      Specify the directory where the database tree starts.  The\n\t      directory must exist and grant appropriate permissions (rwx) to\n\t      the identity slapd is running with."
