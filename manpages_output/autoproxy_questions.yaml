It tries to initialize the web access settings from\n       system standard locations and can be configured to negotiate\n       authentication with the proxy if required.\n\n       On Unix the standard for identifying the local HTTP proxy server seems\n       to be to use the environment variable http_proxy or ftp_proxy and\n       no_proxy to list those domains to be excluded from proxying.  On\n       Windows we can retrieve the Internet Settings values from the registry\n       to obtain pretty much the same information.  With this information we\n       can setup a suitable filter procedure for the Tcl http package and\n       arrange for automatic use of the proxy.\n\n       There seem to be a number of ways that the http_proxy environment\n       variable may be set up. Either a plain host:port or more commonly a URL\n       and sometimes the URL may contain authentication parameters or these\n       may be requested from the user or provided via http_proxy_user and\n       http_proxy_pass. This package attempts to deal with all these schemes.\n       It will do it's best to get the required parameters from the\n       environment or registry and if it fails can be reconfigured.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::autoproxy::init\n\t      Initialize the autoproxy package from system resources. Under\n\t      unix this means we look for environment variables. Under windows\n\t      we look for the same environment variables but also look at the\n\t      registry settings used by Internet Explorer.\n\n       ::autoproxy::cget -optionname\n\t      Retrieve individual package configuration options. See OPTIONS.\n\n       ::autoproxy::configure ?-option value?\n\t      Configure the autoproxy package. Calling configure with no\n\t      options will return a list of all option names and values.  See\n\t      OPTIONS.\n\n       ::autoproxy::tls_connect args\n\t      Connect to a secure socket through a proxy. HTTP proxy servers\n\t      permit the use of the CONNECT HTTP command to open a link\n\t      through the proxy to the target machine. This function hides the\n\t      details. For use with the http package see tls_socket.\n\n\t      The args list may contain any of the tls package options but\n\t      must end with the host and port as the last two items.\n\n       ::autoproxy::tunnel_connect args\n\t      Connect to a target host throught a proxy. This uses the same\n\t      CONNECT HTTP command as the tls_connect but does not promote the\n\t      link security once the connection is established.\n\n\t      The args list may contain any of the tls package options but\n\t      must end with the host and port as the last two items.\n\n\t      Note that many proxy servers will permit CONNECT calls to a\n\t      limited set of ports - typically only port 443 (the secure HTTP\n\t      port).\n\n       ::autoproxy::tls_socket args\n\t      This function is to be used to register a proxy-aware secure\n\t      socket handler for the https protocol. It may only be used with\n\t      the Tcl http package and should be registered using the\n\t      http::register command (see the examples below). The job of\n\t      actually creating the tunnelled connection is done by the\n\t      tls_connect command and this may be used when not registering\n\t      with the http package.\n\nOPTIONS\n       host hostname\n\n       proxy_host hostname\n\t      Set the proxy hostname. This is normally set up by init but may\n\t      be configured here as well.\n\n       port number\n\n       proxy_port number\n\t      Set the proxy port number. This is normally set up by init.\n\t      e.g. configure -port 3128\n\n       no_proxy list\n\t      You may manipulate the no_proxy list that was setup by init. The\n\t      value of this option is a tcl list of strings that are matched\n\t      against the http request host using the tcl string match\n\t      command. Therefore glob patterns are permitted.  For instance,\n\t      configure -no_proxy *.localdomain\n\n       authProc procedure\n\t      This option may be used to set an application defined procedure\n\t      to be called when configure -basic is called with either no or\n\t      insufficient authentication details. This can be used to present\n\t      a dialog to the user to request the additional information.\n\n       -basic Following options are for configuring the Basic authentication\n\t      scheme parameters. See Basic Authentication.\n\nBASIC AUTHENTICATION\n       Basic is the simplest and most commonly use HTTP proxy authentication\n       scheme. It is described in (1 section 11) and also in (2). It offers no\n       privacy whatsoever and its use should be discouraged in favour of more\n       secure alternatives like Digest. To perform Basic authentication the\n       client base64 encodes the username and plaintext password separated by\n       a colon. This encoded text is prefixed with the word \"Basic\" and a\n       space.\n\n       The following options exists for this scheme:\n\n       -username name\n\t      The username required to authenticate with the configured proxy.\n\n       -password password\n\t      The password required for the username specified.\n\n       -realm realm\n\t      This option is not used.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       package require autoproxy\n       autoproxy::init\n       autoproxy::configure -basic -username ME -password SEKRET\n       set tok [http::geturl http://wiki.tcl.tk/]\n       http::data $tok"
