    PREFA

    THIS EIGHTH EDITION of Trigonometry preserves the popular format and style of
    the previous editions. It is a standard right triangle approach to trigonometry, pro-
    viding a smooth and integrated development of the six trigonometric functions
    from point-on-the-terminal-side, to right triangle, to circular function definitions.
    Nearly every section is written so that it can be discussed in a typical class session.

    The focus of the text is on understanding the definitions and principles of
    trigonometry and their applications to problem solving. Exact values of the trig-
    onometric functions are emphasized throughout the text. The clean layout and
    conversational style encourage students to read the text. Historical vignettes are
    placed throughout the text to give students an appreciation for the rich history
    behind trigonometry and the people who contributed to its development.

    The text covers all the material usually taught in trigonometry. There is also
    an appendix that provides a review of algebra, geometry, functions, and inverse
    functions. The appendix sections can be used as a review of topics with which
    students may already be familiar, or they can be used to provide instruction for
    students encountering these concepts for the first time.

    Numerous calculator notes are placed throughout the text to help students
    calculate values when appropriate. As there are many different models of graph-
    ing calculators, and each model has its own set of commands, we have tried to
    avoid overuse of specific key icons or command names.

    Content Changes

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Trigonometric Function Definitions**\n\nUsing the text''s approach to defining trigonometric functions, explain how the six trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant) are derived from the right triangle definition, the point-on-the-terminal-side definition, and the circular function definition.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the right triangle definition and how it leads to the basic trigonometric ratios.\n- **Step 2**: Explain the transition from the right triangle to the point-on-the-terminal-side definition, highlighting how the unit circle extends the domain of trigonometric functions.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the circular function definition builds on the point-on-the-terminal-side definition to define trigonometric functions for any real number input.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly integrate the three definitions and demonstrate an understanding of their relationships and applications.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Trigonometric Principles in Problem Solving**\n\nA ship is sailing along a straight path, and a lighthouse is located at a point 10 miles north of the ship''s starting position. The ship travels 15 miles east and then 20 miles south. At what angle (in degrees) is the lighthouse located from the ship''s final position?\n- **Step 1**: Use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance between the lighthouse and the ship''s final position.\n- **Step 2**: Apply trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, or tangent) to find the angle between the ship''s path and the line connecting the ship to the lighthouse.\n- **Step 3**: Verify your answer using the inverse trigonometric functions provided in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must include all steps, use appropriate trigonometric functions, and demonstrate an understanding of how to apply trigonometry to real-world navigation problems.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Trigonometric Identities and Applications**\n\nConsider the identity $ \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 $.\n- **Part A**: Prove this identity using the definitions of sine and cosine from the circular function definition.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this identity is used in solving real-world problems, such as determining the height of a building or the length of a bridge.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All trigonometric functions are periodic with the same period." Your example must reference at least two trigonometric functions and clarify how their periods differ.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the identity with its applications and demonstrate an understanding of the periodic nature of trigonometric functions.'

    x PREFACE

    NEW OR REVISED EXERCISES Many of the exercises have been revised, and new
    exercises and application problems have been added in some sections to help stu-
    dents better grasp key concepts, and to help motivate students and stimulate their
    interest in trigonometry. The most significant additions include the following.

    m SECTION 4.4: We have added more exercises to this section, giving students the
    opportunity for additional practice identifying the period, range, and horizon-
    tal and vertical translations for the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant

    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY Each problem set begins with a set of questions that

    a.

    focus on grasping the main ideas and understanding the vocabulary and terminology
    ology presented in that particular section. Most of these questions are short-answer
    but some also include matching or other formats.

    included | in some of the problem sets These S@ GXercises are clearly marked with a
    special icon and can easily be omitted if you are not using this technology in your
    classroom. Some of these exercises are investigative in nature, and help prepare

    students for concepts that are introduced in following sections.
    APPLICATIONS Application problems are titled according to subject and indexed for

    easy reference. We have found that students are more likely to put effort and effort
    into application problems if they do not have to work an overwhelming number of
    them at one time, and if they work on them every day. For this reason, a few applica-
    tion problems are included toward the end of almost every problem set in the text.

    Practice Problems give students an opportunity to explore certain topics further or take on
    a more challenging problem.

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Graphing Calculator Technology in Trigonometry**\n\nExplain how the use of graphing calculator technology, as described in the text, can enhance the study of trigonometric functions.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the specific section in the text that discusses the role of technology in trigonometry.\n- **Step 2**: Describe at least three ways graphing calculators can be used to improve understanding of trigonometric concepts.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how these technological tools support both visual and analytical learning styles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the text''s discussion of technology to the practical applications in trigonometry, and you must demonstrate an understanding of how technology can be used in both graphical and analytical contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Problem-Solving Strategies**\n\nThe text mentions that application problems are designed to be worked on daily to build student engagement.\n- **Part A**: Explain the reasoning behind this strategy, using the text''s description of how students are more likely to put effort into application problems when they are spread out.\n- **Part B**: Create a hypothetical scenario where a student might use this strategy effectively. Describe the scenario, the problem, and how the student applies the strategy.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how this approach aligns with the text''s emphasis on "exploratory" exercises and how it can prepare students for more complex concepts in later sections.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of problem-solving strategies and demonstrate an understanding of how daily application problems contribute to student learning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Integration of Conceptual and Applied Learning**\n\nThe text describes how problem sets include both conceptual questions and application problems.\n- **Part A**: Explain the purpose of the "conceptual and vocabulary" questions at the beginning of each problem set.\n- **Part B**: Describe how the "practice problems" section can be used to reinforce the concepts introduced in the "conceptual and vocabulary" questions.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical problem that combines both conceptual and applied reasoning. Explain how this problem would be structured and what skills it would test.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s structure and how it supports both conceptual and applied learning, with a focus on how these elements work together to enhance student understanding.'

- prompt: |-
    “MS Beginning with Chapter 2, each problem set contains a few
    review problems. Where appropriate, the review problems cover material that will
    be needed in the next section; otherwise, they cover material from the previous
    chapter. Continual review will help students retain what they have learned in pre-
    vious chapters and reinforce main ideas.

    OBJECTIVES AND ASSESSMENTS Multiple-choice questions are provided at
    the end of every problem set and are designed to be used in or outside of class to
    assess student learning. Each question directly corresponds to one of the student
    learning objectives for that section. Answers to these questions are not avail-
    able to students, but are provided for instructors in the Instructor’s Edition and
    the Instructor’s Solutions Manual. These problems can be especially useful for
    schools and institutions required to provide documentation and data relating to
    assessment of student learning outcomes.

    PROJECTS Each chapter concludes with a group project which involves
    some interesting problem or application that relates to or extends the ideas intro-
    duced in the chapter. Many of the projects emphasize the connection of math-
    ematics with other disciplines, or illustrate real-life situations in which trigonometry
    is used. The projects are designed to be used in class with groups of three or four
    students each, but the problems could also be given as individual assignments for
    students wanting an additional challenge.

    A SPECIAL NO

    Trigonometry can be a very enjoyable subject to study. You will find that there
    are many interesting and useful problems that trigonometry can be used to solve.
    However, many trigonometry students are apprehensive at first because they are
    worried they will not understand the topics we cover. When we present a new
    topic that they do not grasp completely, they think something is wrong with them
    for not understanding it. On the other hand, some students are excited about the
    course from the beginning. They are not worried about understanding trigonom-
    etry and, in fact, expect to find some topics difficult.

    What is the difference between these two types of students?

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Properties of Real Numbers**\n\nUsing the definitions of the properties of addition and multiplication provided in the text, simplify the expression $ 3x + 2(5 - x) $.\n- **Step 1**: Apply the distributive property to expand the terms.\n- **Step 2**: Use the associative and commutative properties to combine like terms.\n- **Step 3**: Justify each step by referencing the specific property (e.g., "The distributive property states that...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final simplified expression must be correct, and you must explicitly identify at least two distinct properties used in your reasoning.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rational Exponent Definitions**\n\nEvaluate $ 16^{3/4} $ using the three definitions of rational exponents provided in the text:\n- **Definition 1**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^{1/n})^m $\n- **Definition 2**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $ \n- **Definition 3**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Compute the value using Definition 1. Show all intermediate steps, including simplifying radicals and exponents.\n- **Part B**: Verify that your result matches the value obtained using Definition 2. Explain why Definitions 1 and 2 yield the same outcome despite their different order of operations.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s repeated emphasis on equivalent forms (e.g., $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $) ensures consistency in simplifying expressions with rational exponents.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of all three definitions and explicitly link their equivalence to the properties of exponents.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Number Classifications**\n\nThe text defines natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. Consider the number $ \sqrt{16} $.\n- **Part A**: Determine which sets (natural, whole, integer, rational, or irrational) this number belongs to. Justify your answer using definitions from the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why $ \sqrt{16} $ is not classified as an irrational number, despite involving a square root. Use logical reasoning based on the distinction between rational and irrational numbers provided in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All numbers with exponents are irrational." Your example must reference at least two sets from the text (e.g., integers, rationals) and clarify how they relate to exponentiation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the hierarchy of real number classifications and demonstrate an understanding of why certain numbers fall into specific categories.'

    Those who are excited about the course know from experience (as you do) that a certain amount of confusion is associated with most new topics in mathematics. They don’t worry about it, because they also know that the confusion gives way to understanding in the process of reading the text, working problems, and getting their questions answered. If they find a topic difficult, they work as many problems as necessary to grasp the subject. They don’t wait for the understanding to come to them; they go out and get it by working lots of problems. In contrast, the students who lack confidence tend to give up when they become confused. Instead of working more problems, they sometimes stop working problems altogether — and that, of course, guarantees that they will remain confused.

    If you are worried about this course because you lack confidence in your ability to understand trigonometry, and you want to change the way you feel about mathematics, then look forward to the first topic that causes you some confusion. As soon as that topic comes along, make it your goal to master it, in spite of your apprehension. You will see that each and every topic covered in this course is one you can eventually master, even if your initial introduction to it is accompanied by some confusion. As long as you have passed a college-level intermediate algebra course (or its equivalent), you are ready to take this course.

    It also helps a great deal if you make a solid commitment to your trigonometry course. If you are not completely committed to a class, then you will tend to give less than your full effort. Consider this quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s *Faust:

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding the Role of Confusion in Learning**\n\nThe text discusses how confusion is a natural part of learning mathematics, and that persistence through confusion leads to understanding.\n\n**Question**: Explain how the text''s perspective on confusion aligns with the quote from *Faust* that is mentioned. Use specific examples from the text to illustrate how the process of working through problems and seeking clarification is essential for mastering trigonometry.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference both the text''s explanation of confusion and the *Faust* quote, and demonstrate an understanding of how persistence in the face of difficulty is key to learning trigonometry.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Applying the Concept of Commitment to Learning**\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of commitment to a trigonometry course, stating that lack of commitment leads to less effort and continued confusion.\n\n**Question**: If you were to advise a student who is unsure about their ability to master trigonometry, how would you apply the text''s advice about commitment and persistence? Use the text''s explanation of the role of intermediate algebra in readiness for trigonometry as a basis for your advice.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s discussion of intermediate algebra and the importance of commitment, and demonstrate how these factors contribute to successful learning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analyzing the Text''s Approach to Teaching Trigonometry**\n\nThe text presents a view of mathematics learning that emphasizes working through problems and seeking understanding despite initial confusion.\n\n**Question**: Compare and contrast the learning approaches of the two types of students described in the text (those who work through problems and those who give up when confused). Use the text''s explanation of the role of intermediate algebra in readiness for trigonometry to support your analysis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish the two approaches, reference the text''s discussion of intermediate algebra, and explain how the text''s advice applies to trigonometry learning.'

    Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always
    ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one
    elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid
    plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence
    moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise
    have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising
    in one’s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents, meetings and material
    assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.
    Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius,
    power and magic in it.

    A SPECIAL NOTE TO THE STUDENT

    If you are committed to doing well in trigonometry, the following suggestions
    will be important to you.

    See your teacher. You are there. Missing class and then expecting to find out what
    went on from someone else is not the same as being there yourself.

    Read the textbook. This text was written for you! It is best to read beforehand
    the section that will be covered in class. Reading in advance, even if you do
    not understand everything you read, helps prepare a foundation for what you
    will see in class. Also, your instructor may not have time to discuss everything
    you need to know from a section, so you may need to pick up some things on
    your own.

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on the Role of Initiative**\n\nThe passage states that ''the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too.'' Using this idea, construct an argument for why initiative is essential in trigonometry.\n- **Part A**: Define ''initiative'' in the context of the passage.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of how initiative in learning trigonometry can lead to unexpected benefits.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the role of initiative with the ''ignorance'' mentioned in the passage.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate the passage''s themes and demonstrate a clear understanding of the relationship between commitment, initiative, and success in trigonometry.'

    The Six Trigonometric

    Functions

    Introduction

    The history of mathematics is a spiral of knowledge passed down from one gen-
    eration to another. Each person in the history of mathematics is connected to the
    others along this spiral. In Italy, around 500 B.c., the Pythagoreans discovered a
    relationship between the sides of any right triangle. That discovery, known as the
    Pythagorean Theorem, is the foundation on which the Spiral of Roots shown in
    Figure 1 is built. The Spiral of Roots gives us a way to visualize square roots of
    positive integers.

    Figure 1

    In Problem Set 1.1, you will have a chance to construct the Spiral of Roots
    yourself.

    2 CHAPTER 1 Bf The Six Trigonometric Functions

    Study Skills

    At the beginning of the first few chapters of this text you will find a Study
    Skills section in which we list the skills that are necessary for success in
    trigonometry. If you have just completed an algebra class successfully, you
    have acquired most of these skills. If it has been some time since you have
    taken a math class, you must pay attention to the sections on study skills.
    Here is a list of things you can do to develop effective study skills.

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Historical and Mathematical Concepts**\n\nThe text mentions the Pythagorean Theorem and its connection to the Spiral of Roots. Considering the historical context provided, explain how the Pythagorean Theorem''s discovery influenced the development of trigonometric functions.\n- **Step 1**: Discuss the relationship between the Pythagorean Theorem and the Pythagorean triples.\n- **Step 2**: Relate the Spiral of Roots to the concept of square roots in trigonometry.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the historical spiral of knowledge connects to the modern study of trigonometry.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate historical context with mathematical principles as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Study Skills in Trigonometry**\n\nThe text outlines study skills necessary for success in trigonometry. Create a study plan for a student who has completed an algebra class but has not studied trigonometry in several years.\n- **Part A**: Identify three key study skills from the text that are essential for mastering trigonometry.\n- **Part B**: Develop a weekly schedule that incorporates these skills over a 4-week period.\n- **Part C**: Explain how these skills contribute to long-term retention and understanding of trigonometric concepts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your plan must be practical and demonstrate an understanding of both study techniques and trigonometric principles.'

    EM Put Yourself on a Schedule The general rule is that you spend two hours
    on homework for every hour you are in class. Make a schedule for your-
    self, setting aside at least six hours a week to work on trigonometry. Once
    you make the schedule, stick to it. Don’t just complete your assignments
    and then stop. Use all the time you have set aside. If you complete an
    assignment and have time left over, read the next section in the text and
    work more problems. As the course progresses you may find that six hours
    a week is not enough time for you to master the material in this course. If
    it takes you longer than that to reach your goals for this course, then that’s
    how much time it takes. Trying to get by with less will not work.

    Find Your Mistakes and Correct Them There is more to studying
    trigonometry than just working problems. You must always check your
    answers with those in the back of the text. When you have made a mis-
    take, find out what it is and correct it. Making mistakes is part of the
    process of learning mathematics. The key to discovering what you do not
    understand can be found by correcting your mistakes.

    FE] Imitate Success Your work should look like the work you see in this
    text and the work your instructor shows. The steps shown in solving
    problems in this text were written by someone who has been successful
    in mathematics. The same is true of your instructor. Your work should
    imitate the work of people who have been successful in mathematics.

    23 Memorize Definitions and Identities You may think that memoriza-
    tion is not necessary if you understand a topic you are studying. In trigo-
    nometry, memorization is especially important. In this chapter, you will
    be presented with the definition of the six trigonometric functions that
    you will use throughout your study of trigonometry. We have seen many
    bright students struggle with trigonometry simply because they did not
    memorize the definitions and identities when they were first presented.

    Learning Objectives

    Compute the complement and supplement of an angle.
    Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the third side of a right triangle.

    Find the other two sides of a 30°-60°–90° or 45°-45°–90° triangle given
    one side.

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Study Strategies for Trigonometry Success**\n\nBased on the text''s advice on effective study habits, design a weekly study schedule for a student who has 10 hours per week available for trigonometry. The schedule must incorporate the following elements: \n- **Schedule Design**: Allocate time for homework, reviewing the text, and practicing problems. \n- **Mistake Analysis**: Include a section where the student reviews and corrects errors from the previous day''s work. \n- **Imitation of Success**: Dedicate time to replicating the problem-solving steps from the text and instructor examples. \n- **Memorization Practice**: Schedule regular review sessions for key definitions and identities. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your schedule must be realistic, demonstrate understanding of the text''s recommendations, and explicitly reference the text''s advice on time allocation and error correction.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Trigonometric Definitions**\n\nGiven a 30°-60°–90° triangle where the hypotenuse is 10 units long, determine the lengths of the other two sides using the definitions and identities provided in the text. \n- **Step 1**: Recall the specific ratios of the sides in a 30°-60°–90° triangle as defined in the text. \n- **Step 2**: Apply these ratios to the given hypotenuse length, showing all calculations. \n- **Step 3**: Justify your answer by referencing the text''s explanation of how these ratios are derived from the properties of right triangles. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must be mathematically accurate and explicitly link the side ratios to the text''s definitions, demonstrating a deep understanding of the relationships between the sides and angles in such triangles.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Memorization in Trigonometry**\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of memorizing trigonometric definitions and identities. Construct an argument to explain why memorization is essential for mastering trigonometry, even for students who understand the underlying concepts. \n- **Part A**: Reference at least two specific definitions or identities from the text and explain their significance. \n- **Part B**: Use logical reasoning to argue that memorization enhances problem-solving efficiency, even when the conceptual understanding is present. \n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a common mistake that could be avoided through memorization, and explain how this mistake would impact problem-solving. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate the text''s perspective on memorization and demonstrate a clear understanding of its role in both conceptual and practical aspects of trigonometry.'

    Introduction

    Table 1 is taken from the trail map at the Northstar California Ski Resort in Lake
    Tahoe, California. The table gives the length of some of the chair lifts at Northstar,
    along with the change in elevation from the beginning of the lift to the end of the lift.

    Right triangles are good mathematical models for chair lifts. In this section
    we review some important items from geometry, including right triangles. Let’s
    begin by looking at some of the terminology associated with angles.

    Angles in General

    An angle is formed by two rays with the same end point. The common end point is
    called the vertex of the angle, and the rays are called the sides of the angle.

    In Figure 1 the vertex of angle 6 (theta) is labeled O, and A and B are points
    on each side of 6. Angle @ can also be denoted by AOB, where the letter associated
    with the vertex is written between the letters associated with the points on each side.

    We can think of 6 as having been formed by rotating side OA about the ver-
    tex to side OB. In this case, we call side OA the initial side of 6 and side OB the
    terminal side of @.

    When the rotation from the initial side to the terminal side takes place in a
    counterclockwise direction, the angle formed is considered a positive angle. If the
    rotation is in a clockwise direction, the angle formed is a negative angle (Figure 2).

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Angle Measurement and Direction**\n\nIn Figure 2, if the initial side of an angle is the positive x-axis and the terminal side is in the second quadrant, determine the sign of the angle and explain your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s definition of positive and negative angles and the direction of rotation.\n\n**Answer**: The angle is positive because the terminal side is obtained by rotating the initial side counterclockwise. Since the terminal side is in the second quadrant, the rotation is counterclockwise, which is the standard direction for positive angles as defined in the text.\n\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Using Special Triangle Relationships to Solve a Real-Life Problem**\n\nAt Northstar California Ski Resort, the Big Springs Express lift has a vertical rise of 480 feet and a length of 4,100 feet. Using the special triangle relationships provided in the text, determine the angle of elevation of this lift.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must include the use of trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan) and the special triangles (30°-60°-90° and 45°-45°-90°), and you must explain how the given measurements relate to the sides of the triangle.\n\n**Answer**: The angle of elevation can be found using the sine function: sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = 480/4100. This corresponds to a 30°-60°-90° triangle where the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. By comparing 480/4100 to the ratios, we determine that θ is approximately 6.8°, which is close to 7°, matching the 30°-60°-90° triangle''s angle relationships.\n\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Classifying Angles and Their Applications**\n\nBased on the text''s definitions of angles and the information provided in Table 1, classify the angles formed by the chair lifts at Northstar California Ski Resort. Explain how the vertical rise and length of each lift relate to the angles of elevation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the text''s terminology for angles (initial side, terminal side, vertex) and the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the angles.\n\n**Answer**: The angles formed by the chair lifts are angles of elevation, with the initial side along the horizontal and the terminal side rising to the peak. The vertical rise (opposite side) and the length of the lift (hypotenuse) form a right triangle, and the angle of elevation can be calculated using trigonometric ratios as described in the text.\n\n'

    Degree Measure

    One way to measure the size of an angle is with degree measure. The angle formed
    by rotating a ray through one complete revolution has a measure of 360 degrees,
    written 360° (Figure 3).

    One complete One degree (1°), then, is 1/360 of a full rotation. Likewise, 180° is one-half of
    revolution = 360° a full rotation, and 90° is half of that (or a quarter of a rotation). Angles that mea-
    Figure 3 ure 90° are called right angles, while angles that measure 180° are called straight

    If two angles have a sum of 90°, then they are called complementary angles,
    and we say each is the complement of the other. Two angles with a sum of 180° are
    called supplementary angles.

    NOTE To be precise, we should say “two angles, the sum of the measures of
    which is 180°, are called supplementary angles” because there is a difference
    between an angle and its measure. However, in this text, we will not always draw
    the distinction between an angle and its measure. Many times we will refer to
    “angle 0” when we actually mean “the measure of angle 0.”

    There are different types of triangles that are named according to the rela-
    tive lengths of their sides or angles (Figure 6). In an equilateral triangle, all three
    sides are of equal length and all three angles are equal. An isosceles triangle has
    two equal sides and two equal angles. If all the sides and angles are different, the
    triangle is called scalene. In an acute triangle, all three angles are acute. An obtuse
    triangle has exactly one obtuse angle, and a right triangle has one right angle.

    Special Triangles

    As we will see throughout this text, right triangles are very important to the study
    of trigonometry. In every right triangle, the longest side is called the hypotenuse,
    and it is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides are called the /egs of
    the right triangle. Because the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180°, the other
    two angles in a right triangle must be complementary, acute angles. The Pythago-
    rean Theorem that we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter gives us the
    relationship that exists among the sides of a right triangle.

    Pythagorean Theorem

    In any right triangle, the square of the length of the longest side (called the
    hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two
    sides (called legs).

    If C = 90°,
    then c² = a² + b².

    SECTION 1.1 Angles, Degrees, and Special Triangles 7

    To find the horizontal distance covered by a person riding the chair lift, we
    use the Pythagorean Theorem:

    5,900² = x² + 1,250² Pythagorean Theorem
    34,810,000 = x² + 1,562,500 Simplify squares
    x² = 34,810,000 — 1,562,500 Solve for x²
    x² = 33,247,500 Simplify the right side
    x = √33,247,500
    x = 5,766 ft To the nearest foot

    A rider getting on the lift at point A and riding to point B will cover a horizontal
    distance of approximately 5,766 feet. a

    Before leaving the Pythagorean Theorem, we should mention something
    about Pythagoras and his followers, the Pythagoreans. They established them-
    selves as a secret society around the year 540 B.C. The Pythagoreans kept no written
    record of their work; everything was handed down by spoken word. Their
    influence was not only in mathematics, but also in religion, science, medicine, and
    music. Among other things, they discovered the correlation between musical notes
    and the reciprocals of counting numbers, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and so on. In their daily lives they
    followed strict dietary and moral rules to achieve a higher rank in future lives. The
    British philosopher Bertrand Russell has referred to Pythagoras as “intellectually
    one of the most important men that ever lived.”

    ladder to the wall, then the length of the ladder can be represented by 2x. The
    distance from the top of the ladder to the ground is x V3, since it is opposite the
    60° angle (Figure 15). It is also given as 4 feet. Therefore,

    For Questions 1 through 7, fill in each blank with the appropriate word or number.

    1. For a positive angle, the rotation from the initial side to the terminal side takes
    place in a clockwise direction. For a negative angle, the rotation takes place in a
    counterclockwise direction.
    2. Two angles with a sum of 90° are called complementary angles, and when the sum is 180°
    they are called supplementary angles.

    3. In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is always 180°.

    4. In a right triangle, the longest side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called legs.

    5. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the
    sum of the squares of the legs.

    6. In a 30°—60°—90° triangle, the hypotenuse is always twice the shortest side, and
    the side opposite the 60° angle is always √3 times the shortest side.

    7. In a 45°—45°—90° triangle, the legs are always equal and the hypotenuse is
    always √2 times either leg.

    8. Match each term with the appropriate angle measure.

    a. Right i, 0° < θ < 90°

    b. Straight ii, θ = 90°

    c. Acute iii. 90° < θ < 180°

    The book *The Closing of the American Mind* by Allan Bloom was published in 1987 and spent many weeks on the bestseller list. In the book, Mr. Bloom recalls being in a restaurant in France and overhearing a waiter call another waiter a "Cartesian." He goes on to say that French people today define themselves in terms of the philosophy of either René Descartes (1595-1650) or Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Followers of Descartes are sometimes referred to as Cartesians.

    16 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions

    As a philosopher, Descartes is responsible for the statement "I think, therefore I
    am." In mathematics, Descartes is credited with, among other things, the invention of the rectangular coordinate system, which we sometimes call the Cartesian coordinate system. Until Descartes invented his coordinate system in 1637, algebra and geometry were treated as separate subjects. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to connect algebra and geometry by associating geometric shapes with algebraic equations. For example, every nonvertical straight line (a geometric concept) can be paired with an equation of the form y = mx + b (an algebraic concept), where m and b are real numbers, and x and y are variables that we associate with the axes of a coordinate system. In this section we will review some of the concepts developed around the rectangular coordinate system and graphing in two dimensions.

    Graphing Parabolas

    Recall from your algebra classes that any parabola that opens up or down can be
    described by an equation of the form

    y = a(x - h)^2 + k

    Likewise, any equation of this form will have a graph that is a parabola. The high-
    est or lowest point on the parabola is called the vertex. The coordinates of the
    vertex are (h, k). The value of a determines how wide or narrow the parabola will
    be and whether it opens upward or downward.

    EXAMPLE 2 At a past Washington County Fair in Oregon, David Smith,
    Jr., The Bullet, was shot from a cannon. As a human cannonball, he reached
    a height of 70 feet before landing in a net 160 feet from the cannon. Sketch the
    graph of his path, and then find the equation of the graph.

    SOLUTION We assume that the path taken by the human cannonball is a parabola.
    If the origin of the coordinate system is at the opening of the cannon, then the net
    that catches him will be at 160 on the x-axis. Figure 5 shows a graph of this path.

    Net

    [ a es ee ee ee ee ee ee ]

    80 160
    Figure 5
    Because the curve is a parabola, we know that the equation will have the form
    y = a(x - h)^2 + k

    Because the vertex of the parabola is at (80, 70), we can fill in two of the three
    constants in our equation, giving us

    y = a(x - 80)^2 + 70

    To find a we note that the landing point will be (160, 0). Substituting the coor-
    dinates of this point into the equation, we solve for a.

    0 = a(160 - 80)^2 + 70

    0 = a(80)^2 + 70

    The distance between any two points (x), y,) and (x, y) in a rectangular coor-
    dinate system is given by the formula

    r= √(x₁ — x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)²

    The distance formula can be derived by applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the
    right triangle in Figure 8. Because r is a distance, r = 0.

    EXAMPLE 3. Find the distance between the points (—1, 5) and (2, 1).

    SOLUTION It makes no difference which of the points we call (x₁, y₁) and
    which we call (x₂, y₂) because this distance will be the same between the two
    points regardless (Figure 9).

    Equation of a Circle

    The equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r > 0 is given by the
    formula

    (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

    If the center is at the origin so that (h, k) = (0, 0), this simplifies to

    x^2 + y^2 = r^2

    EXAMPLE 5 Verify that the points (±√2/2, ±√2/2) and (√3/2, 1/2) both lie on
    a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.
    SOLUTION Because r = 1, the equation of the circle is x^2 + y^2 = 1. We check
    each point by showing that the coordinates satisfy the equation.
    V2 V2 V3 1
    If x = √2/2 and y = √2/2, then x^2 + y^2 = (√2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2
    If x = √3/2 and y = 1/2, then x^2 + y^2 = (√3/2)^2 + (1/2)^2

    = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

    22 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions

    The circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 from Example 5 is called the unit circle because its
    radius is 1. As you will see, it will be an important part of one of the definitions
    that we will give in Chapter 3.

    Using Technology: Graphing a Circle

    To graph the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 on a graphing calculator, we must first isolate y:

    y^2 = 1 - x^2

    y = ±√(1 - x^2)

    Because of the + sign, we see that a circle is really the union of two separate
    functions. The positive square root represents the top half of the circle and
    the negative square root represents the bottom half. Define these functions
    separately (Figure 13).

    When you graph both functions, you will probably see a circle that is not
    quite round and has gaps near the x-axis (Figure 14). Getting rid of the gaps
    can be tricky, and it requires a good understanding of how your calculator
    works. However, we can easily make the circle appear round using the zoom-
    square command (Figure 15).

- prompt: |-
    SOLUTION If we draw 45° in standard position, we see that the terminal side is
    along the line y = x in quadrant I (Figure 16). Because the terminal side of 45°
    lies along the line y = x in the first quadrant, any point on the terminal side will
    have positive coordinates that satisfy the equation y = x. Here are some of the
    points that do just that.

    Vocabulary

    If angle θ is in standard position and the terminal side of θ lies in quadrant I,
    then we say θ lies in quadrant I and we abbreviate it like this:

    θ ∈ QI

    Likewise, θ ∈ QII means θ is in standard position with its terminal side in quad-

    rant II.
    y

    If the terminal side of an angle in standard position lies along one of the
    axes, then that angle is called a quadrantal angle. For example, an angle of 90°
    drawn in standard position would be a quadrantal angle, because the terminal
    side would lie along the positive y-axis. Likewise, 270° in standard position is a
    quadrantal angle because the terminal side would lie along the negative y-axis
    (Figure 17).

    Two angles in standard position with the same terminal side are called
    coterminal angles. Figure 18 shows that 60° and —300° are coterminal angles when
    they are in standard position. Notice that these two angles differ by 360°. That is,
    60° — (—300°) = 360°. Coterminal angles always differ from each other by some
    multiple of 360°.

    One revolution in the positive direction: —90° + 360° = 270°

    One revolution in the negative direction: —90° — 360° = —450°
    A second revolution in the negative direction: —450° — 360° = —810°

    NOTE There are actually an infinite number of angles that are coterminal with
    —90°. We can find a coterminal angle by adding or subtracting 360° any number
    of times. If we let k be any integer, then the angle —90° + 360° will be coterminal

A catcher is at home plate, and a shortstop is at second base.\n\n**Question**: How far does the catcher have to throw the ball to reach the shortstop?\n\n**Answer Requirements**:\n- Use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the distance.\n- Explain why the distance forms the hypotenuse of the right triangle.\n- Justify that the triangle is a right triangle based on the problem description.\n- Show all steps of the calculation, including the formula and substitution of values.\n\n**Answer**: The distance is 60√2 feet, calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem since the triangle formed by home plate, first base, and second base is a right triangle with legs of 60 feet each. The hypotenuse is the distance from home plate to second base, which is the throw required.'

    30 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions

    Definition | = Trigonometric Functions (x, y, r Definitions) |
    If θ is an angle in standard position, and the point (x, y) is any point on the
    terminal side of θ other than the origin, then the six trigonometric functions of
    angle θ are defined as follows:
    Function Abbreviation Definition
    sin θ = y/r
    cos θ = x/r
    tan θ = y/x (x ≠ 0)
    cot θ = x/y (y ≠ 0)
    sec θ = r/x (x ≠ 0)
    csc θ = r/y (y ≠ 0)
    where x² + y² = r², or r = √(x² + y²). That is, r is the distance from the origin
    to (x, y).
    (x, y)
    As you can see, the six trigonometric functions are simply names given to
    r | y the six possible ratios that can be made from the numbers x, y, and r as shown in
    | Figure 1. In particular, notice that tan θ can be interpreted as the slope of the line
    θ corresponding to the terminal side of θ. Both tan θ and sec θ will be undefined
    when x = 0, which will occur any time the terminal side of θ coincides with the
    y-axis. Likewise, both cot θ and csc θ will be undefined when y = 0, which will
    Figure 1 occur any time the terminal side of θ coincides with the x-axis.

    EXAMPLE 2 Find the sine and cosine of 45°.
    SOLUTION According to the definition given earlier, we can find sin 45° and
    cos 45° if we know a point (x, y) on the terminal side of 45°, when 45° is in stan-
    dard position. Figure 3 is a diagram of 45° in standard position.

    Because the terminal side of 45° lies along the line y = x, any point on
    the terminal side will have equal coordinates. A convenient point to use is the
    point (1, 1). (We say it is a convenient point because the coordinates are easy
    to work with.)
    Because x = 1 and y = 1 and r = √(x² + y²), we have
    r = √2
    Substituting these values for x, y, and r into our definition for sine and cosine,
    we have √2 √2

    SOLUTION Again, we need to find a point on the terminal side of 270°. From
    Figure 4, we see that the terminal side of 270° lies along the negative y-axis.

    **Algebraic Signs of Trigonometric Functions**

    The algebraic sign, + or —, of each of the six trigonometric functions will depend
    on the quadrant in which θ terminates. For example, in quadrant I all six trigono-

    **PROBLEM 5**
    If tan θ = 4/3 and θ terminates in
    quadrant III, find sin θ and cos θ.

    **NOTE** In Example 5 we are not
    saying that if y/r = —5/13, then

    y must be —5 and r must be 13.
    There are many pairs of numbers
    whose ratio is —5/13, not just —5
    and 13. Our definition for sine and
    cosine indicates we can choose
    any point on the terminal side of
    θ. However, because r is always
    positive, we must associate the
    negative sign with y.

    **SECTION 1.3 Bf Definition I: Trigonometric Functions 33**

    sin θ and csc θ are positive because y and r are positive and x is negative. Table 1
    shows the signs of all the ratios in each of the four quadrants.

    For θ in QI QII QIII QIV

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\n38 CHAPTER 1 Bf The Six Trigonometric Functions\n\nYou may recall from the work you have done in algebra that an expression such as \nsin @ = y/r, where (x, y) is a point on the terminal side of an angle @ in standard position and r = √(x² + y²). \n\nTo find the value of a trigonometric function, you can use the definitions of the six trigonometric functions in terms of x, y, and r. These are:\n\nsin @ = y/r  \ncos @ = x/r  \ntan @ = y/x  \ncsc @ = r/y  \nsec @ = r/x  \ncot @ = x/y  \n\nUsing these definitions, you can find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the coordinates of a point on the terminal side of an angle. For example, if (x, y) is a point on the terminal side of @, then:\n\nsin @ = y/r  \ncos @ = x/r  \ntan @ = y/x  \ncsc @ = r/y  \nsec @ = r/x  \ncot @ = x/y  \n\nwhere r = √(x² + y²). \n\nYou can also use reciprocal identities to find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the value of its reciprocal. For example, if you know that csc @ = 2, then sin @ = 1/2. \n\nYou can also use ratio identities to find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the values of two other trigonometric functions. For example, if you know that sin @ = 3/5 and cos @ = 4/5, then tan @ = (3/5)/(4/5) = 3/4. \n\nYou can also use a Pythagorean identity to find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the value of another trigonometric function. For example, if you know that sin @ = 3/5, then cos @ can be found using the Pythagorean identity: sin²@ + cos²@ = 1. So, (3/5)² + cos²@ = 1 → 9/25 + cos²@ = 1 → cos²@ = 16/25 → cos @ = ±4/5. \n\nThe sign of the trigonometric function depends on the quadrant in which the angle terminates. For example, if @ is in QII, then sin @ is positive and cos @ is negative. \n\nYou can also evaluate a trigonometric function raised to an exponent by using the definitions of the trigonometric functions. For example, if sin @ = 3/5, then (sin @)² = (3/5)² = 9/25. \n\nBy using these definitions and identities, you can find the value of a trigonometric function if you know the coordinates of a point on the terminal side of an angle or the value of one trigonometric function.\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner."

    Vx" + 9 cannot be simplified further because the square root of a sum is not equal to the sum of the square roots. (In other words, it would be a mistake to write Vx? +9 as x + 3.) However, expressions such as Vx* + 9 occur frequently enough in mathematics that we would like to find expressions equivalent to them that do not contain square roots. As it turns out, the relationships that we develop in this section and the next are the key to rewriting expressions such as V.x* + 9 in a more convenient form, which we will show in Section 1.5.

    Before we begin our introduction to identities, we need to review some con-
    cepts from arithmetic and algebra.

    In algebra, statements such as 2x =x +x, x°=x-x-+x, and Z= ; are
    called identities. They are identities because they are true for all replacements of
    the variable for which they are defined.

    NOTE jz is not equal to ‘ when x is 0. The statement 7. = t is still an identity,
    however, since it is true for all values of x for which z- is defined.

    The eight basic trigonometric identities we will work with in this section are
    all derived from our definition of the trigonometric functions. Because many trig-
    onometric identities have more than one form, we will list the basic identity first
    and then give the most common equivalent forms of that identity.

    Reciprocal Identities

    Our definition for the sine and cosecant functions indicate that they are recipro-
    cals; that is,
    1 r

    csc 9 = — because ; =—=-—=csced
    sin 0 sn@ y/r yp

    NOTE We can also write this same relationship between sin @ and csc @ in
    another form as
    1

    1 yi,
    sin 9 = —— because =—=-=sin0
    csc 8 escO rly 4

    The first identity we wrote, csc 9 = 1/sin @, is the basic identity. The second
    one, sin 0 = 1/csc @, is an equivalent form of the first.

    40 CHAPTER 1 The Six Trigonometric Functions

    Notation

    The notation sin² @ is a shorthand notation for (sin @)². It indicates we are to
    square the number that is the sine of @.

    PROBLEMS EXAMPLES
    8. If cos @ = 3/5, find cos² @. 8. If sin @ = 3/5, then sin² @ = (3/5)² = 9/25
    9. If cos @ = -4/5, find cos² @. 9. If tan @ = 3/5, find tan² @.

    Pythagorean Identities

    To derive our first Pythagorean identity, we start with the relationship among x, y,
    and r as given in the definition of sin @ and cos @.

    x² + y² = r²
    Divide through by r²

    x²/r² + y²/r² = 1

    (x/r)² + (y/r)² = 1
    Property of exponents

    (cos @)² + (sin @)² = 1 Definition of sin @ and cos @
    (cos @)² + (sin @)² = 1 Notation

    This last line is our first Pythagorean identity. We will use it many times through-
    out the text. It states that, for any angle @, the sum of the squares of sin @ and
    cos @ is always 1.

    There are two very useful equivalent forms of the first Pythagorean identity.
    One form occurs when we solve (cos @)² + (sin @)² = 1 for cos @, and the other form
    is the result of solving for sin @.

    Solving for cos @ we have

    (cos @)² = 1 - (sin @)²
    Solving for sin @ we have

    (sin @)² = 1 - (cos @)²

    SECTION 1.5 Bf More on Identities 47

    The topics we will cover in this section are an extension of the work we did with
    identities in Section 1.4. We can use the eight basic identities we introduced in the
    previous section to rewrite or simplify certain expressions. It will be helpful at this
    point if you have already begun to memorize these identities.

    The first topic involves writing any of the six trigonometric functions in terms
    of any of the others. Let’s look at an example.

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Write tan 6 in terms of sin 6.
    Write sec 6 in terms of sin 6.
    SOLUTION When we say we want tan 6 written in terms of sin 0, we mean that

    we want to write an expression that is equivalent to tan 6 but involves no trigo-
    nometric function other than sin 6. Let’s begin by using a ratio identity to write
    tan @ in terms of sin 6 and cos 6.

    Now we need to replace cos 6 with an expression involving only sin 0. Since
    cos@ = + V1 -— sin’@

    sin 6

    tan 8
    cos 6

    sin 0
    +V1— sin? 6
    sin 6

    >
    V1 — sin? @

    This last expression is equivalent to tan 6 and is written in terms of sin @ only.
    (In a problem like this, it is okay to include numbers and algebraic symbols
    with sin 0.) a

    Here is another example.

    Positive ANGLES [1.1]

    “ee An angle is formed by two rays with a common end point. The common end point

    Negative is called the vertex, and the rays are called sides, of the angle. If we think of an
    angle as being formed by rotating the initial side about the vertex to the terminal
    side, then a counterclockwise rotation gives a positive angle, and a clockwise rota-
    tion gives a negative angle.

    There are 360° in a full rotation. This means that 1° is of a full rotation.
    An angle that measures 90° is a right angle. An angle that measures 180° is a

    In any right triangle, the square of the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse)

    In any right triangle in which the two acute angles are 30° and 60°, the longest side
    (the hypotenuse) is always twice the shortest side (the side opposite the 30° angle),
    and the side of medium length (the side opposite the 60° angle) is always √3 times
    the shortest side.

    If the two acute angles in a right triangle are both 45°, then the two shorter

    Although the Babylonians appear to have had an understanding of this relationship a thousand years before Pythagoras, his name is associated with the theorem because he was the first to provide a proof. In this project you will provide the details for several proofs of the theorem.

    EM The diagram shown in Figure 1 was used by the Hindu mathematician Bhaskara to prove the theorem in the 12th century. His proof consisted only of the diagram and the word "Behold!" Use this figure to derive the Pythagorean Theorem. The right triangle with sides a, b, and c has been repeated three times. The area of the large square is equal to the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the area of the small square in the center. The key to this derivation is in finding the length of a side of the small square. Once you have the equation, simplify the right side to obtain the theorem.
    Figure 1

    1 The second proof, credited to former president James Garfield, is based on the diagram shown in Figure 2. Use this figure to derive the Pythagorean Theorem. The right triangle with sides a, b, and c has been repeated and a third triangle created by placing a line segment between points P and Q. The area of the entire figure (a trapezoid) is equal to the sum of the areas of the three triangles. Once you have the equation, simplify both sides and then isolate c" to obtain the theorem.

    FE] For the third "proof," consider the two squares shown in Figure 3. Both squares are of the same size, so their areas must be equal. Write a paragraph explaining how this diagram serves as a "visual proof" of the Pythagorean Theorem. The key to this argument is to make use of what the two squares have in common.

    Although Pythagoras preceded William Shakespeare by 2,000 years, the philosophy of the Pythagoreans is mentioned in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice. Here is a quote from that play:

    Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith,
    To hold opinion with Pythagoras,

    That souls of animals infuse themselves
    Into the trunks of men.

    == Right Triangle Trigonometry

    Introduction

    Most serious hikers are familiar with maps like the one shown in Figure 1. It is
    a topographic map. This particular map is of Bishop’s Peak in San Luis Obispo,
    California.

    Mike Agliolo/Flame/Corbis

    NOTE Many of the chapter
    introductions touch on one of the
    themes running throughout the
    text. For example, the image of the
    compass rose indicates that this
    particular introduction relates to
    the navigation theme.

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Pythagorean Philosophy and Modern Beliefs**\n\nExplain how the philosophy of the Pythagoreans, as described in the text, relates to the concept of ''excellence as a habit'' from the quote: ''We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the core belief of the Pythagoreans regarding the nature of reality and the soul.\n- **Step 2**: Connect this belief to the idea of cultivating excellence through consistent actions.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this to present-day religions or philosophies that emphasize the importance of habitual behavior in achieving spiritual or moral excellence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s description of Pythagorean beliefs with logical reasoning about the connection between habit and excellence, and provide a specific example from modern contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Right Triangle Trigonometry in Navigation**\n\nUsing the topographic map of Bishop’s Peak, imagine you are a hiker planning a route. The map shows a right triangle where the vertical distance (elevation gain) is 1,200 feet and the horizontal distance (horizontal distance) is 2,400 feet.\n- **Part A**: Calculate the straight-line distance (hypotenuse) between the two points using the Pythagorean Theorem. Show all steps and justify the application of the theorem.\n- **Part B**: If the angle of elevation from the base to the peak is 30 degrees, use trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to verify the horizontal distance. Explain how this relates to navigation and map interpretation.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the concepts of right triangle trigonometry are essential for accurate navigation in hiker planning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of both the Pythagorean Theorem and trigonometric ratios, with precise calculations and logical connections to real-world navigation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Pythagorean Beliefs and Their Influence**\n\nThe text mentions that the Pythagoreans believed in the transmigration of souls, where souls can transfer between animals and humans. Analyze the implications of this belief on the following:\n- **Part A**: The ethical treatment of animals in Pythagorean philosophy.\n- **Part B**: The role of mathematics in understanding the soul''s journey.\n- **Part C**: The potential conflicts between Pythagorean beliefs and modern scientific views on the soul.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must critically evaluate the text''s description of Pythagorean beliefs, linking them to ethical, philosophical, and scientific perspectives. Provide at least one historical example or reference to support your analysis.'

On this map, the change in ele-  \nvation between any two contour lines is 40 feet, meaning that, if you were standing  \non one contour line and you were to hike to a position two contour lines away  \nfrom your starting point, your elevation would change by 80 feet. In general, the  \ncloser the contour lines are together, the faster the land rises or falls.

They will spend less  \ntime with their homework. Don’t do it. Keep to the same schedule.  \n\nFA Continue to Memorize Definitions and Important Facts The impor-  \ntant definitions in this chapter are those for trigonometric ratios in right  \ntriangles. We will point these out as we progress through the chapter.\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Interpreting Topographic Map Contours**\n\nGiven the contour interval of 40 feet and the scale of 1 inch = 1600 feet, determine the elevation difference between two points on the map that are 2 inches apart horizontally.\n- **Step 1**: Convert the horizontal distance (2 inches) to feet using the scale.\n- **Step 2**: Calculate the number of contour lines between the two points based on the contour interval.\n- **Step 3**: Use the contour interval to find the elevation difference.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include a clear explanation of how the scale and contour interval relate to elevation change, and you must show all mathematical steps.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Right Triangle Trigonometry**\n\nA hiker is standing at a point where the angle of elevation to the top of a mountain is 30 degrees. The horizontal distance from the hiker to the base of the mountain is 1000 feet.\n- **Part A**: Use the tangent ratio to find the height of the mountain.\n- **Part B**: Verify your answer using the sine ratio.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent in a right triangle relate to the hiker''s perspective.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must demonstrate a clear understanding of trigonometric ratios and their application to real-world scenarios.

    Ei List Difficult Problems Begin to make lists of problems that give you the most difficulty. These are the problems that you are repeatedly making mistakes with. Try to spend a few minutes each day reworking some of the problems from your list. Once you are able to work these problems successfully, you will have much more confidence going into the next exam.

    23 Begin to Develop Confidence with Word Problems It seems that the main difference between people who are good at working word problems and those who are not, is confidence. People with confidence know that no matter how long it takes them, they will eventually be able to solve the problem they are working on. Those without confidence begin by saying to themselves, “I will never be able to work this problem.” If you are in the second category, then instead of telling yourself that you can’t do word problems, that you don’t like them, or that they’re not good for anything anyway, decide to do whatever it takes to master them. As Aristotle said, it is practice that produces excellence. For us, practice means working problems, lots of problems.

- prompt: |-
    The word trigonometry is derived from two Greek words: tri’gonon, which trans-
    lates as triangle, and met’ron, which means measure. Trigonometry, then,
    is triangle measure. In this section, we will give a second definition for the trigo-
    nometric functions that is, in fact, based on “triangle measure.” We will define
    the trigonometric functions as the ratios of sides in right triangles. As you will
    see, this new definition does not conflict with the definition from Chapter 1 for
    the trigonometric functions.

    Definition II: Trigonometric Functions (Right Triangle Definitions)

That is, sin A = cos B, sec A = csc B, and tan A = cot B, to name  \na few. Because A and B are the acute angles in a right triangle, they are always  \ncomplementary angles; that is, their sum is always 90°. What we actually have here  \nis another property of trigonometric functions: The sine of an angle is the cosine  \nof its complement, the secant of an angle is the cosecant of its complement, and  \nthe tangent of an angle is the cotangent of its complement. Or, in symbols,  \n\nsin A =cos B  \nif d+ B=90°,then Jsec A =csc B  \ntan A = cot B  \n\nand so on.  \nWe generalize this discussion with the following theorem.  \n\nCofunction Theorem  \n\nA trigonometric function of an angle is always equal to the cofunction of the  \ncomplement of the angle.\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Cofunction Theorem Application**\n\nGiven that angle A and angle B are complementary (A + B = 90°), use the Cofunction Theorem to prove that $ \sec A = \csc B $ without referencing the text''s specific examples or diagrams.\n\n**Steps to Follow**:\n1. Start by expressing $ \sec A $ in terms of sine or cosine using the definition of secant.\n2. Use the Cofunction Theorem to relate $ \sec A $ to a cofunction of angle B.\n3. Convert the cofunction to its corresponding trigonometric function using the relationship between complementary angles.\n4. Show that the resulting expression is equivalent to $ \csc B $.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your proof must be logically sound, reference the Cofunction Theorem, and demonstrate understanding of the relationship between complementary angles and their cofunctions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Cofunctions**\n\nConsider the equation $ \tan(30°) = \cot(60°) $.\n- **Part A**: Explain why this equation is true using the Cofunction Theorem and the fact that 30° and 60° are complementary angles.\n- **Part B**: Construct a right triangle that visually represents this relationship. Label all sides and angles, and explain how the triangle illustrates the equality of $ \tan(30°) $ and $ \cot(60°) $.\n- **Part C**: Generalize this relationship for any two complementary angles $ A $ and $ B $. Write a formula that expresses $ \tan A $ in terms of $ \cot B $, and justify your formula using the Cofunction Theorem.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the Cofunction Theorem, demonstrate understanding of complementary angles, and provide a clear geometric interpretation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Cofunctions**\n\nSuppose you are given that $ \sin(45°) = \cos(45°) $, and you are told that $ \sin(\theta) = \cos(\phi) $ for some angles $ \theta $ and $ \phi $.\n- **Part A**: Use the Cofunction Theorem to determine the relationship between $ \theta $ and $ \phi $.\n- **Part B**: Create a real-world scenario where this relationship is applicable. For example, explain how the sine of an angle in a right triangle relates to the cosine of another angle in the same triangle.\n- **Part C**: Extend this relationship to other trigonometric functions. For instance, show that $ \tan(\theta) = \cot(\phi) $ if $ \theta $ and $ \phi $ are complementary.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the Cofunction Theorem, apply it to real-world contexts, and extend the concept to other trigonometric functions.'

- prompt: |-
    To clarify this further, if two angles are complementary, such as 40° and 50°,
    then a trigonometric function of one is equal to the cofunction of the other. That is,
    sin 40° = cos 50°, sec 40° = csc 50°, and tan 40° = cot 50°.

    SOLUTION Using the theorem on cofunctions of complementary angles, we fill
    in the blanks as follows:

    a. sin 60° = cos 30° Because sine and cosine are cofunctions and
    60° + 30° = 90°
    Because tangent and cotangent are cofunctions and

    y + (90° — y) = 90°

    b. tan y = cot (90° — y)

    Because secant and cosecant are cofunctions and
    75° + 15° = 90° |

    c. sec 75° = csc 15°

    For our next application of Definition II, we need to recall the two special
    triangles we introduced in Chapter 1. They are the 30°-60°-90° triangle and the
    45°-45°_90° triangle. Figure 6 shows both of these triangles for the case in which

    As you will see as we progress through the text, there are times when it is
    appropriate to use Definition II for the trigonometric functions and times when
    it is more appropriate to use Definition I. To illustrate, suppose we wanted to find
    sin 6, cos 6, and tan 6 for 8 = 90°. We would not be able to use Definition II because
    we can’t draw a right triangle in which one of the acute angles is 90°. Instead, we
    would draw 90° in standard position, locate a point on the terminal side, and use
    Definition I to find sin 90°, cos 90°, and tan 90°.

    As shown in Figure 8, a point on the terminal side of 90° is (0, 1). The dis-
    tance from the origin to (0, 1) is 1. Therefore, x = 0, y = 1, and r = 1. From Defi-

    SECTION 2.2 ff Calculators and Trigonometric Functions of an Acute Angle 71

    Learning Objectives

    Add and subtract angles expressed in degrees and minutes.

    Convert angles from degrees and minutes to decimal degrees or
    vice-versa.

    Use a calculator to approximate the value of a trigonometric function.

    Use a calculator to approximate an acute angle given the value of a
    trigonometric function.

    In this section, we will see how calculators can be used to find approximations for
    trigonometric functions of angles between 0° and 90°. Before we begin our work
    with calculators, we need to look at degree measure in more detail.

    We previously defined 1 degree (1°) to be 1/360 of a full rotation. A degree itself
    can be broken down further. If we divide 1° into 60 equal parts, each one of the
    parts is called 1 minute, denoted 1’. One minute is 1/60 of a degree; in other words,
    there are 60 minutes in every degree. The next smaller unit of angle measure is a
    second. One second, 1”, is 1/60 of a minute. There are 60 seconds in every minute.

    1 °
    1° = 60’ 1’ = 1/60° 1” = 1/60’

    Table 1 shows how to read angles written in degree measure.

    TABLE 1

    The Expression Is Read

    52° 10’ 52 degrees, 10 minutes

    5° 27' 30” 5 degrees, 27 minutes, 30 seconds

Convert the seconds to minutes by dividing by 60.\n2. Add the result to the minutes.\n3. Convert the total minutes to degrees by dividing by 60.\n4. Verify that converting back from decimal degrees to degrees, minutes, and seconds yields the original angle.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must demonstrate a clear understanding of the conversion process and show all steps, including the final decimal degree and the converted degrees, minutes, and seconds.

Round to four decimal places.\n- **Part B**: Use the identity tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) to find tan(45°). Show your work, including the division of the two calculated values.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the calculator''s approximation of sin(45°) and cos(45°) leads to a precise value for tan(45°), even though both sine and cosine are approximations.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include the calculator approximations and the exact value of tan(45°), with a clear explanation of the relationship between the trigonometric functions.

Show your work.\n- **Part B**: Explain why 30° is classified as an acute angle, using the definition of an acute angle from the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All angles that are multiples of 15° are acute." Your example must reference the definition of an acute angle and clearly show why the counterexample is not acute.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of angle classifications and the conversion between degrees and radians.'

    The ability to measure angles to the nearest second provides enough accuracy for most circumstances, although in some applications, such as surveying and astronomy, even finer measurements may be used. For example, the NASA Gravity Probe B (GP-B) mission successfully confirmed two effects predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity: the geodetic effect, in which the earth warps spacetime, and the frame-dragging effect, in which the earth drags spacetime around it as it rotates. To do so required designing four ultra-precise gyroscopes sensitive enough to detect a tilt corresponding to 0.1 milliarcsecond

    hair when seen from 10 miles away).'

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Add 48° 49’ and 72° 26’.
    Add 39° 27' and 65° 36’,
    SOLUTION We can add in columns with degrees in the first column and minutes in the second column.
    48° 49’
    + 72° 26’
    120° 75’

    Because 60 minutes is equal to 1 degree, we can carry 1 degree from the minutes
    column to the degrees column.

    120° 75’ = 121° 15’ a

    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2. Subtract 24° 14’ from 90°.
    Subtract 39° 14’ from 87°.

    SOLUTION To subtract 24° 14’ from 90°, we will have to "borrow" 1° and write
    that 1° as 60’.

    Decimal Degrees

    An alternative to using minutes and seconds to break down degrees into smaller
    units is decimal degrees. For example, 30.5°, 101.75°, and 62.831° are measures of
    angles written in decimal degrees.

    To convert from decimal degrees to degrees and minutes, we simply multiply
    the fractional part of the angle (the part to the right of the decimal point) by
    60 to convert it to minutes.

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Change 27.25° to degrees and minutes.
    Change 18.75° to degrees and
    minutes. SOLUTION Multiplying 0.25 by 60, we have the number of minutes equivalent
    to 0.25°.
    27.25° = 27° + 0.25°
    = 27° + 0.25(60')
    = 27° + 15’
    = 27° 15’
    Of course in actual practice, we would not show all these steps. They are shown
    here simply to indicate why we multiply only the decimal part of the decimal
    degree by 60 to change to degrees and minutes. a

    Until now, we have been able to determine trigonometric functions only for angles
    for which we could find a point on the terminal side or angles that were part of
    special triangles. We can find decimal approximations for trigonometric functions
    of any acute angle by using a calculator with keys for sine, cosine, and tangent.

    First, there are a couple of things you should know. Just as distance can be
    measured in feet and also in meters, angles can be measured in degrees and also in
    radians. We will cover radian measure in Chapter 3. For now, you simply need to
    be sure that your calculator is set to work in degrees. We will refer to this setting
    as being in degree mode. The most common mistake students make when finding
    values of trigonometric functions on a calculator is working in the wrong mode. As
    a rule, you should always check the mode settings on your calculator before evaluat-
    ing a trigonometric function.

    Your calculator will display a number that rounds to 0.7902. The number
    0.7902 is just an approximation of cos 37.8°, which is actually an irrational
    number, as are the trigonometric functions of most angles. a

    NOTE We will give answers accurate to four places past the decimal point. You
    can set your calculator to four-place fixed-point mode, and it will show you the
    same results without having to round your answers mentally.

    The | sin |, |cos|, and|tan| keys allow us to find the value of a trigonometric func-
    tion when we know the measure of the angle. (Remember: We can think of this value
    as being the ratio of the lengths of two sides of a right triangle.) There are some prob-
    lems, however, where we may be in the opposite situation and need to do the reverse.
    That is, we may know the value of the trigonometric function and need to find the
    angle. The calculator has another set of keys for this purpose. They are the [sin 1],
    [cos 1], and keys. At first glance, the notation on these keys may lead you to
    believe that they will give us the reciprocals of the trigonometric functions. Instead,
    this notation is used to denote an inverse function, something we will cover in more
    detail in Chapter 4. For the time being, just remember that these keys are used to find
    the angle given the value of one of the trigonometric functions of the angle.

    CALCULATOR NOTE Some calculators do not have a key labeled as [sin |}

    You may need to press a combination of keys, such as |INV]] sin |, [ARC]|sin|, or
    [ sin }. If you are not sure which key to press, look in the index of your calcula-
    tor manual under inverse trigonometric function.

    Sundials The Moorish sundial is designed so that the shadow of the gnomon (the vertical
    triangular piece) is consistent at each hour from one day to the next. This allows the hours
    to be marked on the sundial using a single scale that is not affected by the changes in the
    Sun’s path during the year. If the sundial is positioned so that the gnomon is aligned along
    a longitudinal line from north to south, then at exactly noon the gnomon will cast a shadow
    due north.

    Figure 7

    As the sun moves, the shadow will sweep out an angle toward the east, labeled @ in
    Figure 7, called the shadow angle. This angle can be calculated using the formula

    tan 8 = sina tan (A: 15°)
    where a is the latitude of the position of the sundial and / is a number of hours from noon.

    The first Ferris wheel was designed and built by American engineer George W. G.
    Ferris in 1893. The diameter of this wheel was 250 feet. It had 36 cars, each of which
    held 40 passengers. The top of the wheel was 264 feet above the ground. It took
    20 minutes to complete one revolution. As you will see as we progress through
    the text, trigonometric functions can be used to model the motion of a rider on a
    Ferris wheel. The model can be used to give information about the position of the
    rider at any time during a ride. For instance, in the last example in this section,
    we will use Definition IJ for the trigonometric functions to find the height a rider
    is above the ground at certain positions on a Ferris wheel.

    In this section, we will use Definition II for trigonometric functions of an
    acute angle, along with our calculators, to find the missing parts to some right
    triangles. Before we begin, however, we need to talk about significant digits.

    Definition = Significant Digits

    The number of significant digits (or figures) in a number is found by counting
    all the digits from left to right beginning with the first nonzero digit on the left.
    When no decimal point is present, trailing zeros are not considered significant, 4

    NOTE In actual practice it is not always possible to tell how many significant digits an integer like 700 has. For instance, if exactly 700 people signed up to take history at your school, then 700 has three significant digits. On the other hand, if 700 is the result of a calculation in which the answer, 700, has been rounded to the nearest ten, then it has two significant digits. There are ways to write integers like 700 so that the number of significant digits can be determined exactly. One way is with scientific notation. However, to simplify things, in this text we will assume that measurements (other than angles) written without decimal points have the least possible number of significant digits. In the case of 700, that number is one. For angles, we will assume that all angle measures written as integers are accurate to the nearest degree.

    The relationship between the accuracy of the sides of a triangle and the accuracy of the angles in the same triangle is shown in Table 1.

    Three significant digits Nearest 10 minutes or tenth of a degree
    Four significant digits Nearest minute or hundredth of a degree

    We are now ready to use Definition II to solve right triangles. We solve a right triangle by using the information given about it to find all of the missing sides and angles. In all the examples and in the Problem Set that follows, we will assume that C is the right angle in all of our right triangles, unless otherwise noted.

    Unless stated otherwise, we round our answers so that the number of significant digits in our answers matches the number of significant digits in the least significant number given in the original problem. Also, we round our answers only and not any of the numbers in the intermediate steps. Finally, we are showing the values of the trigonometric functions to four significant digits simply to avoid cluttering the page with long decimal numbers. This does not mean that you should stop halfway through a problem and round the values of trigonometric functions to four significant digits before continuing.

    To find B, we use the fact that the sum of the two acute angles in any right triangle is 90°.

    B=90-A
    = 90° — 40°
    B= 50°

    To find a, we can use the formula for sin A.

    sin A = —
    C

    Multiplying both sides of this formula by c and then substituting in our given values of A and c we have

    a = 12(0.6428) — sin 40° = 0.6428

    **EXAMPLE 2**

    In right triangle ABC, a = 2.73 and b = 3.41. Find the remaining side and angles.

    **SOLUTION**

    Figure 2 is a diagram of the triangle. We can find A by using the formula for tan A.

    $$
    \tan A = \frac{a}{b} = \frac{2.73}{3.41}
    $$

    $$
    \tan A = 0.8006
    $$

    Now, to find A, we use a calculator.

    $$
    A = \tan^{-1}(0.8006) = 38.7^\circ
    $$

    Next we find B.

    $$
    B = 90.0^\circ - A
    = 90.0^\circ - 38.7^\circ
    B = 51.3^\circ

    **84 CHAPTER 2 Trigonometry**

    Notice we are rounding each angle to the nearest tenth of a degree since the sides we were originally given have three significant digits.

    We can find c using the Pythagorean Theorem or one of our trigonometric functions. Let’s start with a trigonometric function.

    If:

    $$
    \sin A = \frac{a}{c}
    $$

    Multiply each side by c, then divide each side by sin A:

    $$
    c = \frac{a}{\sin A}
    = \frac{2.73}{\sin 38.7^\circ}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{2.73}{0.6252} = 4.37 \text{ (to three significant digits)}
    $$

    Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we obtain the same result.

    If:

    $$
    c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
    = \sqrt{(2.73)^2 + (3.41)^2}
    = \sqrt{19.081} = 4.37

The final answer must be accurate to the nearest foot.'

The final answers must be precise and logically justified.'

- prompt: |-
    The key to solving this problem is recognizing that x is the difference between OA (the distance from the center of the wheel to the ground) and h. Because OA is 139 feet (the radius of the wheel plus the distance between the bottom of the wheel and the ground: 125 + 14 = 139), we have

    x = 139 - h

    We use a cosine ratio to write an equation that contains h.

    cos 45° = (139 - h) / 125

    Solving for h we have

    125 cos 45° = 139 - h
    h = 139 - 125 cos 45°
    = 139 - 125(0.7071)
    = 51 ft To two significant digits

    If θ = 45°, a rider at position P, is 1/2 of the way around the wheel. At that point, the rider is approximately 51 feet above the ground.

    It is used in navigation and surveying.
    Definition: Bearing
    The bearing of a line l is the acute angle formed by the north-south line and the
    line l. The notation used to designate the bearing of a line begins with N or S
    (for north or south), followed by the number of degrees in the angle, and ends
    with E or W (for east or west).

    SOLUTION First we find x in right triangle ABC with a tangent ratio.

    5 x

    tan 54.5° = 350

    x = 25.0 tan 54.5°
    = 25.0(1.4019)
    = 35.0487 ft

    Without rounding x, we use it to find / in right triangle ACD using another
    tangent ratio.

    tan 61.7 ~ 35 0487
    h = 35.0487(1.8572)
    = 65.1 ft To three significant digits

    Note that if it weren’t for the fence, she could measure x directly and use just
    one triangle to find the height of the flagpole.

    EXAMPLE8 A helicopter is hovering over the desert when it develops mechan-
    ical problems and is forced to land. After landing, the pilot radios his position
    to a pair of radar stations located 25 miles apart along a straight road running
    north and south. The bearing of the helicopter from one station is N 13° E, and
    from the other it is S 19° E. After doing a few trigonometric calculations, one of
    the stations instructs the pilot to walk due west for 3.5 miles to reach the road.
    Is this information correct?

    SOLUTION Figure 11 is a three-dimensional diagram of the situation. The heli-
    copter is hovering at point D and lands at point C. The radar stations are at A

    Figure 11

    and B, respectively. Because the road runs north and south, the shortest dis-
    tance from C to the road is due west of C toward point F. To see if the pilot has
    the correct information, we must find y, the distance from C to F.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Use of Trigonometric Ratios in Real-World Problems**\n\nIn the example involving the flagpole, the problem is solved by first finding the horizontal distance x using the tangent ratio in triangle ABC, and then using that distance to find the height h in triangle ACD.\n- **Step 1**: Explain why the problem is divided into two steps (using two triangles) instead of solving it directly with a single triangle.\n- **Step 2**: Justify the use of the tangent ratio in each triangle, referencing the definition of tangent in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Calculate the height of the flagpole using the values provided in the example, showing all steps and rounding to three significant digits.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include a clear explanation of the problem-solving strategy and correctly compute the height of the flagpole using the given data.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating the Correctness of a Trigonometric Solution**\n\nIn the helicopter problem, the pilot is instructed to walk due west for 3.5 miles to reach the road. To verify if this is correct, the solution involves finding the distance y from the landing point C to the road.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the geometric configuration of the problem, including the positions of the radar stations, the helicopter, and the road.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the given bearings (N 13° E and S 19° E) are used to determine the angles in triangle ABC.\n- **Step 3**: Use trigonometric principles to calculate the distance y, and compare it to the given 3.5 miles to determine the accuracy of the pilot''s instruction.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include a detailed explanation of the geometric setup and the trigonometric calculations, leading to a conclusion about the correctness of the pilot''s instruction.'

    The radar stations are 25 miles apart, thus 4B = 25. If we let AF = x, then
    FB = 25 — x. If we use cotangent ratios in triangles AFC and BFC, we will save
    ourselves some work.

    In triangle AFC cot 13° = ‘
    SO x = ycot 13°
    25 — x

    In triangle BFC cot 19° =
    sO 25— x= ycot 19°
    Solving this equation for x we have

    —x = —25 + ycot 19° Add —25 to each side
    25 — y cot 19° Multiply each side by —1

    xX

    Next, we set our two values of x equal to each other.

    y cot 13° = 25 — y cot 19°
    y cot 13° + y cot 19° = 25 Add y cot 19° to each side

- prompt: |-
    By most accounts, the study of vectors is based on the work of Irish mathematician
    Sir William Hamilton (1805-1865). Hamilton was actually studying complex
    numbers (a topic we will cover in Chapter 8) when he made the discoveries that
    led to what we now call vectors.

    Today, vectors are treated both algebraically and geometrically. In this sec-
    tion, we will focus our attention on the geometric representation of vectors. We
    will cover the algebraic approach later in Section 7.5. We begin with a discussion
    of vector quantities and scalar quantities.

    Many of the quantities that describe the world around us have both magni-
    tude and direction, while others have only magnitude. Quantities that have mag-
    nitude and direction are called vector quantities, while quantities with magnitude
    only are called scalars. Some examples of vector quantities are force, velocity,
    and acceleration. For example, a car traveling 50 miles per hour due south has a
    different velocity from another car traveling due north at 50 miles per hour, while
    a third car traveling at 25 miles per hour due north has a velocity that is different
    from both of the first two.

    One way to represent vector quantities geometrically is with arrows. The
    direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector quantity, and the
    length of the arrow corresponds to the magnitude. For example, the velocities of
    the three cars we mentioned above could be represented as in Figure 1.

    Interfoto/Personalities/Alamy

    William Rowan Hamilton

    Velocity | 50 miles per hour Velocity | 50 miles per hour Velocity 7 25 miles per hour
    of car 1 of car 2 of car 3

    Figure 1

    To distinguish between vectors and scalars, we will write the letters used to
    represent vectors with boldface type, such as U or V. (When you write them on
    paper, put an arrow above them like this: Uor V) The magnitude of a vector
    is represented with absolute value symbols. For example, the magnitude of V is
    written | V |. Table 1 illustrates further.

The temperature outside on a particular day\n2. The force exerted by a person pulling a rope\n3. The speed of a plane in still air\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must be based on the text''s distinction between vector quantities (magnitude and direction) and scalar quantities (magnitude only).

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Geometric Representation of Vectors**\n\nImagine you are creating a diagram to represent the velocities of the three cars described in the text (50 mph south, 50 mph north, 25 mph north). Using the arrow representation of vectors, describe how the arrows would be drawn to represent these velocities.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain the direction and length of each arrow in relation to the text''s examples.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the diagram would differ if the velocities were represented as scalars instead of vectors.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s mention of Hamilton''s work relates to the geometric approach of vectors.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s explanation of vector arrows and the historical context of Hamilton''s contributions to vector theory.\n'

    Addition and Subtraction of Vectors

    The sum of the vectors U and V, written U + V, is called the resultant vector. It is
    the vector that extends from the tail of U to the tip of V when the tail of V is placed
    at the tip of U, as illustrated in Figure 3. Note that this diagram shows the resultant
    vector to be a diagonal in the parallelogram that has U and V as adjacent sides.
    This being the case, we could also add the vectors by putting the tails of U and V
    together to form adjacent sides of that same parallelogram, as shown in Figure 4.
    In either case, the resultant vector is the diagonal that starts at the tail of U.

    To subtract one vector from another, we can add its opposite. That is,
    U-V=U+(-V)

The most intuitive force in our lives is the force of gravity that pulls us toward the center of the earth. The magnitude of this force is our weight; the direction of this force is always straight down toward the center of the earth.

- prompt: |-
    If we rearrange the vectors from the diagram in Figure 17, we can get a
    better picture of the situation. Since Stacey is holding Danny in the position
    shown in Figure 17, he is in a state of static equilibrium. Therefore, the sum of
    the forces acting on him is 0. We add the three vectors W, H, and T using the
    tip-to-tail rule. The resultant vector, extending from the tail of W to the tip of

    A In Section 2.1 we saw how to obtain exact values for the trigonometric functions
    h f using two special triangles, the 30°-60°-90° triangle and the 45°-45°-90° triangle.
    In this project you will use both of these triangles to create a 15°-75°—90° triangle.
    b 45° Once your triangle is complete, you will be able to use it to find additional exact
    8 values of the trigonometric functions.
    The diagram shown in Figure 1 is called an Ailles rectangle. It is named after a
    17? high school teacher, Doug Ailles, who first discovered it. Notice that the rectangle
    c is constructed from four triangles. The triangle in the middle is a 30°-60°—90° tri-
    angle, and the triangle above it in the upper right corner is a 45°-45°-90° triangle.

    Find the measures of the remaining four angles labeled A, B, C, and D.
    Figure 1
    Use your knowledge of a 30°-60°-90° triangle to find sides g and h.

    Now use your knowledge of a 45°-45°-90° triangle to find sides e and f-

    Find c and d, and then find sides a and 5 using your values for sides c, d, e, and f.

    Now that the diagram is complete, you should have a 15°—75°—90° triangle
    with all three sides labeled. Use this triangle to fill in the table below with
    exact values for each trigonometric function.

    The origins of the sine function are found in the tables of chords for a circle constructed by the Greek astronomers/mathematicians Hipparchus and Ptolemy. However, the origins of the tangent and cotangent functions lie primarily with Arabic and Islamic astronomers. Called the umbra recta and umbra versa, their connection was not to the chord of a circle but to the gnomon of a sundial.

    Research the origins of the tangent and cotangent functions. What was the connection to sundials? What other contributions did Arabic astronomers make to trigonometry? Write a paragraph or two about your findings.

    Introduction

    The first cable car was built in San Francisco, California, by Andrew Smith Hal-
    lidie. It was completed on August 2, 1873. Today, three cable car lines remain in
    operation in San Francisco. The cars are propelled by long steel cables. Inside the
    powerhouse, these cables are driven by large 14-foot drive wheels, called sheaves,
    that turn at a rate of 19 revolutions per minute (Figure 1).

    Figure 1

    In this chapter we introduce a second type of angle measure that allows us to
    define rotation in terms of an arc along the circumference of a circle. With radian
    measure, we can solve problems that involve angular speeds such as revolutions per
    minute. For example, we will be able to use this information to determine the linear
    speed at which the cable car travels.

    The reference angle (sometimes called related angle) for any angle 6 in standard position is the positive acute angle between the terminal side of 6 and the x-axis. In this text, we will denote the reference angle for 0 by 0.

    Note that, for this definition, 6 is always positive and always between 0° and 90°. That is, a reference angle is always an acute angle.

    EXAMPLE 4 Find the exact value of csc 300°.
    SOLUTION The reference angle is 360° — 300° = 60° (Figure 5). To find the
    exact value of csc 60°, we use the fact that cosecant and sine are reciprocals.
    csc 300° = —csc 60° Because cosecant is negative in QIV
    = -1/csc 60° = 1/sin 60° = √3/2

    Recall that coterminal angles always differ from each other by multiples of 360°.
    For example, —45° and 315° are coterminal, as are 10° and 370° (Figure 6).

    Figure 6

    wa 370
    <t a x
    CNW
    10°

    The trigonometric functions of an angle and any angle coterminal to it are
    always equal. For sine and cosine, we can write this in symbols as follows:

    for any integer k,
    sin (6 + 360°k) = sin 6 and cos (9 + 360°) = cos 6

    To find values of trigonometric functions for an angle larger than 360° or
    smaller than 0°, we simply find an angle between 0° and 360° that is coterminal to
    it and then use the steps outlined in Examples 2 through 4.

    Next we use a calculator to find an approximation for 0, given one of the trigonometric functions of 6 and the quadrant in which 6 terminates. To do this we will need to use the |sin |, |cos |}, and |tan | keys, which we introduced earlier in Section 2.2. In using one of these keys to find a reference angle, always enter a positive value for the trigonometric function. (Remember: A reference angle is between 0° and 90°, so all six trigonometric functions of that angle will be positive.)

    CALCULATOR NOTE Some calculators do not have a key labeled as [sin |. You may need to press a combination of keys, such as sin |, sin |, or sin |.

    EXAMPLE 6 Find @ to the nearest degree if sin 6 = —0.5592 and 6 terminates in QIII with 0° = 6 < 360°.

    SOLUTION First we find the reference angle using the key with the positive value 0.5592. From this, we get 9 = 34°. As shown in Figure 8, the desired angle in QIII whose reference angle is 34° is

    @ = 180° + 6
    = 180° + 34°
    = 214°
    If we wanted to list all the angles that terminate in QIII and have a sine of —0.5592, we would write

    6 = 214° + 360°k

    where k is any integer

    This gives us all angles coterminal with 214°. a

    CALCULATORNOTE There is a big difference between the key and the key. The key can be used to find the value of the sine function for any angle. However, the reverse is not true with the key. For example, if you were to try Example 6 by entering —0.5592 and using the key, you would not obtain the angle 214°. To see why this happens you will have to wait until we cover inverse trigonometric functions in Chapter 4. In the meantime, to use a calculator on this kind of problem, use it to find the reference angle and then proceed as we did in Example 6.

    EXAMPLE 7 Find @ to the nearest tenth of a degree if tan @ = —0.8541 and 6 terminates in QIV with 0° = 6 < 360°.

    SOLUTION Using the key with the positive value 0.8541 gives the reference angle 8 = 40.5°. The desired angle in QIV with a reference angle of 40.5° is

    6 = 360° — 40.5° = 319.5°
    Again, if we want to list all angles in QIV with a tangent of —0.8541, we write

    6 = 319.5° + 360°k

    where k is any integer

    to include not only 319.5° but all angles coterminal with it. a

- prompt: "If you think back to the work you have done with functions of the form y = f(x)  \nin your algebra class, you will see that the variables x and y were always real  \nnumbers. The trigonometric functions we have worked with so far have had the form  \ny = f(θ), where θ is measured in degrees. To apply the knowledge we have about  \nfunctions from algebra to our trigonometric functions, we need to write our angles  \nas real numbers, not degrees. The key to doing this is called radian measure.\n\nRadian measure is a relatively new concept in the history of mathematics. The  \nfirst printed use of the term radian was by physicist James T. Thomson in examina-  \ntion questions in 1873. It is believed that the concept of radian measure was origi-  \nnally proposed by Roger Cotes (1682-1716), who was also the first to calculate 1  \nradian in degrees. The introduction of radian measure will allow us to do a number  \nof useful things. For instance, in Chapter 4 we will graph the function y = sin x on  \na rectangular coordinate system, where the units on the x- and y-axes are given by  \nreal numbers, just as they would be if we were graphing y = 2x + 3 or y = x².\n\nTo understand the definition for radian measure, we have to recall from geom-  \netry that a central angle in a circle is an angle with its vertex at the center of the  \ncircle. Here is the definition for an angle with a measure of 1 radian.\n\nDefinition: Radian\n\nIn a circle, a central angle that cuts off an arc equal in length to the radius of  \nthe circle has a measure of 1 radian (rad). Figure 1 illustrates this.\n\nAngle θ has a  \nmeasure of 1 radian\n\nO\n\nThe vertex of θ is at the center of  \nthe circle; the arc cut off by θ is  \nequal in length to the radius\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Radian Measure through Geometry**\n\nUsing the definition of a radian provided in the text, explain why the length of the arc cut off by a central angle θ in a circle is equal to rθ, where r is the radius of the circle.\n- **Step 1**: Recall the definition of a radian (1 radian is the measure of a central angle that cuts off an arc equal in length to the radius).\n- **Step 2**: Consider the relationship between the arc length, radius, and central angle in a circle.\n- **Step 3**: Use logical reasoning based on the definition of a radian to derive the general formula for arc length.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly connect the concept of a radian to the formula s = rθ, and you must explicitly reference the definition provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Historical and Conceptual Connections in Trigonometry**\n\nThe text mentions that the concept of radian measure was originally proposed by Roger Cotes and first printed by James T. Thomson. Consider the historical context and the mathematical implications of this development:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the introduction of radian measure as a unit of angle measurement aligns with the transition from degree-based to real-number based trigonometric functions.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the use of degrees and radians in trigonometric functions, focusing on how the choice of units affects the behavior of the functions (e.g., periodicity, derivatives, and graphing).\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the significance of the historical development of radian measure in the context of modern mathematics, particularly in calculus and higher-level trigonometry.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate historical context with mathematical concepts and demonstrate a clear understanding of the role of radian measure in trigonometry.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analyzing the Relationship Between Radians and Real Numbers**\n\nThe text states that in Chapter 4, we will graph the function y = sin x on a rectangular coordinate system where the x-axis is measured in real numbers. Consider the implications of this for the relationship between angles and real numbers:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the use of real numbers to represent angles (radians) allows for a more precise and continuous representation of angular measurements compared to degrees.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument for why the function y = sin x is more naturally defined using radians than degrees. Use mathematical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of real numbers and the definition of a radian.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of how the use of radians in trigonometry facilitates the calculation of derivatives of trigonometric functions, referencing the text''s emphasis on the connection between angles and real numbers.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the relationship between radians, real numbers, and trigonometric functions, with clear connections to the text''s content.'

- prompt: |-
    To find the radian measure of any central angle, we must find how many radii are in the arc it cuts off. To do so, we divide the arc length by the radius. If the radius is 2 centimeters and the arc cut off by central angle 0 is 6 centimeters, then the radian measure of 0 is 6/2 = 3 rad. Here is the formal definition:

    Definition: Radian Measure

    If a central angle θ, in a circle of radius r, cuts off an arc of length s, then the measure of θ, in radians, is given by s/r (Figure 2).

    θ (in radians) = s / r

    Figure 2

    As you will see later in this section, one radian is equal to approximately 57.3°.

    136 CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure

    Example 1
    A central angle θ in a circle of radius 5 centimeters cuts off an arc of length 15 centimeters. What is the radian measure of θ?

    SOLUTION We have r = 5 cm and s = 15 cm (Figure 3);
    therefore,
    θ (in radians) = s / r
    = 15 cm / 5 cm
    = 3

    We say the radian measure of θ is 3, or θ = 3 rad.

    Figure 3

    PROBLEM 1
    A central angle θ in a circle of radius 3 centimeters cuts off an arc of length 6 centimeters. What is the radian measure of θ?

    SOLUTION We have r = 3 cm and s = 6 cm (Figure 3);
    therefore,
    θ (in radians) = s / r
    = 6 cm / 3 cm
    = 2

    We say the radian measure of θ is 2, or θ = 2 rad.

Perform the division to find the radian measure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must be a numerical value (in radians) and explicitly reference the formula from the text in your explanation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Understanding Radian and Degree Equivalence**\n\nThe text states that one radian is approximately 57.3 degrees. Using this conversion factor, convert 3 radians to degrees.\n\n**Steps to Follow**:\n1. Multiply the number of radians by the conversion factor (57.3°/rad).\n2. Show your calculation and round to the nearest tenth of a degree if necessary.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must be in degrees and clearly demonstrate the application of the conversion factor provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Problem Solving with Radian Measure**\n\nA circle has a radius of 10 meters. A central angle θ cuts off an arc of length s = 25 meters.\n\n**Task**:\n1. Use the radian measure formula to find θ in radians.\n2. Convert θ to degrees using the conversion factor from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include both the radian and degree measures, with clear steps showing the application of the formula and the conversion factor. Additionally, explain why the conversion factor is necessary for this task.'

- prompt: "NOTE Because radian measure is defined as a ratio of two lengths, s/r, technically it is a unitless measure. That is, radians are just real numbers. To see why, look again at Example 1. Notice how the units of centimeters divide out, leaving the number 2 without any units. For this reason, it is common practice to omit the word radian when using radian measure. (To avoid confusion, we will sometimes use the term rad in this text as if it were a unit.) If no units are showing, an angle is understood to be measured in radians; with degree measure, the degree symbol ° must be written.\n\n§6=2 means the measure of ∠ is 2 radians  \n§ = 2° means the measure of ∠ is 2 degrees  \n\nTo see the relationship between degrees and radians, we can compare the  \nnumber of degrees and the number of radians in one full rotation (Figure 4).  \nS The angle formed by one full rotation about the center of a circle of radius r  \n\nwill cut off an arc equal to the circumference of the circle. Since the circumference  \nof a circle of radius r is 2πr, we have  \n\nθ measures one full rotation The measure of θ  \n\nFigure 4: full rotation d = 2πr in radians is 2π  \n\nBecause one full rotation in degrees is 360°, we have the following relationship  \nbetween radians and degrees.  \n\n360° = 2π rad  \nDividing both sides by 2 we have  \n180° = π rad  \n\nNOTE We could also find this conversion factor using the definition of π, which  \nis the ratio of the circumference to the diameter for any circle. Because  \n\nC = πd  \n2r = r  \n\nby our definition of radian measure, π is the angle in radians corresponding to an  \narc length of half the circumference of the circle. Therefore, π rad = 180°.\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Conversion and Interpretation of Radian Measure**\n\nGiven that 180° = π rad, convert 150° to radians and 3π/2 rad to degrees.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Convert 150° to radians. Show your work using the conversion factor provided in the text.\n- **Part B**: Convert 3π/2 rad to degrees. Explain how the conversion factor relates to the definition of π in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate correct conversion and an understanding of the relationship between degrees and radians as defined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Reasoning with Angle Measures and Units**\n\nConsider the angle measure 2 radians.\n- **Part A**: Explain why 2 radians is equivalent to approximately 114.6°, using the conversion factor 180° = π rad.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the implications of the text''s statement that radians are unitless. Provide an example where the unitless nature of radians affects the interpretation of an angle measure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the conversion factor and the concept of unitless measures as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Radian and Degree Relationships**\n\nThe text explains that π rad = 180°, and that radians are unitless.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the equation π rad = 180° is consistent with the definition of a radian as a ratio of arc length to radius.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that the unitless nature of radians allows for more precise mathematical calculations in trigonometry. Use the example of the unit circle to support your argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of the relationship between radians and degrees, as well as the implications of radians being unitless.'

    **Problem 8 Example 8**
    Find sin(7π/6)

    **Solution:**
    Because 7π/6 and 30° are equivalent, so are their sines.
    $$
    \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}\right) = \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}
    $$

    **Calculator Note:**
    To work this problem on a calculator, we must first set the calculator to radian mode. If your calculator does not have a key labeled π, use 3.1416.
    Here is the sequence to key in your calculator to work the problem given in Example 8.

    **Scientific Calculator:**
    3.1416 [=] 6 [=] [sin]

    **Graphing Calculator:**
    3.1416 [=] 6 [=] [sin] [C [=] [=] 6 [J] ENTER!

    ---

    **Problem 9 Example 9**
    Find $4 \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$

    **Solution:**
    Because 7π/6 is just slightly larger than π = 6π/6, we know that it terminates in QIII and therefore its sine will be negative (Figure 13).

    The reference angle is:
    $$
    \frac{7\pi}{6} - \pi = \frac{\pi}{6}
    $$

    Then:
    $$
    4 \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}\right) = 4 \cdot -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = 4 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -2
    $$

    148 CHAPTER 3 Bf Radian Measure

    the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) is 1. We can use our first definition
    for the trigonometric functions from Section 1.3 to write

    a
    1 y

    x . y
    cos@=—-=-=x and sing=-=
    r r

    x
    1
    In other words, the ordered pair (x, y) shown in Figure 3 can also be written as
    (cos 6, sin 6). We can arrive at this same result by applying our second definition
    for the trigonometric functions (from Section 2.1). Because @ is an acute angle in
    a right triangle, by Definition I] we have

    side adjacent@ — x

    cos 6 = =x

    hypotenuse 1

    side opposite@ = y
    sin 6 = = —=y
    hypotenuse 1

    As you can see, both of our first two definitions lead to the conclusion that the
    point (x, y) shown in Figure 3 can be written as (cos 6, sin 0).

    Next, consider the length of the arc from (1, 0) to (x, y), which we have labeled
    tin Figure 3. If 6 is measured in radians, then by definition

    The length of the arc from (1, 0) to (x, y) is exactly the same as the radian measure
    of angle 6. Therefore, we can write

    cos@=cost=x and sin @ = sint = y

    These results give rise to a third definition for the trigonometric functions.

Use the text''s explanation of the unit circle and right triangles.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument to show that the third definition (circular functions) is consistent with the first two. Your argument must reference the relationship between arc length and radian measure as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Provide a real-world example where the third definition (circular functions) is more practical than the first two. Explain why this is the case based on the text''s discussion of the unit circle and radian measure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all three definitions and demonstrate a deep understanding of how they are interconnected through the unit circle and radian measure.'

    Using Technology: Graphing the Unit Circle

    We can use Definition III to graph the unit circle with a set of parametric equations. We will cover parametric equations in more detail in Section 6.4. First,
    set your graphing calculator to parametric mode and to radian mode. Then
    define the following pair of functions (Figure 6).

    XIT = cos(t)
    YiT = sin(t)

    Set the window variables so that
    0 ≤ t ≤ 2π, scale = π/12; -1.5 ≤ x ≤ 1.5; -1.5 ≤ y ≤ 1.5

    Graph the equations using the zoom-square command. This will make the
    circle appear round and not like an ellipse. Now you can trace the circle in
    increments of π/12. For example, to find the sine and cosine of 7π/3 radians, we
    would trace through four increments (Figure 7).

    We see that cos (7π/3) = 0.5 and sin (7π/3) = 0.8660 to the nearest ten-
    thousandth.

    Because it is easier for a calculator to display angles exactly in degrees rather
    than in radians, it is sometimes helpful to graph the unit circle using degrees. Set

    PROBLEM 3

    Find tan θ if θ corresponds to the
    point (0.8290, 0.5592) on the unit

    NOTE Our use of x and y here
    follows the traditional use of these
    variables with functions, where

    x represents a domain value and

    y represents a range value. They are not

    to be confused with the x- and
    y-coordinates of points on the unit
    circle as shown in Figure 4.

    We can use this graph to verify our results in Example 2. Trace around the
    unit circle until the x-coordinate is 0.5. The calculator shows us there are two
    such points, at ¢ = 60° and at ¢ = 300° (Figure 8).

    Remember that a function is a rule that pairs each element of the domain
    with exactly one element from the range. When we see the statement y = sin x, it
    is identical to the notation y = f(x). In fact, if we wanted to be precise, we would
    write y = sin (x). In visual terms, we can picture the sine function as a machine
    that assigns a single output value to every input value (Figure 10).

    Figure 10

    The input x is a real number, which can be interpreted as a distance along
    the circumference of the unit circle or an angle in radians. The input is formally
    referred to as the argument of the function.

    Using Definition HI we can find the domain for each of the circular functions.
    Because any value of θ determines a point (x, y) on the unit circle, the sine
    and cosine functions are always defined and therefore have a domain of all real
    numbers.

    Because tan θ = y/x and sec θ = 1/x, the tangent and secant functions will be
    undefined when x = 0, which will occur at the points (0, 1) and (0, −1). Look-
    ing back at Figure 5, we see these points correspond to θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/2.

    or counterclockwise direction, we will encounter these points again and again,
    such as when θ = 5π/2 and θ = 7π/2, or θ = −7π/2 and θ = −3π/2. All these values
    differ from each other by some multiple of π because (0, 1) and (0, −1) are on
    opposite sides of the unit circle a half-revolution apart. Therefore, the tangent
    and secant functions are defined for all real numbers θ except θ = π/2 + kπ, where
    k is any integer.

    In a similar manner, the cotangent and cosecant functions will be undefined
    when y = 0, corresponding to the points (1, 0) or (−1, 0). To avoid either of these
    two positions, we must avoid the values θ = kπ for any integer k. We summarize
    these results here:

    a. This statement is not possible because 2 is not within the range of the

    b. This statement is also not possible, because csc 7 is undefined and therefore

- prompt: "NOTE There are many concepts  \nthat can be visualized from  \n\nFigure 12. One of the more  \nimportant is the variations that  \noccur in sin t, cos t, and tan t as P  \ntravels around the unit circle. We  \nillustrate this in Example 7.\n\nPROBLEM 7  \nDescribe how tan θ varies as  \nt increases from 0 to π/2.\n\nTherefore, cos θ = x and sin θ = y. Because triangle BOR is similar to triangle  \nAOP, we have\n\nBR _ AP _ sinθ  \n\nOB OA _ cosθ  \n\n= tanθ  \nBecause OB = 1, BR is equal to tan θ. Notice that this will be the slope of  \n\nOP. Using a similar argument, it can be shown that CO = cot θ, OO = csc θ, and  \nOR = sec θ.\n\nA\n\nR\n(0, 1) cotθ θ  \nC c .\n\nP(x, y) t units  \n1 1 ~  \na=  \nt radians\n\n- cosθ A B](1,0)\n\nY  \nFigure 12\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the values of the trigonometric functions will  \nsometimes be negative, and so we must obey the following rules when using line  \nsegments to represent them geometrically:\n\n1. sin θ and tan θ are positive when AP and BR extend above the x-axis, and  \nnegative when they extend below the x-axis.\n\n2. cos θ and cot θ are positive when OA and CQ extend to the right of the y-axis,  \nand negative when they extend to the left of the y-axis.\n\n3. sec θ and csc θ are positive when OR and OQ are measured in the same direc-\ntion as the terminal side of the angle, and negative when measured in the op-\nposite direction.\n\nEXAMPLE 7 Describe how sec θ varies as θ increases from 0 to π/2.\n\nSOLUTION When θ = 0, OR = 1 so that sec θ will begin at a value of 1. As θ  \nincreases, sec θ grows larger and larger. Eventually, when θ = π/2, OP will be  \nvertical so sec θ = OR will no longer be defined.\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Behavior of Trigonometric Functions on the Unit Circle**\n\nDescribe how the value of sec θ changes as θ increases from 0 to π/2, using the geometric interpretations provided in the text.\n\n**Guidelines**:\n- Reference the definition of sec θ as the reciprocal of cos θ.\n- Explain the relationship between the position of point P on the unit circle and the length of OR.\n- Discuss the behavior of sec θ as θ approaches π/2, considering the geometric interpretation of sec θ as a line segment.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must explicitly connect the geometric representation of sec θ to its algebraic definition and describe the trend in its value as θ increases.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Trigonometric Sign Variations**\n\nUsing the rules provided in the text, determine the sign of tan θ when θ is in the second quadrant (π/2 < θ < π).\n\n**Steps to Consider**:\n1. Identify the quadrant where θ is located.\n2. Apply the rules regarding the signs of trigonometric functions based on the position of line segments.\n3. Justify your conclusion by referencing the specific rule from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly state the sign of tan θ in the second quadrant and explain why, using the text''s rules about the direction of line segments. This requires understanding the relationship between the terminal side of the angle and the sign of the function.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Reasoning with Trigonometric Identities and Geometric Representations**\n\nGiven that tan θ = sin θ / cos θ, explain how the geometric interpretations of sin θ, cos θ, and tan θ (as line segments in Figure 12) support the identity.\n\n**Key Points to Address**:\n- Describe the geometric meaning of sin θ, cos θ, and tan θ as line segments.\n- Explain how the ratio of these segments (sin θ / cos θ) corresponds to the definition of tan θ.\n- Use the text''s explanation of how these segments relate to the position of point P on the unit circle.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must integrate the geometric definitions from the text with the algebraic identity, demonstrating a clear understanding of how the trigonometric functions are defined and related through their geometric representations.'

Because these lines will not intersect, the point R does not exist and so tan θ = BR is undefined. Once θ increases slightly, the line tangent to the unit circle at B will intersect with the opposite side of ray OP, so that BR extends downward from the x-axis and is therefore negative (see Figure 13).\n\n**Figure 13**\n\nAt first, BR will be very long, so that tan θ will be an extremely large negative value. As θ continues to increase towards π, R will move in closer to P, with the result that BR decreases in length. As a value, this means that tan θ is negative but increasing. Finally, when θ reaches π, the segment BR will have shrunk to zero so that tan θ = 0.\n\nTo summarize, tan θ is undefined at π/2, but then increases from −∞ to 0 as θ increases toward π.\n\n---\n\n**c Getting Ready for Class**\n\n**a After reading through the preceding section, respond in your own words and in complete sentences.**\n\n**b) If (x, y) is any point on the unit circle, and θ is the distance from (1, 0) to (x, y) along the circumference of the unit circle, what are the six trigonometric functions of θ?**\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P.

    Solve a real-life problem involving sector area.

    In Chapter 2, we discussed some of the aspects of the first Ferris wheel, which was built by George Ferris in 1893. The first topic we will cover in this section is arc length. Our study of arc length will allow us to find the distance traveled by a rider on a Ferris wheel at any point during the ride.

    In Section 3.2, we found that if a central angle 0, measured in radians, in a circle of radius r cuts off an arc of length s, then the relationship between s, r, and @ can be written as 0 = - Figure 1 illustrates this.

Applying the formula s = rθ gives us\n\ns = rθ  \n= 4.3(2)  \n= 8.6 inches\n\nFigure 2 illustrates this example.\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2** Figure 3 is a model of George Ferris’s Ferris wheel.

Find the distance traveled by the rider if θ = 45° and if θ = 105°.\n\n**SOLUTION** The formula for arc length, s = rθ, requires θ to be given in radians. Since θ is given in degrees, we must multiply it by π/180 to convert to radians. Also, since the diameter of the wheel is 250 feet, the radius is 125 feet.\n\nFor θ = 45°:\ns = rθ  \n= 125(45)(π/180)  \n= (125π)/4  \n≈ 98 ft\n\nFor θ = 105°:\ns = rθ  \n= 125(105)(π/180)  \n= (875π)/12  \n≈ 230 ft\n\n**Figure 3**\n\n**EXAMPLE 3** The minute hand of a clock is 1.2 centimeters long.

We can use a proportion to find θ. One complete rotation is 60 minutes and 2π radians, so we say θ is to 2π as 20 minutes is to 60 minutes, or\n\nθ/2π = 20/60  \nθ = (20/60)(2π)  \nθ = (1/3)(2π)  \nθ = 2π/3 radians\n\nNow, using the formula s = rθ:\ns = (1.2)(2π/3)  \n= 0.8π  \n≈ 2.5 cm\n\n--- \n\nThis is the corrected and properly formatted version of the original text.\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P.

    If we are working with relatively small central angles in circles with large radii,
    we can use the length of the intercepted arc to approximate the length of the associated
    chord. For example, Figure 5 shows a central angle of 1° in a circle of radius
    1,800 feet, along with the arc and chord cut off by 1°. (Figure 5 is not drawn to scale.)

    Chord AB

    1800 ft A

    Figure 5

    To find the length of arc AB, we convert 1° to radians by multiplying by π/180.
    Then we apply the formula s = rθ.

    WT

    s=1×π/180 × 1800
    = (π × 1800)/180
    = 10π
    ≈ 31.4159 ft

    If we had carried out the calculation of arc AB to six significant digits, we
    would have obtained s = 31.4159. The length of the chord AB is 31.4155 to six
    significant digits (found by using the law of sines, which we will cover in Chapter
    7). As you can see, the first five digits in each number are the same. It seems rea-
    sonable then to approximate the length of chord AB with the length of arc AB.

    As our next example illustrates, we can also use the procedure just outlined
    in the reverse order to find the radius of a circle by approximating arc length with
    the length of the associated chord.

    EXTENDING THE CONCEPTS

    Apparent Diameter As we mentioned in this section, for small central angles in circles with
    large radii, the intercepted arc and the chord are approximately the same length. Figure 19
    shows a diagram of a person looking at the moon. The arc and the chord are essentially the
    same length and are both good approximations to the diameter.

    Chord Arc

    Not drawn to scale

    Figure 19

    In astronomy, the angle α at which an object is seen by the eye is called the apparent diameter
    of the object. Apparent diameter depends on the size of the object and its distance from
    the observer. To three significant figures, the diameter of the moon is 3,470 kilometers and
    its average distance to the earth is 384,000 kilometers. The diameter of the sun is 1,390,000
    kilometers and its mean distance to the earth is 150,000,000 kilometers. Use this information for Problems 63 through 66.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Arc Length and Chord Length in Circles**\n\nGiven a circle with radius r, the arc length s is given by s = rθ (where θ is in radians), and the chord length c is given by c = 2r sin(θ/2).\n\nFor the Reynolds RZR 46 carbon wheel (Problem 60), the diameter is 700 mm, so the radius is 350 mm. The wheel has 16 spokes evenly distributed, so the central angle between adjacent spokes is θ = 360° / 16 = 22.5°.\n\n**Question**: What is the length of the rim subtended by adjacent pairs of spokes (i.e., the arc length between two adjacent spokes)?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include both the arc length calculation using the formula s = rθ (in radians) and a logical explanation of how the central angle was determined from the number of spokes.\n\n**Hint**: Convert the central angle from degrees to radians before applying the formula.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Perimeter and Area in a Circular Sector**\n\nIn Problem 61, the "mouth" of Pac-Man forms a central angle of 55.0° in a circle with radius 4.00 mm. The perimeter of Pac-Man includes the arc length of the mouth and the two straight sides of the mouth.\n\n**Question**: If the radius of the circle is 4.00 mm and the central angle is 55.0°, find the perimeter of Pac-Man (including the sides of the mouth).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include both the calculation of the arc length using the formula s = rθ (in radians) and the calculation of the straight sides of the mouth. You must also explain how the straight sides relate to the central angle and the radius.\n\n**Hint**: The straight sides of the mouth form an isosceles triangle with the arc, and their length can be determined using trigonometry.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Applying Concepts of Apparent Diameter in Astronomy**\n\nIn the "Extending the Concepts" section, it is stated that the apparent diameter α of an object is determined by its actual size and its distance from the observer. The moon''s diameter is 3,470 km and its distance from Earth is 384,000 km. The sun''s diameter is 1,390,000 km and its distance from Earth is 150,000,000 km.\n\n**Question**: Calculate the apparent diameter of the moon and the sun using the small-angle formula α ≈ s/r, where s is the actual diameter and r is the distance from the observer.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include both calculations, and you must explain why the small-angle formula is appropriate in this context. Additionally, compare the apparent sizes of the moon and the sun and explain why they appear to be the same size in the sky despite their different actual sizes and distances.\n\n**Hint**: Convert the diameter and distance into consistent units (e.g., kilometers) before applying the formula.'

    Learning Objectives

    Calculate the linear velocity of a point moving with uniform circular motion.

    Calculate the angular velocity of a point moving with uniform circular motion.

    Convert from linear velocity to angular velocity and vice versa.

    Solve real-life problems involving linear and angular velocity.

    The specifications for the first Ferris wheel indicate that one trip around the wheel took 20 minutes. How fast was a rider traveling around the wheel? There are a number of ways to answer this question. The most intuitive measure of the rate at which the rider is traveling around the wheel is what we call linear velocity. The units of linear velocity are miles per hour, feet per second, and so forth.

    Another way to specify how fast the rider is traveling around the wheel is with what we call angular velocity. Angular velocity is given as the amount of central angle through which the rider travels over a given amount of time. The central angle swept out by a rider traveling once around the wheel is 360°, or 2π radians. If one trip around the wheel takes 20 minutes, then the angular velocity of a rider is

    2π radians / 20 minutes = π/10 rad/min

    In this section, we will learn more about angular velocity and linear velocity and the relationship between them. Let’s start with the formal definition for the linear velocity of a point moving on the circumference of a circle.

    Definition: Linear Velocity

    If P is a point on a circle of radius r, and P moves an arc length s along the circumference of the circle in an amount of time t, then the linear velocity, v, of P is given by the formula

    v = s/t

    To calculate the linear velocity, we simply divide distance traveled by time. It does not matter whether the object moves on a curve or in a straight line.

    From right triangle 4 BC, we have the following relationships:

    Now, these equations give us d and / in terms of 9. To write d and /in terms of
    t, we solve w = 0/t for 6 to obtain 6 = wt = wt. Substituting this for 6 in each

    As suggested by William McClure of Orange Coast Community College, a
    helpful analogy to visualize the relationship between linear and angular velocity
    is to imagine a group of ice skaters linked arm to arm on the ice in a straight
    line, with half the skaters facing in one direction and the other half facing in the
    opposite direction. As the line of skaters rotates in a circular motion, every skater
    is moving with the same angular velocity. However, in terms of linear velocity,
    the skaters near the center of the line are barely moving while the skaters near the
    ends of the line are moving very rapidly because they have to skate a much larger
    circle in the same amount of time.

- prompt: |-
    SOLUTION The quantity 4,500 revolutions per minute is another way of
    expressing the rate at which the point on the DVD is moving. We can obtain
    the angular velocity from it by remembering that one complete revolution is
    equivalent to 27 radians. Therefore,

    4,500 rev × 27 rad
    1 min × 1 rev

    = 9,000 rad/min

    w = 4,500 rpm =

    Because one revolution is equivalent to 27 radians, the fraction

    27 rad
    1 rev

    is just another form of the number 1. We call this kind of fraction a conversion
    factor. Notice how the units of revolutions divide out in much the same way
    that common factors divide out when we reduce fractions to lowest terms. The
    conversion factor allows us to convert from revolutions to radians by dividing
    out revolutions.

    To find the linear velocity, we multiply w by the radius.

    v = rω
    = (2 in.)(9,000 rad/min)
    = 18,000 in./min Exact value
    ≈ 18,000(3.14) Approximate value
    = 56,500 in./min To three significant digits

    To convert 56,500 inches per minute to feet per minute, we use another conver-
    sion factor relating feet to inches. Here is our work:

    56,500 in./min × 1 ft
    1 min × 12 in.

    = 56,500 ft/min ≈ 4,710 ft/min

    NOTE In light of our previous discussion about units, you may be wondering
    how we went from (inches)(radians/minute) to just inches/minute in Example 5.
    Remember that radians are just real numbers and technically have no units. We
    sometimes write them as if they did for our own convenience, but one of the advan-
    tages of radian measure is that it does not introduce a new unit into calculations.

    176 CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure

    SOLUTION

    a. We found the angular velocity in the introduction to this section. It is

    $$
    \omega = \frac{7}{10} \text{ rad/min}
    $$

    Next, we use the formula $ v = r\omega $ to find the linear velocity. That is, we multiply the angular velocity by the radius to find the linear velocity.
    $$
    v = r\omega
    $$
    Figure 2: $ v = (125 \pi) \left( \frac{7}{10} \right) \text{ rad/min} $

    $$
    = 39.27 \text{ ft/min} \quad \text{(intermediate answer)}
    $$

    To convert to miles per hour, we use the facts that there are 60 minutes in 1 hour and 5,280 feet in 1 mile.

    $$
    \frac{39.27 \text{ ft/min} \times 60 \text{ min}}{5,280 \text{ ft/mi}} = \frac{(39.27)(60)}{5,280} \text{ mi/hr}
    $$

    $$
    = 0.45 \text{ mi/hr}
    $$

    b. Suppose the person riding on the wheel is at position $ P $; as shown in Figure 2.
    Based on our work in Example 5 of Section 2.3, the height, $ H $, of the rider can be found from the central angle $ \theta $ using the equation

    $$
    H = 139 - 125 \cos \theta
    $$

    Because the angular velocity of the wheel is $ \omega = \frac{7}{10} $ radians per minute, then assuming $ \theta $ is measured in radians we have

    $$
    \theta = \omega t \quad \text{Definition of angular velocity}
    $$

    $$
    \theta = \frac{7}{10} t \quad \text{Multiply both sides by } t
    $$

    So,

    $$
    H = 139 - 125 \cos\left( \frac{7}{10} t \right)
    $$

    This equation gives us the height of the rider at any time $ t $, where $ t $ is measured in minutes.

    REFERENCE ANGLE (3.1]

    The reference angle θ for any angle θ in standard position is the positive acute
    angle between the terminal side of θ and the x-axis.
    A trigonometric function of an angle and its reference angle differ at most in sign.
    We find trigonometric functions for angles between 0° and 360° by first finding the
    reference angle. We then find the value of the trigonometric function of the reference
    angle and use the quadrant in which the angle terminates to assign the correct sign.

    The Third Man

    We mentioned in Chapter 2 that the Ferris wheel called the Riesenrad, built in
    Vienna in 1897, is still in operation today. A brochure that gives some statistics
    associated with the Riesenrad indicates that passengers riding it travel at 2.5 feet
    per second. The Orson Welles movie *The Third Man* contains a scene in which
    Orson Welles rides the Riesenrad through one complete revolution. Watch *The
    Third Man* so you can view the Riesenrad in operation. Then devise a method
    of using the movie to estimate the angular velocity of the wheel. Give a detailed
    account of the procedure you use to arrive at your estimate. Finally, use your

    SECTION 4.1 Basic Graphs 193

    Don’t dwell on questions and evaluations of the class that can be used
    as excuses for not doing well. If you want to succeed in this course, focus
    your energy and efforts toward success, rather than distracting yourself
    from your goals.

    PA Be Resilient Don’t let setbacks keep you from your goals. You want to put
    yourself on the road to becoming a person who can succeed in this class, or
    any college class. Failing a test or quiz, or having a difficult time on some top-
    ics, is normal. No one goes through college without some setbacks. Don’t
    let a temporary disappointment keep you from succeeding in this course. A
    low grade on a test or quiz is simply a signal that some reevaluation of your
    study habits needs to take place.

    FE] Intend to Succeed We always have a few students who simply go through
    the motions of studying without intending on mastering the material. It
    is more important to them to look as if they are studying than to actu-
    ally study. You need to study with the intention of being successful in the
    course. Intend to master the material, no matter what it takes.

    **Graphing y = sin x Using the Unit Circle**

    We can also obtain the graph of the sine function by using the unit circle definition (Definition III). Figure 2 shows a diagram of the unit circle we introduced earlier in Section 3.3. If the point (x, y) is funits from (1, 0) along the circumference of the unit circle, then sin θ = y. Therefore, if we start at the point (1, 0) and travel once around the unit circle (a distance of 2π units), we can find the value of y in the equation y = sin t by simply keeping track of the y-coordinates of the points that are θ units from (1, 0).

    **NOTE:** In Figure 2 we are using x and y differently than we are in Figure 1. Because in Figure 2 we need x to represent the coordinate of a point on the unit circle, we let t be the input value to the trigonometric function. The variable x in Figure 1 represents the same quantity as the variable θ in Figure 2.

    As θ increases from 0 to 7/2, meaning P travels from (1, 0) to (0, 1), y = sin θ increases from 0 to 1. As θ continues in QU from 7/2 to π, y decreases from 1 back to 0. In QIII the length of segment AP increases from 0 to 1, but because it is located below the x-axis the y-coordinate is negative. So, as θ increases from π to 3π/2, y decreases from 0 to —1. Finally, as θ increases from 3π/2 to 2π in QIV, bringing P back to (1, 0), y increases from —1 back to 0. Figure 3 illustrates how the y-coordinate of P (or AP) is used to construct the graph of the sine function as θ increases.

    196 = CHAPTER 4 Il Graphing and Inverse Functions

    The graph of y = sin x never goes above | or below —1, repeats itself every 27
    units on the x-axis, and crosses the x-axis at multiples of 7. This gives rise to the
    following three definitions.

    Definition = Period

    For any function y = f(x), the smallest positive number p for which

    F(x + p) = f(x)
    for all xin the domain of fis called the period of f(x). y

    In the case of y = sin x, the period is 277 because p = 27ris the smallest positive
    number for which sin (x + p) = sin x for all x.

    Definition = Amplitude

    If the greatest value of y is M and the least value of y is m, then the amplitude
    of the graph of y is defined to be

    4-+\m—ml
    2

    IN

    In the case of y = sin x, the amplitude is 1 because

    1 Lo
    5 I —(-1)| =5@Q=1

    Definition = Zero

    A zero of a function y = f(x) is any domain value x = c for which f(c) = 0.
    If c is a real number, then x =c will be an x-intercept of the graph of

    y = f(x). 4

    From the graph of y = sin x, we see that the sine function has an infinite num-
    ber of zeros, which are the values x = kw for any integer k. These values will be
    very important later in Chapter 6 when we begin solving equations that involve
    trigonometric functions.

    In Section 3.3 we saw that the domain for the sine function is all real numbers.
    Because point P in Figure 2 must be on the unit circle, we have

    -1 ≤ y ≤ 1 which implies -1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1

    This means the sine function has a range of [−1, 1]. The sine of any angle can only
    be a value between −1 and 1, inclusive.

    We can generate the graph of the cosine function using the unit circle just as we did for the sine function. By Definition III, if the point (x, y) is ¢ units from (1, 0) along the circumference of the unit circle, then cos ¢ = x. We start at the point (1, 0) and travel once around the unit circle, keeping track of the x-coordinates of the points that are ¢ units from (1, 0). To help visualize how the x-coordinates generate the cosine graph, we have rotated the unit circle 90° counterclockwise so that we may represent the x-coordinates as vertical line segments (Figure 6).

    cross or touch this line. If we were to calculate values of tan x when x is very close
    to 7/2 (or very close to 90° in degree mode), we would find that tan x would become
    very large for values of x just to the left of the asymptote and very large in the nega-
    tive direction for values of x just to the right of the asymptote, as shown in Table 4.

    In terms of the unit circle (Definition II), visualize segment BR in Figure 10a
    as t increases from 0 to 7/2. When t = 0, OP is horizontal and so BR = 0. As
    t increases, BR grows in length, getting very large as θ nears 7/2. At t = 7/2, OP is
    vertical and BR is no longer defined. The exact reverse happens as θ increases from
    π/2 to π, except that now tan θ is negative because BR will be located below the
    x-axis (Figure 10b). As θ continues through π, the values of tan θ will be a repeat
    of the values we saw in QI. The same can be said of QIV and QII.

    We can also visualize tan θ as the slope of OP. At t = 0, OP is horizontal and
    the slope is zero. As P travels around the unit circle through QI, you can see how
    OP gets very steep when θ nears 7π/2. At t = π/2, OP is vertical and the slope is not
    defined. As P travels through QII the slopes are all negative, reaching a zero slope
    once again at θ = π. For P in QIII and QIV, the slope of OP will simply repeat the

    Extending the graph in Figure 9 to the right of 7 and to the left of 0, we obtain
    the graph shown in Figure 11. As this figure indicates, the period of y = tan x is 7.
    The tangent function has no amplitude because there is no largest or smallest value of
    y on the graph of y = tan x. For this same reason, the range of the tangent function is
    all real numbers. Because tan x = sin x/cos x, the zeros for the tangent function are the
    same as for the sine; that is, x = π for any integer k. The vertical asymptotes corre-
    spond to the zeros of the cosine function, which are x = π/2 + kπ for any integer k.

    **PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of y = csc x.**

    Graph y = sec x.

    **SOLUTION** To graph y = csc x, we can use the fact that csc x is the reciprocal of sin x. In Table 5, we use the values of sin x from Table 1 and take reciprocals. Filling in with some additional points, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 12.

    **TABLE 5**

    x | sin x | csc x = 1/sin x

    0 | 0 | undefined
    π/6 | 1/2 | 2
    π/4 | √2/2 | √2 ≈ 1.4
    π/3 | √3/2 | 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547
    π/2 | 1 | 1
    2π/3 | √3/2 | 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547
    3π/4 | √2/2 | √2 ≈ 1.4
    5π/6 | 1/2 | 2
    π | 0 | undefined
    7π/6 | -1/2 | -2
    5π/4 | -√2/2 | -√2 ≈ -1.4
    4π/3 | -√3/2 | -2/√3 ≈ -1.1547
    3π/2 | -1 | -1
    5π/3 | -√3/2 | -2/√3 ≈ -1.1547
    7π/4 | -√2/2 | -√2 ≈ -1.4
    5π/6 | -1/2 | -2
    3π | 0 | undefined

    **Figure 12**

    As you can see in Figure 12, the reciprocals of 1 and -1 are themselves, so these points are common to both the graphs of the sine and cosecant functions. When sin x is close to 1 or -1, so is csc x. When sin x is close to zero, csc x will be a very large positive or negative number. The cosecant function will be undefined whenever the sine function is zero, so that y = csc x has vertical asymptotes at the values x = kπ for any integer k.

    Because y = sin x repeats every 2π, so do the reciprocals of sin x, so the period of y = csc x is 2π. As was the case with y = tan x, there is no amplitude. The range of y = csc x is y = -1 or y = 1, or in interval notation, (-∞, -1] U [1, ∞). The cosecant function has no zeros because y cannot ever be equal to zero. Notice in Figure 12 that the graph of y = csc x never crosses the x-axis.

    Because the calculator graphs a function by plotting points and connecting
    them, the vertical line seen in Figure 13 will sometimes appear where an asymp-
    tote exists. We just need to remember that this line is not part of the graph of
    the cosecant function, as Figure 14 indicates. To make sure that these artificial
    lines do not appear in the graph, we can graph the function in dot mode or with

    SECTION 4.1 Basic Graphs 203

    NOTE Some instructors prefer to define the basic cycle for the tangent function
    to be (—7/2, 7/2) as shown in Figure 18. This allows the graph of a cycle to be
    drawn as a single, unbroken curve. We have chosen to define the basic cycle over
    the interval [0, 7], which will allow us to graph all six trigonometric functions
    using a consistent approach.

    Even and Odd Functions

    Recall from algebra the definitions of even and odd functions.

    Definition = Even Function

    An even function is a function for which
    f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f

    The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis. y

    An even function is a function for which replacing x with −x leaves the expression
    that defines the function unchanged. If a function is even, then every time the point
    (x, y) is on the graph, so is the point (−x, y). The function f(x) = x² + 3 is an even
    function because

    f(−x) = (−x)² + 3 = x² + 3 = f(x)

    Definition = Odd Function

    An odd function is a function for which

    f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain of f

    The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin. y

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.

Justify your answer using the definitions of even and odd functions from the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the function cannot be odd, despite the presence of $ x^2 $ inside the square root. Use logical reasoning based on the properties of square roots and even functions.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example of a function that is neither even nor odd, and explain how its graph reflects this property. Your example must reference the text''s definitions of even and odd functions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the definitions of even and odd functions and the implications of their properties on the graph of a function.'

- prompt: |-
    An odd function is a function for which replacing x with —x changes the sign of the expression that defines the function. If a function is odd, then every time the point (x, y) is on the graph, so is the point (—x, —y). The function f(x) = x7 — x is an odd function because

    f(—x) = (—x)^7 — (—x)

    = -x^7 + x

    = —(x^7 — x)

    = f(x)

    From the unit circle it is apparent that sine is an odd function and cosine is an even function. To begin to see that this is true, we locate 7/6 and —7/6 (—7/6 is coterminal with 11π/6) on the unit circle and notice that

    and

    We can generalize this result by drawing an angle θ and its opposite —θ in standard position and then labeling the points where their terminal sides intersect the unit circle with (x, y) and (x, —y), respectively. (Can you see from Figure 19 why we label these two points in this way? That is, does it make sense that if (x, y) is on the terminal side of θ, then (x, —y) must be on the terminal side of —θ?)

Show your reasoning step by step, referencing the unit circle coordinates and the definitions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly connect the geometric properties of the unit circle to the algebraic definitions of odd and even functions.'

Show all steps, including the application of exponent rules.\n\n**Part B**: Compare f(x) = x^7 − x with the sine function. Both are odd functions, but sine is a trigonometric function while f(x) is a polynomial. Explain the difference in their graphical representations based on the properties of odd functions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the definition of an odd function and its implications for the graph of a function.'

    indicating that sine is an odd function.

    Now that we have established that sine is an odd function and cosine is an even
    function, we can use our ratio and reciprocal identities to find which of the other
    trigonometric functions are even and which are odd. Example 3 shows how this is

    Because the sine function is odd, we can see in Figure 4 that the graph of
    y = sin x is symmetric about the origin. On the other hand, the cosine function is
    even, so the graph of y = cos x is symmetric about the y-axis as can be seen in Fig-
    ure 7. We summarize the nature of all six trigonometric functions for easy reference.

    SECTION 4.2 I Amplitude, Reflection, and Period 209

    Learning Objectives

    Find the amplitude of a sine or cosine function.
    Find the period of a sine or cosine function.

    Graph a sine or cosine function having a different amplitude and
    period.

    Solve a real-life problem involving a trigonometric function as a model.

    In Section 4.1, the graphs of y = sin x and y = cos x were shown to have an ampli-
    tude of 1 and a period of 2π. In this section, we will extend our work with these
    two functions by considering what happens to the graph when we allow for a coef-
    ficient with a trigonometric function.

    Amplitude

    First, we will consider the effect that multiplying a trigonometric function by a
    numerical factor has on the graph.

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of y = 2 sin x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π.
    Graph y = 4 cos x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π.

    SOLUTION The coefficient 2 on the right side of the equation will simply multiply each value of sin x by a factor of 2. Therefore, the values of y in y = 2 sin x should all be twice the corresponding values of y in y = sin x. Table 1 contains some values for y = 2 sin x.

    TABLE 1

    x      y=2sinx        (x, y)
    0     y =2sin 0 = 2(0) = 0 (0, 0)
    7     y =2sin 7 = 2(0) = 0 (7, 0)
    5     y=2sin 5 = 2(1) = 2 (5, 2)
    7     y =2sin 7 = 2(0) = 0 (7, 0)
    3     y=2sin 3 = 2(-1) = -2 (3, -2)
    27    y =2sin 27 = 2(0) = 0 (27, 0)

    Figure 1 shows the graphs of y = sin x and y = 2 sin x. (We are including the graph of y = sin x simply for reference and comparison. With both graphs to look at, it is easier to see what change is brought about by the coefficient 2.)

    SECTION 4.2 Amplitude, Reflection, and Period 211

    Summary

    Generalizing the results of these last two examples, we can say that if A > 0,
    then the graphs of y = A sin x and y = A cos x will have amplitude A and
    range [— A, A].

    Reflecting About the x-Axis

    In the previous examples we only considered changes to the graph if the coefficient
    A was a positive number. To see how a negative value of A affects the graph, we will

    consider the function y = —2 cos x.
    NN“
    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Graph y = —2 cos x, from x = —27 to x = 4a.
    Graph y = —3 sin x for
    27 =x = 4n. SOLUTION Each value of y on the graph of y = —2 cos x will be the opposite

    of the corresponding value of y on the graph of y = 2 cos x. The result is that
    the graph of y = —2 cos x is the reflection of the graph of y = 2 cos x about the
    x-axis. Figure 3 shows the extension of one complete cycle of y = —2 cos x to
    the interval —27 = x = 47.

    y=2cosx y=—2cosx

    Figure 3 a

    Summary

    If A <0, then the graphs of y = Asin xand y = Acosx will be sine and cosine
    graphs that have been reflected about the x-axis. The amplitude will be |A|.

    Period

    Up to this point we have considered the effect that a coefficient, which multiplies
    the trigonometric function, has on the graph. Now we will investigate what hap-
    pens if we allow the input variable to have a coefficient. Remember that the input
    is formally called the argument of the function.

    In the situation where B < 0, we can use the properties of even and odd func-
    tions to rewrite the function so that B is positive. For example,

    y=3 sin (—2x) Is equivalent to y = —3 sin (2x) because
    sine is an odd function

    y = 3cos (—2x) Is equivalent to y = 3 cos (2x) because

    cosine is an even function

    In the next two examples, we use this information about amplitude and period
    to graph one complete cycle of a sine and cosine curve and then extend these
    graphs to cover more than the one cycle. We also take this opportunity to intro-
    duce a method of drawing the graph by constructing a “frame” for the basic cycle.

    In the previous section, we considered what happens to the graph when we allow for a coefficient (a multiplier) with a sine or cosine function. We will conclude our study of the graphs of these two functions by investigating the effect caused by inserting a term (that is, adding or subtracting a number) in the equation of the function. As we will see, the addition of a term creates a translation, in which the position, but not shape, of the graph is changed.

    Vertical Translations

    Recall from algebra the relationship between the graphs of y = x² and y = x² — 3. Figures 1 and 2 show the graphs. The graph of y = x² — 3 has the same shape as the graph of y = x² but with its vertex (and all other points) moved down three units. If we were to graph y = x² + 2, the graph would have the same shape as the graph of y = x², but it would be shifted up two units. In general, the graph of

    y = f(x) + k is the graph of y = f(x) translated k units vertically. If k is a positive number, the translation is up. If k is a negative number, the translation is down.

    we see that y = —3 — 2 sin wx will have a graph that is identical to that of

    y = —2s1n 7x, except that all points on the graph will be shifted downward three
    units. Using the result of Example 8 in the previous section, we move every point

    3 units, the original range [—2, 2] becomes [—5, —1]. a

    In our next example we show how to graph a trigonometric function involving a
    vertical translation directly. Because the sine and cosine functions are centered
    about the x-axis, we can shift the axis first and then sketch the graph as usual.

    **Example 2**

    In Example 6 of Section 3.5, we found that the height of a rider on a Ferris wheel was given by the function

    $$
    H = 139 - 125 \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{20}\right)
    $$

    where $\theta$ is the number of minutes from the beginning of a ride. Graph a complete cycle of this function.

    **SOLUTION**

    The term 139 indicates that the cosine graph is shifted 139 units upward. We lightly draw the dashed horizontal line $H = 139$ to act as a place for the $y$-axis, and then proceed as normal.

    The amplitude is 125, and there is a reflection about the $y$-axis due to the negative sign.

    $$
    0 < \theta < 27\\
    10 < \theta < 20
    $$

    One cycle:
    $$
    \frac{10}{2} = 5
    $$

    The period is 20. Dividing 20 by 4, we will mark the $y$-axis at intervals of 5. Using a rectangle to frame the cycle, we then sketch in the graph as shown in Figure 4. Notice that we measure 125 units above and below the line $H = 139$ to create the frame and that we must remember to plot points for a cycle that is reflected.

    $$
    \begin{array}{c|c}
    H & \text{Graph} \\
    \hline
    280 + & \\
    260 -F & \\

    80 + & \\
    60 +& \\

    \end{array}
    $$

    $$
    H = 139 - 125 \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{20}\right)
    $$

    $$
    H = 139 \\
    125 < \theta < 4
    $$

    **Figure 4**

    **Summary**

    The graphs of $y = k + \sin x$ and $y = k + \cos x$ will be sine and cosine graphs that have been translated vertically $k$ units upward if $k > 0$, or $|k|$ units downward if $k < 0$.

    **Horizontal Translations**

    If we add a term to the argument of the function, the graph will be translated in a horizontal direction instead of a vertical direction as demonstrated in the next example.

    300 3 a good idea to begin by making a table (Table 1). In this case, multiples of 7/2
    will be the most convenient replacements for x in the table. Also, if we start with
    x = —7/2, our first value of y will be 0.
    TABLE 1
    x y=sin (x + 7/2) (x,y)
    -7/2 sin(-7/2 + 7/2) = sin(0) = 0 (-7/2, 0)
    -5/2 sin(-5/2 + 7/2) = sin(1) = 0 (-5/2, 0)
    0 sin(0 + 7/2) = sin(7/2) = 1 (0, 1)
    5/2 sin(5/2 + 7/2) = sin(6) = 0 (5/2, 0)
    3a sin(3a + 7/2) = sin(3a) = -1 (3a, -1)
    -7/2 sin(-7/2 + 7/2) = sin(0) = 0 (-7/2, 0)
    5/2 sin(5/2 + 7/2) = sin(6) = 0 (5/2, 0)
    Graphing these points and then drawing the sine curve that connects them
    gives us the graph of y = sin (x + 7/2), as shown in Figure 5.

    3π/2 instead of 2π, which agrees with the graph in Figure 5. The graph has sim-

    230 CHAPTER 4 Graphing and Inverse Functions

    Another method of determining the period and horizontal shift is to rewrite
    the function so that the argument looks like B(x — h) instead of combined as
    Bx + C. For instance, using the function from Example 5 we have

    377 377
    y =4cos (> — ). 4 cos (2(. — r))

    which is accomplished by factoring out the coefficient of 2. We can now easily
    identify that B = 2 and h = 37/4.

    Before working a final example that ties everything together, we summarize all
    the information we have covered about the graphs of the sine and cosine functions.

    The graphs of y =A + A sin (B(x — h)) and y =k + A cos (B(x — /A)), where

    The term 5 in the equation y = sin(x + 5) affects the graph by vertically stretching it. This means that the amplitude of the sine wave is increased, making the peaks and troughs more pronounced. The graph will have a greater height from the maximum to the minimum points compared to the standard sine wave.

    The term 5 in the equation y = sin(x - 5) affects the graph by horizontally shifting it. Specifically, it shifts the graph to the right by 5 units. This means that the entire sine wave moves along the x-axis, and the key points of the graph (such as the maximum, minimum, and intercepts) will also shift to the right by 5 units.

- prompt: |-
    To sketch the graph of one cycle, remember that a cycle begins with an x-
    intercept, has the vertical asymptote in the middle, and ends with an x-inter-
    cept. At x = 7/4, the normal y-value of 1 must be tripled, so we plot a point at
    (7/4, 3). For the same reason we plot a point at (37/4, —3). Figure 1 shows a
    complete cycle for y = 3 tan x (we have included the graph of y = tan x for
    comparison).

    The original problem asked for the graph on the interval —7 = x = 7. We
    extend the graph to the left by adding a second complete cycle. The final graph
    is shown in Figure 2.

    Figure 1 Figure 2

    In Section 1.5, we found that the expression √(x^7 + 9) could be rewritten without
    a square root by making the substitution x = 3 tan θ. Then we noted that the
    substitution itself was questionable because we did not know at that time if every
    real number x could be written as 3 tan θ, for some value of θ. As you can see from
    the graph in Figure 2, the range for y = 3 tan θ is all real numbers. This means that
    any real number can indeed be written as 3 tan θ, which confirms the validity of
    the substitution.

    As we saw in Section 4.2, the presence of a coefficient (other than 1) with the
    independent variable may result in a reflection or change in the period, which, for
    the tangent and cotangent functions, is π. We consider this case in the following
    two examples.

    Graph y= 10 tan 2mrfor0=1=1. next to a long block wall. The red light on the top of the truck is 10 feet from
    the wall and rotates through one complete revolution every 2 seconds. Graph the
    function that gives the length din terms of time ¢ from ¢ = 0 to f = 2.

    Figure 4

    SOLUTION From Example 4 of Section 3.5, we know that d= 10 tan zt. We
    must multiply all the y-values of the basic tangent function by 10. Also, the coef-
    ficient of zr will change the period.

    One cycle: Osatsa7

    The period is 1. Dividing by 4 gives us i, so we mark the f-axis in increments
    of i The graph is shown in Figure 5. Because the original problem asks for the
    graph from ¢ = 0 to ¢ = 2, we extended the graph by adding an additional cycle
    on the right.

    SECTION 4.4 The Other Trigonometric Functions 239

    ~
    PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4 Graph one complete cycle of y = 3 + 2 tan (3x + π/2)
    Graph one cycle of y = 2 + 4 tan (3x − π/2)
    SOLUTION The first term of 3 will shift the graph of y = tan x vertically 3 units
    upward. The factor of 2 will double the y-coordinates. To determine the horizon-
    tal shift and period, we check one cycle.

    One cycle: π/2 + π
    2 8
    _2 = * = π/2 Subtract −π/2
    § 2 8 8
    _= π/2 x i Multiply by 2
    4 4

    A cycle will begin at −π/4, so the graph is shifted π/4 units to the left. To find
    the period, we compute the difference between endpoints for the cycle:

    Period = π/2 − (−π/4) = 3π/4
    Dividing the period by 4 gives us π/2, so we mark the x-axis at intervals of
    π/2 beginning with x = −π/4 as follows (we only need to find the three middle
    points).

    −π/4, −π/4 + π/2 = π/4, −π/4 + 2(π/2) = 3π/4, −π/4 + 3(π/2) = 5π/4

    A cycle will begin and end with x-intercepts at x = −π/4 and x = 5π/4 (on the
    shifted axis). There will be a vertical asymptote at x = 3π/4. Figure 6 shows the
    key points, and the final graph is given in Figure 7.

    As Example 5 illustrates, because the secant and cosecant are reciprocals of the
    cosine and sine, respectively, there is a natural relationship between their graphs.
    We can take advantage of this relationship to graph the secant and cosecant func-
    tions by first graphing a corresponding cosine or sine function.

    SOLUTION From algebra we know that the equation of any straight line (except
    a vertical one) can be written in slope-intercept form as

    y=mx + b

    where m is the slope of the line, and b is its y-intercept.

    Because the line in Figure 2 crosses the y-axis at 3, we know the y-intercept
    b is 3. To find the slope of the line, we find the ratio of the vertical change to the
    horizontal change between any two points on the line (sometimes called rise/
    run). From Figure 1 we see that this ratio is —1/2. Therefore, m = —1/2. The
    equation of our line must be

    y = -1/2 x + 3

    As you can see, there are many possible equations we could find to represent
    the graph of a trigonometric function. The point is not to overwhelm you with too
    many choices but to let you know that there is more than one correct answer for
    each of these problems. Whether you choose a sine function or a cosine function,
    you should be able to find an equation that works. In making your choice, use what
    seems most “natural” to you, and try to keep the equation as simple as possible.

    Using Technology: Verifying Trigonometric Models

    With a graphing calculator, we can easily verify that our equation, or model,
    for the graph in Figure 10 is correct. First, set your calculator to radian mode,
    and then define

    Y1 = —5 cos (77x)

    Set the window variables to match the given graph:

    —0.5 =x =2.5, scale = 0.5; -6 = y ≤6

    Figure 11
    If our equation is correct, the graph drawn by our calculator should be identical
    to the graph provided. Because the graph shown in Figure 11 is the same as the
    graph in Figure 10, our equation must be correct.

    In our next example, we use a table of values for two variables to obtain a
    graph. From the graph, we find the equation.

    **SECTION 4.5 I Finding an Equation from Its Graph 253**

    First, make a table that shows the rider’s height H above the ground for each of the nine values of f shown in Figure 12. Then graph the ordered pairs indicated by the table. Finally, use the graph to find an equation that gives H as a function of f.

    **SOLUTION**

    Here is the reasoning we use to find the value of H for each of the given values of f: When f = 0 and f = 20, the rider is at the bottom of the wheel, 14 feet above the ground. When f = 10, the rider is at the top of the wheel, which is 264 feet above the ground. At times f = 5 and f = 15, the rider is even with the center of the wheel, which is 139 feet above the ground. The other four values of H are found using right triangle trigonometry, as we did in Section 2.3. Table 1 shows our corresponding values of f and H.

    If we graph the points (¢, H) on a rectangular coordinate system and then
    connect them with a smooth curve, we produce the diagram shown in Figure 13.
    The curve is a cosine curve that has been reflected about the f-axis and then
    shifted up vertically.

    The curve is a cosine curve, so the equation will have the form

    H = k + A cos(B(x — h))

    To find the equation for the curve in Figure 13, we must find values for k, A, B,
    and h. We begin by finding h. Because the curve starts at ¢ = 0, the horizontal
    shift is 0, which gives us

    h = 0

    The amplitude, half the difference between the highest point and the lowest
    point on the graph, must be 125 (also equal to the radius of the wheel). How-
    ever, because the graph is a reflected cosine curve, we have

    A = —125
    The period is 20 minutes, so we find B with the equation

    The value of one of the trigonometric functions. This is the reverse of what a trigonometric function is designed to do. When we try to use a function in the reverse direction, we are really using what is called the inverse of the function. We begin this section with a brief review of the inverse of a function. If this is a new topic for you, a more thorough presentation of functions and inverse functions is provided in Appendix A.
    First, let us review the definition of a function and its inverse.

    Definition: Function and Inverse

    A function is a rule or correspondence that pairs each element of the domain with exactly one element from the range. That is, a function is a set of ordered pairs in which no two different ordered pairs have the same first coordinate.

    The inverse of a function is found by interchanging the coordinates in each ordered pair that is an element of the function.

    SECTION 4.7 Inverse Trigonometric Functions 271

    With the inverse, the domain and range of the function have switched roles. To find the equation of the inverse of a function, we simply exchange x and y in the equation and then solve for y. For example, to find the inverse of the function y = x² - 4, we would proceed like this:

    The inverse of y = x² - 4
    is x = y² - 4 Exchange x and y
    or y² = x + 4 Add 4 to both sides

    y = √(x + 4) Take the square root of both sides

    The inverse of the function y = x² - 4 is given by the equation y = √(x + 4).

- prompt: "The graph of y = x² — 4 is a parabola that crosses the x-axis at —2 and 2 and  \nhas its vertex at (0, —4). To graph the inverse, we take each point on the graph of  \ny = x² — 4, interchange the x- and y-coordinates, and then plot the resulting point.  \nFigure 1 shows both graphs.

    SECTION 4.7 Inverse Trigonometric Functions 273

    It is apparent from Figure 4 that if x = sin y is restricted to the interval
    –π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, then each value of x between –1 and 1 is associated with exactly
    one value of y, and we have a function rather than just a relation. The equation
    x = sin y, together with the restriction –π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, forms the inverse sine
    function. To designate this function, we use the following notation.

    The notation used to indicate the inverse sine function is as follows:

    Notation Meaning

    y = sin⁻¹x or y = arcsin x
    x = sin y and –π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2

    In words: y is the angle between –π/2 and π/2, inclusive, whose sine is x.

    NOTE The notation sin⁻¹x is not to be interpreted as meaning the reciprocal of
    sin x. That is,

    sin⁻¹x ≠ 1/sin x

    If we want the reciprocal of sin x, we use csc x or (sin x)⁻¹, but never sin⁻¹x.

    The Inverse Cosine Function

    Just as we did for the sine function, we must restrict the values that x can assume
    with the cosine function in order to satisfy the horizontal line test. The interval
    we restrict it to is 0 ≤ x ≤ π. Figure 5 shows the graph of y = cos x with the
    restricted interval. Figure 6 shows the graph of the inverse relation x = cos y with
    the restricted interval after the cosine curve has been reflected about the line y = x.

    NOTE Notice in Example 4a that the result of 1/2 is the same as the value that
    appeared in the original expression. Because y = sin x and y = sin ' x are inverse
    functions, the one function will “undo” the action performed by the other. (For
    more details on this property of inverse functions, see Appendix A.) The reason
    this same process did not occur in Example 4b is that the original angle 135° is
    not within the restricted domain of the sine function and is therefore outside the
    range of the inverse sine function. In a sense, the functions in Example 4b are not
    really inverses because we did not choose an input within the agreed-upon interval
    for the sine function.

    Tangent is an even and odd function [4.1]
    sin (−θ) = −cos θ
    tan(−θ) = cos(−θ)
    An even function is a function for which
    f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f
    cos θ
    An odd function is a function for which
    f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain of f

    −tan θ
    Cosine is an even function, and sine is an odd function. That is,
    cos(−θ) = cos θ
    Cosine is an even function
    and
    sin(−θ) = −sin θ
    Sine is an odd function

    The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis, and the graph of an
    odd function is symmetric about the origin.

    The horizontal shift for the graph HORIZONTAL TRANSLATIONS [4.3]

    of y = 5 sin(x + 2) is ...
    The horizontal translation for a sine or cosine curve is the distance the curve has
    moved right or left from the curve y = sin x or y = cos x. For example, we usu-
    ally think of the graph of y = sin x as starting at the origin. If we graph another
    sine curve that starts at π/4, then we say this curve has a horizontal translation, or
    horizontal shift, of π/4.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Horizontal Translations**\n\nThe text describes horizontal translations as the distance a sine or cosine curve has moved right or left from the standard curve y = sin x or y = cos x.

Explain your reasoning based on the text''s definition.\n- **Part B**: If the function were y = 5 sin(x − 2), what would be the horizontal translation?\n- **Part C**: Explain how the sign in the argument of the sine function affects the direction of the horizontal translation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly identify the horizontal translation for both functions and explain the relationship between the sign in the argument and the direction of the shift.'

    From my earlier observations, which I have reported every year in this journal, it
    appears that there is a certain periodicity in the appearance of sunspots and this
    theory seems more and more probable from the results of this year...
    Heinrich Schwabe, 1843

    OBJECTIVE: To find a sinusoidal model for the average annual sunspot number
    using recent data.

    Sunspots have been observed and recorded for thousands of years. Some of the earli-
    est observations were made by Chinese astronomers. Further observations were made
    following the invention of the telescope in the 17th century by a number of astrono-
    mers, including Galileo and William Herschel. However, it was the German astron-
    omer Heinrich Schwabe who, in searching for evidence of other planets between
    Mercury and the Sun, first observed an apparent periodic cycle in sunspot activity.

    Table 1 provides the average annual sunspot number for each year between
    1978 and 1998.

Include at least two steps in your explanation and reference the properties of sinusoidal functions.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the significance of the sunspot cycle observed by Heinrich Schwabe and how it relates to the periodic nature of the data. Use the text''s historical context to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: If the model you created in Part A is used to predict the sunspot number for the year 2020, what would be the predicted value? Justify your prediction using the model''s equation and the data provided in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of sinusoidal modeling and the historical context of sunspot cycles as described in the text.'

    RESEARCH PROJECT
    The Sunspot Cycle

    Although many astronomers made regular observations of sunspots, it was the
    Swiss astronomer Rudolph Wolf who devised the first universal method for
    counting sunspots. The daily sunspot number, sometimes called the Wolf num-
    ber, follows a periodic cycle. Wolf calculated the length of this cycle to be about
    11.1 years.

    Research the astronomer Rudolph Wolf and the sunspot cycle. Why do
    modern astronomers consider the length of the sunspot cycle to be 22 years?
    What are some of the effects that the sunspot cycle causes here on Earth? Write
    a paragraph or two about your findings.

    Although it doesn’t look like it, Figure 1 shows the graphs of two functions, namely

    = cos x an = ——_
    y y 1 + sin? x
    Although these two functions look quite different from one another, they are in
    fact the same function. This means that, for all values of x,

    5 1 — sin’ x
    cos’ xX = ———_—
    1 + sine x

    This last expression is an identity, and identities are one of the topics we will study

The first study skill is a point of view you hold about your natural instincts for what does and doesn’t work in mathematics. The second study skill gives you a way of testing your instincts.\n\n**E.H. Don’t Let Your Intuition Fool You**  \nAs you become more experienced and more successful in mathematics, you will be able to trust your mathematical intuition. For now, though, it can get in the way of your success. For example, if you ask a beginning algebra student to expand (a + 5)², many will write a² + b², which is incorrect. In trigonometry, at first glance it may seem that a statement such as sin (A + B) = sin A + sin B is true. However, it too is false, as you will see in this chapter.\n\n**1 Test Properties You Are Unsure Of**  \nFrom time to time you will be in a situation in which you would like to apply a property or rule, but you are not sure it is true. You can always test a property or statement by substituting numbers for variables. For instance, we always have students that rewrite (x + 3)² as x² + 9, thinking that the two expressions are equivalent. The fact that the two expressions are not equivalent becomes obvious when we substitute 10 for x in each one.\n\nThe text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Identities and Intuition Testing**\n\nGiven the identity $ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 $, test its validity by substituting $ a = 3 $ and $ b = 4 $ into both sides of the equation. Then, use the study skill "Don’t Let Your Intuition Fool You" to explain why a student might incorrectly expand $ (a + b)^2 $ as $ a^2 + b^2 $, and how this relates to the importance of verifying identities through substitution.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a numerical verification of the identity and a logical explanation of common misconceptions, referencing the study skills provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Trigonometric Identity Testing**\n\nConsider the trigonometric identity $ \sin(A + B) = \sin A + \sin B $. Use the study skill "Test Properties You Are Unsure Of" to verify the truth of this identity by substituting specific values for A and B (e.g., A = 30°, B = 60°).\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Calculate both sides of the equation using the given values.\n- **Part B**: Explain why this identity is false based on your calculations and how this relates to the text’s discussion of trigonometric identities.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the process of testing properties through substitution aligns with the study skill of "Don’t Let Your Intuition Fool You."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of trigonometric identities and the importance of verification through substitution.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Mathematical Intuition**\n\nA student claims that $ (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 9 $ is true because both sides are polynomials. Use the study skills from the text to critique this claim and explain why this reasoning is flawed.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the error in the student’s reasoning by substituting a specific value for x (e.g., x = 2) into both sides of the equation.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the study skill "Don’t Let Your Intuition Fool You" applies to this situation and why trusting intuition without verification can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the student’s claim using another value for x and show how the correct identity $ (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 $ is derived.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the study skills and demonstrate a clear understanding of polynomial identities and their verification.'

If you try A = 30° in each expression, you will find out  \nquickly that the two expressions are not the same.  \n\nV3  \nWhen 4 = 30°, the expression sin 2A = sin 2(30°) = sin 60° = >  \n1  \nWhen 4 = 30°, the expression 2 sin A = 2 sin 30° = 2 - a 1  \n\nWhen you test the equivalence of expressions by substituting numbers for  \nthe variable, make it easy on yourself by choosing numbers that are easy  \nto work with, as we did above.  \n\nIt is not good practice to trust your intuition or instincts in every new sit-  \nuation in mathematics. If you have any doubt about generalizations you are  \nmaking, test them by replacing variables with numbers and simplifying.  \n\nLearning Objectives  \n\nProve an equation is an identity.  \nUse a counterexample to prove an equation is not an identity.  \n\nUse a graphing calculator to determine if an equation appears to be an  \nidentity.  \n\nCopyright 2017 Cengage Learning.

    292 CHAPTER 5 Bf Identities and Formulas

    The main thing to remember in proving identities is to work on each side of
    the identity separately. We do not want to use properties from algebra that involve
    both sides of the identity—like the addition property of equality. To do so would
    be to assume that the two sides are equal, which is what we are trying to establish.
    We are not allowed to treat the problem as an equation.

    We prove identities to develop the ability to transform one trigonometric
    expression into another. When we encounter problems in other courses that require
    the techniques used to verify identities, we usually find that the solutions to these
    problems hinge on transforming an expression containing trigonometric functions
    into less complicated expressions. In these cases, we do not usually have an equal
    sign to work with.

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Prove sin @ cot 6 = cos @.

    tan 6
    Prove

    PROOF To prove this identity, we transform the left side into the right side.

    sin 8 cot@ = sin@: Ratio identity

    sin 8
    sin 6 cos 8
    = Multiply
    sin @
    cos @ Divide out common factor sin @

    In this example, we have transformed the left side into the right side. Remember,
    we verify identities by transforming one expression into another. a

    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2 Prove tan x + cos x = sin x (sec x + cot x).
    Prove

    cot x + 1 =cosx(cscx + secx). PROOF Wecan begin by applying the distributive property to the right side to
    multiply through by sin x. Then we can change the right side to an equivalent
    expression involving only sin x and cos x.

    sin x (sec x + cot x) = sin x sec x + sin x cot x Multiply

Use the example in the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Analyze the difference between verifying an identity and solving an equation. Provide an example of each, using the text''s examples as a reference.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinction between identities and equations, as well as the specific methods required for proving identities.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Trigonometric Identities**\n\nSuppose you are given the expression $ \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1 $, which is a fundamental trigonometric identity.\n- **Part A**: Use this identity to derive the identity $ \tan^2 x + 1 = \sec^2 x $. Show all steps and justify each transformation using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Create a new identity by manipulating the original identity and one of the other fundamental identities (e.g., $ \sin x = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $). Explain your process and the reasoning behind each step.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the significance of these identities in trigonometry and how they are used in real-world applications. Provide a specific example of their application, referencing the text''s examples.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the fundamental identities and demonstrate a deep understanding of their relationships and applications.'

    In this case, we transformed the right side into the left side. a

    Before we go on to the next example, let’s list some guidelines that may be
    useful in learning how to prove identities. Keep in mind that these are simply
    guidelines. The best way to become proficient at proving trigonometric iden-
    tities is to practice. The more identities you prove, the more you will be able
    to prove and the more confident you will become. Don’t be afraid to stop and
    start over if you don’t seem to be getting anywhere. With most identities, there
    are a number of different proofs that will lead to the same result. Some of the
    proofs will be longer than others.

    SECTION 5.1 Proving Identities 293

    Guidelines for Proving Identities RTT THT THT

    1. It is usually best to work on the more complicated side first.

    2. Look for trigonometric substitutions involving the basic identities that
    may help simplify things.

    3. Look for algebraic operations, such as adding fractions, the distributive
    property, or factoring, that may simplify the side you are working with or
    that will at least lead to an expression that will be easier to simplify.

    4. If you cannot think of anything else to do, change everything to sines and
    cosines and see if that helps.

    5. Always keep an eye on the side you are not working with to be sure you
    are working toward it. There is a certain sense of direction that accompa-

    nies a successful proof. 4

    296 CHAPTER 5 Identities and Formulas

    In the previous examples, we have concentrated on methods for proving that a
    statement is an identity, meaning that the two expressions are equal for all replace-
    ments of the variable for which each expression is defined. To show that a state-
    ment is not an identity is usually much simpler. All we must do is find a single
    value of the variable for which each expression is defined, but which makes the
    statement false. This is known as finding a counterexample.

    PROBLEM 8 EXAMPLE 8 Show that cot²θ + cos²θ = cot²θ cos²θ is not an identity by
    finding a counterexample.
    SOLUTION Because cot θ is undefined for θ = kπ, where k is any integer, we
    must choose some other value of θ as a counterexample. Using θ = π/4, we find

    cot²(π/4) + cos²(π/4) vs. cot²(π/4) cos²(π/4)

    cot(π/4) = 1, and cos(π/4) = √2/2

    So:

    cot²(π/4) + cos²(π/4) = 1² + (√2/2)² = 1 + (2/4) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2

    cot²(π/4) cos²(π/4) = (1)² * (√2/2)² = 1 * (2/4) = 1/2

    Therefore, cot²θ + cos²θ ≠ cot²θ cos²θ when θ = π/4, so the statement is not
    an identity. a

    Using Technology: Finding Counterexamples

    In the previous Using Technology section, we saw that a graphing calculator
    can be used to determine whether an equation appears to be an identity or not.
    Using this approach with Example 8, we define

    PROBLEM SET

    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY

    For Questions 1 through 6, fill in each blank with the appropriate word.

    1. An identity is a statement that two expressions are for all replacements of the
    variable for which each expression is defined.

    2. To prove, or verify, an identity, we start with one side of the equation and
    transform it until it is identical to the other side of the equation.
    3. To prove an identity, it is usually best to start with the more complex side first.

    4. If nothing else comes to mind, try changing everything in the expression into
    sine and cosine and then simplify.

    5. To investigate if an equation is an identity, graph the left side and the right side separately and see if the two graphs are identical.

    6. To prove that an equation is not an identity, find a value of the variable for which the two expressions do not have the same value.

    Adding —2 to both sides and then dividing both sides by —2 gives us the formula
    we are after:

    This is the first formula in a series of formulas for trigonometric functions of
    the sum or difference of two angles. It must be memorized. Before we derive the
    others, let’s look at some of the ways we can use our first formula.

    NOTE Itisacommon mistake for students to think that

    cos (A + B)=cos A + cos B

    Is this true? The answer is no. Substituting almost any pair of numbers for A and
    B in the formula will yield a false statement. As a counterexample, we can let
    A = 30° and B = 60° in the preceding formula and then simplify each side.

    Prove sin (. + =) — COS X. SOLUTION Applying the formula for cos (A + B), we have
    cos (x + 27) = cos x cos 27 — sin x sin 277
    =cosx:1—sinx:0
    = cos x
    Notice that this is not a new relationship. We already know that if two angles are coterminal, then their cosines are equal—and x + 27 and x are coterminal.
    What we have done here is shown this to be true with a formula instead of the definition of cosine. a

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3 Write cos 3x cos 2x — sin 3x sin 2x as a single cosine.
    Write cos 5x cos x + sin 5x sin x

    the way we applied it in the first two examples.
    cos 3x cos 2x — sin 3x sin 2x = cos (3x + 2x)
    = cos 5x a

    Here is the derivation of the formula for cos (A — B). It involves the formula for
    cos (A + B) and the formulas for even and odd functions.

    cos (A — B) =cos[A + (—B)] Write A — Bas a sum
    = cos A cos(—B)— sin A sin(—B) — Sum formula
    = cos A cos B — sin A (—sin B) Cosine is an even
    function, sine is odd

    = cos Acos B+ sin A sin B

    The only difference in the formulas for the expansion of cos (4 + B) and
    cos (A — B) is the sign between the two terms. Here are both formulas.

    304 CHAPTER 5 Bf Identities and Formulas

    PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4 Show that cos (90° — A) = sin A.
    Show that cos (270° + B) = sin B.
    SOLUTION We will need this formula when we derive the formula for

    sin (A + B).

    cos (90° — A) = cos 90° cos A + sin 90° sin A
    0·cosA+1·sin A
    sin A

    Note that the formula we just derived is not a new formula. The angles 90° — A
    and A are complementary angles, and we already know by the Cofunction Theo-
    rem from Chapter 2 that the sine of an angle is always equal to the cosine of its
    complement. We could also state it this way:

    sin (90° — A) = cos A
    We can use this information to derive the formula for sin (A + B). To under-

    stand this derivation, you must recognize that A + B and 90° — (A + B) are com-
    plementary angles.

    sin (A + B) = cos [90° — (A + B)] The sine of an angle is the
    cosine of its complement
    = cos [90° — A — B] Remove parentheses
    = cos [(90° — A) — B] Regroup within brackets

    Now we expand using the formula for the cosine of a difference.

    = cos (90° — A) cos B + sin (90° — A) sin B
    sin A cos B+ cos A sin B

    This gives us an expansion formula for sin (A + B).

    sin (A + B) = sin A cos B+ cos A sin B

    half-angle formulas and are derived from the double-angle formulas for cos 2.4.
    In Section 5.3, we developed three ways to write the formula for cos 24, two

    of which were

    cos2A = 1-—2sin’ A and cos 2A = 2cos* A - 1
    The choice of the letter we use to denote the angles in these formulas is arbitrary,
    SO we can use x instead of A.

    cos 2x = 1 — 2 sin’ x and cos 2x = 2cos*x — 1

    SECTION 5.4 Bf Half-Angle Formulas 321

    Let us exchange sides in the first formula and solve for sin x.

    1 — 2 sin? x = cos 2x Exchange sides
    —2 sin? x = —1 + cos 2x Add —1 to both sides
    5 1 — cos 2x
    sin“ x = > Divide both sides by —2
    1 — cos 2x
    sn x= > Take the square root of both sides

    Because every value of x can be written as ; of some other number A, we can
    replace x with A/2. This is equivalent to saying 2x = A.

    sin 2 = + 1—cosA

    57. Navigation As we have seen in previous chapters, the great circle distance (in radians) between two points P₁(LT₁, LN₁) and P₂(LT₂, LN₂), whose coordinates are given as latitudes and longitudes, is calculated using the formula

    d = cos⁻¹[(sin(LT₁) sin(LT₂) + cos(LT₁) cos(LT₂) cos(LN₁ − LN₂))]

    NOTE These four product formulas are of use in calculus.

    The reason they are useful is that they indicate how we can convert a product into a sum. In calculus, it is sometimes much easier to work with sums of trigonometric functions than it is to work with products.

    cos A sin B = sin (A + B) — sin (A — B)] (2)

    cos A cos B = [cos (A + B) + cos (A — B)] (3)

    sin A sin B = [cos (A — B)—cos(A + B)] (4)

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Verify product formula (3) for A = 30° and B = 120°.

    SOLUTION Product formula (2) is appropriate for an expression of the form

    cos A sin B. If we substitute A = 5x and B = 3x, then

    = 10 [sin 8x — sin 2x]

    = 5(sin 8x — sin 2x)

    **To prove**
    tan x + cos x = sin x (sec x + cot x),
    we can multiply through by sin x
    on the right side and then change
    to sines and cosines.

    sin x (sec x + cot x)

    = sin x sec x + sin x cot x

    = sin x * (1/cos x) + sin x * (cos x / sin x)

    = (sin x / cos x) + cos x

    = tan x + cos x

    **To find the exact value for**
    cos 75°, we write 75° as 45° + 30°
    and then apply the formula for
    cos (A + B).

    cos 75° = cos (45° + 30°)

    = cos 45° cos 30° - sin 45° sin 30°

    = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2)

    = √6/4 - √2/4

    = (√6 - √2)/4

    **If sin A = 2 with 4 in QII, then**
    cos 2A = 1 - 2 sin² A

    340 CHAPTER 5 Bl Identities and Formulas

    In Example 4 of Section 4.6, we showed how we could graph the function
    y = sin x + cos x by adding y-coordinates. We observed that the resulting graph
    appeared to have the shape of a sine function.

    ®) Ei) Graph y = sin x + cos x with your graphing calculator. Use your calculator to
    find the coordinates of a high point on the graph and a low point (you can use
    your key, or your calculator may have special commands for finding
    maximum and minimum points). Find an equation of the graph in the form
    y =A sin (Bx + C) by using these coordinates to estimate values of A, B,
    and C. Check your equation by graphing it. The two graphs should be nearly
    identical.

    To find an equation for this graph using an algebraic method, we need to find a way
    to write y = asin Bx + bcos Bx as y = A sin (Bx + C). That is, we would like to
    find values of A, B, and C so that the equation

    asin Bx + bcos Bx = A sin (Bx + C)

    is an identity. Because the value of B will be the same for both functions, we only
    need to find values for A and C.

    PM First, we will assume a sin Bx + b cos Bx = A sin (Bx + C). Express the right
    side of this equation as a sum using a sum identity. In order for the resulting
    equation to be an identity, explain why it must be true that 4 cos C = a and
    Asin C = b.

    E] Solve for A in terms of a and b using the Pythagorean identity
    sin? C + cos?’ C= 1
    Assume A is positive. To find the value of C, we simply need to find an angle

    Ptolemy

    Many of the identities presented in this chapter were known to the Greek astron-
    omer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (A.p. 85-165). In his work Almagest,
    he was able to find the sines of sums and differences of angles and half-angles.

    Research Ptolemy and his use of chords and the chord function. What was
    the notation that he used, and how is it different from modern notation? What
    other significant contributions did Ptolemy make to science? Write a paragraph

    Solve a simple trigonometric equation.
    Use factoring to solve a trigonometric equation.
    Use the quadratic formula to solve a trigonometric equation.

    Solve a trigonometric equation involving a horizontal translation.

    The solution set for an equation is the set of all numbers that, when used in place of
    the variable, make the equation a true statement. In the previous chapter we worked
    with identities, which are equations that are true for every replacement of the vari-
    able for which it is defined. Most equations, however, are not identities. They are only
    true for certain values of the variable. For example, the solution set for the equation
    4x° — 9 = Ois {—3/2, 3/2} because these are the only two numbers that, when used in
    place of x, turn the equation into a true statement. We call these types of equations
    conditional equations.

    In algebra, the first kind of equations you learned to solve were linear (or first-
    degree) equations in one variable. Solving these equations was accomplished by
    applying two important properties: the addition property of equality and the mul-
    tiplication property of equality. These two properties were stated as follows:

    Addition Property of Equality

    For any three algebraic expressions A, B, and C
    If A=B
    then A+C=B+C

    In words: Adding the same quantity to both sides of an equation will not
    change the solution set.

    Multiplication Property of Equality

    For any three algebraic expressions A, B, and C, with C ≠ 0,
    If A=B
    then AC = BC

    In words: Multiplying both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity
    will not change the solution set.

    Here is an example that shows how we use these two properties to solve a
    linear equation in one variable.

    From Figure | we can see that if we are looking for radian solutions between 0
    and 277, then x is either 77/6 or 57/6. On the other hand, if we want degree solu-
    tions between 0° and 360°, then our solutions will be 30° and 150°. Without the
    aid of Figure 1, we would reason that, because sin x = 5, the reference angle for
    x is 30°. Then, because ; is a positive number and the sine function is positive in
    QI and QII, x must be 30° or 150° (Figure 2).

    SECTION 6.1 ff Solving Trigonometric Equations 345

    Because the sine function is periodic with period 27 (or 360°), any angle
    coterminal with x = 77/6 (or 30°) or x = 57/6 (or 150°) will also be a solution of
    the equation. For any integer k, adding 2477 (or 360°) will result in a coterminal
    angle. Therefore, we can represent all solutions to the equation as follows.

    A — 25° = 135° + 360° or A — 25° = 225° + 360°
    for any integer k. We can now solve for A by adding 25° to both sides.
    A — 25° = 135° + 360° or A — 25° = 225° + 360°
    A = 160° + 360° A = 250° + 360° a

    ing the expression on each side of the equation as a function. The solutions
    to the equation will be the x-values of the points where the two graphs

    following window settings:

    The solutions of the equation will be the zeros (x-intercepts) of this function.
    From the graph, we see that there are only two solutions. Use the feature of
    your calculator that will allow you to evaluate the function from the graph, and
    verify that x = 7/2 and x = 7 are x-intercepts (Figure 2). It is clear from the

    The first step in solving the equation $2 \cos x - 1 = \sec x$ is to rewrite $\sec x$ in terms of cosine, since $\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}$. This gives the equation $2 \cos x - 1 = \frac{1}{\cos x}$. Next, multiply both sides of the equation by $\cos x$ to eliminate the denominator and simplify the equation. This results in $ (2 \cos x - 1) \cos x = 1 $. Expanding this equation gives $2 \cos^2 x - \cos x = 1$. Then, rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation in terms of $\cos x$: $2 \cos^2 x - \cos x - 1 = 0$. Finally, solve this quadratic equation for $\cos x$ using factoring or the quadratic formula.

    Learning Objectives

    Solve a simple trigonometric equation involving a multiple angle.

    Use an identity to solve a trigonometric equation involving a multiple
    angle.

    Solve a trigonometric equation involving a multiple angle by factoring
    or the quadratic formula.

    Solve a real-life problem using a trigonometric equation.

    In this section, we will consider equations that contain multiple angles. We will use
    most of the same techniques to solve these equations that we have used in the past.
    We have to be careful at the last step, however, when our equations contain mul-
    tiple angles. Here is an example.

    if 0° = @ < 360°.
    SOLUTION The equation cannot be simplified further. The reference angle is
    given by cos ! (V3/2) = 30°. Because the cosine function is positive in QI or
    QIV, the expression 20 must be coterminal with 30° or 330°. Therefore, for any
    integer k, all solutions will have the form

    20 = 30° + 360% or 20 = 330° + 360°

    2 2 2 2
    6 = 15° + 180°% 0 = 165° + 180°k

    Because we were asked only for values of 6 between 0° and 360°, we substitute
    the appropriate integers in place of k.

    If k=0 If k=1
    then 6 = 15° + 180°(0) = 15° then 6 = 15° + 180°(1) = 195°
    or 6 = 165° + 180°(0) = 165° or 6 = 165° + 180°(1) = 345°

    For all other values of k, 6 will fall outside the given interval. a

    Because the period of y = cos 2x is 360°/2 = 180°, we see that two cycles of the
    cosine function occur between 0° and 360° (Figure 1). Within the first cycle there
    are two intersection points. Using the appropriate command, we find that the
    x-coordinates of these points are x = 15° and x = 165° (Figure 2).

    SOLUTION First we find all values of 3x in the interval 0 = 3x < 7 that satisfy
    tan 3x = 1, and then we add on multiples of 7 because the period of the tan-
    gent function is 7. After that, we simply divide by 3 to solve for x.

    The sine function is zero for 0° or 180°. Therefore, the expression 20 must be
    coterminal with either of these. For any integer &, we can represent all solutions
    more concisely as
    20 = 0° + 180°n
    20 = 180°n
    6 = 90°n
    We were asked only for values of 6 in the interval 0° ≤ 6 < 360°. Choosing k = 0,
    1, 2, or 3 we have 6 = 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°. For all other values of k, 6 will fall
    outside the given interval.

    SECTION 6.3 Bf Trigonometric Equations Involving Multiple Angles 365

    Because our first step involved squaring both sides of the equation, we must
    check all the possible solutions to see if they satisfy the original equation. Doing
    SO gives us solutions 8 = 90° and 6 = 180°. The other two values are extraneous,
    as can be seen in Figure 6.

    Use parametric equations as a model in a real-life problem.

    Up to this point we have had a number of encounters with the Ferris wheel problem. In Sections 3.5 and 4.5, we were able to find a function that gives the rider’s height above the ground at any time t during the ride. A third way to derive this function is with parametric equations, which we will study in this section.

    Let’s begin with a model of the giant wheel built by George Ferris. The diameter of this wheel is 250 feet, and the bottom of the wheel sits 14 feet above the ground. We can superimpose a coordinate system on our model, so that the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the wheel. This is shown in

    The graph of the plane curve is shown in Figure 3. We have labeled each point with its associated value of the parameter θ. As expected, the curve is a circle. More importantly, notice in which direction the circle is traversed as θ increases from 0 to 2π. We say that the plane curve is oriented in a counterclockwise direction and indicate the orientation using small arrows.

    To make the circle look right, graph the equations using the zoom-square command. The result is shown in Figure 5.
    To see the orientation, we can trace the circle and follow the cursor as the parameter θ increases (Figure 6). We can also evaluate the equations for any given value of the parameter. Figure 7 shows how this might look for θ = 3π/4.

    Making Our Models More Realistic

    Let’s go back to our Ferris wheel model from the beginning of this section.
    Our wheel has a radius of 125 feet and sits 14 feet above the ground. One trip
    around the wheel takes 20 minutes. Figure 11 shows this model with a coor-
    dinate system superimposed with its origin at the center of the wheel. Also
    shown are the parametric equations that describe the path of someone riding
    the wheel.

    Our model would be more realistic if the x-axis was along the ground, below
    the wheel. We can accomplish this very easily by moving everything up 139 feet
    (125 feet for the radius and another 14 feet for the wheel’s height above the ground).
    Figure 12 shows our new graph next to a new set of parametric equations.

    Neglecting the resistance of air, the only force acting on the human cannon-
    ball is the force of gravity, which is an acceleration of 32 feet per second squared
    toward the earth. Because the cannonball’s horizontal speed is constant, we can
    find the distance traveled after t seconds by simply multiplying speed and time.
    Therefore, the distance traveled horizontally after t seconds is

    x = (|V| cos 0)t

    To find the cannonball’s vertical distance from the cannon after t seconds, we use
    a formula from physics:

    **EXTENDING THE CONCEPTS**

    **Q 47.** For an NBA regulation basketball court, the hoop is 10 feet above the ground, and the horizontal distance from the center of the hoop to the free throw line is 13.75 feet. In making a free throw, the player releases the ball approximately 8.5 feet directly above the free throw line (see Figure 20). The ball reaches the center of the hoop 0.98 second later. The path of the ball can be described by the parametric equations

    $$
    x = (|Vo| \cos \theta)t
    $$
    $$
    y = (|Vo| \sin \theta)t - 16t^2 + 8.5
    $$

    where $ x $ is the distance (in feet) traveled horizontally and $ y $ is the height (in feet) of the ball above the ground $ t $ seconds after the ball is released. Find the initial speed $ |Vo| $ and the angle $ \theta $ at which the basketball is thrown.

    The aerial tram in Rio de Janeiro, which carries sightseers up to the top of Sug-
    arloaf Mountain, provides a good example of forces acting in equilibrium. The
    force representing the weight of the gondola and its passengers must be with-
    stood by the tension in the cable, which can be represented by a pair of forces
    pointing in the same direction as the cable on either side (Figure 1). Because
    these three forces are in static equilibrium, they must form a triangle as shown
    in Figure 2.

    SECTION 7.1 & The Law of Sines 391

    Learning Objectives

    Use the law of sines to find a missing side in an oblique triangle.
    Solve a real-life problem using the law of sines.

    Use vectors and the law of sines to solve an applied problem.

    C In this chapter we return to the matter of solving triangles. Up to this point, the tri-
    angles we have worked with have always been right triangles. We will now look at situ-
    ations that involve oblique triangles, which are triangles that do not have a right angle.

    It is important to remember that our triangle definitions of the six trigonomet-
    ric functions (Definition I) involve ratios of the sides of a right triangle only. These
    definitions do not apply to oblique triangles. For example, the triangle shown in
    A c B. Figure 1 is oblique, so we cannot say that sin A = a/c. In this chapter we will see how
    the sine and cosine functions can be used properly to solve these kinds of triangles.

    Two Angles and One Side

    In our first example, we are given two angles and the side opposite one of them.
    (You may recall that in geometry these were the parts we needed equal in two tri-
    angles in order to prove them congruent using the AAS Theorem.)

    EXAMPLE 1 In triangle ABC, A = 30°, B = 70°, and a = 8.0 cm. Find the
    length of side c.

    SOLUTION We begin by drawing a picture of triangle ABC (it does not have to
    be accurate) and labeling it with the information we have been given (Figure 5).

    A c B
    Figure 5

    When we use the law of sines, we must have one of the ratios given to us. In this
    case, since we are given a and A, we have the ratio a/sin A. To solve for c, we need
    to first find angle C. The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180°, so we have
    C= 180° — (A + B)
    = 180° — (30° + 70°)
    = 80°
    To find side c, we use the following two ratios given in the law of sines.

    c/c = a/sin A

Justify your reasoning using the Law of Sines and the triangle angle sum theorem.\n- **Scenario 2**: If side a were 16.0 cm instead of 8.0 cm, what would be the new length of side c? Explain how scaling the side affects the proportionality in the Law of Sines.\n- **Scenario 3**: Suppose angle A were 150°, and angles B and C were adjusted accordingly.

    NOTE 1 The equal sign in the third line should actually be replaced by the approximately equal to symbol, ~, because the decimal 0.9848 is an approximation to sin 80°.
    (Remember, most values of the trigonometric functions are irrational numbers.) In
    this chapter, we will use an equal sign in the solutions to all of our examples, even when
    the ~ symbol would be more appropriate, to make the examples a little easier to follow.

    of the trigonometric functions to four significant digits simply to avoid cluttering
    the page with long decimal numbers. This does not mean that you should stop
    halfway through a problem and round the values of trigonometric functions to
    four significant digits before continuing.

    them (ASA) and are asked to find all the missing parts.

    The law of sines, along with some fancy electronic equipment, was used to
    obtain the results of some of the field events in one of the past Olympic Games.
    For instance, Figure 7 is a diagram of a shot put ring. The shot is tossed (put)
    from the left and lands at A. A small electronic device is then placed at A (there
    is usually a dent in the ground where the shot lands, so it is easy to find where
    to place the device). The device at A sends a signal to a booth in the stands that
    gives the measures of angles A and B. The distance a is found ahead of time.
    With this information, we have the case AAS. To find the distance x, the law of
    sines is used.

    With the specific case of objects in flight, we use the term airspeed for the
    speed of the object relative to the air and ground speed for the speed of the object
    relative to the ground. The airspeed is the magnitude of the vector representing
    the velocity of the object in the direction of the heading, and the ground speed is
    the magnitude of the vector representing the velocity of the object in the direction
    of the true course. Likewise, the wind speed is the magnitude of the vector repre-
    senting the wind. As illustrated in Figure 7, the ground speed/true course vector
    is the resultant vector found by adding the airspeed/heading vector and the wind

    Using the Law of Sines

    EXAMPLE 1 Find angle B in triangle ABC if a = 2, b = 6, and A = 30°.
    SOLUTION Applying the law of sines we have

    sin B / sin A = b / a
    b sin A
    sin B = ---
    a
    6 sin 30°
    sin B = ---
    2
    ~15 Figure 1

    Because sin B can never be larger than 1, no triangle exists for which a = 2,
    b = 6, and A = 30°. (You may recall from geometry that there was no congruence
    theorem SSA.) Figure 1 illustrates what went wrong here. No matter how
    we orient side a, we cannot complete a triangle.

    When we are given two sides and an angle opposite one of them (SSA), we
    have several possibilities for the triangle or triangles that result. As was the case in
    Example 1, one of the possibilities is that no triangle will fit the given information.
    If side a in Example 1 had been equal in length to the altitude drawn from vertex

    C, then we would have had a right triangle that fit the given information, as shown

    in Figure 2. If side a had been longer than this altitude but shorter than side b,
    we would have had two triangles that fit the given information, triangle AB’C and
    triangle ABC as illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Notice that the two possibili-
    ties for side a in Figure 3 create an isosceles triangle B’CB.

    Figure 4

    If side a in triangle ABC of Example 1 had been longer than side b, we would
    have had only one triangle that fit the given information, as shown in Figure 5.

    **PROBLEM 4 EXAMPLE 4**
    Find angle B in triangle ABC if a = 2, b = 6, and A = 30°.

    In triangle ABC, if A = 36°, a = 5.0, and b = 14, find angle B.

    **SOLUTION**
    First we apply the law of cosines to find the missing side.
    $$
    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
    $$
    $$
    2^2 = 6^2 + c^2 - 2 \cdot 6 \cdot c \cos 30°
    $$
    $$
    4 = 36 + c^2 - 12c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
    $$
    $$
    4 = 36 + c^2 - 6\sqrt{3}c
    $$
    $$
    0 = c^2 - 6\sqrt{3}c + 32
    $$

    Using the quadratic formula to solve this quadratic equation, we obtain:
    $$
    c = \frac{-(-6\sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{(-6\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(32)}}{2(1)}
    $$
    $$
    c = \frac{6\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{-20}}{2}
    $$

    Because of the negative number in the square root, c is not a real number.
    Therefore no triangle is possible.

    **PROBLEM 5 EXAMPLE 5**
    Find the missing parts in triangle ABC if a = 54cm, b = 62 cm, and A = 40°.

    Find the missing parts of triangle ABC if A = 44°, a = 55 cm, and b = 66 cm.

    **SOLUTION**
    Once again, we begin by using the law of cosines to find side c.

    $$
    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
    $$
    $$
    54 = 62^2 + c^2 - 2 \cdot 62 \cdot c \cos 40°
    $$
    $$
    2916 = 3844 + c^2 - 124c \cdot 0.7660
    $$
    Approximate cos 40°
    $$
    2916 = 3844 + c^2 - 94.984c
    $$
    $$
    0 = c^2 - 94.984c + 928
    $$

    Using the quadratic formula to solve for c, we obtain:
    $$
    c = \frac{-(-94.984) + \sqrt{(-94.984)^2 - 4(1)(928)}}{2(1)}
    $$
    $$
    c = \frac{94.984 + 72.8695}{2}
    $$

    Which gives us c = 11 or c = 84, to two significant digits. Since both of these
    values are positive real numbers, there are two triangles possible. We can use the
    law of cosines again to find either of the remaining two angles.

    The possibilities for the ground with vectors, the resultant of which will be the ground speed and true course of
    speed of the plane? the plane. First, measure an angle of 52.5° from north (clockwise) and draw a
    vector in that direction with magnitude 170 to represent the heading and air-
    speed. Then draw a second vector at an angle of 64.1° from north with unknown
    magnitude to represent the true course and ground speed. Because this second
    vector must be the resultant, the wind velocity will be some vector originating at
    the tip of the first vector and ending at the tip of the second vector, and having
    a length of 40.0. Figure 10 illustrates the situation. From Figure 10, we see that

    6 = 64.1° — 52.5° = 11.6°

    First we use the law of sines to find angle a.

    sin a = (sin 11.6°) * (170 / 40.0)

    sin a = (sin 11.6°) * 4.25

    sin a = 0.8546

    Because sin a is positive in quadrants I and II, we have two possible values for a.
    a = sin ! (0.8546) = 58.7° and a’ = 180° — 58.7°
    = 121.3°

    We see there are two different triangles that can be formed with the three vec-
    tors. Figure 11 shows both of them. There are two values for a, so there are two
    values for B.

    B = 180° — (11.6° + 58.7°) and B’ = 180° — (11.6° + 121.3°)
    B = 109.7° and B’ = 47.1°

    Now we can use the law of sines again to find the ground speed.
    From Figure 11:

    40 / sin 109.7° = x / sin 11.6°
    and
    40 / sin 47.1° = x’ / sin 11.6°

    Solving for x and x’:

    x = (40 * sin 109.7°) / sin 11.6°
    x’ = (40 * sin 47.1°) / sin 11.6°

    x = 187 mi/hr
    x’ = 146 mi/hr

    424  CHAPTER7 B—l Triangles

    In this section, we will derive three formulas for the area S of a triangle. We will
    start by deriving the formula used to find the area of a triangle for which two sides
    and the included angle are given.

    Two Sides and the Included Angle

    To derive our first formula, we begin with the general formula for the area of a
    triangle:

    1
    S= ½ (base)(height)

    The base of triangle ABC in Figure 1 is c and the height is h. So the formula for
    S becomes, in this case,

    Figure 1

    Suppose that, for triangle ABC, we are given the lengths of sides b and c and the
    measure of angle A. Then we can write sin A as
    h = b sin A
    or, by solving for h,
    h=bsin A
    Substituting this expression for h into the formula
    1
    S= ½ (base)(height)
    we have
    1
    S= ½ (c)(b sin A)

    Applying the same kind of reasoning to the heights drawn from A and B, we also
    have the following.

    Area of a Triangle (SAS)

    S = ½ ab sin C = ½ bc sin A = ½ ac sin B

    Each of these three formulas indicates that to find the area of a triangle for which
    we are given two sides and the angle included between them, we multiply half the
    product of the two sides by the sine of the angle included between them.

    Three Sides

    The last area formula we will discuss is called Heron’s formula. It is used to find the
    area of a triangle in which all three sides are known. Heron’s formula is attributed
    to Heron of Alexandria, a geometer of the first century A.D. Heron proved his
    formula in Book I of his work, Metrica.

    Area of a Triangle (SSS)

    Given a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, the semiperimeter of the
    triangle is defined as

    and the area of the triangle is given by

    SECTION 7.5 Vectors: An Algebraic Approach 431

    vector corresponds to the point (a, b), then the coordinates of this point provide a
    unique representation for the vector. That is, the point (a, b) determines both the
    length of the vector and its direction, as shown in Figure 1.

    Figure 1

    To avoid confusion between the point (a, b) and the vector, which is the ray
    extending from the origin to the point, we will denote the vector as V = (a, b). We
    refer to this notation as component form. The x-coordinate, a, is called the horizon-
    tal component of V, and the y-coordinate, b, is called the vertical component of V.

    Magnitude

    As you know from Section 2.5, the magnitude of a vector is its length. Referring to
    Figure 1, we can find the magnitude of the vector V = (a, b) using the Pythagorean

    Theorem:
    |V| = √(a² + b²)

    magnitude.

    Draw the vector (5, —2) in standard position and find its
    magnitude. SOLUTION We draw the vector by sketching an arrow from the origin to the point
    (3, —4), as shown in Figure 2. To find the magnitude of V, we find the positive
    square root of the sum of the squares of the horizontal and vertical components.

    432. CHAPTER 7 [fl Triangles

    Addition and Subtraction with Algebraic Vectors

    Adding and subtracting vectors written in component form is simply a matter of
    adding (or subtracting) the horizontal components and adding (or subtracting)
    the vertical components. Figure 3 shows the vector sum of vectors U = (6, 2) and
    V = (-3, 5).

    Figure 3

    By simply counting squares on the grid you can convince yourself that the
    sum can be obtained by adding horizontal components and adding vertical com-
    ponents. That is,

    U + V = (6, 2) + (-3, 5)
    = (6 + (-3), 2 + 5)
    = (3, 7)

    Figure 4 shows the difference of vectors U and V. As the diagram in Figure 4
    indicates, subtraction of algebraic vectors can be accomplished by subtracting
    corresponding components. That is,

    U - V = (6, 2) - (-3, 5)

    = (6 - (-3), 2 - 5)

    SECTION 7.5 Vectors: An Algebraic Approach 433

    Scalar Multiplication
    To multiply a vector in component form by a scalar (real number) we multiply
    each component of the vector by the scalar. Figure 5 shows the vector V = (2, 3)
    and the vector 3V. As you can see,
    3V = 3(2, 3)
    = (3*2, 3*3)
    = (6, 9)
    Notice that the vector 3V has the same direction as V but is three times as long.
    Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar will preserve the direction of the vector
    but change its length (assuming the scalar is not equal to 1). Multiplying a vector
    by a negative scalar will result in a vector with the opposite direction and different
    length (assuming the scalar is not equal to —1).
    Figure 5

    PROBLEM 2
    EXAMPLE 2 If U = (5, —3) and V = (-6, 4), find
    a. U+V b. 4U — 5V

    SOLUTION
    a. U+ V =(5, —3) + (-6, 4)
    = (5-6, -3 + 4)
    = (-1, 1)

    b. 4U — 5V = 4(5, —3) — 5(-6, 4)
    = (20, -12) + (30, -20)
    = (20 + 30, -12 — 20)
    = (50, -32)

    Component Vector Form

    Another way to represent a vector algebraically is to express the vector as the sum of a
    horizontal vector and a vertical vector. As we mentioned in Section 2.5, any vector V
    can be written in terms of its horizontal and vertical component vectors, V_h and
    V_v, respectively. To do this, we need to define two special vectors.

    Definition = Unit Vectors

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Write the vector V = (3, 4) in terms of the unit vectors i and j.
    Write V = (5, 12) in terms
    of iand j. SOLUTION From the origin, we must go three units in the positive x-direction,

    and then four units in the positive y-direction, to locate the terminal point of V at

    (3, 4). Because i is a vector of length 1 in the positive x-direction, 3i will be a vec-

    tor of length 3 in that same direction. Likewise, 4j will be a vector of length 4 in

    the positive y-direction. As shown in Figure 7, V is the sum of vectors 3i and 4j.
    Therefore, we can write V in terms of the unit vectors i and j as

    V = 3i + 4j

    Figure 10

    y SOLUTION When we solved this problem in Section 2.5, we noted that there
    A are three forces acting on Danny (and the swing), which we have labeled W,
    H, and T. Recall that the vector W is due to the force of gravity: its magnitude
    30 T is |W| = 42 Ib, and its direction is straight down. The vector H represents the
    60° ay force with which Stacey is pulling Danny horizontally, and T is the force acting
    ~< > >» x on Danny in the direction of the ropes.

    Ww If we place the origin of a coordinate system on the point at which the
    tails of the three vectors intersect, we can write each vector in terms of its
    magnitude and the unit vectors i and j. The coordinate system is shown in
    Figure 11. The direction along which H acts is in the positive x direction, so
    we can write

    vy

    v

    Figure 11
    H = |H|i

    Likewise, the weight vector W is straight down, so we can write
    W= -|W|j= ~42j

    Using right triangle trigonometry, we write T in terms of its horizontal and
    vertical components:

    T = —|T| cos 60° + |T|sin 60°

    Because Danny and the swing are at rest, we have static equilibrium. There-
    fore, the sum of the vectors is the zero vector.

    T+H+W=0
    —|T| cos 60° + |T| sin 60° + |H|i + (—42j) = 0

    Collecting all the i components and all the j components together, we have

    (—|T| cos 60° + |H|)i + (|T| sin 60° — 42)j = 0

    Finding the Angle Between Two Vectors

    One application of the dot product is finding the angle between two vectors. To
    do this, we will use an alternate form of the dot product, shown in the following
    theorem.

    Theorem 7.1

    The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes
    multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. That is, when @ is the angle
    between two nonzero vectors U and V, then

    U*V=|U||V| cos 6 4

    The proof of this theorem is derived from the law of cosines and is left as an
    exercise.

    When we are given two vectors and asked to find the angle between them, we
    rewrite the formula in Theorem 7.1 by dividing each side by | U||V|. The result is

    cos § =
    1U||v|

    This formula is equivalent to our original formula, but is easier to work with when
    finding the angle between two nonzero vectors.

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Vector Operations**\n\nGiven vectors U = (2, -4) and V = (-3, 5), perform the following operations and explain your reasoning:\n- **Part A**: Compute the dot product U*V using the standard definition (U1V1 + U2V2).\n- **Part B**: Use Theorem 7.1 to find the angle between vectors U and V.

Explain how the angle relates to the dot product''s value.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the theorem''s formula and demonstrate an understanding of how the angle is determined by the relationship between the vectors'' magnitudes and dot product.'

    Perpendicular Vectors

    If two nonzero vectors are perpendicular, then the angle between them is 90°. We
    sometimes refer to perpendicular vectors as being orthogonal. Because the cosine
    of 90° is always 0, the dot product of two perpendicular vectors must also be 0.
    This fact gives rise to the following theorem.

    Theorem 7.2

    If U and V are two nonzero vectors, then
    UeV=0<5U1LV

    In Words: Two nonzero vectors are perpendicular, or orthogonal, if and only if
    their dot product is 0.

    In Figure 2 we let V represent the component of F that is oriented in the same
    direction as d, since only the amount of the force in the direction of movement
    can be used in calculating work. V is sometimes called the projection of F onto d.
    We can find the magnitude of V using right triangle trigonometry:

    |V| = |F| cos 6

    Because |d| represents the distance the object is moved, the work performed by
    the force is

    Work = |V||d|
    = (|F|cos 6) - |d|
    = |F||d| cos 6

    SOLUTION We solved this problem previously in Example 6 of Section 2.5 by
    finding the magnitude of the horizontal vector component of the force. Now we
    will see how this same problem can be solved using a dot product.

    To begin, we express the force applied to the package and its resulting
    motion in terms of vectors. We can assume the package moves horizontally to
    the right as shown in Figure 4.

    Force F = 64 cos (—35°) + 64 sin (—35°)
    = 52.431 — 36.71j

    VECTOR COMPONENT FORM [7.5]

    If V is a vector in standard position, and θ is the angle that V makes with the positive x-axis, then the vector component form for V is given by

    V = |V|cos θi + |V|sin θj

    DOT PRODUCT [7.6]

    The dot product of two vectors U = ai + bj and V = ci + dj is written U · V and
    is defined as follows:

    In 1545, Jerome Cardan (Girolamo Cardano) published the mathematical work
    Ars Magna, the title page of which is shown in Figure 1. The title translates to The
    Great Art of Solving Algebraic Equations. In this book Cardan posed a number of
    problems, such as solving certain cubic and quartic equations.

    In our present-day notation, many of the problems posed by Cardan can be
    solved with some simple algebra, but the solutions require taking square roots
    of negative numbers. Square roots of negative numbers are handled with the
    complex number system, which had not been developed when Cardan wrote his
    book. The foundation of the complex number system is contained in this chapter,
    along with the very interesting and useful connection between complex numbers
    and trigonometric functions.

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Complex Number Concepts**\n\nUsing the information provided in the text, explain how Cardan''s problem can be solved using complex numbers.\n- **Step 1**: Translate the problem into a quadratic equation.\n- **Step 2**: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.\n- **Step 3**: Interpret the solutions in the context of complex numbers.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must demonstrate an understanding of how complex numbers resolve what appears to be an impossible problem, and you must reference the text''s mention of the complex number system''s foundation.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Imaginary Numbers**\n\nSimplify the expression $ i^{12} $ using the properties of imaginary numbers.\n- **Step 1**: Recognize the cyclical pattern of powers of i (i^1 = i, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, i^4 = 1, and so on).\n- **Step 2**: Divide the exponent 12 by 4 to find the remainder.\n- **Step 3**: Use the remainder to determine the simplified form of $ i^{12} $.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show the correct simplified form and explain the reasoning based on the cyclical nature of powers of i as described in the text.

- prompt: |-
    Using our present-day notation, this problem can be solved with a system of
    equations:
    x+y=10
    xy = 40
    Solving the first equation for y, we have y = 10 — x. Substituting this value of y
    into the second equation, we have
    x(10 — x) = 40
    The equation is quadratic. We write it in standard form and apply the quadratic
    formula.
    0 = x² — 10x + 40
    10 ± √(100 — 4(1)(40))
    2
    10 ± √(100 — 160)
    2
    10 ± √(—60)
    2
    10 ± 2√(—15)
    2
    = 5 ± √(—15)

    This is as far as Cardan could take the problem because he did not know what to do
    with the square root of a negative number. We handle this situation by using com-
    plex numbers. Our work with complex numbers is based on the following definition.

    Definition = Imaginary Unit

    The number i, called the imaginary unit, is such that i² = —1. (That is, i is the
    number whose square is — 1.) y

    The number i is not a real number. We can use it to write square roots of
    negative numbers without a negative sign. To do so, we reason that if a > 0, then

    NOTE We usually place / after the
    coefficient, but in front of the radical, C. -—17 =iV 17 |

    so that we avoid inadvertently
    writing the / inside the radical.

    To simplify expressions that contain square roots of negative numbers by
    using the properties of radicals developed in algebra, it is necessary to write each
    square root in terms of i before applying the properties of radicals. For example,

    this is correct) WV—4V—9 = (iV4)(iV9) = (21)(3i) = 677 = —6
    this is incorrect: V—4V—9 = V—4(—9) = V36 = 6

    Remember, the properties of radicals you developed in algebra hold only for expres-
    sions in which the numbers under the radical sign are nonnegative. When the radi-
    cals contain negative numbers, you must first write each radical in terms of i and
    then simplify.

    Next, we use i to write a definition for complex numbers.

    Definition = Complex Number a

    A complex number is any number that can be written in the form

    where a and b are real numbers and i? = —1. The forma + Dis called standard
    form for complex numbers. The number a is called the real part of the com-
    plex number. The number b is called the imaginary part of the complex num-
    ber. If b = 0, then a + bi = a, which is a real number. If a = 0 and b # 0, then
    a + bi = bi, which is called an imaginary number.

    Because i² = 1, i⁴ will simplify to i and we will begin repeating the sequence
    i, -1, -i, 1 as we increase our exponent by one each time.

    P = i⁴ = i
    h = i⁵ - P = 1(-1) = -1
    (i = i⁶ - P = 1(-i) = -i

    BP = i⁷ - f = 10) = 1

    We can simplify higher powers of i by writing them in terms of i² since i² is always 1.

    Multiplication and Division with Complex Numbers

    Definition: Multiplication

    If z₁ = a + bi and z₂ = a + bi are complex numbers, then their product is
    defined as follows:
    = (aa) — (bb)(byby) + (ayby + anb,)i 4

    This formula is simply a result of binomial multiplication and is much less com-

    EXAMPLE 6 Multiply (3 — 4i)(2 — 5i).
    SOLUTION Multiplying as if these were two binomials, we have
    (3 — 4i)(2 — 5i) = 3*2 — 3*5i — 4i*2 + 4i*5i
    = 6 — 15i — 8i + 20i²
    = 6 — 23i + 20i²
    Now, because i² = -1, we can simplify further.
    = 6 — 23i + 20(-1)
    = 6 — 23i — 20
    = -14 — 23i

    EXAMPLE 7 Multiply (4 — 5i)(4 + 5i).

    SOLUTION This product has the form (a — b)(a + b), which we know results in
    the difference of two squares, a² — b².

    (4 — 5i)(4 + 5i) = 4² — (5i)²
    = 16 — 25i²
    = 16 — 25(-1)
    = 16 + 25
    = 41 a

    The product of the two complex numbers 4 — 5i and 4 + 5i is the real number 41.
    This fact is very useful and leads to the following definition.

    Definition: Complex Conjugates

    The complex numbers a + bi and a — bi are called complex conjugates. Their
    product is the real number a² + b². Here’s why:

    (a + bi)(a — bi) = a² — (bi)²
    = a² — b²i²
    = a² — b²(-1)
    = a² + b²

    The fact that the product of two complex conjugates is a real number is the key to
    division with complex numbers.

    SECTION 8.2 Bf Trigonometric Form for Complex Numbers 467

    Definition = Argument

    The argument of the complex number z = x + yi, denoted arg(z), is the small-
    est positive angle 6 from the positive real axis to the graph of z. y

    Figure 4 illustrates the relationships between the complex number z = x + yi,
    its graph, and the modulus r and argument 6 of z. From Figure 4 we see that

    sin @ = — or

    We can use this information to write z in terms of r and @.

    Z=x+yl

    rcos @ + (r sin 0)i
    rcos@ + risin @
    r (cos 6 + isin 6)

    This last expression is called the trigonometric form for z, which can be abbre-
    viated as r cis 9. The formal definition follows.

    Definition = Trigonometric Form

    If z =x + yiis a complex number in standard form, then the trigonometric
    form for z is given by

    z=r(cos@ + isin@) =rcis@
    where r is the modulus of z and @ is the argument of z.

    We can convert back and forth between standard form and trigonometric
    form by using the relationships that follow:

    For z=x+yi=r(cos@+ isin 8) =rcisé
    r=√(x²+y²) and @ is such that

    474 CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates

    PROBLEM 1 EXAMPLE 1 Find the product of 3 cis 40° and 5 cis 10°.
    Multiply 4 cis 20° and 3 cis 55°.
    SOLUTION Applying the formula from our theorem on products, we have
    (3 cis 40°)(5 cis 10°) = 3 * 5 cis (40° + 10°)
    = 15 cis 50° a
    NN“
    PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2. Find the product of z1 = 1 + i√3 and z2 = −√3 + i in standard form, and then write z1 and z2 in trigonometric form and find their product again.

    SOLUTION Leaving each complex number in standard form and multiplying we have

    z1*z2 = (1 + i√3)(−√3 + i)
    = −√3*1 + i*1 − √3*i√3 + i^2*√3
    = −√3 − 2i + i^2√3
    = −√3 − 2i − √3
    = −2√3 − 2i

    Changing z1 and z2 to trigonometric form and multiplying looks like this:

    z1 = 1 + i√3 = 2(cos 60° + i sin 60°)

    z2 = −√3 + i = 2(cos 150° + i sin 150°)

    z1*z2 = [2(cos 60° + i sin 60°)][2(cos 150° + i sin 150°)]
    = 4(cos 210° + i sin 210°)

    To compare our two products, we convert our product in trigonometric form to

    standard form.
    4(cos 210° + i sin 210°) = 4*(−√3/2 − i*1/2)
    = −2√3 − 2i

    As you can see, both methods of multiplying complex numbers produce the
    same result. a

    PROBLEM 6
    Divide 40 cis 55° by 5 cis 25°.

    PROBLEM 7

    Find the quotient when 47 is
    divided by 1 + i√3 in both
    standard form and trigonometric
    form.

    SECTION 8.3 Bf Products and Quotients in Trigonometric Form

    Now we can use de Moivre’s Theorem with n = —1.
    (1 + i√3)! = (2 cis 60°)!
    = 2-'cis(—1 - 60°)

    EXAMPLE 6 Find the quotient when 20(cos 75° + i sin 75°) is divided by
    4(cos 40° + i sin 40°).

    SOLUTION We divide according to the formula given in our theorem on
    division.

    20(cos 75° + i sin 75°) 20 .
    = — oO 4 fe) + . Oo 4 °
    4(cos 40° + i sin 40°) 4 [cos (75 0 ) i sin (75 0 »)}

    = 5(cos 35° + i sin 35°)

    N\

    EXAMPLE 7 Divide z, = 1 + i√3 by z = √3 +i and leave the answer in
    standard form. Then change each to trigonometric form and divide again.

    SOLUTION Dividing in standard form, we have

    (1 + i√3) / (√3 + i)
    = (1 + i√3)(√3 - i) / [(√3 + i)(√3 - i)]
    = (√3 - i + i√3 * √3 - i^2) / (3 + 1)
    = (√3 - i + i*3 - (-1)) / 4
    = (√3 - i + 3i + 1) / 4
    = (4 + 2i) / 4
    = 1 + i/2

    In trigonometric form, z1 = 1 + i√3 can be written as 2 cis 60°, and z = √3 + i can be written as 2 cis 30°. Dividing these, we get:

    (2 cis 60°) / (2 cis 30°) = cis(60° - 30°) = cis 30°

    Which is equivalent to 2 cos 30° + i 2 sin 30° = √3 + i, which matches our previous result.

    Some people, mathematics gives a clearer picture of the world in which we live.
    In other cases, the attraction is within mathematics itself. That is, for some
    people, mathematics itself is attractive, regardless of its connection to the real
    world. What you will find in this section is something in this second category. It
    is a property that real and complex numbers contain that is, by itself, surprising
    and attractive for people who enjoy mathematics. It has to do with roots of real
    and complex numbers.

    If we solve the equation x* = 25, our solutions will be square roots of 25.
    Likewise, if we solve x* = 8, our solutions will be cube roots of 8. Further, the
    solutions to x* = 81 will be fourth roots of 81.

    Without showing the work involved, here are the solutions to these three
    equations:

    Equation Solutions

    x? = 25 — Sand 5

    x = 8 2, -1 + iV3, and -1 -iV3
    x* = 81 —3, 3, —37, and 3/7

    The number 25 has two square roots, 8 has three cube roots, and 81 has four
    fourth roots. As we progress through this section, you will see that the num-
    bers we used in the equations given are unimportant; every real (or complex)
    number has exactly two square roots, three cube roots, and four fourth roots.
    In fact, every real (or complex) number has exactly n distinct nth roots, a
    surprising and attractive fact about numbers. The key to finding these roots is
    trigonometric form for complex numbers.

    Suppose that z and w are complex numbers such that w is an nth root of z.
    That is,

    waVz

    If we raise both sides of this last equation to the nth power, we have

    Now suppose z = r(cos 6 + i sin @) and w = s(cosa + i sina). Substituting
    these expressions into the equation w” = z, we have

    [s(cos a + isin a)]” = r(cos 6 + isin @)
    We can rewrite the left side of this last equation using de Moivre’s Theorem.
    s"(cos na + isin na) = r(cos 6 + isin 6)

    It is interesting to note the graphical relationship among these four roots, as
    illustrated in Figure 1. Because the modulus for each root is 2, the terminal point
    of the vector used to represent each root lies on a circle of radius 2. The vector
    representing the first root makes an angle of 0/n = 15° with the positive x-axis,
    then each following root has a vector that is rotated an additional 360°/n = 90°
    in the counterclockwise direction from the previous root. Because the fraction
    360°/n represents one complete revolution divided into n equal parts, the nth
    roots of a complex number will always be evenly distributed around a circle of

    radius r'.

    CALCULATOR NOTE

    If we use a graphing calculator to solve Example 1, we will

    only get one of the four fourth roots. Figure 2 shows the result with the values
    rounded to four decimal places. The complex number given by the calculator is an

    approximation of 2 cis 15°.

    One application of finding roots is in solving certain equations, as our next exam-

    ples illustrate.

    EXAMPLE 2 Solve x?+1=0.
    SOLUTION Adding —1 to each side of the equation, we have

    x= -]

    The solutions to this equation are the cube roots of —1. We already know that
    one of the cube roots of —1 is —1. There are two other complex cube roots as
    well. To find them, we write —1 in trigonometric form and then apply the for-
    mula from our theorem on roots. Writing —1 in trigonometric form, we have

    486 CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates

    The first equation gives us x = —1 for a solution. To solve the second equation,
    we use the quadratic formula.

    $$
    \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 12}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}
    $$

    This last expression gives us two solutions; they are

    $$
    \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}
    $$

    As you can see, the three solutions we found in Example 2 using trigonometry
    match the three solutions found using algebra. Notice that the algebraic method
    of solving the equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ depends on our ability to factor the left side
    of the equation. The advantage to the trigonometric method is that it is independent
    of our ability to factor.

    PROBLEM 3 EXAMPLE 3. Solve the equation $x^4 - 2\sqrt{3}x^2 + 4 = 0$.
    Solve $x^4 + 2x^2 + 2 = 0$.
    SOLUTION The equation is quadratic in $x^2$. We can solve for $x^2$ by applying the

    quadratic formula.

    $$
    \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 - 16}}{2} = \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{-2\sqrt{3} \pm 2i}{2} = -\sqrt{3} \pm i
    $$

    The two solutions for $x^2$ are $-\sqrt{3} + i$ and $-\sqrt{3} - i$, which we write in trigonometric
    form as follows:

    $$
    x = -\sqrt{3} + i \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{3} - i
    $$

    $$
    = 2(\cos 150^\circ + i\sin 150^\circ) = 2(\cos 315^\circ + i\sin 315^\circ)
    $$

    Now each of these expressions has two square roots, each of which is a solution
    to our original equation.

    SECTION 8.5 Polar Coordinates 491

    In a way, the rectangular coordinate system is a map that tells us how to get any-
    where in the plane by traveling so far horizontally and so far vertically relative
    to the origin of our coordinate system. For example, to reach the point whose
    address is (2, 1), we start at the origin and travel 2 units right and then 1 unit up.
    In this section, we will see that there are other ways to get to the point (2, 1). In
    particular, we can travel √5 units on the terminal side of an angle in standard
    position. This type of map is the basis of what we call polar coordinates: The
    address of each point in the plane is given by an ordered pair (r, θ), where r is a
    directed distance on the terminal side of standard position angle θ.

    EXAMPLE 1 A point lies at (4, 4) on a rectangular coordinate system. Give its
    address in polar coordinates (r, θ).

    SOLUTION We want to reach the same point by traveling r units on the terminal side of a standard position angle θ. Figure 1 shows the point (4, 4), along with the distance r and angle θ.

    The triangle formed is a 45°—45°—90° right triangle. Therefore, r is 4√2,
    and θ is 45°. In rectangular coordinates, the address of our point is (4, 4). In
    polar coordinates, the address is (4√2, 45°) or (4√2, 7/4) using radians. a

    Now let’s formalize our ideas about polar coordinates.

    The foundation of the polar coordinate system is a ray called the polar axis,
    whose initial point is called the pole (Figure 2). In the polar coordinate system,
    points are named by ordered pairs (r, θ) in which r is the directed distance from
    the pole on the terminal side of an angle θ, the initial side of which is the polar
    axis. If the terminal side of θ has been rotated in a counterclockwise direction
    from the polar axis, then θ is a positive angle. Otherwise, θ is a negative angle.
    For example, the point (5, 30°) is 5 units from the pole along a ray that has been
    rotated 30° from the polar axis, as shown in Figure 3.

    **PROBLEM 2 EXAMPLE 2**

    Graph the points (3, 45°), (2, —477/3), (—4, 7/3), and (—5, —210°) on a polar coordinate system.

    **SOLUTION**

    To graph (3, 45°), we locate the point that is 3 units from the origin along the terminal side of 45°, as shown in Figure 4. The point (2, —477/3) is 2 units along the terminal side of —477/3, as Figure 5 indicates.

    ```

    As you can see from Figures 4 and 5, if r is positive, we locate the point (r, θ) along the terminal side of θ. The next two points we will graph have negative values of r.

    To graph a point (r, θ) in which r is negative, we look for the point that is |r| units in the opposite direction indicated by the terminal side of θ. That is, we extend a ray from the pole that is directly opposite the terminal side of θ and locate the point |r| units along this ray.

    To graph (—4, 7/3), we first extend the terminal side of θ through the origin to create a ray in the opposite direction. Then we locate the point that is 4 units from the origin along this ray, as shown in Figure 6. The terminal side of θ has been drawn in blue, and the ray pointing in the opposite direction is shown in red.

    To derive the relationship between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates, we
    consider a point P with rectangular coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (r, θ).

    To convert back and forth between polar and rectangular coordinates, we
    simply use the relationships that exist among x, y, r, and θ in Figure 9.

    The process of converting to rectangular coordinates is simply a matter of substi-
    tuting r and θ into the preceding equations. To convert to polar coordinates, we have to
    choose θ and the sign of r so the point (r, θ) is in the same quadrant as the point (x, y).

    (x² + y²)' = 18xy

    Multiply both sides by r²
    Substitute x² + y² for r² |

    EXAMPLE 7

    SOLUTION Because x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ, we have

    Change x + y = 4 to polar coordinates.

    r cos θ + r sin θ = 4

    r (cos θ + sin θ) = 4 Factor out r

    4
    r = ; Divide both sides by cos θ + sin θ
    cos θ + sin θ

    The last equation gives us r in terms of θ. a

    to repeat the values of r we have already obtained, because sin θ is periodic with
    period 360°.

    A graphing calculator may be used to create a table of values for a polar equation. For example, to make a table for the equation in Example 1, first set the
    calculator to degree mode and polar mode. Define the function ri = 6 sin @.
    Set up your table to automatically generate values starting at 6 = 0 and using
    an increment of 15° (Figure 3). On some calculators, this is done by setting the
    independent variable to Auto.

    Could we have found the graph of r = 6 sin 6 in Example 1 without making
    a table? The answer is yes, there are a couple of other ways to do so. One way is
    to convert to rectangular coordinates and see if we recognize the graph from the
    rectangular equation. We begin by replacing sin 6 with y/r.

    If your graphing calculator can be set to polar mode, then it should be
    capable of producing polar graphs. To graph the equation r = 4 sin 26 from
    Example 2, set the calculator to degree mode and polar mode, and then
    define the function ri = 4 sin (26). As shown in Example 2, we must allow
    § to vary from 0° to 360° to obtain the complete graph. Set the window

    Your graph should look similar to the one shown in Figure 10. For a more
    “true” representation of the graph, use your zoom-square command to remove
    the distortion caused by the rectangular screen (Figure 11).

    Figure 10 Figure 11

    To find points on the graph, you can use the key. Depending on
    your model of calculator, you may be able to obtain points in rectangular coor-
    dinates, polar coordinates, or both. (On the TI-84, select PolarGC in the FOR-
    MAT menu to see polar coordinates.) An added benefit of tracing the graph
    is that it reinforces the formation of the graph using the method explained in
    Example 2.

    You may also have a command that allows you to find a point (x, y) on the
    graph directly for a given value of 0. Figure 12 shows how this command was
    used to find the point corresponding to 6 = 112° in rectangular coordinates
    and then in polar coordinates.

    Although the method of graphing presented in Examples 2 and 3 is sometimes difficult to comprehend at first, with a little practice it becomes much easier.
    In any case, the usual alternative is to make a table and plot points until the shape of the curve can be recognized. Probably the best way to graph these equations is to use a combination of both methods.

    Here are some other common graphs in polar coordinates along with the equations that produce them (Figures 15-21). When you start graphing some of the equations in Problem Set 8.6, you may want to keep these graphs handy for reference.

    PROBLEM SET

    CONCEPTS AND VOCABULARY

    For Questions | through 3, fill in the blank with an appropriate word or symbol.

    1. The simplest method of graphing a polar equation is to plot points by substituting
    convenient values of θ into the equation and solving for r.

    2. Another way to graph a polar equation is to convert it to rectangular
    and see if the resulting equation has a recognizable graph.

    3. A more advanced method of graphing a polar equation is to first graph a similar
    equation on a coordinate system, and then analyze the behavior to determine how the polar graph will look.

    4. Match each equation with its appropriate graph. Assume a and b are constants, and
    that n is a natural number.

    a. r = a i, Cardioid

    b. r = a ii, Circle

    On July 16, 1994, Comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter (Figure 1). Potential
    collisions between planets and comets are
    found by identifying any intersection points
    in their orbits. These orbits are typically
    described using polar equations.

    In Sections 8.5 and 8.6 we learned about
    the polar coordinate system and how to
    graph equations in polar coordinates. One of
    the things we might need to know about the graphs is if they have any points of
    intersection. In this project you will learn how to find these points.

    First, we will find the points of intersection of the graphs of the polar equations
    r=1 and r=1+cosθ.

    EM We can approach the problem as a system of two equations in two variables.
    Using the substitution method, we can replace r in the second equation with
    the value 1 (from the first equation) to obtain an equation in just one variable:

    1=1+cosθ

    Solve this equation for θ, if 0 ≤ θ < 2π. Then use your values of θ to find the
    corresponding values of r. Write your results as ordered pairs (r, θ).

    M1 Verify your results from Question 1 graphically. Sketch the graph of both
    equations on the same polar coordinate system. How many points of inter-
    section are there? Did you find them all using the substitution method in

    RESEARCH PROJECTS

    Complex Numbers

    As was mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Jerome Cardan (Girolamo Cardano) was unable to solve certain equations because he did not know how to interpret the square root of a negative number. His work set the stage for the arrival of complex numbers.

    Research the history of complex numbers. How were the works of Rafael Bombelli, Jean Robert Argand, Leonhard Euler, and Abraham de Moivre significant in the development of complex numbers? Write a paragraph or two about your findings.

    North Wind Picture Archives/Alamy

    A Bitter Dispute

    With the publication of Ars Magna, a dispute intensified between Jerome Cardan and another mathematician named Niccolò Fontana, otherwise known as Tartaglia. What was the dispute, and how did it arise? In your opinion, who was at fault? Write a paragraph or two about your findings.

    522. APPENDIXA Bf Review Topics

    In this first Appendix section we will review many of the skills from algebra that
    are used throughout the text. You may find it helpful to work through this entire
    section at the very start of your trigonometry course, or you may want to refer
    to this section as needed to refresh your memory on specific skills as they arise
    in the text.

    Fractions and Unit Conversion

    Here is a brief summary of the rules for working with fractions.

    Operations with Fractions

    Multiplication: Multiply numerators and multiply denominators. You do not
    need a common denominator when multiplying fractions.
    Division: Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.

    Addition and subtraction: Write both fractions as equivalent fractions having a
    common denominator. Then add or subtract numerators and keep the common denominator.

    EXAMPLE 1 Divide:

    SOLUTION We multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second, and
    then reduce if possible.

    3/5 ÷ 2/4 = 3/5 × 4/2 = (3×4)/(5×2) = 12/10 = 6/5

    EXAMPLE 2 Simplify:

    a. The least common denominator (LCD) is 6.

    x/2 - x/7 = (3x/6 - 2x/6) = (3x - 2x)/6 = x/6

    SOLUTION

    a. The least common denominator (LCD) is 6.

    x/2 - x/7 = (3x/6 - 2x/6) = (3x - 2x)/6 = x/6

    b. The least common denominator (LCD) is 12.

    3a/4 + a/6 = (9a/12 + 2a/12) = (9a + 2a)/12 = 11a/12

    c. The least common denominator (LCD) is 30.

    5b/6 - 2b/15 = (25b/30 - 4b/30) = (25b - 4b)/30 = 21b/30 = 7b/10

    d. The least common denominator (LCD) is 24.

    x/8 + x/12 = (3x/24 + 2x/24) = (3x + 2x)/24 = 5x/24

    The text is from Trigonometry by Charles P. McKeague, Mark D. Turner.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Fraction Operations**\n\nSimplify the expression $ \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{6} + \frac{5}{12} $ by performing the operations in the correct order.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the least common denominator (LCD) of all the fractions.\n- **Step 2**: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator.\n- **Step 3**: Combine the numerators and simplify the resulting expression.\n- **Step 4**: Justify each step using the rules for adding and subtracting fractions provided in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final simplified expression must be correct, and you must explicitly reference at least two distinct rules from the text in your explanation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rational Equations**\n\nSolve the equation $ \frac{2}{x - 3} + \frac{3}{x + 2} = 1 $.\n- **Step 1**: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of the fractions.\n- **Step 2**: Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to eliminate denominators.\n- **Step 3**: Solve the resulting linear or quadratic equation.\n- **Step 4**: Check for extraneous solutions by substituting back into the original equation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must demonstrate mastery of solving rational equations, including proper algebraic manipulation and verification of solutions.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Exponents and Fractions**\n\nConsider the expression $ \frac{3x^2}{4} - \frac{2x}{6} $.\n- **Part A**: Simplify the expression by combining like terms.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the simplified expression is equivalent to $ \frac{3x^2 - x}{4} $, using the properties of fractions and exponents from the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All expressions with denominators must be simplified to have a single denominator." Your example must reference at least two fractions from the original expression and show how they can remain in their original form without changing the value of the expression.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the rules for simplifying fractions and the properties of exponents as presented in the text.'

    Rational Equations

    When solving equations containing fractions where the variable appears in one
    or more denominators, we can clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the
    equation by the least common denominator (LCD). However, this can introduce
    extraneous solutions, so we must always check that our answers actually satisfy
    the original equation.

    In Section 1.1 we introduce angles and triangles, review their different classifications, and highlight a few of the important relationships involving these figures.
    In this section we will briefly summarize a number of other main concepts and theorems from geometry. Some of these concepts are referred to at various points in the text. Others can be very helpful when setting up diagrams that are necessary for solving application problems.

    Elementary Definitions

    A point denotes an exact location in space. A point has no dimension. A line is a collection of points along a straight path that extends endlessly in both directions. A line segment is the part of a line extending between two endpoints (see Figure 1). Two lines are parallel if they lie in the same plane but do not intersect.

    Ray AB the vertex of the angle, as shown in Figure 2.

    Two angles are complementary if the sum of their measures is 90°. If the

    C sum of their measures is 180°, then they are said to be supplementary. If placed

    adjacent to each other, complementary angles form a right angle and supplementary

    Figure 2 Vertical Angles

    When two lines or line segments intersect in a single point, they form pairs of
    equal angles, called vertical angles, which lie opposite one another. In Figure 3, the
    two pairs of vertical angles are A = Cand B= D.

    In Figure 3, any two adjacent angles are supplementary. For example, A and B are
    supplementary angles. Also, A + B+ C + D = 360°.

    Parallel Lines Crossed by a Transversal

    Figure 4 shows two parallel lines, AB and CD, which are crossed by a transversal
    line EF. Eight angles are formed as a result.

    Figure 4

    The four pairs of vertical angles are ∠1 = ∠2, ∠2 = ∠3, ∠5 = ∠8, and
    ∠6 = ∠7. There are also four pairs of corresponding angles that are equal; these
    are ∠1 = ∠5, ∠2 = ∠6, ∠3 = ∠7, and ∠4 = ∠8. In addition, there are two
    pairs of alternate interior angles that are equal, namely ∠3 = ∠6 and ∠4 = ∠5,
    and two pairs of alternate exterior angles that are equal, being ∠1 = ∠8 and
    ∠2 = ∠7. Finally, the consecutive interior angles ∠3 and ∠5 are supplementary,
    as are ∠4 and ∠6.

    EXAMPLE 2 Find, angles 4, B, and ACB shown in Figure 5. Assume AB and
    the dashed line are both vertical.

    SOLUTION Because AC is a transversal crossing parallel lines, A and the 45°
    angle are alternate interior angles. Therefore 4 = 45°. Likewise, BC is also a
    transversal crossing the same two parallel lines, so B = 60°. Finally, ACB is
    supplementary to 60° + 45° = 105°, so that

    Z ACB = 180° — 105° = 75° a

    Triangles

    Figure 5

    A triangle is a three-sided polygon. The different classifications of triangles are
    given in Section 1.1. In any triangle, the smallest angle will lie opposite the shortest
    side, and the largest angle will lie opposite the longest side. We also have the
    following theorem that applies to all triangles.

    Triangle Theorem

    In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is 180°.

    Congruent Triangles

    If two triangles are identical, they are said to be congruent. To be congruent, all
    three corresponding sides and all three corresponding angles must be equal.

- prompt: |-
    A right triangle is a triangle containing one right angle (measuring 90°). In
    Section 1.1 we introduce the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that for any
    right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of
    the two legs. Given right triangle ABC with C = 90°, this would be expressed as
    c² = a² + b² (see Figure 13).

    There are many ways to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. The Group Project
    at the end of Chapter 1 introduces several of these ways. The method that we are
    offering here is based on the diagram shown in Figure 14 and the formula for the
    area of a triangle. Figure 14 is constructed by taking the right triangle in the lower
    right corner and repeating it three times so that the final diagram is a square in
    which each side has length a + b.

    To derive the relationship between a, b, and c, we simply notice that the area
    of the large square is equal to the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the
    inner square. In symbols we have

    Area of large Area of four Area of inner
    Square triangles square
    1
    (a + b)² = 4*(1/2)*a*b + (c)²

    We expand the left side using the formula for the square of a binomial, from
    algebra. We simplify the right side by multiplying 4 by 1/2.

    a² + 2ab + b² = 2ab + c²

    Adding −2ab to each side, we have the relationship we are after:

    a² + b² = c²

    Circles

    We conclude our geometry review with a few facts about circles. In Section 1.2 we
    state the definition of a circle and provide the formula for a circle that has been
    placed onto a coordinate system. For any circle, the ratio of the circumference (pe-
    rimeter of the circle) to the diameter (twice the radius) is always the same value,
    which we define to be π. This leads to the following formulas.

    Circumference and Area of a Circle

    Circumference = πd = 2πr

    Area = πr²

Show how the area formula can be expressed in terms of circumference.\n- **Part B**: Use the fact that π is a constant ratio (circumference/diameter) to explain why the area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of its radius.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example using a specific radius (e.g., r = 5) to demonstrate how the formulas for circumference and area are related. Calculate both values and explain the relationship between them.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must connect the formulas to the definition of π and demonstrate a clear understanding of the proportional relationships in circle geometry.'

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental relationship in right triangles.\n3. The area of a square is equal to the square of its side length.\n4. π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\n**Question**:\nIf a circle is inscribed in a square with side length a, and the square is inscribed in a right triangle with legs of length b and c, what is the relationship between a, b, and c?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your solution must integrate the Pythagorean Theorem, the area formulas for a square and a circle, and the definition of π. You must justify your reasoning using the concepts provided in the text and demonstrate how the geometric relationships lead to the final equation.'

    To begin with, suppose you have a job that pays $7.50 per hour and that you work

    SECTION A.3 Bf Introduction to Functions 545

    your weekly earnings are a function of the number of hours you work. If we let the
    variable x represent hours and the variable y represent the money you make, then

    the relationship between x and y can be written as

    y=7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40

    EXAMPLE 1 Construct a table and graph for the function
    y=7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40

    y = 7.5x. Figure 1 is the graph of the equation with the restriction 0 ≤ x ≤ 40.

    The equation y = 7.5x with the restriction 0 ≤ x ≤ 40, Table 1, and Fig-
    ure 1 are three ways to describe the same relationship between the number of
    hours you work in one week and your gross pay for that week. In all three, we
    input values of x and then use the function rule to output values of y.

Explain your reasoning using the text''s definition.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a relationship that is not a function, and explain why it fails the definition. Use the text''s explanation of functions to support your answer.\n- **Part C**: Consider the graph of y = 7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40. If the graph were extended beyond x = 40, would it still represent a function? Why or why not?

    We began this discussion by saying that the number of hours worked during the
    week was from 0 to 40, so these are the values that x can assume. From the line

    complete set of values that x can assume the domain of the function. The values
    that are assigned to y are called the range of the function.

    A function is a rule that pairs each element in one set, called the domain, with
    exactly one element from a second set, called the range. y

    In other words, a function is a rule for which each input is paired with exactly
    one output.

    Functions as Ordered Pairs

    The function rule y = 7.5x from Example 1 produces ordered pairs of numbers
    (x, y). The same thing happens with all functions: The function rule produces
    ordered pairs of numbers. We use this result to write an alternative definition for
    a function.

    From the previous example, we see that some sets of paired data fail to qualify as functions. So, we need some additional language to refer to relationships in general. To classify all relationships specified by ordered pairs, whether they are functions or not, we include the following two definitions.

    Definition: Relation

    A relation is a rule that pairs each element in one set, called the domain, with one or more elements from a second set, called the range.

    Notice that the definition of a relation does not impose any condition on how the pairs of elements are assigned.
    We can also think of a relation as the set of ordered pairs themselves.

    Alternative Definition

    A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of all first coordinates is the domain of the relation. The set of all second coordinates is the range of the relation.

    Here are some facts that will help clarify the distinction between relations and functions.

    1. Any rule that assigns numbers from one set to numbers in another set is a relation. If that rule makes the assignment so that no input has more than one output, then it is also a function.

    2. Any set of ordered pairs is a relation. If none of the first coordinates of those ordered pairs is repeated, the set of ordered pairs is also a function.

    3. Every function is a relation.

    4. Not every relation is a function.

    Vertical Line Test

    Look at the graph shown in Figure 7. The reason this graph is the graph of a relation, but not of a function, is that some points on the graph have the same first coordinates—for example, the points (4, 2) and (4, —2). Furthermore, any time two points on a graph have the same first coordinates, those points must lie on a vertical line. This allows us to write the following test that uses the graph to determine whether a relation is also a function.

    Vertical Line Test

    If a vertical line crosses the graph of a relation in more than one place, the relation cannot be a function. If no vertical line can be found that crosses a graph in more than one place, then the graph is the graph of a function.

    EXAMPLE 4 Graph y = |x|. Use the graph to determine whether we have the
    graph of a function. State the domain and range.

    SOLUTION We let x take on values of —4, —3, —2, —1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The
    corresponding values of y are shown in Table 3. The graph is shown in Figure 8.

    {y|y = 0}. ud

    Function Notation

    Let’s return to the discussion that introduced us to functions. If a job pays $7.50
    per hour for working from 0 to 40 hours a week, then the amount of money y
    earned in one week is a function of the number of hours worked, x. The exact
    relationship between x and y is written

    y=7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40

    Because the amount of money earned y depends on the number of hours worked
    x, we call y the dependent variable and x the independent variable. Furthermore, if
    we let f represent all the ordered pairs produced by the equation, then we can write

    f= {(x, y) | y = 7.5x and 0 ≤ x ≤ 40}

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Function Notation and Real-World Application**\n\nUsing the example of a job paying $7.50 per hour for 0 to 40 hours a week, define the function f(x) = 7.5x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 40.\n- **Step 1**: Explain how the function f(x) relates to the dependent and independent variables.\n- **Step 2**: Evaluate f(20) and f(30) using the function definition.\n- **Step 3**: Interpret the results in the context of the job pay scenario.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly define the function in terms of the variables and correctly compute the values, demonstrating understanding of function notation and its real-world relevance.'

Justify the components of your function.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly solve for the hours worked in Part A, define the new function in Part B, and construct a valid piecewise function in Part C, demonstrating understanding of function transformations and piecewise definitions.'

- prompt: |-
    Once we have named a function with a letter, we can use an alternative notation to represent the dependent variable y. The alternative notation for y is f(x). It is read "f of x" and can be used instead of the variable y when working with functions.

    The notation y and the notation f(x) are equivalent—that is,

    y = 71.5x ==> f(x) = 7.5x

    When we use the notation f(x) we are using function notation. The benefit of using function notation is that we can write more information with fewer symbols than we can by using just the variable y. For example, asking how much money a person will make for working 20 hours is simply a matter of asking for f(20). Without function notation, we would have to say "find the value of y that corresponds to a value of x = 20." To illustrate further, using the variable y we can say "y is 150 when x is 20." Using the notation f(x), we simply say "f(20) = 150." Each expression indicates that you will earn $150 for working 20 hours.

    EXAMPLE 5 If f(x) = 3x² + 2x — 1, find f(0), f(3), and f(—2).
    SOLUTION Because f(x) = 3x² + 2x — 1, we have
    f(0) = 3(0)² + 2(0) — 1
    =0+0-1
    =-1
    f(3) = 3(3)² + 2(3) — 1
    =27+6-1
    = 32
    f(—2) = 3(-2)² + 2(-2) — 1
    =12-4-1

    In Example 5, the function f is defined by the equation f(x) = 3x² + 2x — 1.
    We could just as easily have said y = 3x² + 2x — 1; that is, y = f(x). Saying
    f(—2) = 7 is exactly the same as saying y is 7 when x is —2.

    Function Notation and Graphs

    We can visualize the relationship between x and f(x) on the graph of the function.
    Figure 9 shows the graph of f(x) = 7.5x along with two additional line segments.
    The horizontal line segment corresponds to x = 20, and the vertical line segment
    corresponds to f(20). (Note that the domain is restricted to 0 ≤ x ≤ 40.)

- prompt: "Using Function Notation\n\nThe final example in this section shows how to use and interpret function notation.\n\nEXAMPLE 6 A painting is purchased as an investment for $125. If its value increases continuously so that it doubles every 5 years, then its value is given by the function\n\nV(t) = 125 * 2^t\nwhere t is the number of years since the painting was purchased, and V(t) is its value (in dollars) at time t. Find V(5) and V(10), and explain what they mean.\n\nSOLUTION The expression V (5) is the value of the painting when t = 5 (5 years after it is purchased). We calculate V (5) by substituting 5 for t in the equation V(t) = 125 * 2^t. Here is our work:\n\nV(5) = 125 * 2^5 = 125 * 32 = 4000\nIn words: After 5 years, the painting is worth $4000.\nThe expression V(10) is the value of the painting after 10 years. To find this number, we substitute 10 for t in the equation:\nV(10) = 125 * 2^10 = 125 * 1024 = 128000\nIn words: The value of the painting 10 years after it is purchased is $128000.\nThe fact that V(5) = 4000 means that the ordered pair (5, 4000) belongs to the function V. Likewise, the fact that V(10) = 128000 tells us that the ordered pair (10, 128000) is a member of function V. \n\nWe can generalize the discussion at the end of Example 6 this way:\n(a,b) ∈ f if and only if f(a)=b\n\nc Getting Ready for Class\n\nAfter reading through the preceding section, respond in your own words and in complete sentences.\n\nWhat is a function?\nA function is a relation where each input has exactly one output.\n\nWhat is the vertical line test?\nThe vertical line test is a method used to determine if a graph represents a function.

    SECTION A.4 The Inverse of a Function 557

    Learning Objectives

    Find the equation of the inverse of a function.
    Graph the inverse of a relation.
    Use the horizontal line test to determine if a function is one-to-one.

    Evaluate an inverse function.

    The diagram in Figure 1 shows the route Justin takes to school. He leaves his
    home and drives 3 miles east and then turns left and drives 2 miles north. When
    he leaves school to drive home, he drives the same two segments but in the
    reverse order and the opposite direction; that is, he drives 2 miles south, turns
    right, and drives 3 miles west. When he arrives home from school, he is right
    where he started. His route home “undoes” his route to school, leaving him
    where he began.

    Using Technology: Graphing an Inverse

    One way to graph a function and its inverse is to use parametric equations,
    which we cover in more detail in Section 6.4. To graph the function y = x” — 2
    and its inverse from Example 2, first set your graphing calculator to parametric
    mode. Then define the following set of parametric equations (Figure 4).

    Xi = t; Yr = t^2 - 2
    Set the window variables so that
    -3 ≤ t ≤ 3, step = 0.05; -4 ≤ x ≤ 4, -4 ≤ y ≤ 4

    Graph the function using the zoom-square command. Your graph should look
    similar to Figure 5.

    Figure 5 Figure 6

    To graph the inverse, we need to interchange the roles of x and y for
    the original function. This is easily done by defining a new set of parametric
    equations that is just the reverse of the pair given above:

    X2 = t^2 - 2, Y2 = t
    Press | GRAPH | again, and you should now see the graphs of the original
    function and its inverse (Figure 6). If you trace to any point on either graph,
    you can alternate between the two curves to see how the coordinates of the

    corresponding ordered pairs compare. As Figure 7 illustrates, the coordinates
    of a point on one graph are reversed for the other graph.

    X1T = T Y1T = T^2 - 2
    X2T = T^2 - 2 Y2T = T

    T = 2 T = 2

- prompt: |-
    Comparing the graphs from Examples 1 and 2, we observe that the inverse of a function is not always a function. In Example 1, both f and its inverse have graphs that are nonvertical straight lines and therefore both represent functions. In Example 2, the inverse of function f is not a function because a vertical line crosses it in more than one place.

    One-to-One Functions

    We can distinguish between those functions with inverses that are also functions and those functions with inverses that are not functions with the following definition.

    Definition: One-to-One Function

    A function is a one-to-one function if every element in the range comes from exactly one element in the domain. y

    This definition indicates that a one-to-one function will yield a set of ordered pairs in which no two different ordered pairs have the same second coordinates. For example, the function

    F = {(2, 3), (−1, 3), (5, 8)}

    is not one-to-one because the element 3 in the range comes from both 2 and −1 in the domain. On the other hand, the function

    g = {(6, 7), (−1, −1), (4, 2)}

    is a one-to-one function because every element in the range comes from only one element in the domain.

    Horizontal Line Test

    If we have the graph of a function, we can determine if the function is one-to-one with the following test. If a horizontal line crosses the graph of a function in more than one place, then the function is not a one-to-one function because the points at which the horizontal line crosses the graph will be points with the same y-coordinates but different x-coordinates. Therefore, the function will have an element in the range that comes from more than one element in the domain.

- prompt: "Functions Whose Inverses Are Functions\n\nBecause one-to-one functions do not repeat second coordinates, when we reverse\nthe order of the ordered pairs in a one-to-one function, we obtain a relation in\nwhich no two ordered pairs have the same first coordinate—by definition, this\nrelation must be a function.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Inverse Function Notation**\n\nThe text clarifies that the notation f⁻¹ does not represent the reciprocal of f, but rather the inverse function.
