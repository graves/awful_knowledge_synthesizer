If no poolName is supplied, then the\n\t      new pool will be named poolX, where X is a positive integer.\n\t      The optional second argument maxsize has to be a positive\n\t      integer indicating the maximum size of the pool; this is the\n\t      maximum number of items the pool may hold. The default for this\n\t      value is 10.\n\n\t      The pool object has an associated global Tcl command whose name\n\t      is poolName. This command may be used to invoke various\n\t      configuration operations on the report. It has the following\n\t      general form:\n\n\t      poolName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command. See section POOL OBJECT COMMAND for a detailed\n\t\t     list of options and their behaviour.\n\nPOOLS AND ALLOCATION\n       The purpose of the pool command and the pool object command that it\n       generates, is to manage pools of discrete items.  Examples of a pool of\n       discrete items are:\n\n       •      the seats in a cinema, theatre, train etc.. for which\n\t      visitors/travelers can  make a reservation;\n\n       •      the dynamic IP-addresses that an ISP can dole out  to\n\t      subscribers;\n\n       •      a car rental's collection of cars, which can be rented by\n\t      customers;\n\n       •      the class rooms in a school building, which need to be\n\t      scheduled;\n\n       •      the database connections available to client-threads in a web-\n\t      server application;\n\n       •      the books in a library that customers can borrow;\n\n       •      etc ...\n\n       The common denominator in the examples is that there is a more or less\n       fixed number of items (seats, IP-addresses, cars, ...) that are\n       supposed to be allocated on a more or less regular basis. An item can\n       be allocated only once at a time. An item that is allocated, must be\n       released before it can be re-allocated.\tWhile several items in a pool\n       are being allocated and released continuously, the total number of\n       items in the pool remains constant.\n\n       Keeping track of which items are allocated, and by whom, is the purpose\n       of the pool command and its subordinates.\n\n       Pool parlance: If we say that an item is allocated, it means that the\n       item is busy, owned or occupied; it is not available anymore. If an\n       item is free, it is available. Deallocating an item is equivalent to\n       setting free or releasing an item. The person or entity to which the\n       item has been allotted is said to own the item.\n\nITEMS\n       Discrete items\n\n       The pool command is designed for discrete items only. Note that there\n       are pools where allocation occurs on a non-discrete basis, for example\n       computer memory. There are also pools from which the shares that are\n       doled out are not expected to be returned, for example a charity fund\n       or a pan of soup from which you may receive a portion. Finally, there\n       are even pools from which nothing is ever allocated or returned, like a\n       swimming pool or a cesspool.\n\n       Unique item names\n\n       A pool cannot manage duplicate item names. Therefore, items in a pool\n       must have unique names.\n\n       Item equivalence\n\n       From the point of view of the manager of a pool, items are equivalent.\n       The manager of a pool is indifferent about which entity/person occupies\n       a given item. However, clients may have preferences for a particular\n       item, based on some item property they know.\n\n       Preferences\n\n       A future owner may have a preference for a particular item. Preference\n       based allocation is supported (see the -prefer option to the request\n       subcommand). A preference for a particular item is most likely to\n       result from variability among features associated with the items. Note\n       that the pool commands themselves are not designed to manage such item\n       properties. If item properties play a role in an application, they\n       should be managed separately.\n\nPOOL OBJECT COMMAND\n       The following subcommands and corresponding arguments are available to\n       any pool object command.\n\n       poolName add itemName1 ?itemName2 itemName3 ...?\n\t      This command adds the items on the command line to the pool. If\n\t      duplicate item names occur on the command line, an error is\n\t      raised. If one or more of the items already exist in the pool,\n\t      this also is considered an error.\n\n       poolName clear ?-force?\n\t      Removes all items from the pool. If there are any allocated\n\t      items at the time when the command is invoked, an error is\n\t      raised. This behaviour may be modified through the -force\n\t      argument. If it is supplied on the command line, the pool will\n\t      be cleared regardless the allocation state of its items.\n\n       poolName destroy ?-force?\n\t      Destroys the pool data structure, all associated variables and\n\t      the associated pool object command. By default, the command\n\t      checks whether any items are still allocated and raises an error\n\t      if such is the case. This behaviour may be modified through the\n\t      argument -force. If it is supplied on the command line, the pool\n\t      data structure will be destroyed regardless allocation state of\n\t      its items.\n\n       poolName info type ?arg?\n\t      Returns various information about the pool for further\n\t      programmatic use. The type argument indicates the type of\n\t      information requested. Only the type allocID uses an additional\n\t      argument.\n\n\t      allocID itemName\n\t\t     returns the allocID of the item whose name is itemName.\n\t\t     Free items have an allocation id of -1.\n\n\t      allitems\n\t\t     returns a list of all items in the pool.\n\n\t      allocstate\n\t\t     Returns a list of key-value pairs, where the keys are the\n\t\t     items and the values are the corresponding allocation\n\t\t     id's. Free items have an allocation id of -1.\n\n\t      cursize\n\t\t     returns the current pool size, i.e. the number of items\n\t\t     in the pool.\n\n\t      freeitems\n\t\t     returns a list of items that currently are not allocated.\n\n\t      maxsize\n\t\t     returns the maximum size of the pool."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pool`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\npoolName maxsize ?maxsize?\n\t      Sets or queries the maximum size of the pool, depending on\n\t      whether the maxsize argument is supplied or not. If maxsize is\n\t      supplied, the maximum size of the pool will be set to that\n\t      value. If no argument is supplied, the current maximum size of\n\t      the pool is returned. In this variant, the command is an alias\n\t      for:\n\n\t      poolName info maxsize.\n\n\t      The maxsize argument has to be a positive integer.\n\n       poolName release itemName\n\t      Releases the item whose name is itemName that was allocated\n\t      previously. An error is raised if the item was not allocated at\n\t      the time when the command was issued.\n\n       poolName remove itemName ?-force?\n\t      Removes the item whose name is itemName from the pool. If the\n\t      item was allocated at the time when the command was invoked, an\n\t      error is raised. This behaviour may be modified through the\n\t      optional argument -force. If it is supplied on the command line,\n\t      the item will be removed regardless its allocation state.\n\n       poolName request itemVar ?options?\n\t      Handles a request for an item, taking into account a possible\n\t      preference for a particular item. There are two possible\n\t      outcomes depending on the availability of items:\n\n\t      [1]    The request is honoured, an item is allocated and the\n\t\t     variable whose name is passed with the argument itemVar\n\t\t     will be set to the name of the item that was allocated.\n\t\t     The command returns 1.\n\n\t      [2]    The request is denied. No item is allocated. The variable\n\t\t     whose name is itemVar is not set.\tAttempts to read\n\t\t     itemVar may raise an error if the variable was not\n\t\t     defined before issuing the request. The command returns\n\t\t     0.\n\n       The return values from this command are meant to be inspected. The\n       examples below show how to do this. Failure to check the return value\n       may result in erroneous behaviour. If no preference for a particular\n       item is supplied through the option -prefer (see below), then all\n       requests are honoured as long as items are available.\n\n       The following options are supported:\n\n\t      -allocID allocID\n\t\t     If the request is honoured, an item will be allocated to\n\t\t     the entity identified by allocID. If the allocation state\n\t\t     of an item is queried, it is this allocation ID that will\n\t\t     be returned. If the option -allocID is not supplied, the\n\t\t     item will be given to and owned by dummyID. Allocation\n\t\t     id's may be anything except the value -1, which is\n\t\t     reserved for free items.\n\n\t      -prefer preferredItem\n\t\t     This option modifies the allocation strategy as follows:\n\t\t     If the item whose name is preferredItem is not allocated\n\t\t     at the time when the command is invoked, the request is\n\t\t     honoured (return value is 1). If the item was allocated\n\t\t     at the time when the command was invoked, the request is\n\t\t     denied (return value is 0).\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Two examples are provided. The first one mimics a step by step\n       interactive tclsh session, where each step is explained. The second\n       example shows the usage in a server application that talks to a back-\n       end application.\n\n       Example 1\n\n       This example presents an interactive tclsh session which considers the\n       case of a Car rental's collection of cars. Ten steps explain its usage\n       in chronological order, from the creation of the pool, via the most\n       important stages in the usage of a pool, to the final destruction.\n\n       Note aside:\n\n       In this example, brand names are used to label the various items.\n       However, a brand name could be regarded as a property of an item.\n       Because the pool command is not designed to manage properties of items,\n       they need to be managed separately. In the latter case the items should\n       be labeled with more neutral names such as: car1, car2, car3 , etc ...\n       and a separate database or array should hold the brand names associated\n       with the car labels."
