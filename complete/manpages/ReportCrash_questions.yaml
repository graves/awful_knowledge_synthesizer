ReportCrash also records the identity of the\n     crashing process and the location of the saved crash report in the\n     system.log and the ASL log database.\n\n     ReportCrash is invoked automatically by launchd when a crash is detected.\n     For applications and other processes running in the per-user launchd\n     context, ReportCrash runs as a LaunchAgent and saves crash reports in the\n     user's ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ directory.  For daemons, other\n     processes running in the system launchd context and other privileged\n     processes, ReportCrash runs as a LaunchDaemon and saves crash reports in\n     the system's /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports directory where they are\n     only readable by admin users.  If there are too many crash reports saved\n     for a particular process, older reports will automatically be removed in\n     order to conserve disk space."

To\n     disable crash reporting:\n\n\t   launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist\n\t   sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist\n\n     To re-enable crash reporting:\n\n\t   launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist\n\t   sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist\n\n     For application crashes (but not background process crashes) ReportCrash\n     will display a dialog notifying the user that the application\n     unexpectedly quit and offering to reopen the application or send the\n     report to Apple.  For developers, the behavior of this dialog can be\n     adjusted using /Developer/Applications/Utilities/CrashReporterPrefs.app\n     which is installed as part of the developer tools.\n\n     Crash reports which are sent to Apple are submitted anonymously by the\n     SubmitDiagInfo process.  The reports are used by Apple to improve its\n     products.\tUsers who need support should use http://www.apple.com/support\n     or other authorized support channels.  Developers who are ADC members\n     should report bugs using http://bugreporter.apple.com in order to allow\n     for two way communication between Apple and the bug reporter."
