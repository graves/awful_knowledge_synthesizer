Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `GSSCred`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nGSSCred(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t    GSSCred(8)\n\nNAME\n     GSSCred â€“ manages GSS-API credentials\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     GSSCred manages the lifecycle of GSS-API credentials.\n\nOther options on Mac OS X\n     use-uid-matching\n\t  The default behavior of GSSCred on macOS is to use the audit session\n\t  id to allow access to credentials.  This enables credentials to be\n\t  shared with sudo sessions.  To enable the same uid to access them\n\t  from other audit sessions, run this defaults command:\n\n\t\tsudo defaults write\n\t\t/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Heimdal.GSSCred\n\t\tuse-uid-matching -bool true\n\n     renew-interval\n\t  The default interval in seconds to renew credentials is 2 hours. To\n\t  change it set the default:\n\n\t\tsudo defaults write\n\t\t/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Heimdal.GSSCred renew-interval\n\t\t-int 7200\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n     kdestroy(1), kinit(1), klist(1)\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\t  May 1, 2020\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
