When used like\n       this it will create a pool of child processes or threads to handle\n       requests.\n\n\n       In general, httpd should not be invoked directly, but rather should be\n       invoked via apachectl on Unix-based systems or as a service on Windows\n       NT, 2000 and XP and as a console application on Windows 9x and ME."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the httpd command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you start the Apache HTTP server using apachectl on a Unix-based system?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the httpd command with the -k option to install it as a Windows service?

This can be overridden by the ServerRoot directive\n\t      in the configuration file. The default is /usr.\n\n       -f config\n\t      Uses the directives in the file config on startup. If config\n\t      does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative\n\t      to the ServerRoot. The default is /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.\n\n       -k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop\n\t      Signals httpd to start, restart, or stop. See Stopping Apache\n\t      httpd for more information.\n\n       -C directive\n\t      Process the configuration directive before reading config files.\n\n       -c directive\n\t      Process the configuration directive after reading config files.\n\n       -D parameter\n\t      Sets a configuration parameter which can be used with <IfDefine>\n\t      sections in the configuration files to conditionally skip or\n\t      process commands at server startup and restart. Also can be used\n\t      to set certain less-common startup parameters including\n\t      -DNO_DETACH (prevent the parent from forking) and -DFOREGROUND\n\t      (prevent the parent from calling setsid() et al).\n\n       -e level\n\t      Sets the LogLevel to level during server startup. This is useful\n\t      for temporarily increasing the verbosity of the error messages\n\t      to find problems during startup.\n\n       -E file\n\t      Send error messages during server startup to file.\n\n       -h     Output a short summary of available command line options.\n\n       -l     Output a list of modules compiled into the server. This will not\n\t      list dynamically loaded modules included using the LoadModule\n\t      directive.\n\n       -L     Output a list of directives provided by static modules, together\n\t      with expected arguments and places where the directive is valid.\n\t      Directives provided by shared modules are not listed.\n\n       -M     Dump a list of loaded Static and Shared Modules.\n\n       -S     Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only\n\t      shows the virtualhost settings).\n\n       -T (Available in 2.3.8 and later)\n\t      Skip document root check at startup/restart.\n\n       -t     Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The program\n\t      immediately exits after these syntax parsing tests with either a\n\t      return code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0\n\t      (Syntax Error). If -D DUMP_VHOSTS is also set, details of the\n\t      virtual host configuration will be printed. If -D DUMP_MODULES\n\t      is set, all loaded modules will be printed.\n\n       -v     Print the version of httpd, and then exit.\n\n       -V     Print the version and build parameters of httpd, and then exit.\n\n       -X     Run httpd in debug mode. Only one worker will be started and the\n\t      server will not detach from the console.\n\n\n       The following arguments are available only on the Windows platform:"
