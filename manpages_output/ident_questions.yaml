Interpreting the dictionary as list the first key\n\t      will always be resp-type, and can have one of the values USERID,\n\t      ERROR, and FATAL.  These response types have the following\n\t      meanings:\n\n\t      USERID This indicates a successful response. Two more keys and\n\t\t     associated values are returned, opsys, and user-id.\n\n\t      ERROR  This means the ident server has returned an error.  A\n\t\t     second key named error is present whose value contains\n\t\t     the error-type field from the server response.\n\n\t      FATAL  Fatal errors happen when no ident server is listening on\n\t\t     the remote side, or when the ident server gives a\n\t\t     response that does not conform to the RFC. A detailed\n\t\t     error message is returned under the error key.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category ident of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       ident, identification, rfc 1413\n\nCATEGORY\n       Networking\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2004 Reinhard Max <max@tclers.tk>"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the ident command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the ident package to query an ident daemon on a socket and retrieve user information?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the ident::query command to handle a potential error in the response from an ident server?
