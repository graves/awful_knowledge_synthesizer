If no file\n     arguments are specified, or a file argument is a single dash (‘-’), cut\n     reads from the standard input.  The items specified by list can be in\n     terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited by a special\n     character.  Column and field numbering start from 1.\n\n     The list option argument is a comma or whitespace separated set of\n     numbers and/or number ranges.  Number ranges consist of a number, a dash\n     (‘-’), and a second number and select the columns or fields from the\n     first number to the second, inclusive.  Numbers or number ranges may be\n     preceded by a dash, which selects all columns or fields from 1 to the\n     last number.  Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which\n     selects all columns or fields from the last number to the end of the\n     line.  Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any\n     order.  If a field or column is specified multiple times, it will appear\n     only once in the output.  It is not an error to select columns or fields\n     not present in the input line."

Output fields are\n\t     separated by a single occurrence of the field delimiter\n\t     character.\n\n     -n      Do not split multi-byte characters.  Characters will only be\n\t     output if at least one byte is selected, and, after a prefix of\n\t     zero or more unselected bytes, the rest of the bytes that form\n\t     the character are selected.\n\n     -s      Suppress lines with no field delimiter characters.  Unless\n\t     specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through\n\t     unmodified.\n\n     -w      Use whitespace (spaces and tabs) as the delimiter.  Consecutive\n\t     spaces and tabs count as one single field separator."
