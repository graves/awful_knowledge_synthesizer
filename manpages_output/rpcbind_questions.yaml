It is a replacement for the older portmap program.\n\n     rpcbind supports the original version 2 portmap protocol and in addition\n     supports the newer version 3 and version 4 protocols that are necessary\n     for IPv6 support.\tIt must be running on the server in order to make RPC\n     calls.\n\n     When an RPC server is started, it will tell rpcbind what address it is\n     listening to, and what RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve.  When\n     a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it will\n     first contact rpcbind on the server machine to determine the address\n     where RPC packets should be sent.\n\n     rpcbind is a launchd service. When the first server tries to register\n     with rpcbind the RPC library will contact launchd and arrange for rpcbind\n     to be started.  Note it is no longer possible to run rpcbind from the\n     command line.  rpcbind logs errors and information using os_log(3).\n     rpcbind uses hosts_access(5) for access control; note access control\n     patterns may only reference IP addresses."

This\n\t     option may be specified multiple times and is typically necessary\n\t     when running on a multi-homed host.  If no -h option is\n\t     specified, rpcbind will bind to INADDR_ANY, which could lead to\n\t     problems on a multi-homed host due to rpcbind returning a UDP\n\t     packet from a different IP address than it was sent to.  Note\n\t     that when specifying IP addresses with -h, rpcbind will\n\t     automatically add 127.0.0.1 to the list.\n\nFILES\n     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.rpcbind.plist  launchd.plist(5)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    file for rpcbind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Options should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    added here."
