- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `iwidgets_calendar`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The iwidgets::calendar command creates a calendar widget for the\n       selection of a date, displaying a single month at a time.  Buttons\n       exist on the top to change the month in effect turning the pages of a\n       calendar.  As a page is turned, the dates for the month are modified.\n       Selection of a date visually marks that date.  The selected value can\n       be monitored via the -command option or just retrieved using the get\n       command.\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::calendar command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget.\tIt has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for calendar widgets:\n\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::calendar command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::calendar command.\n\n       pathName get ?format?\n\t      Returns the currently selected date in a format of string or as\n\t      an integer clock value using the -string and -clicks format\n\t      options respectively.  The default is by string.\tReference the\n\t      clock command for more information on obtaining dates and their\n\t      formats.\n\n       pathName select date\n\t      Changes the currently selected date to the value specified which\n\t      must be in the form of a date string, an integer clock value or\n\t      as the keyword \"now\".  Reference the clock command for more\n\t      information on obtaining dates and their formats.  Note that\n\t      selecting a date does not change the month being shown to that\n\t      of the date given.  This chore is left to the show command.\n\n       pathName show date\n\t      Changes the currently displayed date to be that of the date\n\t      argument which must be in the form of a date string, an integer\n\t      clock value or as the keyword \"now\".  Reference the clock\n\t      command for more information on obtaining dates and their\n\t      formats."
