It is written in shell functions based on the features\n       described in zshcompwid(1).\n\n       The features are contextual, sensitive to the point at which completion\n       is started.  Many completions are already provided.  For this reason, a\n       user can perform a great many tasks without knowing any details beyond\n       how to initialize the system, which is described below in\n       INITIALIZATION.\n\n       The context that decides what completion is to be performed may be\n       •      an argument or option position: these describe the position on\n\t      the command line at which completion is requested.  For example\n\t      `first argument to rmdir, the word being completed names a\n\t      directory';\n\n\n       •      a special context, denoting an element in the shell's syntax.\n\t      For example `a word in command position' or `an array\n\t      subscript'."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshcompsys`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nA full context specification contains other elements, as we shall\n       describe.\n\n       Besides commands names and contexts, the system employs two more\n       concepts, styles and tags.  These provide ways for the user to\n       configure the system's behaviour.\n\n       Tags play a dual role.  They serve as a classification system for the\n       matches, typically indicating a class of object that the user may need\n       to distinguish.\tFor example, when completing arguments of the ls\n       command the user may prefer to try files before directories, so both of\n       these are tags.\tThey also appear as the rightmost element in a context\n       specification.\n\n       Styles modify various operations of the completion system, such as\n       output formatting, but also what kinds of completers are used (and in\n       what order), or which tags are examined.  Styles may accept arguments\n       and are manipulated using the zstyle command described in\n       zshmodules(1).\n\n       In summary, tags describe what the completion objects are, and style\n       how they are to be completed.  At various points of execution, the\n       completion system checks what styles and/or tags are defined for the\n       current context, and uses that to modify its behavior.  The full\n       description of context handling, which determines how tags and other\n       elements of the context influence the behaviour of styles, is described\n       below in COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION.\n\n       When a completion is requested, a dispatcher function is called; see\n       the description of _main_complete in the list of control functions\n       below. This dispatcher decides which function should be called to\n       produce the completions, and calls it. The result is passed to one or\n       more completers, functions that implement individual completion\n       strategies: simple completion, error correction, completion with error\n       correction, menu selection, etc.\n\n       More generally, the shell functions contained in the completion system\n       are of two types:\n       •      those beginning `comp' are to be called directly; there are only\n\t      a few of these;"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshcompsys`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n•      those beginning `_' are called by the completion code.  The\n\t      shell functions of this set, which implement completion\n\t      behaviour and may be bound to keystrokes, are referred to as\n\t      `widgets'.  These proliferate as new completions are required.\n\n\nINITIALIZATION\n       If the system was installed completely, it should be enough to call the\n       shell function compinit from your initialization file; see the next\n       section.  However, the function compinstall can be run by a user to\n       configure various aspects of the completion system.\n\n       Usually, compinstall will insert code into .zshrc, although if that is\n       not writable it will save it in another file and tell you that file's\n       location.  Note that it is up to you to make sure that the lines added\n       to .zshrc are actually run; you may, for example, need to move them to\n       an earlier place in the file if .zshrc usually returns early.  So long\n       as you keep them all together (including the comment lines at the start\n       and finish), you can rerun compinstall and it will correctly locate and\n       modify these lines.  Note, however, that any code you add to this\n       section by hand is likely to be lost if you rerun compinstall, although\n       lines using the command `zstyle' should be gracefully handled.\n\n       The new code will take effect next time you start the shell, or run\n       .zshrc by hand; there is also an option to make them take effect\n       immediately.  However, if compinstall has removed definitions, you will\n       need to restart the shell to see the changes.\n\n       To run compinstall you will need to make sure it is in a directory\n       mentioned in your fpath parameter, which should already be the case if\n       zsh was properly configured as long as your startup files do not remove\n       the appropriate directories from fpath.\tThen it must be autoloaded\n       (`autoload -U compinstall' is recommended).  You can abort the\n       installation any time you are being prompted for information, and your\n       .zshrc will not be altered at all; changes only take place right at the\n       end, where you are specifically asked for confirmation.\n\n   Use of compinit\n       This section describes the use of compinit to initialize completion for\n       the current session when called directly; if you have run compinstall\n       it will be called automatically from your .zshrc.\n\n       To initialize the system, the function compinit should be in a\n       directory mentioned in the fpath parameter, and should be autoloaded\n       (`autoload -U compinit' is recommended), and then run simply as\n       `compinit'.  This will define a few utility functions, arrange for all\n       the necessary shell functions to be autoloaded, and will then re-define\n       all widgets that do completion to use the new system.  If you use the\n       menu-select widget, which is part of the zsh/complist module, you\n       should make sure that that module is loaded before the call to compinit\n       so that that widget is also re-defined.\tIf completion styles (see\n       below) are set up to perform expansion as well as completion by\n       default, and the TAB key is bound to expand-or-complete, compinit will\n       rebind it to complete-word; this is necessary to use the correct form\n       of expansion.\n\n       Should you need to use the original completion commands, you can still\n       bind keys to the old widgets by putting a `.' in front of the widget\n       name, e.g. `.expand-or-complete'.\n\n       To speed up the running of compinit, it can be made to produce a dumped\n       configuration that will be read in on future invocations; this is the\n       default, but can be turned off by calling compinit with the option -D.\n       The dumped file is .zcompdump in the same directory as the startup\n       files (i.e. $ZDOTDIR or $HOME); alternatively, an explicit file name\n       can be given by `compinit -d dumpfile'.\tThe next invocation of\n       compinit will read the dumped file instead of performing a full\n       initialization.\n\n       If the number of completion files changes, compinit will recognise this\n       and produce a new dump file.  However, if the name of a function or the\n       arguments in the first line of a #compdef function (as described below)\n       change, it is easiest to delete the dump file by hand so that compinit\n       will re-create it the next time it is run.  The check performed to see\n       if there are new functions can be omitted by giving the option -C.  In\n       this case the dump file will only be created if there isn't one\n       already.\n\n       The dumping is actually done by another function, compdump, but you\n       will only need to run this yourself if you change the configuration\n       (e.g. using compdef) and then want to dump the new one.\tThe name of\n       the old dumped file will be remembered for this purpose.\n\n       If the parameter _compdir is set, compinit uses it as a directory where\n       completion functions can be found; this is only necessary if they are\n       not already in the function search path.\n\n       For security reasons compinit also checks if the completion system\n       would use files not owned by root or by the current user, or files in\n       directories that are world- or group-writable or that are not owned by\n       root or by the current user.  If such files or directories are found,\n       compinit will ask if the completion system should really be used.  To\n       avoid these tests and make all files found be used without asking, use\n       the option -u, and to make compinit silently ignore all insecure files\n       and directories use the option -i.  This security check is skipped\n       entirely when the -C option is given, provided the dumpfile exists.\n\n       The security check can be retried at any time by running the function\n       compaudit.  This is the same check used by compinit, but when it is\n       executed directly any changes to fpath are made local to the function\n       so they do not persist.\tThe directories to be checked may be passed as\n       arguments; if none are given, compaudit uses fpath and _compdir to find\n       completion system directories, adding missing ones to fpath as\n       necessary.  To force a check of exactly the directories currently named\n       in fpath, set _compdir to an empty string before calling compaudit or\n       compinit.\n\n       The function bashcompinit provides compatibility with bash's\n       programmable completion system.\tWhen run it will define the functions,\n       compgen and complete which correspond to the bash builtins with the\n       same names.  It will then be possible to use completion specifications\n       and functions written for bash.\n\n   Autoloaded files\n       The convention for autoloaded functions used in completion is that they\n       start with an underscore; as already mentioned, the fpath/FPATH\n       parameter must contain the directory in which they are stored.  If zsh\n       was properly installed on your system, then fpath/FPATH automatically\n       contains the required directories for the standard functions.\n\n       For incomplete installations, if compinit does not find enough files\n       beginning with an underscore (fewer than twenty) in the search path, it\n       will try to find more by adding the directory _compdir to the search\n       path.  If that directory has a subdirectory named Base, all\n       subdirectories will be added to the path.  Furthermore, if the\n       subdirectory Base has a subdirectory named Core, compinit will add all\n       subdirectories of the subdirectories to the path: this allows the\n       functions to be in the same format as in the zsh source distribution.\n\n       When compinit is run, it searches all such files accessible via\n       fpath/FPATH and reads the first line of each of them.  This line should\n       contain one of the tags described below.  Files whose first line does\n       not start with one of these tags are not considered to be part of the\n       completion system and will not be treated specially.\n\n       The tags are:\n\n       #compdef name ... [ -{p|P} pattern ... [ -N name ... ] ]\n\t      The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined in\n\t      it will be called when completing names, each of which is either\n\t      the name of a command whose arguments are to be completed or one\n\t      of a number of special contexts in the form -context- described\n\t      below.\n\n\t      Each name may also be of the form `cmd=service'.\tWhen\n\t      completing the command cmd, the function typically behaves as if\n\t      the command (or special context) service was being completed\n\t      instead.\tThis provides a way of altering the behaviour of\n\t      functions that can perform many different completions.  It is\n\t      implemented by setting the parameter $service when calling the\n\t      function; the function may choose to interpret this how it\n\t      wishes, and simpler functions will probably ignore it.\n\n\t      If the #compdef line contains one of the options -p or -P, the\n\t      words following are taken to be patterns.  The function will be\n\t      called when completion is attempted for a command or context\n\t      that matches one of the patterns.  The options -p and -P are\n\t      used to specify patterns to be tried before or after other\n\t      completions respectively.  Hence -P may be used to specify\n\t      default actions.\n\n\t      The option -N is used after a list following -p or -P; it\n\t      specifies that remaining words no longer define patterns.  It is\n\t      possible to toggle between the three options as many times as\n\t      necessary.\n\n       #compdef -k style key-sequence ...\n\t      This option creates a widget behaving like the builtin widget\n\t      style and binds it to the given key-sequences, if any.  The\n\t      style must be one of the builtin widgets that perform\n\t      completion, namely complete-word, delete-char-or-list,\n\t      expand-or-complete, expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices,\n\t      menu-complete, menu-expand-or-complete, or\n\t      reverse-menu-complete.  If the zsh/complist module is loaded\n\t      (see zshmodules(1)) the widget menu-select is also available.\n\n\t      When one of the key-sequences is typed, the function in the file\n\t      will be invoked to generate the matches.\tNote that a key will\n\t      not be re-bound if it already was (that is, was bound to\n\t      something other than undefined-key).  The widget created has the\n\t      same name as the file and can be bound to any other keys using\n\t      bindkey as usual.\n\n       #compdef -K widget-name style key-sequence [ name style seq ... ]\n\t      This is similar to -k except that only one key-sequence argument\n\t      may be given for each widget-name style pair.  However, the\n\t      entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a different\n\t      set of arguments.  Note in particular that the widget-name must\n\t      be distinct in each set.\tIf it does not begin with `_' this\n\t      will be added.  The widget-name should not clash with the name\n\t      of any existing widget: names based on the name of the function\n\t      are most useful.\tFor example,\n\n\t\t     #compdef -K _foo_complete complete-word \"^X^C\" \\\n\t\t       _foo_list list-choices \"^X^D\"\n\n\t      (all on one line) defines a widget _foo_complete for completion,\n\t      bound to `^X^C', and a widget _foo_list for listing, bound to\n\t      `^X^D'.\n\n       #autoload [ options ]\n\t      Functions with the #autoload tag are marked for autoloading but\n\t      are not otherwise treated specially.  Typically they are to be\n\t      called from within one of the completion functions.  Any options\n\t      supplied will be passed to the autoload builtin; a typical use\n\t      is +X to force the function to be loaded immediately.  Note that\n\t      the -U and -z flags are always added implicitly.\n\n       The # is part of the tag name and no white space is allowed after it.\n       The #compdef tags use the compdef function described below; the main\n       difference is that the name of the function is supplied implicitly.\n\n       The special contexts for which completion functions can be defined are:\n\n       -array-value-\n\t      The right hand side of an array-assignment (`name=(...)')\n\n       -assign-parameter-\n\t      The name of a parameter in an assignment, i.e. on the left hand\n\t      side of an `='\n\n       -brace-parameter-\n\t      The name of a parameter expansion within braces (`${...}')\n\n       -command-\n\t      A word in command position\n\n       -condition-\n\t      A word inside a condition (`[[...]]')\n\n       -default-\n\t      Any word for which no other completion is defined\n\n       -equal-\n\t      A word beginning with an equals sign\n\n       -first-\n\t      This is tried before any other completion function.  The\n\t      function called may set the _compskip parameter to one of\n\t      various values: all: no further completion is attempted; a\n\t      string containing the substring patterns: no pattern completion\n\t      functions will be called; a string containing default: the\n\t      function for the `-default-' context will not be called, but\n\t      functions defined for commands will be.\n\n       -math- Inside mathematical contexts, such as `((...))'\n\n       -parameter-\n\t      The name of a parameter expansion (`$...')\n\n       -redirect-\n\t      The word after a redirection operator.\n\n       -subscript-\n\t      The contents of a parameter subscript.\n\n       -tilde-\n\t      After an initial tilde (`~'), but before the first slash in the\n\t      word.\n\n       -value-\n\t      On the right hand side of an assignment.\n\n       Default implementations are supplied for each of these contexts.  In\n       most cases the context -context- is implemented by a corresponding\n       function _context, for example the context `-tilde-' and the function\n       `_tilde').\n\n       The contexts -redirect- and -value- allow extra context-specific\n       information.  (Internally, this is handled by the functions for each\n       context calling the function _dispatch.)  The extra information is\n       added separated by commas.\n\n       For the -redirect- context, the extra information is in the form\n       `-redirect-,op,command', where op is the redirection operator and\n       command is the name of the command on the line.\tIf there is no command\n       on the line yet, the command field will be empty.\n\n       For the -value- context, the form is `-value-,name,command', where name\n       is the name of the parameter on the left hand side of the assignment.\n       In the case of elements of an associative array, for example\n       `assoc=(key <TAB>', name is expanded to `name-key'.  In certain special\n       contexts, such as completing after `make CFLAGS=', the command part\n       gives the name of the command, here make; otherwise it is empty.\n\n       It is not necessary to define fully specific completions as the\n       functions provided will try to generate completions by progressively\n       replacing the elements with `-default-'.  For example, when completing\n       after `foo=<TAB>', _value will try the names `-value-,foo,' (note the\n       empty command part), `-value-,foo,-default-'\n       and`-value-,-default-,-default-', in that order, until it finds a\n       function to handle the context.\n\n       As an example:\n\n\t      compdef '_files -g \"*.log\"' '-redirect-,2>,-default-'\n\n       completes files matching `*.log' after `2> <TAB>' for any command with\n       no more specific handler defined.\n\n       Also:\n\n\t      compdef _foo -value-,-default-,-default-\n\n       specifies that _foo provides completions for the values of parameters\n       for which no special function has been defined.\tThis is usually\n       handled by the function _value itself.\n\n       The same lookup rules are used when looking up styles (as described\n       below); for example\n\n\t      zstyle ':completion:*:*:-redirect-,2>,*:*' file-patterns '*.log'\n\n       is another way to make completion after `2> <TAB>' complete files\n       matching `*.log'.\n\n   Functions\n       The following function is defined by compinit and may be called\n       directly."

Here service should already have been defined by\n\t      `cmd1=service' lines in #compdef files, as described above.  The\n\t      argument for cmd will be completed in the same way as service.\n\n\t      The function argument may alternatively be a string containing\n\t      almost any shell code.  If the string contains an equal sign,\n\t      the above will take precedence.  The option -e may be used to\n\t      specify the first argument is to be evaluated as shell code even\n\t      if it contains an equal sign.  The string will be executed using\n\t      the eval builtin command to generate completions.  This provides\n\t      a way of avoiding having to define a new completion function.\n\t      For example, to complete files ending in `.h' as arguments to\n\t      the command foo:\n\n\t\t     compdef '_files -g \"*.h\"' foo\n\n\t      The option -n prevents any completions already defined for the\n\t      command or context from being overwritten.\n\n\t      The option -d deletes any completion defined for the command or\n\t      contexts listed.\n\n\t      The names may also contain -p, -P and -N options as described\n\t      for the #compdef tag.  The effect on the argument list is\n\t      identical, switching between definitions of patterns tried\n\t      initially, patterns tried finally, and normal commands and\n\t      contexts.\n\n\t      The parameter $_compskip may be set by any function defined for\n\t      a pattern context.  If it is set to a value containing the\n\t      substring `patterns' none of the pattern-functions will be\n\t      called; if it is set to a value containing the substring `all',\n\t      no other function will be called.  Setting $_compskip in this\n\t      manner is of particular utility when using the -p option, as\n\t      otherwise the dispatcher will move on to additional functions\n\t      (likely the default one) after calling the pattern-context one,\n\t      which can mangle the display of completion possibilities if not\n\t      handled properly.\n\n\t      The form with -k defines a widget with the same name as the\n\t      function that will be called for each of the key-sequences; this\n\t      is like the #compdef -k tag.  The function should generate the\n\t      completions needed and will otherwise behave like the builtin\n\t      widget whose name is given as the style argument.  The widgets\n\t      usable for this are: complete-word, delete-char-or-list,\n\t      expand-or-complete, expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices,\n\t      menu-complete, menu-expand-or-complete, and\n\t      reverse-menu-complete, as well as menu-select if the\n\t      zsh/complist module is loaded.  The option -n prevents the key\n\t      being bound if it is already to bound to something other than\n\t      undefined-key.\n\n\t      The form with -K is similar and defines multiple widgets based\n\t      on the same function, each of which requires the set of three\n\t      arguments name, style and key-sequence, where the latter two are\n\t      as for -k and the first must be a unique widget name beginning\n\t      with an underscore.\n\n\t      Wherever applicable, the -a option makes the function\n\t      autoloadable, equivalent to autoload -U function.\n\n       The function compdef can be used to associate existing completion\n       functions with new commands.  For example,\n\n\t      compdef _pids foo\n\n       uses the function _pids to complete process IDs for the command foo.\n\n       Note also the _gnu_generic function described below, which can be used\n       to complete options for commands that understand the `--help' option.\n\nCOMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\n       This section gives a short overview of how the completion system works,\n       and then more detail on how users can configure how and when matches\n       are generated.\n\n   Overview\n       When completion is attempted somewhere on the command line the\n       completion system begins building the context.  The context represents\n       everything that the shell knows about the meaning of the command line\n       and the significance of the cursor position.  This takes account of a\n       number of things including the command word (such as `grep' or `zsh')\n       and options to which the current word may be an argument (such as the\n       `-o' option to zsh which takes a shell option as an argument).\n\n       The context starts out very generic (\"we are beginning a completion\")\n       and becomes more specific as more is learned (\"the current word is in a\n       position that is usually a command name\" or \"the current word might be\n       a variable name\" and so on).  Therefore the context will vary during\n       the same call to the completion system.\n\n       This context information is condensed into a string consisting of\n       multiple fields separated by colons, referred to simply as `the\n       context' in the remainder of the documentation.\tNote that a user of\n       the completion system rarely needs to compose a context string, unless\n       for example a new function is being written to perform completion for a\n       new command.  What a user may need to do is compose a style pattern,\n       which is matched against a context when needed to look up\n       context-sensitive options that configure the completion system.\n\n       The next few paragraphs explain how a context is composed within the\n       completion function suite.  Following that is discussion of how styles\n       are defined.  Styles determine such things as how the matches are\n       generated, similarly to shell options but with much more control.  They\n       are defined with the zstyle builtin command (see zshmodules(1)).\n\n       The context string always consists of a fixed set of fields, separated\n       by colons and with a leading colon before the first.  Fields which are\n       not yet known are left empty, but the surrounding colons appear anyway.\n       The fields are always in the order\n       :completion:function:completer:command:argument:tag.  These have the\n       following meaning:\n\n       •      The literal string completion, saying that this style is used by\n\t      the completion system.  This distinguishes the context from\n\t      those used by, for example, zle widgets and ZFTP functions."

For example, the context name\n\n\t      :completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:files\n\n       says that normal completion was attempted as the first argument to the\n       option -o of the command dvips:\n\n\t      dvips -o ...\n\n       and the completion function will generate filenames.\n\n       Usually completion will be tried for all possible tags in an order\n       given by the completion function.

The following examples demonstrate that patterns may\n       be loosely defined for styles that apply broadly, or as tightly defined\n       as desired for styles that apply in narrower circumstances.\n\n       For example, many completion functions can generate matches in a simple\n       and a verbose form and use the verbose style to decide which form\n       should be used.\tTo make all such functions use the verbose form, put\n\n\t      zstyle ':completion:*' verbose yes\n\n       in a startup file (probably .zshrc).

    Manpage text:

    Note that the order in which styles are defined does not matter; the
           style mechanism uses the most specific possible match for a particular
           style to determine the set of values.  Strings are preferred over
           patterns (for example, `:completion::complete:::foo' is more specific
           than `:completion::complete:::*'), and longer patterns are preferred
           over the pattern `*'. See zmodules(1) for details.

           Context patterns that use something other than a wildcard (*) to match
           the middle parts of the context -- the completer, command, and argument
           in :completion:function:completer:command:argument:tag -- should
           include all six colons (:) explicitly. Without this, a pattern such as
           :completion:*:foo:* could match foo against a component other than the
           intended one (for example, against completer when a match against
           command was intended).

           Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend on the
           completion function.  However, the following two sections list some of

If the values for more than one\n\t      tag provide a number, the smallest number is taken.\n\n\t      Menu selection can be turned off explicitly by defining a value\n\t      containing the string`no-select'.\n\n\t      It is also possible to start menu selection only if the list of\n\t      matches does not fit on the screen by using the value\n\t      `select=long'.  To start menu selection even if the current\n\t      widget only performs listing, use the value `select=long-list'.\n\n\t      To turn on menu completion or menu selection when there are a\n\t      certain number of matches or the list of matches does not fit on\n\t      the screen, both of `yes=' and `select=' may be given twice,\n\t      once with a number and once with `long' or `long-list'.\n\n\t      Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of menu\n\t      selection.  The word `interactive' in the value causes\n\t      interactive mode to be entered immediately when menu selection\n\t      is started; see the description of the zsh/complist module in\n\t      zshmodules(1) for a description of interactive mode.  Including\n\t      the string `search' does the same for incremental search mode.\n\t      To select backward incremental search, include the string\n\t      `search-backward'."

If\n\t      it is `true', the prefix will not be shown in the list of\n\t      matches.\n\n\t      The default value for this style is `false'.\n\n       prefix-needed\n\t      This style is also relevant for matches with a common prefix.\n\t      If it is set to `true' this common prefix must be typed by the\n\t      user to generate the matches.\n\n\t      The style is applicable to the options, signals, jobs,\n\t      functions, and parameters completion tags.\n\n\t      For command options, this means that the initial `-', `+', or\n\t      `--' must be typed explicitly before option names will be\n\t      completed.\n\n\t      For signals, an initial `-' is required before signal names will\n\t      be completed.\n\n\t      For jobs, an initial `%' is required before job names will be\n\t      completed.\n\n\t      For function and parameter names, an initial `_' or `.' is\n\t      required before function or parameter names starting with those\n\t      characters will be completed.\n\n\t      The default value for this style is `false' for function and\n\t      parameter completions, and  `true' otherwise.\n\n       preserve-prefix\n\t      This style is used when completing path names.  Its value should\n\t      be a pattern matching an initial prefix of the word to complete\n\t      that should be left unchanged under all circumstances.  For\n\t      example, on some Unices an initial `//' (double slash) has a\n\t      special meaning; setting this style to the string `//' will\n\t      preserve it.  As another example, setting this style to `?:/'\n\t      under Cygwin would allow completion after `a:/...' and so on.\n\n       range  This is used by the _history completer and the\n\t      _history_complete_word bindable command to decide which words\n\t      should be completed.\n\n\t      If it is a single number, only the last N words from the history\n\t      will be completed.\n\n\t      If it is a range of the form `max:slice', the last slice words\n\t      will be completed; then if that yields no matches, the slice\n\t      words before those will be tried and so on.  This process stops\n\t      either when at least one match has been found, or max words have\n\t      been tried.\n\n\t      The default is to complete all words from the history at once.\n\n       recursive-files\n\t      If this style is set, its value is an array of patterns to be\n\t      tested against `$PWD/': note the trailing slash, which allows\n\t      directories in the pattern to be delimited unambiguously by\n\t      including slashes on both sides.\tIf an ordinary file completion\n\t      fails and the word on the command line does not yet have a\n\t      directory part to its name, the style is retrieved using the\n\t      same tag as for the completion just attempted, then the elements\n\t      tested against $PWD/ in turn.  If one matches, then the shell\n\t      reattempts completion by prepending the word on the command line\n\t      with each directory in the expansion of **/*(/) in turn.\n\t      Typically the elements of the style will be set to restrict the\n\t      number of directories beneath the current one to a manageable\n\t      number, for example `*/.git/*'.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' recursive-files '*/zsh/*'\n\n\t      If the current directory is /home/pws/zsh/Src, then zle_tr<TAB>\n\t      can be completed to Zle/zle_tricky.c.\n\n       regular\n\t      This style is used by the _expand_alias completer and bindable\n\t      command.\tIf set to `true' (the default), regular aliases will\n\t      be expanded but only in command position.  If it is set to\n\t      `false', regular aliases will never be expanded.\t If it is set\n\t      to `always', regular aliases will be expanded even if not in\n\t      command position.\n\n       rehash If this is set when completing external commands, the internal\n\t      list (hash) of commands will be updated for each search by\n\t      issuing the rehash command.  There is a speed penalty for this\n\t      which is only likely to be noticeable when directories in the\n\t      path have slow file access.\n\n       remote-access\n\t      If set to `false', certain commands will be prevented from\n\t      making Internet connections to retrieve remote information.\n\t      This includes the completion for the CVS command.\n\n\t      It is not always possible to know if connections are in fact to\n\t      a remote site, so some may be prevented unnecessarily.\n\n       remove-all-dups\n\t      The _history_complete_word bindable command and the _history\n\t      completer use this to decide if all duplicate matches should be\n\t      removed, rather than just consecutive duplicates.\n\n       select-prompt\n\t      If this is set for the default tag, its value will be displayed\n\t      during menu selection (see the menu style above) when the\n\t      completion list does not fit on the screen as a whole.  The same\n\t      escapes as for the list-prompt style are understood, except that\n\t      the numbers refer to the match or line the mark is on.  A\n\t      default prompt is used when the value is the empty string.\n\n       select-scroll\n\t      This style is tested for the default tag and determines how a\n\t      completion list is scrolled during a menu selection (see the\n\t      menu style above) when the completion list does not fit on the\n\t      screen as a whole.  If the value is `0' (zero), the list is\n\t      scrolled by half-screenfuls; if it is a positive integer, the\n\t      list is scrolled by the given number of lines; if it is a\n\t      negative number, the list is scrolled by a screenful minus the\n\t      absolute value of the given number of lines.  The default is to\n\t      scroll by single lines.\n\n       separate-sections\n\t      This style is used with the manuals tag when completing names of\n\t      manual pages.  If it is `true', entries for different sections\n\t      are added separately using tag names of the form `manuals.X',\n\t      where X is the section number.  When the group-name style is\n\t      also in effect, pages from different sections will appear\n\t      separately.  This style is also used similarly with the words\n\t      style when completing words for the dict command. It allows\n\t      words from different dictionary databases to be added\n\t      separately. See also insert-sections.\n\n\t      The default for this style is `false'.\n\n       show-ambiguity\n\t      If the zsh/complist module is loaded, this style can be used to\n\t      highlight the first ambiguous character in completion lists. The\n\t      value is either a color indication such as those supported by\n\t      the list-colors style or, with a value of `true', a default of\n\t      underlining is selected. The highlighting is only applied if the\n\t      completion display strings correspond to the actual matches.\n\n       show-completer\n\t      Tested whenever a new completer is tried.  If it is `true', the\n\t      completion system outputs a progress message in the listing area\n\t      showing what completer is being tried.  The message will be\n\t      overwritten by any output when completions are found and is\n\t      removed after completion is finished.\n\n       single-ignored\n\t      This is used by the _ignored completer when there is only one\n\t      match.  If its value is `show', the single match will be\n\t      displayed but not inserted.  If the value is `menu', then the\n\t      single match and the original string are both added as matches\n\t      and menu completion is started, making it easy to select either\n\t      of them.\n\n       sort   This allows the standard ordering of matches to be overridden.\n\n\t      If its value is `true' or `false', sorting is enabled or\n\t      disabled.  Additionally the values associated with the `-o'\n\t      option to compadd can also be listed: match, nosort, numeric,\n\t      reverse.\tIf it is not set for the context, the standard\n\t      behaviour of the calling widget is used.\n\n\t      The style is tested first against the full context including the\n\t      tag, and if that fails to produce a value against the context\n\t      without the tag.\n\n\t      In many cases where a calling widget explicitly selects a\n\t      particular ordering in lieu of the default, a value of `true' is\n\t      not honoured.  An example of where this is not the case is for\n\t      command history where the default of sorting matches\n\t      chronologically may be overridden by setting the style to\n\t      `true'.\n\n\t      In the _expand completer, if it is set to `true', the expansions\n\t      generated will always be sorted.\tIf it is set to `menu', then\n\t      the expansions are only sorted when they are offered as single\n\t      strings but not in the string containing all possible\n\t      expansions.\n\n       special-dirs\n\t      Normally, the completion code will not produce the directory\n\t      names `.' and `..' as possible completions.  If this style is\n\t      set to `true', it will add both `.' and `..' as possible\n\t      completions; if it is set to `..', only `..' will be added.\n\n\t      The following example sets special-dirs to `..' when the current\n\t      prefix is empty, is a single `.', or consists only of a path\n\t      beginning with `../'.  Otherwise the value is `false'.\n\n\t\t     zstyle -e ':completion:*' special-dirs \\\n\t\t\t'[[ $PREFIX = (../)#(|.|..) ]] && reply=(..)'\n\n       squeeze-slashes\n\t      If set to `true', sequences of slashes in filename paths (for\n\t      example in `foo//bar') will be treated as a single slash.  This\n\t      is the usual behaviour of UNIX paths.  However, by default the\n\t      file completion function behaves as if there were a `*' between\n\t      the slashes.\n\n       stop   If set to `true', the _history_complete_word bindable command\n\t      will stop once when reaching the beginning or end of the\n\t      history.\tInvoking _history_complete_word will then wrap around\n\t      to the opposite end of the history.  If this style is set to\n\t      `false' (the default), _history_complete_word will loop\n\t      immediately as in a menu completion.\n\n       strip-comments\n\t      If set to `true', this style causes non-essential comment text\n\t      to be removed from completion matches.  Currently it is only\n\t      used when completing e-mail addresses where it removes any\n\t      display name from the addresses, cutting them down to plain\n\t      user@host form.\n\n       subst-globs-only\n\t      This is used by the _expand completer.  If it is set to `true',\n\t      the expansion will only be used if it resulted from globbing;\n\t      hence, if expansions resulted from the use of the substitute\n\t      style described below, but these were not further changed by\n\t      globbing, the expansions will be rejected.\n\n\t      The default for this style is `false'.\n\n       substitute\n\t      This boolean style controls whether the _expand completer will\n\t      first try to expand all substitutions in the string (such as\n\t      `$(...)' and `${...}').\n\n\t      The default is `true'.\n\n       suffix This is used by the _expand completer if the word starts with a\n\t      tilde or contains a parameter expansion.\tIf it is set to\n\t      `true', the word will only be expanded if it doesn't have a\n\t      suffix, i.e. if it is something like `~foo' or `$foo' rather\n\t      than `~foo/' or `$foo/bar', unless that suffix itself contains\n\t      characters eligible for expansion.  The default for this style\n\t      is `true'.\n\n       tag-order\n\t      This provides a mechanism for sorting how the tags available in\n\t      a particular context will be used.\n\n\t      The values for the style are sets of space-separated lists of\n\t      tags.  The tags in each value will be tried at the same time; if\n\t      no match is found, the next value is used.  (See the\n\t      file-patterns style for an exception to this behavior.)\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-:*:*' tag-order \\\n\t\t\t 'commands functions'\n\n\t      specifies that completion in command position first offers\n\t      external commands and shell functions.  Remaining tags will be\n\t      tried if no completions are found.\n\n\t      In addition to tag names, each string in the value may take one\n\t      of the following forms:\n\n\t      -      If any value consists of only a hyphen, then only the\n\t\t     tags specified in the other values are generated.\n\t\t     Normally all tags not explicitly selected are tried last\n\t\t     if the specified tags fail to generate any matches.  This\n\t\t     means that a single value consisting only of a single\n\t\t     hyphen turns off completion.\n\n\t      ! tags...\n\t\t     A string starting with an exclamation mark specifies\n\t\t     names of tags that are not to be used.  The effect is the\n\t\t     same as if all other possible tags for the context had\n\t\t     been listed.\n\n\t      tag:label ...\n\t\t     Here, tag is one of the standard tags and label is an\n\t\t     arbitrary name.  Matches are generated as normal but the\n\t\t     name label is used in contexts instead of tag.  This is\n\t\t     not useful in words starting with !.\n\n\t\t     If the label starts with a hyphen, the tag is prepended\n\t\t     to the label to form the name used for lookup.  This can\n\t\t     be used to make the completion system try a certain tag\n\t\t     more than once, supplying different style settings for\n\t\t     each attempt; see below for an example.\n\n\t      tag:label:description\n\t\t     As before, but description will replace the `%d' in the\n\t\t     value of the format style instead of the default\n\t\t     description supplied by the completion function.  Spaces\n\t\t     in the description must be quoted with a backslash.  A\n\t\t     `%d' appearing in description is replaced with the\n\t\t     description given by the completion function.\n\n\t      In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or several\n\t      patterns in the form `{pat1,pat2...}'.  In this case all\n\t      matching tags will be used except for any given explicitly in\n\t      the same string.\n\n\t      One use of these features is to try one tag more than once,\n\t      setting other styles differently on each attempt, but still to\n\t      use all the other tags without having to repeat them all.  For\n\t      example, to make completion of function names in command\n\t      position ignore all the completion functions starting with an\n\t      underscore the first time completion is tried:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:*' tag-order \\\n\t\t\t 'functions:-non-comp *' functions\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:functions-non-comp' \\\n\t\t\t ignored-patterns '_*'\n\n\t      On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the functions\n\t      tag will be replaced by functions-non-comp.  The\n\t      ignored-patterns style is set for this tag to exclude functions\n\t      starting with an underscore.  If there are no matches, the\n\t      second value of the tag-order style is used which completes\n\t      functions using the default tag, this time presumably including\n\t      all function names.\n\n\t      The matches for one tag can be split into different groups.  For\n\t      example:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' tag-order \\\n\t\t\t 'options:-long:long\\ options\n\t\t\t  options:-short:short\\ options\n\t\t\t  options:-single-letter:single\\ letter\\ options'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:options-long' \\\n\t\t\t  ignored-patterns '[-+](|-|[^-]*)'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:options-short' \\\n\t\t\t  ignored-patterns '--*' '[-+]?'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:options-single-letter' \\\n\t\t\t  ignored-patterns '???*'\n\n\t      With the group-names style set, options beginning with `--',\n\t      options beginning with a single `-' or `+' but containing\n\t      multiple characters, and single-letter options will be displayed\n\t      in separate groups with different descriptions.\n\n\t      Another use of patterns is to try multiple match specifications\n\t      one after another.  The matcher-list style offers something\n\t      similar, but it is tested very early in the completion system\n\t      and hence can't be set for single commands nor for more specific\n\t      contexts.  Here is how to try normal completion without any\n\t      match specification and, if that generates no matches, try again\n\t      with case-insensitive matching, restricting the effect to\n\t      arguments of the command foo:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*:*' tag-order '*' '*:-case'\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*-case' matcher 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'\n\n\t      First, all the tags offered when completing after foo are tried\n\t      using the normal tag name.  If that generates no matches, the\n\t      second value of tag-order is used, which tries all tags again\n\t      except that this time each has -case appended to its name for\n\t      lookup of styles.  Hence this time the value for the matcher\n\t      style from the second call to zstyle in the example is used to\n\t      make completion case-insensitive.\n\n\t      It is possible to use the -e option of the zstyle builtin\n\t      command to specify conditions for the use of particular tags.\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     zstyle -e '*:-command-:*' tag-order '\n\t\t\t if [[ -n $PREFIX$SUFFIX ]]; then\n\t\t\t   reply=( )\n\t\t\t else\n\t\t\t   reply=( - )\n\t\t\t fi'\n\n\t      Completion in command position will be attempted only if the\n\t      string typed so far is not empty.  This is tested using the\n\t      PREFIX special parameter; see zshcompwid for a description of\n\t      parameters which are special inside completion widgets.  Setting\n\t      reply to an empty array provides the default behaviour of trying\n\t      all tags at once; setting it to an array containing only a\n\t      hyphen disables the use of all tags and hence of all\n\t      completions.\n\n\t      If no tag-order style has been defined for a context, the\n\t      strings `(|*-)argument-* (|*-)option-* values' and `options'\n\t      plus all tags offered by the completion function will be used to\n\t      provide a sensible default behavior that causes arguments\n\t      (whether normal command arguments or arguments of options) to be\n\t      completed before option names for most commands.\n\n       urls   This is used together with the urls tag by functions completing\n\t      URLs.\n\n\t      If the value consists of more than one string, or if the only\n\t      string does not name a file or directory, the strings are used\n\t      as the URLs to complete.\n\n\t      If the value contains only one string which is the name of a\n\t      normal file the URLs are taken from that file (where the URLs\n\t      may be separated by white space or newlines).\n\n\t      Finally, if the only string in the value names a directory, the\n\t      directory hierarchy rooted at this directory gives the\n\t      completions.  The top level directory should be the file access\n\t      method, such as `http', `ftp', `bookmark' and so on.  In many\n\t      cases the next level of directories will be a filename.  The\n\t      directory hierarchy can descend as deep as necessary.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' urls ~/.urls\n\t\t     mkdir -p ~/.urls/ftp/ftp.zsh.org/pub"

           after calling compinit. The default value for this style is `_complete
           _ignored', i.e. normally only ordinary completion is tried, first with
           the effect of the ignored-patterns style and then without it.  The
           _main_complete function uses the return status of the completer
           functions to decide if other completers should be called.  If the
           return status is zero, no other completers are tried and the
           _main_complete function returns.

           If the first argument to _main_complete is a single hyphen, the
           arguments will not be taken as names of completers.  Instead, the
           second argument gives a name to use in the completer field of the
           context and the other arguments give a command name and arguments to

If it is set to an\n\t      associative array, the keys are used as the possible completions\n\t      and the values (if non-empty) are used as descriptions for the\n\t      matches.\tIf `compcontext' is set to a string containing colons,\n\t      it should be of the form `tag:descr:action'.  In this case the\n\t      tag and descr give the tag and description to use and the action\n\t      indicates what should be completed in one of the forms accepted\n\t      by the _arguments utility function described below.\n\n\t      Finally, if `compcontext' is set to a string without colons, the\n\t      value is taken as the name of the context to use and the\n\t      function defined for that context will be called.  For this\n\t      purpose, there is a special context named -command-line- that\n\t      completes whole command lines (commands and their arguments).\n\t      This is not used by the completion system itself but is\n\t      nonetheless handled when explicitly called."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshcompsys`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThis function is also a bindable command, see the section\n\t      `Bindable Commands' below.\n\n       _extensions\n\t      If the cursor follows the string `*.', filename extensions are\n\t      completed. The extensions are taken from files in current\n\t      directory or a directory specified at the beginning of the\n\t      current word. For exact matches, completion continues to allow\n\t      other completers such as _expand to expand the pattern. The\n\t      standard add-space and prefix-hidden styles are observed.\n\n       _external_pwds\n\t      Completes current directories of other zsh processes belonging\n\t      to the current user.\n\n\t      This is intended to be used via _generic, bound to a custom key\n\t      combination. Note that pattern matching is enabled so matching\n\t      is performed similar to how it works with the _match completer.\n\n       _history\n\t      Complete words from the shell's command  history.  This\n\t      completer can be controlled by the remove-all-dups, and sort\n\t      styles as for the _history_complete_word bindable command, see\n\t      the section `Bindable Commands' below and the section\n\t      `Completion System Configuration' above.\n\n       _ignored\n\t      The ignored-patterns style can be set to a list of patterns\n\t      which are compared against possible completions; matching ones\n\t      are removed.  With this completer those matches can be\n\t      reinstated, as if no ignored-patterns style were set.  The\n\t      completer actually generates its own list of matches; which\n\t      completers are invoked is determined in the same way as for the\n\t      _prefix completer.  The single-ignored style is also available\n\t      as described above.\n\n       _list  This completer allows the insertion of matches to be delayed\n\t      until completion is attempted a second time without the word on\n\t      the line being changed.  On the first attempt, only the list of\n\t      matches will be shown.  It is affected by the styles condition\n\t      and word, see the section `Completion System Configuration'\n\t      above.\n\n       _match This completer is intended to be used after the _complete\n\t      completer.  It behaves similarly but the string on the command\n\t      line may be a pattern to match against trial completions.  This\n\t      gives the effect of the GLOB_COMPLETE option.\n\n\t      Normally completion will be performed by taking the pattern from\n\t      the line, inserting a `*' at the cursor position and comparing\n\t      the resulting pattern with the possible completions generated.\n\t      This can be modified with the match-original style described\n\t      above.\n\n\t      The generated matches will be offered in a menu completion\n\t      unless the insert-unambiguous style is set to `true'; see the\n\t      description above for other options for this style.\n\n\t      Note that matcher specifications defined globally or used by the\n\t      completion functions (the styles matcher-list and matcher) will\n\t      not be used.\n\n       _menu  This completer was written as simple example function to show\n\t      how menu completion can be enabled in shell code. However, it\n\t      has the notable effect of disabling menu selection which can be\n\t      useful with _generic based widgets. It should be used as the\n\t      first completer in the list.  Note that this is independent of\n\t      the setting of the MENU_COMPLETE option and does not work with\n\t      the other menu completion widgets such as reverse-menu-complete,\n\t      or accept-and-menu-complete.\n\n       _oldlist\n\t      This completer controls how the standard completion widgets\n\t      behave when there is an existing list of completions which may\n\t      have been generated by a special completion (i.e. a\n\t      separately-bound completion command).  It allows the ordinary\n\t      completion keys to continue to use the list of completions thus\n\t      generated, instead of producing a new list of ordinary\n\t      contextual completions.  It should appear in the list of\n\t      completers before any of the widgets which generate matches.  It\n\t      uses two styles: old-list and old-menu, see the section\n\t      `Completion System Configuration' above.\n\n       _precommand\n\t      Complete an external command in word-separated arguments, as for\n\t      exec and /usr/bin/env.\n\n       _prefix\n\t      This completer can be used to try completion with the suffix\n\t      (everything after the cursor) ignored.  In other words, the\n\t      suffix will not be considered to be part of the word to\n\t      complete.  The effect is similar to the\n\t      expand-or-complete-prefix command.\n\n\t      The completer style is used to decide which other completers are\n\t      to be called to generate matches.  If this style is unset, the\n\t      list of completers set for the current context is used --\n\t      except, of course, the _prefix completer itself.\tFurthermore,\n\t      if this completer appears more than once in the list of\n\t      completers only those completers not already tried by the last\n\t      invocation of _prefix will be called.\n\n\t      For example, consider this global completer style:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' completer \\\n\t\t\t _complete _prefix _correct _prefix:foo\n\n\t      Here, the _prefix completer tries normal completion but ignoring\n\t      the suffix.  If that doesn't generate any matches, and neither\n\t      does the call to the _correct completer after it, _prefix will\n\t      be called a second time and, now only trying correction with the\n\t      suffix ignored.  On the second invocation the completer part of\n\t      the context appears as `foo'.\n\n\t      To use _prefix as the last resort and try only normal completion\n\t      when it is invoked:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete ... _prefix\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion::prefix:*' completer _complete\n\n\t      The add-space style is also respected.  If it is set to `true'\n\t      then _prefix will insert a space between the matches generated\n\t      (if any) and the suffix.\n\n\t      Note that this completer is only useful if the COMPLETE_IN_WORD\n\t      option is set; otherwise, the cursor will be moved to the end of\n\t      the current word before the completion code is called and hence\n\t      there will be no suffix.\n\n       _user_expand\n\t      This completer behaves similarly to the _expand completer but\n\t      instead performs expansions defined by users.  The styles\n\t      add-space and sort styles specific to the _expand completer are\n\t      usable with _user_expand in addition to other styles handled\n\t      more generally by the completion system.\tThe tag all-expansions\n\t      is also available.\n\n\t      The expansion depends on the array style user-expand being\n\t      defined for the current context; remember that the context for\n\t      completers is less specific than that for contextual completion\n\t      as the full context has not yet been determined.\tElements of\n\t      the array may have one of the following forms:\n\n\t      $hash\n\n\t\t     hash is the name of an associative array.\tNote this is\n\t\t     not a full parameter expression, merely a $, suitably\n\t\t     quoted to prevent immediate expansion, followed by the\n\t\t     name of an associative array.  If the trial expansion\n\t\t     word matches a key in hash, the resulting expansion is\n\t\t     the corresponding value.\n\t      _func\n\n\t\t     _func is the name of a shell function whose name must\n\t\t     begin with _ but is not otherwise special to the\n\t\t     completion system.  The function is called with the trial\n\t\t     word as an argument.  If the word is to be expanded, the\n\t\t     function should set the array reply to a list of\n\t\t     expansions.  Optionally, it can set REPLY to a word that\n\t\t     will be used as a description for the set of expansions.\n\t\t     The return status of the function is irrelevant.\n\nBINDABLE COMMANDS\n       In addition to the context-dependent completions provided, which are\n       expected to work in an intuitively obvious way, there are a few widgets\n       implementing special behaviour which can be bound separately to keys.\n       The following is a list of these and their default bindings.\n\n       _bash_completions\n\t      This function is used by two widgets, _bash_complete-word and\n\t      _bash_list-choices.  It exists to provide compatibility with\n\t      completion bindings in bash.  The last character of the binding\n\t      determines what is completed: `!', command names; `$',\n\t      environment variables; `@', host names; `/', file names; `~'\n\t      user names.  In bash, the binding preceded by `\\e' gives\n\t      completion, and preceded by `^X' lists options.  As some of\n\t      these bindings clash with standard zsh bindings, only `\\e~' and\n\t      `^X~' are bound by default.  To add the rest, the following\n\t      should be added to .zshrc after compinit has been run:\n\n\t\t     for key in '!' '$' '@' '/' '~'; do\n\t\t       bindkey \"\\e$key\" _bash_complete-word\n\t\t       bindkey \"^X$key\" _bash_list-choices\n\t\t     done\n\n\t      This includes the bindings for `~' in case they were already\n\t      bound to something else; the completion code does not override\n\t      user bindings.\n\n       _correct_filename (^XC)\n\t      Correct the filename path at the cursor position.  Allows up to\n\t      six errors in the name.  Can also be called with an argument to\n\t      correct a filename path, independently of zle; the correction is\n\t      printed on standard output.\n\n       _correct_word (^Xc)\n\t      Performs correction of the current argument using the usual\n\t      contextual completions as possible choices. This stores the\n\t      string `correct-word' in the function field of the context name\n\t      and then calls the _correct completer.\n\n       _expand_alias (^Xa)\n\t      This function can be used as a completer and as a bindable\n\t      command.\tIt expands the word the cursor is on if it is an\n\t      alias.  The types of alias expanded can be controlled with the\n\t      styles regular, global and disabled.\n\n\t      When used as a bindable command there is one additional feature\n\t      that can be selected by setting the complete style to `true'.\n\t      In this case, if the word is not the name of an alias,\n\t      _expand_alias tries to complete the word to a full alias name\n\t      without expanding it.  It leaves the cursor directly after the\n\t      completed word so that invoking _expand_alias once more will\n\t      expand the now-complete alias name.\n\n       _expand_word (^Xe)\n\t      Performs expansion on the current word:  equivalent to the\n\t      standard expand-word command, but using the _expand completer.\n\t      Before calling it, the function field of the context is set to\n\t      `expand-word'.\n\n       _generic\n\t      This function is not defined as a widget and not bound by\n\t      default.\tHowever, it can be used to define a widget and will\n\t      then store the name of the widget in the function field of the\n\t      context and call the completion system.  This allows custom\n\t      completion widgets with their own set of style settings to be\n\t      defined easily.  For example, to define a widget that performs\n\t      normal completion and starts menu selection:\n\n\t\t     zle -C foo complete-word _generic\n\t\t     bindkey '...' foo\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:foo:*' menu yes select=1\n\n\t      Note in particular that the completer style may be set for the\n\t      context in order to change the set of functions used to generate\n\t      possible matches.  If _generic is called with arguments, those\n\t      are passed through to _main_complete as the list of completers\n\t      in place of those defined by the completer style.\n\n       _history_complete_word (\\e/)\n\t      Complete words from the shell's command history. This uses the\n\t      list, remove-all-dups, sort, and stop styles.\n\n       _most_recent_file (^Xm)\n\t      Complete the name of the most recently modified file matching\n\t      the pattern on the command line (which may be blank).  If given\n\t      a numeric argument N, complete the Nth most recently modified\n\t      file.  Note the completion, if any, is always unique.\n\n       _next_tags (^Xn)\n\t      This command alters the set of matches used to that for the next\n\t      tag, or set of tags, either as given by the tag-order style or\n\t      as set by default; these matches would otherwise not be\n\t      available.  Successive invocations of the command cycle through\n\t      all possible sets of tags.\n\n       _read_comp (^X^R)\n\t      Prompt the user for a string, and use that to perform completion\n\t      on the current word.  There are two possibilities for the\n\t      string.  First, it can be a set of words beginning `_', for\n\t      example `_files -/', in which case the function with any\n\t      arguments will be called to generate the completions.\n\t      Unambiguous parts of the function name will be completed\n\t      automatically (normal completion is not available at this point)\n\t      until a space is typed.\n\n\t      Second, any other string will be passed as a set of arguments to\n\t      compadd and should hence be an expression specifying what should\n\t      be completed.\n\n\t      A very restricted set of editing commands is available when\n\t      reading the string:  `DEL' and `^H' delete the last character;\n\t      `^U' deletes the line, and `^C' and `^G' abort the function,\n\t      while `RET' accepts the completion.  Note the string is used\n\t      verbatim as a command line, so arguments must be quoted in\n\t      accordance with standard shell rules.\n\n\t      Once a string has been read, the next call to _read_comp will\n\t      use the existing string instead of reading a new one.  To force\n\t      a new string to be read, call _read_comp with a numeric\n\t      argument.\n\n       _complete_debug (^X?)\n\t      This widget performs ordinary completion, but captures in a\n\t      temporary file a trace of the shell commands executed by the\n\t      completion system.  Each completion attempt gets its own file.\n\t      A command to view each of these files is pushed onto the editor\n\t      buffer stack.\n\n       _complete_help (^Xh)\n\t      This widget displays information about the context names, the\n\t      tags, and the completion functions used when completing at the\n\t      current cursor position. If given a numeric argument other than\n\t      1 (as in `ESC-2 ^Xh'), then the styles used and the contexts for\n\t      which they are used will be shown, too.\n\n\t      Note that the information about styles may be incomplete; it\n\t      depends on the information available from the completion\n\t      functions called, which in turn is determined by the user's own\n\t      styles and other settings.\n\n       _complete_help_generic\n\t      Unlike other commands listed here, this must be created as a\n\t      normal ZLE widget rather than a completion widget (i.e. with zle\n\t      -N).  It is used for generating help with a widget bound to the\n\t      _generic widget that is described above.\n\n\t      If this widget is created using the name of the function, as it\n\t      is by default, then when executed it will read a key sequence.\n\t      This is expected to be bound to a call to a completion function\n\t      that uses the _generic widget.  That widget will be executed,\n\t      and information provided in the same format that the\n\t      _complete_help widget displays for contextual completion.\n\n\t      If the widget's name contains debug, for example if it is\n\t      created as `zle -N _complete_debug_generic\n\t      _complete_help_generic', it will read and execute the keystring\n\t      for a generic widget as before, but then generate debugging\n\t      information as done by _complete_debug for contextual\n\t      completion.\n\n\t      If the widget's name contains noread, it will not read a\n\t      keystring but instead arrange that the next use of a generic\n\t      widget run in the same shell will have the effect as described\n\t      above.\n\n\t      The widget works by setting the shell parameter\n\t      ZSH_TRACE_GENERIC_WIDGET which is read by _generic.  Unsetting\n\t      the parameter cancels any pending effect of the noread form.\n\n\t      For example, after executing the following:\n\n\t\t     zle -N _complete_debug_generic _complete_help_generic\n\t\t     bindkey '^x:' _complete_debug_generic\n\n\t      typing `C-x :' followed by the key sequence for a generic widget\n\t      will cause trace output for that widget to be saved to a file.\n\n       _complete_tag (^Xt)\n\t      This widget completes symbol tags created by the etags or ctags\n\t      programmes (note there is no connection with the completion\n\t      system's tags) stored in a file TAGS, in the format used by\n\t      etags, or tags, in the format created by ctags.  It will look\n\t      back up the path hierarchy for the first occurrence of either\n\t      file; if both exist, the file TAGS is preferred.\tYou can\n\t      specify the full path to a TAGS or tags file by setting the\n\t      parameter $TAGSFILE or $tagsfile respectively.  The\n\t      corresponding completion tags used are etags and vtags, after\n\t      emacs and vi respectively.\n\nUTILITY FUNCTIONS\n       Descriptions follow for utility functions that may be useful when\n       writing completion functions.  If functions are installed in\n       subdirectories, most of these reside in the Base subdirectory.  Like\n       the example functions for commands in the distribution, the utility\n       functions generating matches all follow the convention of returning\n       status zero if they generated completions and non-zero if no matching\n       completions could be added.\n\n       _absolute_command_paths\n\t      This function completes external commands as absolute paths\n\t      (unlike _command_names -e which completes their basenames).  It\n\t      takes no arguments.\n\n       _all_labels [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ command arg ... ]\n\t      This is a convenient interface to the _next_label function\n\t      below, implementing the loop shown in the _next_label example.\n\t      The command and its arguments are called to generate the\n\t      matches.\tThe options stored in the parameter name will\n\t      automatically be inserted into the args passed to the command.\n\t      Normally, they are put directly after the command, but if one of\n\t      the args is a single hyphen, they are inserted directly before\n\t      that.  If the hyphen is the last argument, it will be removed\n\t      from the argument list before the command is called.  This\n\t      allows _all_labels to be used in almost all cases where the\n\t      matches can be generated by a single call to the compadd builtin\n\t      command or by a call to one of the utility functions.\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     local expl\n\t\t     ...\n\t\t     if _requested foo; then\n\t\t       ...\n\t\t       _all_labels foo expl '...' compadd ... - $matches\n\t\t     fi\n\n\t      Will complete the strings from the matches parameter, using\n\t      compadd with additional options which will take precedence over\n\t      those generated by _all_labels.\n\n       _alternative [ -O name ] [ -C name ] spec ...\n\t      This function is useful in simple cases where multiple tags are\n\t      available.  Essentially it implements a loop like the one\n\t      described for the _tags function below.\n\n\t      The tags to use and the action to perform if a tag is requested\n\t      are described using the specs which are of the form:\n\t      `tag:descr:action'.  The tags are offered using _tags and if the\n\t      tag is requested, the action is executed with the given\n\t      description descr.  The actions are those accepted by the\n\t      _arguments function (described below), with the following\n\t      exceptions:\n\t      •      The `->state' and `=...' forms are not supported."

The options are followed by specs that describe\n\t      options and arguments of the analyzed command.  To avoid\n\t      ambiguity, all options to _arguments itself may be separated\n\t      from the spec forms by a single colon.\n\n\t      The `--' form is used to intuit spec forms from the help output\n\t      of the command being analyzed, and is described in detail below.\n\t      The opts for the `--' form are otherwise the same options as the\n\t      first form.  Note that `-s' following `--' has a distinct\n\t      meaning from `-s' preceding `--', and both may appear.\n\n\t      The option switches -s, -S, -A, -w, and -W affect how _arguments\n\t      parses the analyzed command line's options.  These switches are\n\t      useful for commands with standard argument parsing.\n\n\t      The options of _arguments have the following meanings:\n\n\t      -n     With this option, _arguments sets the parameter NORMARG\n\t\t     to the position of the first normal argument in the\n\t\t     $words array, i.e. the position after the end of the\n\t\t     options.  If that argument has not been reached, NORMARG\n\t\t     is set to -1.  The caller should declare `integer\n\t\t     NORMARG' if the -n option is passed; otherwise the\n\t\t     parameter is not used.\n\n\t      -s     Enable option stacking for single-letter options, whereby\n\t\t     multiple single-letter options may be combined into a\n\t\t     single word.  For example, the two options `-x' and `-y'\n\t\t     may be combined into a single word `-xy'.\tBy default,\n\t\t     every word corresponds to a single option name (`-xy' is\n\t\t     a single option named `xy').\n\n\t\t     Options beginning with a single hyphen or plus sign are\n\t\t     eligible for stacking; words beginning with two hyphens\n\t\t     are not.\n\n\t\t     Note that -s after -- has a different meaning, which is\n\t\t     documented in the segment entitled `Deriving spec forms\n\t\t     from the help output'.\n\n\t      -w     In combination with -s, allow option stacking even if one\n\t\t     or more of the options take arguments.  For example, if\n\t\t     -x takes an argument, with no -s, `-xy' is considered as\n\t\t     a single (unhandled) option; with -s, -xy is an option\n\t\t     with the argument `y'; with both -s and -w, -xy is the\n\t\t     option -x and the option -y with arguments to -x (and to\n\t\t     -y, if it takes arguments) still to come in subsequent\n\t\t     words.\n\n\t      -W     This option takes -w a stage further:  it is possible to\n\t\t     complete single-letter options even after an argument\n\t\t     that occurs in the same word.  However, it depends on the\n\t\t     action performed whether options will really be completed\n\t\t     at this point.  For more control, use a utility function\n\t\t     like _guard as part of the action.\n\n\t      -C     Modify the curcontext parameter for an action of the form\n\t\t     `->state'.  This is discussed in detail below.\n\n\t      -R     Return status 300 instead of zero when a $state is to be\n\t\t     handled, in the `->string' syntax.\n\n\t      -S     Do not complete options after a `--' appearing on the\n\t\t     line, and ignore the `--'.  For example, with -S, in the\n\t\t     line\n\n\t\t\t    foobar -x -- -y\n\n\t\t     the `-x' is considered an option, the `-y' is considered\n\t\t     an argument, and the `--' is considered to be neither.\n\n\t      -A pat Do not complete options after the first non-option\n\t\t     argument on the line.  pat is a pattern matching all\n\t\t     strings which are not to be taken as arguments.  For\n\t\t     example, to make _arguments stop completing options after\n\t\t     the first normal argument, but ignoring all strings\n\t\t     starting with a hyphen even if they are not described by\n\t\t     one of the optspecs, the form is `-A \"-*\"'.\n\n\t      -O name\n\t\t     Pass the elements of the array name as arguments to\n\t\t     functions called to execute actions.  This is discussed\n\t\t     in detail below.\n\n\t      -M matchspec\n\t\t     Use the match specification matchspec for completing\n\t\t     option names and values.  The default matchspec allows\n\t\t     partial word completion after `_' and `-', such as\n\t\t     completing `-f-b' to `-foo-bar'.  The default matchspec\n\t\t     is:\n\t\t     r:|[_-]=* r:|=*\n\n\t      -0     When populating values of the `opt_args' associative\n\t\t     array, don't backslash-escape colons and backslashes and\n\t\t     use NUL rather than colon for joining multiple values.\n\t\t     This option is described in more detail below, under the\n\t\t     heading specs: actions.\n\n\t      specs: overview\n\n\t      Each of the following forms is a spec describing individual sets\n\t      of options or arguments on the command line being analyzed.\n\n\t      n:message:action\n\t      n::message:action\n\t\t     This describes the n'th normal argument.  The message\n\t\t     will be printed above the matches generated and the\n\t\t     action indicates what can be completed in this position\n\t\t     (see below).  If there are two colons before the message\n\t\t     the argument is optional.\tIf the message contains only\n\t\t     white space, nothing will be printed above the matches\n\t\t     unless the action adds an explanation string itself.\n\n\t      :message:action\n\t      ::message:action\n\t\t     Similar, but describes the next argument, whatever number\n\t\t     that happens to be.  If all arguments are specified in\n\t\t     this form in the correct order the numbers are\n\t\t     unnecessary.\n\n\t      *:message:action\n\t      *::message:action\n\t      *:::message:action\n\t\t     This describes how arguments (usually non-option\n\t\t     arguments, those not beginning with - or +) are to be\n\t\t     completed when neither of the first two forms was\n\t\t     provided.\tAny number of arguments can be completed in\n\t\t     this fashion.\n\n\t\t     With two colons before the message, the words special\n\t\t     array and the CURRENT special parameter are modified to\n\t\t     refer only to the normal arguments when the action is\n\t\t     executed or evaluated.  With three colons before the\n\t\t     message they are modified to refer only to the normal\n\t\t     arguments covered by this description.\n\n\t      optspec\n\t      optspec:...\n\t\t     This describes an option.\tThe colon indicates handling\n\t\t     for one or more arguments to the option; if it is not\n\t\t     present, the option is assumed to take no arguments.\n\n\t\t     The following forms are available for the initial\n\t\t     optspec, whether or not the option has arguments.\n\n\t\t     *optspec\n\t\t\t    Here optspec is one of the remaining forms below.\n\t\t\t    This indicates the following optspec may be\n\t\t\t    repeated.  Otherwise if the corresponding option\n\t\t\t    is already present on the command line to the left\n\t\t\t    of the cursor it will not be offered again.\n\n\t\t     -optname\n\t\t     +optname\n\t\t\t    In the simplest form the optspec is just the\n\t\t\t    option name beginning with a minus or a plus sign,\n\t\t\t    such as `-foo'.  The first argument for the option\n\t\t\t    (if any) must follow as a separate word directly\n\t\t\t    after the option.\n\n\t\t\t    Either of `-+optname' and `+-optname' can be used\n\t\t\t    to specify that -optname and +optname are both\n\t\t\t    valid.\n\n\t\t\t    In all the remaining forms, the leading `-' may be\n\t\t\t    replaced by or paired with `+' in this way.\n\n\t\t     -optname-\n\t\t\t    The first argument of the option must come\n\t\t\t    directly after the option name in the same word.\n\t\t\t    For example, `-foo-:...' specifies that the\n\t\t\t    completed option and argument will look like\n\t\t\t    `-fooarg'.\n\n\t\t     -optname+\n\t\t\t    The first argument may appear immediately after\n\t\t\t    optname in the same word, or may appear as a\n\t\t\t    separate word after the option.  For example,\n\t\t\t    `-foo+:...' specifies that the completed option\n\t\t\t    and argument will look like either `-fooarg' or\n\t\t\t    `-foo arg'.\n\n\t\t     -optname=\n\t\t\t    The argument may appear as the next word, or in\n\t\t\t    same word as the option name provided that it is\n\t\t\t    separated from it by an equals sign, for example\n\t\t\t    `-foo=arg' or `-foo arg'.\n\n\t\t     -optname=-\n\t\t\t    The argument to the option must appear after an\n\t\t\t    equals sign in the same word, and may not be given\n\t\t\t    in the next argument.\n\n\t\t     optspec[explanation]\n\t\t\t    An explanation string may be appended to any of\n\t\t\t    the preceding forms of optspec by enclosing it in\n\t\t\t    brackets, as in `-q[query operation]'.\n\n\t\t\t    The verbose style is used to decide whether the\n\t\t\t    explanation strings are displayed with the option\n\t\t\t    in a completion listing.\n\n\t\t\t    If no bracketed explanation string is given but\n\t\t\t    the auto-description style is set and only one\n\t\t\t    argument is described for this optspec, the value\n\t\t\t    of the style is displayed, with any appearance of\n\t\t\t    the sequence `%d' in it replaced by the message of\n\t\t\t    the first optarg that follows the optspec; see\n\t\t\t    below.\n\n\t\t     It is possible for options with a literal `+' or `=' to\n\t\t     appear, but that character must be quoted, for example\n\t\t     `-\\+'.\n\n\t\t     Each optarg following an optspec must take one of the\n\t\t     following forms:\n\n\t\t     :message:action\n\t\t     ::message:action\n\t\t\t    An argument to the option; message and action are\n\t\t\t    treated as for ordinary arguments.\tIn the first\n\t\t\t    form, the argument is mandatory, and in the second\n\t\t\t    form it is optional.\n\n\t\t\t    This group may be repeated for options which take\n\t\t\t    multiple arguments.  In other words,\n\t\t\t    :message1:action1:message2:action2 specifies that\n\t\t\t    the option takes two arguments.\n\n\t\t     :*pattern:message:action\n\t\t     :*pattern::message:action\n\t\t     :*pattern:::message:action\n\t\t\t    This describes multiple arguments.\tOnly the last\n\t\t\t    optarg for an option taking multiple arguments may\n\t\t\t    be given in this form.  If the pattern is empty\n\t\t\t    (i.e. :*:), all the remaining words on the line\n\t\t\t    are to be completed as described by the action;\n\t\t\t    otherwise, all the words up to and including a\n\t\t\t    word matching the pattern are to be completed\n\t\t\t    using the action.\n\n\t\t\t    Multiple colons are treated as for the `*:...'\n\t\t\t    forms for ordinary arguments:  when the message is\n\t\t\t    preceded by two colons, the words special array\n\t\t\t    and the CURRENT special parameter are modified\n\t\t\t    during the execution or evaluation of the action\n\t\t\t    to refer only to the words after the option.  When\n\t\t\t    preceded by three colons, they are modified to\n\t\t\t    refer only to the words covered by this\n\t\t\t    description.\n\n\t      Any literal colon in an optname, message, or action must be\n\t      preceded by a backslash, `\\:'.\n\n\t      Each of the forms above may be preceded by a list in parentheses\n\t      of option names and argument numbers.  If the given option is on\n\t      the command line, the options and arguments indicated in\n\t      parentheses will not be offered.\tFor example, `(-two -three\n\t      1)-one:...' completes the option `-one'; if this appears on the\n\t      command line, the options -two and -three and the first ordinary\n\t      argument will not be completed after it.\t`(-foo):...' specifies\n\t      an ordinary argument completion; -foo will not be completed if\n\t      that argument is already present.\n\n\t      Other items may appear in the list of excluded options to\n\t      indicate various other items that should not be applied when the\n\t      current specification is matched: a single star (*) for the rest\n\t      arguments (i.e. a specification of the form `*:...'); a colon\n\t      (:) for all normal (non-option-) arguments; and a hyphen (-) for\n\t      all options.  For example, if `(*)' appears before an option and\n\t      the option appears on the command line, the list of remaining\n\t      arguments (those shown in the above table beginning with `*:')\n\t      will not be completed.\n\n\t      To aid in reuse of specifications, it is possible to precede any\n\t      of the forms above with `!'; then the form will no longer be\n\t      completed, although if the option or argument appears on the\n\t      command line they will be skipped as normal.  The main use for\n\t      this is when the arguments are given by an array, and _arguments\n\t      is called repeatedly for more specific contexts: on the first\n\t      call `_arguments $global_options' is used, and on subsequent\n\t      calls `_arguments !$^global_options'.\n\n\t      specs: actions"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshcompsys`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n{eval-string}\n\t\t     A string in braces is evaluated as shell code to generate\n\t\t     matches.  If the eval-string itself does not begin with\n\t\t     an opening parenthesis or brace it is split into separate\n\t\t     words before execution.\n\n\t      = action\n\t\t     If the action starts with `= ' (an equals sign followed\n\t\t     by a space), _arguments will insert the contents of the\n\t\t     argument field of the current context as the new first\n\t\t     element in the words special array and increment the\n\t\t     value of the CURRENT special parameter.  This has the\n\t\t     effect of inserting a dummy word onto the completion\n\t\t     command line while not changing the point at which\n\t\t     completion is taking place.\n\n\t\t     This is most useful with one of the specifiers that\n\t\t     restrict the words on the command line on which the\n\t\t     action is to operate (the two- and three-colon forms\n\t\t     above).  One particular use is when an action itself\n\t\t     causes _arguments on a restricted range; it is necessary\n\t\t     to use this trick to insert an appropriate command name\n\t\t     into the range for the second call to _arguments to be\n\t\t     able to parse the line.\n\n\t       word...\n\t      word...\n\t\t     This covers all forms other than those above.  If the\n\t\t     action starts with a space, the remaining list of words\n\t\t     will be invoked unchanged.\n\n\t\t     Otherwise it will be invoked with some extra strings\n\t\t     placed after the first word; these are to be passed down\n\t\t     as options to the compadd builtin.  They ensure that the\n\t\t     state specified by _arguments, in particular the\n\t\t     descriptions of options and arguments, is correctly\n\t\t     passed to the completion command.\tThese additional\n\t\t     arguments are taken from the array parameter `expl'; this\n\t\t     will be set up before executing the action and hence may\n\t\t     be referred to inside it, typically in an expansion of\n\t\t     the form `$expl[@]' which preserves empty elements of the\n\t\t     array.\n\n\t      During the performance of the action the array `line' will be\n\t      set to the normal arguments from the command line, i.e. the\n\t      words from the command line after the command name excluding all\n\t      options and their arguments.  Options are stored in the\n\t      associative array `opt_args' with option names as keys and their\n\t      arguments as the values.\tBy default, all colons and backslashes\n\t      in the value are escaped with backslashes, and if an option has\n\t      multiple arguments (for example, when using an optspec of the\n\t      form `*optspec'), they are joined with (unescaped) colons.\n\t      However, if the -0 option was passed, no backslash escaping is\n\t      performed, and multiple values are joined with NUL bytes.  For\n\t      example, after `zsh -o foo:foo -o bar:bar -o <TAB>', the\n\t      contents of `opt_args' would be\n\n\t\t     typeset -A opt_args=( [-o]='foo\\:foo:bar\\:bar:' )\n\n\t      by default, and\n\n\t\t     typeset -A opt_args=( [-o]=$'foo:foo\\x00bar:bar\\x00' )\n\n\t      if _arguments had been called with the -0 option.\n\n\t      The parameter `context' is set when returning to the calling\n\t      function to perform an action of the form `->string'.  It is set\n\t      to an array of elements corresponding to the elements of $state.\n\t      Each element is a suitable name for the argument field of the\n\t      context: either a string of the form `option-opt-n' for the n'th\n\t      argument of the option -opt, or a string of the form\n\t      `argument-n' for the n'th argument.  For `rest' arguments, that\n\t      is those in the list at the end not handled by position, n is\n\t      the string `rest'.  For example, when completing the argument of\n\t      the -o option, the name is `option-o-1', while for the second\n\t      normal (non-option-) argument it is `argument-2'.\n\n\t      Furthermore, during the evaluation of the action the context\n\t      name in the curcontext parameter is altered to append the same\n\t      string that is stored in the context parameter.\n\n\t      The option -C tells _arguments to modify the curcontext\n\t      parameter for an action of the form `->state'.  This is the\n\t      standard parameter used to keep track of the current context.\n\t      Here it (and not the context array) should be made local to the\n\t      calling function to avoid passing back the modified value and\n\t      should be initialised to the current value at the start of the\n\t      function:\n\n\t\t     local curcontext=\"$curcontext\"\n\n\t      This is useful where it is not possible for multiple states to\n\t      be valid together.\n\n\t      Grouping Options\n\n\t      Options can be grouped to simplify exclusion lists. A group is\n\t      introduced with `+' followed by a name for the group in the\n\t      subsequent word. Whole groups can then be referenced in an\n\t      exclusion list or a group name can be used to disambiguate\n\t      between two forms of the same option. For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments \\\n\t\t\t '(group2--x)-a' \\\n\t\t       + group1 \\\n\t\t\t -m \\\n\t\t\t '(group2)-n' \\\n\t\t       + group2 \\\n\t\t\t -x -y\n\n\t      If the name of a group is specified in the form `(name)' then\n\t      only one value from that group will ever be completed; more\n\t      formally, all specifications are mutually exclusive to all other\n\t      specifications in that group. This is useful for defining\n\t      options that are aliases for each other. For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments \\\n\t\t\t -a -b \\\n\t\t       + '(operation)' \\\n\t\t\t {-c,--compress}'[compress]' \\\n\t\t\t {-d,--decompress}'[decompress]' \\\n\t\t\t {-l,--list}'[list]'\n\n\t      If an option in a group appears on the command line, it is\n\t      stored in the associative array `opt_args' with 'group-option'\n\t      as a key.  In the example above, a key `operation--c' is used if\n\t      the option `-c' is present on the command line.\n\n\t      Specifying Multiple Sets of Arguments\n\n\t      It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and arguments\n\t      with the sets separated by single hyphens. This differs from\n\t      groups in that sets are considered to be mutually exclusive of\n\t      each other.\n\n\t      Specifications before the first set and from any group are\n\t      common to all sets. For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments \\\n\t\t\t -a \\\n\t\t       - set1 \\\n\t\t\t -c \\\n\t\t       - set2 \\\n\t\t\t -d \\\n\t\t\t ':arg:(x2 y2)'\n\n\t      This defines two sets.  When the command line contains the\n\t      option `-c', the `-d' option and the argument will not be\n\t      considered possible completions.\tWhen it contains `-d' or an\n\t      argument, the option `-c' will not be considered.  However,\n\t      after `-a' both sets will still be considered valid.\n\n\t      As for groups, the name of a set may appear in exclusion lists,\n\t      either alone or preceding a normal option or argument\n\t      specification.\n\n\t      The completion code has to parse the command line separately for\n\t      each set. This can be slow so sets should only be used when\n\t      necessary.  A useful alternative is often an option\n\t      specification with rest-arguments (as in `-foo:*:...'); here the\n\t      option -foo swallows up all remaining arguments as described by\n\t      the optarg definitions.\n\n\t      Deriving spec forms from the help output\n\n\t      The option `--' allows _arguments to work out the names of long\n\t      options that support the `--help' option which is standard in\n\t      many GNU commands.  The command word is called with the argument\n\t      `--help' and the output examined for option names.  Clearly, it\n\t      can be dangerous to pass this to commands which may not support\n\t      this option as the behaviour of the command is unspecified.\n\n\t      In addition to options, `_arguments --' will try to deduce the\n\t      types of arguments available for options when the form\n\t      `--opt=val' is valid.  It is also possible to provide hints by\n\t      examining the help text of the command and adding helpspec of\n\t      the form `pattern:message:action'; note that other _arguments\n\t      spec forms are not used.\tThe pattern is matched against the\n\t      help text for an option, and if it matches the message and\n\t      action are used as for other argument specifiers.  The special\n\t      case of `*:' means both message and action are empty, which has\n\t      the effect of causing options having no description in the help\n\t      output to be ordered in listings ahead of options that have a\n\t      description.\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     _arguments -- '*\\*:toggle:(yes no)' \\\n\t\t\t\t   '*=FILE*:file:_files' \\\n\t\t\t\t   '*=DIR*:directory:_files -/' \\\n\t\t\t\t   '*=PATH*:directory:_files -/'\n\n\t      Here, `yes' and `no' will be completed as the argument of\n\t      options whose description ends in a star; file names will be\n\t      completed for options that contain the substring `=FILE' in the\n\t      description; and directories will be completed for options whose\n\t      description contains `=DIR' or `=PATH'.  The last three are in\n\t      fact the default and so need not be given explicitly, although\n\t      it is possible to override the use of these patterns.  A typical\n\t      help text which uses this feature is:\n\n\t\t       -C, --directory=DIR\t    change to directory DIR\n\n\t      so that the above specifications will cause directories to be\n\t      completed after `--directory', though not after `-C'.\n\n\t      Note also that _arguments tries to find out automatically if the\n\t      argument for an option is optional.  This can be specified\n\t      explicitly by doubling the colon before the message.\n\n\t      If the pattern ends in `(-)', this will be removed from the\n\t      pattern and the action will be used only directly after the `=',\n\t      not in the next word.  This is the behaviour of a normal\n\t      specification defined with the form `=-'.\n\n\t      By default, the command (with the option `--help') is run after\n\t      resetting all the locale categories (except for LC_CTYPE) to\n\t      `C'.  If the localized help output is known to work, the option\n\t      `-l' can be specified after the `_arguments --' so that the\n\t      command is run in the current locale.\n\n\t      The `_arguments --' can be followed by the option `-i patterns'\n\t      to give patterns for options which are not to be completed.  The\n\t      patterns can be given as the name of an array parameter or as a\n\t      literal list in parentheses.  For example,\n\n\t\t     _arguments -- -i \\\n\t\t\t \"(--(en|dis)able-FEATURE*)\"\n\n\t      will cause completion to ignore the options `--enable-FEATURE'\n\t      and `--disable-FEATURE' (this example is useful with GNU\n\t      configure).\n\n\t      The `_arguments --' form can also be followed by the option `-s\n\t      pair' to describe option aliases.  The pair consists of a list\n\t      of alternating patterns and corresponding replacements, enclosed\n\t      in parens and quoted so that it forms a single argument word in\n\t      the _arguments call.\n\n\t      For example, some configure-script help output describes options\n\t      only as `--enable-foo', but the script also accepts the negated\n\t      form `--disable-foo'.  To allow completion of the second form:\n\n\t\t     _arguments -- -s \"((#s)--enable- --disable-)\"\n\n\t      Miscellaneous notes\n\n\t      Finally, note that _arguments generally expects to be the\n\t      primary function handling any completion for which it is used.\n\t      It may have side effects which change the treatment of any\n\t      matches added by other functions called after it.  To combine\n\t      _arguments with other functions, those functions should be\n\t      called either before _arguments, as an action within a spec, or\n\t      in handlers for `->state' actions.\n\n\t      Here is a more general example of the use of _arguments:\n\n\t\t     _arguments '-l+:left border:' \\\n\t\t\t\t'-format:paper size:(letter A4)' \\\n\t\t\t\t'*-copy:output file:_files::resolution:(300 600)' \\\n\t\t\t\t':postscript file:_files -g \\*.\\(ps\\|eps\\)' \\\n\t\t\t\t'*:page number:'\n\n\t      This describes three options: `-l', `-format', and `-copy'.  The\n\t      first takes one argument described as `left border' for which no\n\t      completion will be offered because of the empty action.  Its\n\t      argument may come directly after the `-l' or it may be given as\n\t      the next word on the line.\n\n\t      The `-format' option takes one argument in the next word,\n\t      described as `paper size' for which only the strings `letter'\n\t      and `A4' will be completed.\n\n\t      The `-copy' option may appear more than once on the command line\n\t      and takes two arguments.\tThe first is mandatory and will be\n\t      completed as a filename.\tThe second is optional (because of the\n\t      second colon before the description `resolution') and will be\n\t      completed from the strings `300' and `600'.\n\n\t      The last two descriptions say what should be completed as\n\t      arguments.  The first describes the first argument as a\n\t      `postscript file' and makes files ending in `ps' or `eps' be\n\t      completed.  The last description gives all other arguments the\n\t      description `page number' but does not offer completions.\n\n       _cache_invalid cache_identifier\n\t      This function returns status zero if the completions cache\n\t      corresponding to the given cache identifier needs rebuilding.\n\t      It determines this by looking up the cache-policy style for the\n\t      current context.\tThis should provide a function name which is\n\t      run with the full path to the relevant cache file as the only\n\t      argument.\n\n\t      Example:\n\n\t\t     _example_caching_policy () {\n\t\t\t # rebuild if cache is more than a week old\n\t\t\t local -a oldp\n\t\t\t oldp=( \"$1\"(Nm+7) )\n\t\t\t (( $#oldp ))\n\t\t     }\n\n       _call_function return name [ arg ... ]\n\t      If a function name exists, it is called with the arguments args.\n\t      The return argument gives the name of a parameter in which the\n\t      return status from the function name should be stored; if return\n\t      is empty or a single hyphen it is ignored.\n\n\t      The return status of _call_function itself is zero if the\n\t      function name exists and was called and non-zero otherwise.\n\n       _call_program [ -l ] [ -p ] tag string ...\n\t      This function provides a mechanism for the user to override the\n\t      use of an external command.  It looks up the command style with\n\t      the supplied tag.  If the style is set, its value is used as the\n\t      command to execute.  The strings from the call to _call_program,\n\t      or from the style if set, are concatenated with spaces between\n\t      them and the resulting string is evaluated.  The return status\n\t      is the return status of the command called.\n\n\t      By default, the command is run in an environment where all the\n\t      locale categories (except for LC_CTYPE) are reset to `C' by\n\t      calling the utility function _comp_locale (see below). If the\n\t      option `-l' is given, the command is run with the current\n\t      locale.\n\n\t      If the option `-p' is supplied it indicates that the command\n\t      output is influenced by the permissions it is run with. If the\n\t      gain-privileges style is set to true, _call_program will make\n\t      use of commands such as sudo, if present on the command-line, to\n\t      match the permissions to whatever the final command is likely to\n\t      run under. When looking up the gain-privileges and command\n\t      styles, the command component of the zstyle context will end\n\t      with a slash (`/') followed by the command that would be used to\n\t      gain privileges.\n\n       _combination [ -s pattern ] tag style spec ... field opts ...\n\t      This function is used to complete combinations of values,  for\n\t      example pairs of hostnames and usernames.  The style argument\n\t      gives the style which defines the pairs; it is looked up in a\n\t      context with the tag specified.\n\n\t      The style name consists of field names separated by hyphens, for\n\t      example `users-hosts-ports'.  For each field for a value is\n\t      already known, a spec of the form `field=pattern' is given.  For\n\t      example, if the command line so far specifies a user `pws', the\n\t      argument `users=pws' should appear.\n\n\t      The next argument with no equals sign is taken as the name of\n\t      the field for which completions should be generated (presumably\n\t      not one of the fields for which the value is known).\n\n\t      The matches generated will be taken from the value of the style.\n\t      These should contain the possible values for the combinations in\n\t      the appropriate order (users, hosts, ports in the example\n\t      above).  The values for the different fields are separated by\n\t      colons.  This can be altered with the option -s to _combination\n\t      which specifies a pattern.  Typically this is a character class,\n\t      as for example `-s \"[:@]\"' in the case of the users-hosts style.\n\t      Each `field=pattern' specification restricts the completions\n\t      which apply to elements of the style with appropriately matching\n\t      fields.\n\n\t      If no style with the given name is defined for the given tag, or\n\t      if none of the strings in style's value match, but a function\n\t      name of the required field preceded by an underscore is defined,\n\t      that function will be called to generate the matches.  For\n\t      example, if there is no `users-hosts-ports' or no matching\n\t      hostname when a host is required, the function `_hosts' will\n\t      automatically be called.\n\n\t      If the same name is used for more than one field, in both the\n\t      `field=pattern' and the argument that gives the name of the\n\t      field to be completed, the number of the field (starting with\n\t      one) may be given after the fieldname, separated from it by a\n\t      colon.\n\n\t      All arguments after the required field name are passed to\n\t      compadd when generating matches from the style value, or to the\n\t      functions for the fields if they are called.\n\n       _command_names [ -e | - ]\n\t      This function completes words that are valid at command\n\t      position: names of aliases, builtins, hashed commands,\n\t      functions, and so on.  With the -e flag, only hashed commands\n\t      are completed.  The - flag is ignored.\n\n       _comp_locale\n\t      This function resets all the locale categories other than\n\t      LC_CTYPE to `C' so that the output from external commands can be\n\t      easily analyzed by the completion system. LC_CTYPE retains the\n\t      current value (taking LC_ALL and LANG into account), ensuring\n\t      that non-ASCII characters in file names are still handled\n\t      properly.\n\n\t      This function should normally be run only in a subshell, because\n\t      the new locale is exported to the environment. Typical usage\n\t      would be `$(_comp_locale; command ...)'.\n\n       _completers [ -p ]\n\t      This function completes names of completers.\n\n\t      -p     Include the leading underscore (`_') in the matches.\n\n       _default\n\t      This function corresponds to the -default- special context which\n\t      is applied where no completion is defined.  It is useful to call\n\t      it under certain error conditions such as completion after an\n\t      unrecognised subcommand.\tThis applies the concept of graceful\n\t      degradation to the completion system, allowing it to fallback on\n\t      basic completion of commonly useful things like filenames."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshcompsys`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n_description [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ spec ... ]\n\t      This function is not to be confused with the previous one; it is\n\t      used as a helper function for creating options to compadd.  It\n\t      is buried inside many of the higher level completion functions\n\t      and so often does not need to be called directly.\n\n\t      The styles listed below are tested in the current context using\n\t      the given tag.  The resulting options for compadd are put into\n\t      the array named name (this is traditionally `expl', but this\n\t      convention is not enforced).  The description for the\n\t      corresponding set of matches is passed to the function in descr.\n\n\t      The styles tested are: format, hidden, matcher, ignore-line,\n\t      ignored-patterns, group-name and sort.  The format style is\n\t      first tested for the given tag and then for the descriptions tag\n\t      if no value was found, while the remainder are only tested for\n\t      the tag given as the first argument.  The function also calls\n\t      _setup which tests some more styles.\n\n\t      The string returned by the format style (if any) will be\n\t      modified so that the sequence `%d' is replaced by the descr\n\t      given as the third argument without any leading or trailing\n\t      white space.  If, after removing the white space, the descr is\n\t      the empty string, the format style will not be used and the\n\t      options put into the name array will not contain an explanation\n\t      string to be displayed above the matches.\n\n\t      If _description is called with more than three arguments, the\n\t      additional specs should be of the form `char:str'.  These supply\n\t      escape sequence replacements for the format style: every\n\t      appearance of `%char' will be replaced by string.  If no\n\t      additional specs are given but the description in descr conforms\n\t      to a common form then further escape sequences are set for\n\t      elements of that description.  These elements correspond to a\n\t      default value (`%o'), the units (`%m') range of acceptable\n\t      values (`%r') and the remaining initial part of the description\n\t      (`%h').  The form the description takes consists of specifying\n\t      the units and range in parentheses and the default value in\n\t      square brackets, for example:\n\n\t\t     _description times expl 'timeout (seconds) (0-60) [20]'\n\n\t      It is possible to use zformat conditional expressions when\n\t      styling these elements. So, for example, to add `default:' as a\n\t      tag but only when there is a default value to show, the format\n\t      style might include `%(o.default: %o.)'.\n\n\t      If the -x option is given, the description will be passed to\n\t      compadd using the -x option instead of the default -X.  This\n\t      means that the description will be displayed even if there are\n\t      no corresponding matches.\n\n\t      The options placed in the array name take account of the\n\t      group-name style, so matches are placed in a separate group\n\t      where necessary.\tThe group normally has its elements sorted (by\n\t      passing the option -J to compadd), but if an option starting\n\t      with `-V', `-J', `-1', or `-2' is passed to _description, that\n\t      option will be included in the array.  Hence it is possible for\n\t      the completion group to be unsorted by giving the option `-V',\n\t      `-1V', or `-2V'.\n\n\t      In most cases, the function will be used like this:\n\n\t\t     local expl\n\t\t     _description files expl file\n\t\t     compadd \"$expl[@]\" - \"$files[@]\"\n\n\t      Note the use of the parameter expl, the hyphen, and the list of\n\t      matches.\tAlmost all calls to compadd within the completion\n\t      system use a similar format; this ensures that user-specified\n\t      styles are correctly passed down to the builtins which implement\n\t      the internals of completion.\n\n       _dir_list [ -s sep ] [ -S ]\n\t      Complete a list of directory names separated by colons (the same\n\t      format as $PATH).\n\n\t      -s sep Use sep as separator between items.  sep defaults to a\n\t\t     colon (`:').\n\n\t      -S     Add sep instead of slash (`/') as an autoremoveable\n\t\t     suffix.\n\n       _dispatch context string ...\n\t      This sets the current context to context and looks for\n\t      completion functions to handle this context by hunting through\n\t      the list of command names or special contexts (as described\n\t      above for compdef) given as strings.  The first completion\n\t      function to be defined for one of the contexts in the list is\n\t      used to generate matches.  Typically, the last string is\n\t      -default- to cause the function for default completion to be\n\t      used as a fallback.\n\n\t      The function sets the parameter $service to the string being\n\t      tried, and sets the context/command field (the fourth) of the\n\t      $curcontext parameter to the context given as the first\n\t      argument.\n\n       _email_addresses [ -c ] [ -n plugin ]\n\t      Complete email addresses.  Addresses are provided by plugins.\n\n\t      -c     Complete bare localhost@domain.tld addresses, without a\n\t\t     name part or a comment.  Without this option, RFC822\n\t\t     `Firstname Lastname <address>' strings are completed.\n\n\t      -n plugin\n\t\t     Complete aliases from plugin.\n\n\t      The following plugins are available by default: _email-ldap (see\n\t      the filter style), _email-local (completes user@hostname Unix\n\t      addresses), _email-mail (completes aliases from ~/.mailrc),\n\t      _email-mush, _email-mutt, and _email-pine.\n\n\t      Addresses from the _email-foo plugin are added under the tag\n\t      `email-foo'.\n\n\t      Writing plugins\n\n\t      Plugins are written as separate functions with names starting\n\t      with `_email-'.  They are invoked with the -c option and compadd\n\t      options.\tThey should either do their own completion or set the\n\t      $reply array to a list of `alias:address' elements and return\n\t      300.  New plugins will be picked up and run automatically.\n\n       _files The function _files is a wrapper around _path_files. It supports\n\t      all of the same functionality, with some enhancements --\n\t      notably, it respects the list-dirs-first style, and it allows\n\t      users to override the behaviour of the -g and -/ options with\n\t      the file-patterns style. _files should therefore be preferred\n\t      over _path_files in most cases.\n\n\t      This function accepts the full set of options allowed by\n\t      _path_files, described below.\n\n       _gnu_generic\n\t      This function is a simple wrapper around the _arguments function\n\t      described above.\tIt can be used to determine automatically the\n\t      long options understood by commands that produce a list when\n\t      passed the option `--help'.  It is intended to be used as a\n\t      top-level completion function in its own right.  For example, to\n\t      enable option completion for the commands foo and bar, use\n\n\t\t     compdef _gnu_generic foo bar\n\n\t      after the call to compinit.\n\n\t      The completion system as supplied is conservative in its use of\n\t      this function, since it is important to be sure the command\n\t      understands the option `--help'.\n\n       _guard [ options ] pattern descr\n\t      This function displays descr if pattern matches the string to be\n\t      completed.  It is intended to be used in the action for the\n\t      specifications passed to _arguments and similar functions.\n\n\t      The return status is zero if the message was displayed and the\n\t      word to complete is not empty, and non-zero otherwise.\n\n\t      The pattern may be preceded by any of the options understood by\n\t      compadd that are passed down from _description, namely -M, -J,\n\t      -V, -1, -2, -n, -F and -X.  All of these options will be\n\t      ignored.\tThis fits in conveniently with the argument-passing\n\t      conventions of actions for _arguments.\n\n\t      As an example, consider a command taking the options -n and\n\t      -none, where -n must be followed by a numeric value in the same\n\t      word.  By using:\n\n\t\t     _arguments '-n-: :_guard \"[0-9]#\" \"numeric value\"' '-none'\n\n\t      _arguments can be made to both display the message `numeric\n\t      value' and complete options after `-n<TAB>'.  If the `-n' is\n\t      already followed by one or more digits (the pattern passed to\n\t      _guard) only the message will be displayed; if the `-n' is\n\t      followed by another character, only options are completed.\n\n       _message [ -r12 ] [ -VJ group ] descr\n       _message -e [ tag ] descr\n\t      The descr is used in the same way as the third argument to the\n\t      _description function, except that the resulting string will\n\t      always be shown whether or not matches were generated.  This is\n\t      useful for displaying a help message in places where no\n\t      completions can be generated.\n\n\t      The format style is examined with the messages tag to find a\n\t      message; the usual tag, descriptions, is used only if the style\n\t      is not set with the former.\n\n\t      If the -r option is given, no style is used; the descr is taken\n\t      literally as the string to display.  This is most useful when\n\t      the descr comes from a pre-processed argument list which already\n\t      contains an expanded description.  Note that this option does\n\t      not disable the `%'-sequence parsing done by compadd.\n\n\t      The -12VJ options and the group are passed to compadd and hence\n\t      determine the group the message string is added to.\n\n\t      The second -e form gives a description for completions with the\n\t      tag tag to be shown even if there are no matches for that tag.\n\t      This form is called by _arguments in the event that there is no\n\t      action for an option specification.  The tag can be omitted and\n\t      if so the tag is taken from the parameter $curtag; this is\n\t      maintained by the completion system and so is usually correct.\n\t      Note that if there are no matches at the time this function is\n\t      called, compstate[insert] is cleared, so additional matches\n\t      generated later are not inserted on the command line.\n\n       _multi_parts [ -i ] sep array\n\t      The argument sep is a separator character.  The array may be\n\t      either the name of an array parameter or a literal array in the\n\t      form `(foo bar)', a parenthesised list of words separated by\n\t      whitespace.  The possible completions are the strings from the\n\t      array.  However, each chunk delimited by sep will be completed\n\t      separately.  For example, the _tar function uses `_multi_parts /\n\t      patharray' to complete partial file paths from the given array\n\t      of complete file paths.\n\n\t      The -i option causes _multi_parts to insert a unique match even\n\t      if that requires multiple separators to be inserted.  This is\n\t      not usually the expected behaviour with filenames, but certain\n\t      other types of completion, for example those with a fixed set of\n\t      possibilities, may be more suited to this form.\n\n\t      Like other utility functions, this function accepts the `-V',\n\t      `-J', `-1', `-2', `-n', `-f', `-X', `-M', `-P', `-S', `-r',\n\t      `-R', and `-q' options and passes them to the compadd builtin.\n\n       _next_label [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ option ... ]\n\t      This function is used to implement the loop over different tag\n\t      labels for a particular tag as described above for the tag-order\n\t      style.  On each call it checks to see if there are any more tag\n\t      labels; if there is it returns status zero, otherwise non-zero.\n\t      As this function requires a current tag to be set, it must\n\t      always follow a call to _tags or _requested.\n\n\t      The -x12VJ options and the first three arguments are passed to\n\t      the _description function.  Where appropriate the tag will be\n\t      replaced by a tag label in this call.  Any description given in\n\t      the tag-order style is preferred to the descr passed to\n\t      _next_label.\n\n\t      The options given after the descr are set in the parameter given\n\t      by name, and hence are to be passed to compadd or whatever\n\t      function is called to add the matches.\n\n\t      Here is a typical use of this function for the tag foo.  The\n\t      call to _requested determines if tag foo is required at all; the\n\t      loop over _next_label handles any labels defined for the tag in\n\t      the tag-order style.\n\n\t\t     local expl ret=1\n\t\t     ...\n\t\t     if _requested foo; then\n\t\t       ...\n\t\t       while _next_label foo expl '...'; do\n\t\t\t compadd \"$expl[@]\" ... && ret=0\n\t\t       done\n\t\t       ...\n\t\t     fi\n\t\t     return ret\n\n       _normal [ -P | -p precommand ]\n\t      This is the standard function called to handle completion\n\t      outside any special -context-.  It is called both to complete\n\t      the command word and also the arguments for a command.  In the\n\t      second case, _normal looks for a special completion for that\n\t      command, and if there is none it uses the completion for the\n\t      -default- context.\n\n\t      A second use is to reexamine the command line specified by the\n\t      $words array and the $CURRENT parameter after those have been\n\t      modified.  For example, the function _precommand, which\n\t      completes after precommand specifiers such as nohup, removes the\n\t      first word from the words array, decrements the CURRENT\n\t      parameter, then calls `_normal -p $service'.  The effect is that\n\t      `nohup cmd ...' is treated in the same way as `cmd ...'.\n\n\t      -P     Reset the list of precommands. This option should be used\n\t\t     if completing a command line which allows internal\n\t\t     commands (e.g. builtins and functions) regardless of\n\t\t     prior precommands (e.g. `zsh -c').\n\n\t      -p precommand\n\t\t     Append precommand to the list of precommands. This option\n\t\t     should be used in nearly all cases in which -P is not\n\t\t     applicable.\n\n\t      If the command name matches one of the patterns given by one of\n\t      the options -p or -P to compdef, the corresponding completion\n\t      function is called and then the parameter _compskip is checked.\n\t      If it is set completion is terminated at that point even if no\n\t      matches have been found.\tThis is the same effect as in the\n\t      -first- context.\n\n       _numbers [ option ... ] [ description ] [ suffix ... ]\n\t      This can be used where a number is followed by a suffix to\n\t      indicate the units.  The unit suffixes are completed and can\n\t      also be included in the description used when completion is\n\t      invoked for the preceding number.\n\n\t      In addition to common compadd options, _numbers accepts the\n\t      following options:\n\n\t      -t tag Specify a tag to use instead of the default of numbers.\n\n\t      -u units\n\t\t     Indicate the default units for the number, e.g. bytes.\n\n\t      -l min Specify the lowest possible value for the number.\n\n\t      -m max Specify the highest possible value for the number.\n\n\t      -d default\n\t\t     Specify the default value.\n\n\t      -N     Allow negative numbers.  This is implied if the range\n\t\t     includes a negative.\n\n\t      -f     Allow decimal numbers.\n\n\t      Where a particular suffix represents the default units for a\n\t      number, it should be prefixed with a colon.  Additionally,\n\t      suffixes can be followed by a colon and a description.  So for\n\t      example, the following allows the age of something to be\n\t      specified, either in seconds or with an optional suffix with a\n\t      longer unit of time:\n\n\t\t     _numbers -u seconds age :s:seconds m:minutes h:hours d:days\n\n\t      It is typically helpful for units to be presented in order of\n\t      magnitude when completed.  To facilitate this, the order in\n\t      which they are given is preserved.\n\n\t      When the format style is looked up with the descriptions tag or\n\t      the tag specified with -t, the list of suffixes is available as\n\t      a `%x' escape sequence. This is in addition to the usual\n\t      sequences documented under the format style. The form this list\n\t      takes can also be configured. To this end, the format style is\n\t      first looked up with the tag unit-suffixes. The retrieved format\n\t      is applied to each suffix in turn and the results are then\n\t      concatenated to form the completed list. For the unit-suffixes\n\t      format, `%x' expands to the individual suffix and `%X' to its\n\t      description. %d' indicates a default suffix and can be used in a\n\t      condition. The index and reverse index are set in `%i' and `%r'\n\t      respectively and are useful for text included only with the\n\t      first and last suffixes in the list. So for example, the\n\t      following joins the suffixes together as a comma-separated list:\n\n\t\t     zstyle ':completion:*:unit-suffixes' format '%x%(r::,)'\n\n       _options\n\t      This can be used to complete the names of shell options.\tIt\n\t      provides a matcher specification that ignores a leading `no',\n\t      ignores underscores and allows upper-case letters to match their\n\t      lower-case counterparts (for example, `glob', `noglob',\n\t      `NO_GLOB' are all completed).  Any arguments are propagated to\n\t      the compadd builtin.\n\n       _options_set and _options_unset\n\t      These functions complete only set or unset options, with the\n\t      same matching specification used in the _options function.\n\n\t      Note that you need to uncomment a few lines in the\n\t      _main_complete function for these functions to work properly.\n\t      The lines in question are used to store the option settings in\n\t      effect before the completion widget locally sets the options it\n\t      needs.  Hence these functions are not generally used by the\n\t      completion system.\n\n       _parameters\n\t      This is used to complete the names of shell parameters.\n\n\t      The option `-g pattern' limits the completion to parameters\n\t      whose type matches the pattern.  The type of a parameter is that\n\t      shown by `print ${(t)param}', hence judicious use of `*' in\n\t      pattern is probably necessary.\n\n\t      All other arguments are passed to the compadd builtin.\n\n       _path_files\n\t      This function is used throughout the completion system to\n\t      complete filenames.  It allows completion of partial paths.  For\n\t      example, the string `/u/i/s/sig' may be completed to\n\t      `/usr/include/sys/signal.h'.\n\n\t      The options accepted by both _path_files and _files are:\n\n\t      -f     Complete all filenames.  This is the default.\n\n\t      -/     Specifies that only directories should be completed.\n\n\t      -g pattern\n\t\t     Specifies that only files matching the pattern should be\n\t\t     completed.\n\n\t      -W paths\n\t\t     Specifies path prefixes that are to be prepended to the\n\t\t     string from the command line to generate the filenames\n\t\t     but that should not be inserted as completions nor shown\n\t\t     in completion listings.  Here, paths may be the name of\n\t\t     an array parameter, a literal list of paths enclosed in\n\t\t     parentheses or an absolute pathname.\n\n\t      -F ignored-files\n\t\t     This behaves as for the corresponding option to the\n\t\t     compadd builtin.  It gives direct control over which\n\t\t     filenames should be ignored.  If the option is not\n\t\t     present, the ignored-patterns style is used.\n\n\t      Both _path_files and _files also accept the following options\n\t      which are passed to compadd: `-J', `-V', `-1', `-2', `-n', `-X',\n\t      `-M', `-P', `-S', `-q', `-r', and `-R'.\n\n\t      Finally, the _path_files function  uses the styles expand,\n\t      ambiguous, special-dirs, list-suffixes and file-sort described\n\t      above."
