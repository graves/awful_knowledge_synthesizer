(Data Structures and\n       Algorithms; Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman; Addison-Wesley, 1987).  In\n       addition to maintaining the node relationships, this tree\n       implementation allows any number of keyed values to be associated with\n       each node.\n\n       The element names can be arbitrary strings.\n\n       A tree is thus similar to an array, but with three important\n       differences:\n\n       [1]    Trees are accessed through an object command, whereas arrays are\n\t      accessed as variables. (This means trees cannot be local to a\n\t      procedure.)\n\n       [2]    Trees have a hierarchical structure, whereas an array is just an\n\t      unordered collection.\n\n       [3]    Each node of a tree has a separate collection of attributes and\n\t      values. This is like an array where every value is a dictionary.\n\n       Note: The major version of the package struct has been changed to\n       version 2.0, due to backward incompatible changes in the API of this\n       module. Please read the section Changes for 2.0 for a full list of all\n       changes, incompatible and otherwise.\n\nAPI\n   TREE CLASS API\n       The main commands of the package are:\n\n       ::struct::tree ?treeName? ?=|:=|as|deserialize source?\n\t      The command creates a new tree object with an associated global\n\t      Tcl command whose name is treeName. This command may be used to\n\t      invoke various operations on the tree.  It has the following\n\t      general form:\n\n\t      treeName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command.\n\n       If treeName is not specified a unique name will be generated by the\n       package itself. If a source is specified the new tree will be\n       initialized to it. For the operators =, :=, and as source is\n       interpreted as the name of another tree object, and the assignment\n       operator = will be executed. For deserialize the source is a serialized\n       tree object and deserialize will be executed.\n\n       In other words"

This allows, for example, the transfer of\n\t      tree objects (or parts thereof) over arbitrary channels,\n\t      persistence, etc.  This method is also the basis for both the\n\t      copy constructor and the assignment operator.\n\n\t      The result of this method has to be semantically identical over\n\t      all implementations of the tree interface. This is what will\n\t      enable us to copy tree data between different implementations of\n\t      the same interface.\n\n\t      The result is a list containing containing a multiple of three\n\t      elements. It is like a serialized array except that there are\n\t      two values following each key. They are the names of the nodes\n\t      in the serialized tree. The two values are a reference to the\n\t      parent node and the attribute data, in this order.\n\n\t      The reference to the parent node is the empty string for the\n\t      root node of the tree. For all other nodes it is the index of\n\t      the parent node in the list. This means that they are integers,\n\t      greater than or equal to zero, less than the length of the list,\n\t      and multiples of three.  The order of the nodes in the list is\n\t      important insofar as it is used to reconstruct the lists of\n\t      children for each node. The children of a node have to be listed\n\t      in the serialization in the same order as they are listed in\n\t      their parent in the tree.\n\n\t      The attribute data of a node is a dictionary, i.e. a list of\n\t      even length containing a serialized array. For a node without\n\t      attribute data the dictionary is the empty list.\n\n\t      Note: While the current implementation returns the root node as\n\t      the first element of the list, followed by its children and\n\t      their children in a depth-first traversal this is not\n\t      necessarily true for other implementations.  The only\n\t      information a reader of the serialized data can rely on for the\n\t      structure of the tree is that the root node is signaled by the\n\t      empty string for the parent reference, that all other nodes\n\t      refer to their parent through the index in the list, and that\n\t      children occur in the same order as in their parent."

The combination of a breadth-first walk with in-order is\n\t      illegal.\n\n\t      As the walk progresses, the script will be evaluated at each\n\t      node. The evaluation takes place in the context of the caller of\n\t      the method.  Regarding loop variables, these are listed in\n\t      loopvar. If one only one variable is specified it will be set to\n\t      the id of the node. When two variables are specified, i.e.\n\t      loopvar is a true list, then the first variable will be set to\n\t      the action performed at the node, and the other to the id of the\n\t      node itself.  All loop variables are created in the context of\n\t      the caller.\n\n\t      There are three possible actions: enter, leave, or visit.  enter\n\t      actions occur during pre-order walks; leave actions occur during\n\t      post-order walks; visit actions occur during in-order walks.  In\n\t      a both-order walk, the command will be evaluated twice for each\n\t      node; the action is enter for the first evaluation, and leave\n\t      for the second.\n\n\t      Note: The enter action for a node is always performed before the\n\t      walker will look at the children of that node. This means that\n\t      changes made by the script to the children of the node will\n\t      immediately influence the walker and the steps it will take.\n\n\t      Any other manipulation, for example of nodes higher in the tree\n\t      (i.e already visited), or upon leaving will have undefined\n\t      results. They may succeed, error out, silently compute the wrong\n\t      result, or anything in between.\n\n\t      At last a small table showing the relationship between the\n\t      various options and the possible actions."

This command can be used\n\t      in the walk script to force the command to ignore the children\n\t      of the node we are currently at. It will throw an error if the\n\t      order of traversal is either post or in as these modes visit the\n\t      children before their parent, making pruning non-sensical.\n\n       treeName walkproc node ?-order order? ?-type type? cmdprefix\n\t      This method is like method walk in all essentials, except the\n\t      interface to the user code. This method invokes a command prefix\n\t      with three additional arguments (tree, node, and action),\n\t      instead of evaluating a script and passing the node via a loop\n\t      variable.\n\n   CHANGES FOR 2.0\n       The following noteworthy changes have occurred:\n\n       [1]    The API for accessing attributes and their values has been\n\t      simplified.\n\n\t      All functionality regarding the default attribute \"data\" has\n\t      been removed. This default attribute does not exist anymore. All\n\t      accesses to attributes have to specify the name of the attribute\n\t      in question. This backward incompatible change allowed us to\n\t      simplify the signature of all methods handling attributes.\n\n\t      Especially the flag -key is not required anymore, even more, its\n\t      use is now forbidden. Please read the documentation for the\n\t      methods set, get, getall, unset, append, lappend, keyexists and\n\t      keys for a description of the new API's.\n\n       [2]    The methods keys and getall now take an optional pattern\n\t      argument and will return only attribute data for keys matching\n\t      this pattern.\n\n       [3]    Nodes can now be renamed. See the documentation for the method\n\t      rename.\n\n       [4]    The structure has been extended with API's for the serialization\n\t      and deserialization of tree objects, and a number of operations\n\t      based on them (tree assignment, copy construction).\n\n\t      Please read the documentation for the methods serialize,\n\t      deserialize, =, and -->, and the documentation on the\n\t      construction of tree objects.\n\n\t      Beyond the copying of whole tree objects these new API's also\n\t      enable the transfer of tree objects over arbitrary channels and\n\t      for easy persistence.\n\n       [5]    The walker API has been streamlined and made more similar to the\n\t      command foreach. In detail:\n\n\t      •      The superfluous option -command has been removed.\n\n\t      •      Ditto for the place holders. Instead of the placeholders\n\t\t     two loop variables have to be specified to contain node\n\t\t     and action information.\n\n\t      •      The old command argument has been documented as a script\n\t\t     now, which it was in the past too.\n\n\t      •      The fact that enter actions are called before the walker\n\t\t     looks at the children of a node has been documented now.\n\t\t     In other words it is now officially allowed to manipulate\n\t\t     the list of children for a node under these\n\t\t     circumstances. It has been made clear that changes under\n\t\t     any other circumstances will have undefined results, from\n\t\t     silently computing the wrong result to erroring out.\n\n       [6]    A new method, attr, was added allowing the query and retrieval\n\t      of attribute data without regard to the node relationship.\n\n       [7]    The method children has been extended with the ability to select\n\t      from the children of the node based on an arbitrary filtering\n\t      criterium. Another extension is the ability to look not only at\n\t      the immediate children of the node, but the whole tree below it.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       The following example demonstrates the creation of new nodes:\n\n\t   mytree insert root end 0   ; # Create node 0, as child of the root\n\t   mytree insert root end 1 2 ; # Ditto nodes 1 & 2\n\t   mytree insert 0    end 3   ; # Now create node 3 as child of node 0\n\t   mytree insert 0    end     ; # Create another child of 0, with a\n\t   #\t\t\t\t  generated name. The name is returned\n\t   #\t\t\t\t  as the result of the command."
