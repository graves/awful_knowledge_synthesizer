The creating interpreter is called the master and the new\n       interpreter is called a slave.  A master can create any number of\n       slaves, and each slave can itself create additional slaves for which it\n       is master, resulting in a hierarchy of interpreters.\n\n       Each interpreter is independent from the others: it has its own name\n       space for commands, procedures, and global variables.  A master\n       interpreter may create connections between its slaves and itself using\n       a mechanism called an alias.  An alias is a command in a slave\n       interpreter which, when invoked, causes a command to be invoked in its\n       master interpreter or in another slave interpreter.  The only other\n       connections between interpreters are through environment variables (the\n       env variable), which are normally shared among all interpreters in the\n       application, and by resource limit exceeded callbacks.  Note that the   │\n       name space for files (such as the names returned by the open command)\n       is no longer shared between interpreters. Explicit commands are\n       provided to share files and to transfer references to open files from\n       one interpreter to another."

    Manpage text:

    A qualified interpreter name is a proper Tcl lists containing a subset
           of its ancestors in the interpreter hierarchy, terminated by the string
           naming the interpreter in its immediate master. Interpreter names are
           relative to the interpreter in which they are used. For example, if a
           is a slave of the current interpreter and it has a slave a1, which in
           turn has a slave a11, the qualified name of a11 in a is the list a1
           a11.

           The interp command, described below, accepts qualified interpreter
           names as arguments; the interpreter in which the command is being
           evaluated can always be referred to as {} (the empty list or string).
           Note that it is impossible to refer to a master (ancestor) interpreter
           by name in a slave interpreter except through aliases. Also, there is
           no global name by which one can refer to the first interpreter created
           in an application.  Both restrictions are motivated by safety concerns.

In this command, either of the slave\n\t      interpreters may be anywhere in the hierarchy of interpreters\n\t      under the interpreter invoking the command.  SrcPath and srcCmd\n\t      identify the source of the alias.  SrcPath is a Tcl list whose\n\t      elements select a particular interpreter.  For example, “a b”\n\t      identifies an interpreter b, which is a slave of interpreter a,\n\t      which is a slave of the invoking interpreter.  An empty list\n\t      specifies the interpreter invoking the command.  srcCmd gives\n\t      the name of a new command, which will be created in the source\n\t      interpreter.  TargetPath and targetCmd specify a target\n\t      interpreter and command, and the arg arguments, if any, specify\n\t      additional arguments to targetCmd which are prepended to any\n\t      arguments specified in the invocation of srcCmd.\tTargetCmd may\n\t      be undefined at the time of this call, or it may already exist;\n\t      it is not created by this command.  The alias arranges for the\n\t      given target command to be invoked in the target interpreter\n\t      whenever the given source command is invoked in the source\n\t      interpreter.  See ALIAS INVOCATION below for more details.  The\n\t      command returns a token that uniquely identifies the command\n\t      created srcCmd, even if the command is renamed afterwards. The\n\t      token may but does not have to be equal to srcCmd."

    can only be provided by explicit definition of an unknown command in
           the safe interpreter.  This will involve exposing the source command.
           This is most easily accomplished by creating the safe interpreter with
           Tcl's Safe-Tcl mechanism.  Safe-Tcl provides safe versions of source,
           load, and other Tcl commands needed to support autoloading of commands
           and the loading of packages.

           In addition, the env variable is not present in a safe interpreter, so
           it cannot share environment variables with other interpreters. The env
           variable poses a security risk, because users can store sensitive
           information in an environment variable. For example, the PGP manual
           recommends storing the PGP private key protection password in the
           environment variable PGPPASS. Making this variable available to
           untrusted code executing in a safe interpreter would incur a security
           risk.

           If extensions are loaded into a safe interpreter, they may also
           restrict their own functionality to eliminate unsafe commands. For a
           discussion of management of extensions for safety see the manual
           entries for Safe-Tcl and the load Tcl command.

The most important thing in\n       guaranteeing safety is to ensure that information passed from the slave\n       to the master is never evaluated or substituted in the master;  if this\n       were to occur, it would enable an evil script in the slave to invoke\n       arbitrary functions in the master, which would compromise security.\n\n       When the source for an alias is invoked in the slave interpreter, the\n       usual Tcl substitutions are performed when parsing that command.  These\n       substitutions are carried out in the source interpreter just as they\n       would be for any other command invoked in that interpreter.  The\n       command procedure for the source command takes its arguments and merges\n       them with the targetCmd and args for the alias to create a new array of\n       arguments.  If the words of srcCmd were “srcCmd arg1 arg2 ... argN”,\n       the new set of words will be “targetCmd arg arg ... arg arg1 arg2 ...\n       argN”, where targetCmd and args are the values supplied when the alias\n       was created.  TargetCmd is then used to locate a command procedure in\n       the target interpreter, and that command procedure is invoked with the\n       new set of arguments.  An error occurs if there is no command named\n       targetCmd in the target interpreter.  No additional substitutions are\n       performed on the words:\tthe target command procedure is invoked\n       directly, without going through the normal Tcl evaluation mechanism.\n       Substitutions are thus performed on each word exactly once: targetCmd\n       and args were substituted when parsing the command that created the\n       alias, and arg1 - argN are substituted when the alias's source command\n       is parsed in the source interpreter."

    Manpage text:

    The interp command provides a solution to this problem in the form of
           hidden commands. Instead of removing the dangerous commands entirely
           from a safe interpreter, these commands are hidden so they become
           unavailable to Tcl scripts executing in the interpreter. However, such
           hidden commands can be invoked by any trusted ancestor of the safe
           interpreter, in the context of the safe interpreter, using interp
           invoke. Hidden commands and exposed commands reside in separate name
           spaces. It is possible to define a hidden command and an exposed
           command by the same name within one interpreter.

           Hidden commands in a slave interpreter can be invoked in the body of
           procedures called in the master during alias invocation. For example,
           an alias for source could be created in a slave interpreter. When it is
           invoked in the slave interpreter, a procedure is called in the master
           interpreter to check that the operation is allowable (e.g. it asks to
           source a file that the slave interpreter is allowed to access). The
           procedure then it invokes the hidden source command in the slave
           interpreter to actually source in the contents of the file. Note that
           two commands named source exist in the slave interpreter: the alias,
           and the hidden command.

    Manpage text:

    Because a master interpreter may invoke a hidden command as part of
           handling an alias invocation, great care must be taken to avoid
           evaluating any arguments passed in through the alias invocation.
           Otherwise, malicious slave interpreters could cause a trusted master
           interpreter to execute dangerous commands on their behalf. See the
           section on ALIAS INVOCATION for a more complete discussion of this
           topic.  To help avoid this problem, no substitutions or evaluations are
           applied to arguments of interp invokehidden.

           Safe interpreters are not allowed to invoke hidden commands in
           themselves or in their descendants. This prevents safe slaves from
           gaining access to hidden functionality in themselves or their
           descendants.

           The set of hidden commands in an interpreter can be manipulated by a
           trusted interpreter using interp expose and interp hide. The interp
           expose command moves a hidden command to the set of exposed commands in
           the interpreter identified by path, potentially renaming the command in
           the process. If an exposed command by the targeted name already exists,
           the operation fails. Similarly, interp hide moves an exposed command to
           the set of hidden commands in that interpreter. Safe interpreters are
           not allowed to move commands between the set of hidden and exposed
           commands, in either themselves or their descendants.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `interp`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-value This option specifies the number of commands that the\t       │\n\t      interpreter may execute before triggering the command limit.     │\n\t      This option may be the empty string, which indicates that a      │\n\t      command limit is not set for the interpreter.\t\t       │\n\n       Where an interpreter with a resource limit set on it creates a slave    │\n       interpreter, that slave interpreter will have resource limits imposed   │\n       on it that are at least as restrictive as the limits on the creating    │\n       master interpreter. If the master interpreter of the limited master     │\n       wishes to relax these conditions, it should hide the interp command in  │\n       the child and then use aliases and the interp invokehidden subcommand   │\n       to provide such access as it chooses to the interp command to the       │\n       limited master as necessary.\t\t\t\t\t       │\n\nBACKGROUND ERROR HANDLING\t\t\t\t\t\t       │\n       When an error happens in a situation where it cannot be reported        │\n       directly up the stack (e.g. when processing events in an update or      │\n       vwait call) the error is instead reported through the background error  │\n       handling mechanism.  Every interpreter has a background error handler   │\n       registered; the default error handler arranges for the bgerror command  │\n       in the interpreter's global namespace to be called, but other error     │\n       handlers may be installed and process background errors in\t       │\n       substantially different ways.\t\t\t\t\t       │"
