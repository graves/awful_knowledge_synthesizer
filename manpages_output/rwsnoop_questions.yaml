Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       rwsnoop [-jPtvZ] [-n name] [-p PID]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This is measuring reads and writes at the application level. This\n       matches the syscalls read, write, pread and pwrite.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -j     print project ID\n\n       -P     print parent process ID\n\n       -t     print timestamp, us\n\n       -v     print time, string\n\n       -Z     print zone ID\n\n       -n name\n\t      process name to track\n\n       -p PID PID to track\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Default output,\n\t      # rwsnoop\n\n       Print zone ID,\n\t      # rwsnoop -\n\n       Monitor processes named \"bash\",\n\t      # rwsnoop -n bash\n\nFIELDS\n       TIME   timestamp, us\n\n       TIMESTR\n\t      time, string\n\n       ZONE   zone ID\n\n       PROJ   project ID\n\n       UID    user ID\n\n       PID    process ID\n\n       PPID   parent process ID\n\n       CMD    command name for the process\n\n       D      direction, Read or Write\n\n       BYTES  total bytes during sample\n\n       FILE   filename, if file based.\tReads and writes that are not file\n\t      based, for example with sockets, will print \"<unknown>\" as the\n\t      filename.\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       rwsnoop will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       rwtop(1M), dtrace(1M)"
