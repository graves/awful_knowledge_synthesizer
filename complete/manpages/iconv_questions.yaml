By default, iconv\n\t   outputs an “invalid character” specified by the to_name codeset\n\t   when it encounts a character which is valid in the from_name\n\t   codeset but does not have a corresponding character in the to_name\n\t   codeset.\n\n     -f    Specifies the source codeset name as from_name.\n\n     -l    Lists available codeset names.  Note that not all combinations of\n\t   from_name and to_name are valid."
