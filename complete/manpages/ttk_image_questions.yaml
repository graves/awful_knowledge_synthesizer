The first element is the default image\n       name.  The rest of the list is a sequence of statespec / value pairs\n       specifying other images to use when the element is in a particular\n       state or combination of states.\n\nOPTIONS\n       Valid options are:\n\n       -border padding\n\t      padding is a list of up to four integers, specifying the left,\n\t      top, right, and bottom borders, respectively.  See IMAGE\n\t      STRETCHING, below.\n\n       -height height\n\t      Specifies a minimum height for the element.  If less than zero,\n\t      the base image's height is used as a default."

Defaults to -border\n\t      if not specified.\n\n       -sticky spec\n\t      Specifies how the image is placed within the final parcel.  spec\n\t      contains zero or more characters “n”, “s”, “w”, or “e”.\n\n       -width width\n\t      Specifies a minimum width for the element.  If less than zero,\n\t      the base image's width is used as a default.\n\nIMAGE STRETCHING\n       If the element's allocated parcel is larger than the image, the image\n       will be placed in the parcel based on the -sticky option.  If the image\n       needs to stretch horizontally (i.e., -sticky ew) or vertically (-sticky\n       ns), subregions of the image are replicated to fill the parcel based on\n       the -border option.  The -border divides the image into 9 regions: four\n       fixed corners, top and left edges (which may be tiled horizontally),\n       left and right edges (which may be tiled vertically), and the central\n       area (which may be tiled in both directions)."
