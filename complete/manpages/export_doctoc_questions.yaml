Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `export_doctoc`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ndoctools::toc::export::doctoc(n)\t\t\t   Documentation tools\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nNAME\n       doctools::toc::export::doctoc - doctoc export plugin\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       package require Tcl  8.4\n\n       package require doctools::toc::export::doctoc  ?0.1?\n\n       export serial configuration\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This package implements the doctools table of contents export plugin\n       for the generation of doctoc markup.\n\n       This is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level\n       management packages handling tables of contents, especially\n       doctools::toc::export, the export manager.\n\n       Using it from a regular interpreter is possible, however only with\n       contortions, and is not recommended.  The proper way to use this\n       functionality is through the package doctools::toc::export and the\n       export manager objects it provides.\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       doctoc export plugin API version 2.\n\n       export serial configuration\n\t      This command takes the canonical serialization of a table of\n\t      contents, as specified in section ToC serialization format, and\n\t      contained in serial, the configuration, a dictionary, and\n\t      generates doctoc markup encoding the table.  The created string\n\t      is then returned as the result of the command.\n\n[DOCTOC] NOTATION OF TABLES OF CONTENTS\n       The doctoc format for tables of contents, also called the doctoc markup\n       language, is too large to be covered in single section.\tThe interested\n       reader should start with the document\n\n       [1]    doctoc language introduction\n\n       and then proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the\n       documents\n\n       [1]    doctoc language syntax and\n\n       [2]    doctoc language command reference.\n\n       to get a thorough understanding of the language.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       The doctoc export plugin recognizes the following configuration\n       variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.\n\n       string user\n\t      This standard configuration variable contains the name of the\n\t      user running the process which invoked the export plugin.  The\n\t      plugin puts this information into the provenance comment at the\n\t      beginning of the generated document.\n\n       string file\n\t      This standard configuration variable contains the name of the\n\t      file the table of contents came from. This variable may not be\n\t      set or contain the empty string.\tThe plugin puts this\n\t      information, if defined, i.e. set and not the empty string, into\n\t      the provenance comment at the beginning of the generated\n\t      document.\n\n       boolean newlines\n\t      If this flag is set the plugin will break the generated doctoc\n\t      code across lines, with each markup command on a separate line.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the whole document will\n\t      be written on a single line, with minimum spacing between all\n\t      elements.\n\n       boolean indented\n\t      If this flag is set the plugin will indent the markup commands\n\t      according to the structure of tables of contents. To make this\n\t      work this also implies that newlines is set. This effect is\n\t      independent of the value for aligned however.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted\n\t      as per the value of newlines, and no indenting is done.\n\n       boolean aligned\n\t      If this flag is set the generator ensures that the arguments for\n\t      the item commands in a division are aligned vertically for a\n\t      nice table effect. To make this work this also implies that\n\t      newlines is set. This effect is independent of the value for\n\t      indented however.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted\n\t      as per the values of newlines and indented, and no alignment is\n\t      done.\n\n       Note that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variables\n       format, and map, and their values.\n\nTOC SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to\n       serialize tables of contents as immutable values for transport,\n       comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       table of contents may have more than one regular serialization only\n       exactly one of them will be canonical.\n\n       regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    The serialization of any table of contents is a nested\n\t\t     Tcl dictionary.\n\n\t      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, doctools::toc, and\n\t\t     its value. This value holds the contents of the table of\n\t\t     contents.\n\n\t      [3]    The contents of the table of contents are a Tcl\n\t\t     dictionary holding the title of the table of contents, a\n\t\t     label, and its elements. The relevant keys and their\n\t\t     values are\n\n\t\t     title  The value is a string containing the title of the\n\t\t\t    table of contents.\n\n\t\t     label  The value is a string containing a label for the\n\t\t\t    table of contents.\n\n\t\t     items  The value is a Tcl list holding the elements of\n\t\t\t    the table, in the order they are to be shown.\n\n\t\t\t    Each element is a Tcl list holding the type of the\n\t\t\t    item, and its description, in this order. An\n\t\t\t    alternative description would be that it is a Tcl\n\t\t\t    dictionary holding a single key, the item type,\n\t\t\t    mapped to the item description.\n\n\t\t\t    The two legal item types and their descriptions\n\t\t\t    are\n\n\t\t\t    reference\n\t\t\t\t   This item describes a single entry in the\n\t\t\t\t   table of contents, referencing a single\n\t\t\t\t   document.  To this end its value is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary containing an id for the\n\t\t\t\t   referenced document, a label, and a longer\n\t\t\t\t   textual description which can be associated\n\t\t\t\t   with the entry.  The relevant keys and\n\t\t\t\t   their values are\n\n\t\t\t\t   id\t  The value is a string containing the\n\t\t\t\t\t  id of the document associated with\n\t\t\t\t\t  the entry.\n\n\t\t\t\t   label  The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  label for this entry. This string\n\t\t\t\t\t  also identifies the entry, and no\n\t\t\t\t\t  two entries (references and\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions) in the containing list\n\t\t\t\t\t  are allowed to have the same label.\n\n\t\t\t\t   desc   The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  longer description for this entry.\n\n\t\t\t    division\n\t\t\t\t   This item describes a group of entries in\n\t\t\t\t   the table of contents, inducing a hierarchy\n\t\t\t\t   of entries.\tTo this end its value is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary containing a label for the\n\t\t\t\t   group, an optional id to a document for the\n\t\t\t\t   whole group, and the list of entries in the\n\t\t\t\t   group.  The relevant keys and their values\n\t\t\t\t   are\n\n\t\t\t\t   id\t  The value is a string containing the\n\t\t\t\t\t  id of the document associated with\n\t\t\t\t\t  the whole group. This key is\n\t\t\t\t\t  optional.\n\n\t\t\t\t   label  The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  label for the group. This string\n\t\t\t\t\t  also identifies the entry, and no\n\t\t\t\t\t  two entries (references and\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions) in the containing list\n\t\t\t\t\t  are allowed to have the same label.\n\n\t\t\t\t   items  The value is a Tcl list holding the\n\t\t\t\t\t  elements of the group, in the order\n\t\t\t\t\t  they are to be shown.  This list has\n\t\t\t\t\t  the same structure as the value for\n\t\t\t\t\t  the keyword items used to describe\n\t\t\t\t\t  the whole table of contents, see\n\t\t\t\t\t  above. This closes the recusrive\n\t\t\t\t\t  definition of the structure, with\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions holding the same type of\n\t\t\t\t\t  elements as the whole table of\n\t\t\t\t\t  contents, including other divisions.\n\n       canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a table of contents has the\n\t      format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally\n\t      satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all\n\t      the possible serializations of this table of contents.\n\n\t      [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are\n\t\t     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by\n\t\t     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
