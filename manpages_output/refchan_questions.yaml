Note that cmdPrefix is whatever was specified in the call to\n       chan create, and may consist of multiple arguments; this will be\n       expanded to multiple words in place of the prefix.\n\n       Of all the possible subcommands, the handler must support initialize,\n       finalize, and watch. Support for the other subcommands is optional."
