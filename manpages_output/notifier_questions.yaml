- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `notifier`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nnotifier(7)\t\t\t  Apple Inc.\t\t\t   notifier(7)\n\nNAME\n       notifier - cups notification interface\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       notifier recipient [ user-data ]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The CUPS notifier interface provides a standard method for adding\n       support for new event notification methods to CUPS.  Each notifier\n       delivers one or more IPP events from the standard input to the\n       specified recipient.\n\n       Notifiers MUST read IPP messages from the standard input using the\n       ippNew() and ippReadFile() functions and exit on error.\tNotifiers are\n       encouraged to exit after a suitable period of inactivity, however they\n       may exit after reading the first message or stay running until an error\n       is seen.  Notifiers inherit the environment and can use the logging\n       mechanism documented in filter(7).\n\nSEE ALSO\n       cupsd(8), filter(7), CUPS Online Help (http://localhost:631/help)\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright Â© 2007-2019 by Apple Inc.\n\n26 April 2019\t\t\t     CUPS\t\t\t   notifier(7)"
