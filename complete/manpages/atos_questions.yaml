If full debug symbol information is available, for example\n     in a .app.dSYM sitting beside a .app, then the output of atos will\n     include file name and source line number information.\n\n     The input addresses may be given in one of three ways:\n\n     1.   A list of addresses at the end of the argument list.\n\n     2.   Using the -f <address-input-file> argument to specify the path of an\n\t  input file containing whitespace-separated numeric addresses.\n\n     3.   If no addresses were directly specified, atos enters an interactive\n\t  mode, reading addresses from stdin.\n\n     The symbols are found in either a binary image file or in a currently\n     executing process, as specified by:\n\n     -o <binary-image-file> | <dSYM>\n\t     The path to a binary image file or dSYM in which to look up\n\t     symbols.\n\n     -p <pid> | <partial-executable-name>\n\t     The process ID or the partial name of a currently executing\n\t     process in which to look up symbols.\n\n     Multiple process IDs or paths can be specified if necessary, and the two\n     can be mixed in any order.  When working with a Mach-O binary image file,\n     atos considers only addresses and symbols defined in that binary image\n     file, at their default locations (unless the -l or -s option is given).\n     When working with a running process, atos considers addresses and symbols\n     defined in all binary images currently loaded by that process, at their\n     loaded locations.\n\n     The following additional options are available.\n\n     -arch architecture\n\t     The particular architecure of a binary image file in which to\n\t     look up symbols.\n\n     -l <load-address>\n\t     The load address of the binary image.  This value is always\n\t     assumed to be in hex, even without a \"0x\" prefix.\tThe input\n\t     addresses are assumed to be in a binary image with that load\n\t     address.  Load addresses for binary images can be found in the\n\t     Binary Images: section at the bottom of crash, sample, leaks, and\n\t     malloc_history reports.\n\n     -s <slide>\n\t     The slide value of the binary image -- this is the difference\n\t     between the load address of a binary image, and the address at\n\t     which the binary image was built.\tThis slide value is subtracted\n\t     from the input addresses.\tIt is usually easier to directly\n\t     specify the load address with the -l argument than to manually\n\t     calculate a slide value.\n\n     -offset\n\t     Treat all given addresses as offsets into the binary. Only one of\n\t     the following options can be used at a time: -s , -l or -offset.\n\n     -printHeader\n\t     If a process was specified, the first line of atos output should\n\t     be a header of the form \"Looking up symbols in process <pid>\n\t     named:  <process-name>\".  This is primarily used when atos is\n\t     invoked as part of a stackshot(1) run, for verification of the\n\t     process ID and name.\n\n     -fullPath\n\t     Print the full path of the source files.\n\n     -i      Display inlined symbols.\n\n     -d <delimiter>\n\t     Delimiter when outputting inline frames. Defaults to newline."
