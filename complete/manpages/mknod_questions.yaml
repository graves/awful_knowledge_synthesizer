Correct the\n\t      mode, user and group.\n\n     -F fmt   Create device nodes that may be used by an operating system\n\t      which uses device numbers packed in a different format than\n\t      NetBSD uses.  This is necessary when NetBSD is used as an NFS\n\t      server for netbooted computers running other operating systems.\n\n\t      The following values for the fmt are recognized: native, 386bsd,\n\t      4bsd, bsdos, freebsd, hpux, isc, linux, netbsd, osf1, sco,\n\t      solaris, sunos, svr3, svr4, and ultrix."

The gid operand may be a\n\t      numeric group ID or a group name.  If a group name is also a\n\t      numeric group ID, the operand is used as a group name.  Precede\n\t      a numeric group ID with a # to stop it being treated as a name.\n\n     -m mode  Specify the mode for the device node.  The mode may be absolute\n\t      or symbolic, see chmod(1).\n\n     name     Device name, for example “sd” for a SCSI disk on an HP300 or a\n\t      “pty” for pseudo-devices.\n\n     b | c | p\n\t      Type of device.  If the device is a block type device such as a\n\t      tape or disk drive which needs both cooked and raw special\n\t      files, the type is b.  All other devices are character type\n\t      devices, such as terminal and pseudo devices, and are type c.\n\t      Specifying p creates fifo files.\n\n     driver | major\n\t      The major device number is an integer number which tells the\n\t      kernel which device driver entry point to use.  If the device\n\t      driver is configured into the current kernel it may be specified\n\t      by driver name or major number."
