First, the Tcl interpreter\n\t      breaks the command into words and performs substitutions as\n\t      described below.\tThese substitutions are performed in the same\n\t      way for all commands.  The first word is used to locate a\n\t      command procedure to carry out the command, then all of the\n\t      words of the command are passed to the command procedure.  The\n\t      command procedure is free to interpret each of its words in any\n\t      way it likes, such as an integer, variable name, list, or Tcl\n\t      script.  Different commands interpret their words differently."

Braces nest within the word: for each\n\t      additional open brace there must be an additional close brace\n\t      (however, if an open brace or close brace within the word is\n\t      quoted with a backslash then it is not counted in locating the\n\t      matching close brace).
