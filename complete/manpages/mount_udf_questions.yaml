This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot\n     time.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -o options\n\t     Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma\n\t     separated string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for\n\t     possible options and their meanings.\n\n     -v verificationPolicy\n\t     This is an advanced option not useful for regular use.  It\n\t     controlls the verification policy when writing to RW type optical\n\t     media.  Its value can be \"meta\", \"all\", or \"none\".  Policy \"meta\"\n\t     means only the metadata are verified after they are written.\n\t     This is the default policy.  Policy \"all\" means to verify data\n\t     written, which could be several times slower than policy \"meta\".\n\t     Policy \"none\" does not verify any data.  It is only slightly\n\t     faster than \"meta\" in normal cases, but may result a corrupted\n\t     UDF disc if the write of metadata fails."

It forces\n\t     to enable the experimental packet writing function on optical\n\t     media that has not been fully supported, such as CD-R, CD-RW,\n\t     DVD-R, DVD+R, HD DVD-R, and BD-R.\tWriting to these media does\n\t     not work on some drives and may cause data corruption or data\n\t     loss on some other drives.

They are\n     mainly used for debugging and data recovery.  Since the -s, -n, and -p\n     flags are all specified in units of block size, when any of these flags\n     are specified, it is strongly recommended that the -b flag is also\n     specified.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     mount(2), unmount(2), fstab(5), mount(8)\n\nBUGS\n     Reading of all UDF revisions (1.02 - 2.60) on both block device (e.g.,\n     hard drives and USB drives) and most optical media is supported.
