It is started automatically by\n       the uucico (8) daemon (unless uucico (8) is given the -q or --nouuxqt\n       option).\n\n       There is normally no need to run this command, since it will be invoked\n       by uucico (8).  However, it can be used to provide greater control over\n       the processing of the work queue.\n\n       Multiple invocations of uuxqt may be run at once, as controlled by the\n       max-uuxqts configuration command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The following options may be given to uuxqt.\n\n       -c command, --command command\n\t    Only execute requests for the specified command.  For example:\n\t\t uuxqt --command rmail\n\n       -s system, --system system\n\t    Only execute requests originating from the specified system."
