Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `SmartCardServices`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSmartCardServices(7)   Miscellaneous Information Manual   SmartCardServices(7)\n\nNAME\n     SmartCardServices – overview of SmartCard support\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     SmartCardServices is a set of components for macOS SmartCard support.\n\n     SmartCards which adhere to the PIV standard are supported natively by\n     macOS. Additional smartcard support is provided through the installation\n     of third party drivers.  Access to SmartCard content is possible using\n     the keychain interface.\n\n     SmartCard certificates are automatically added to a user's keychain when\n     a SmartCard is inserted and authenticated. SmartCard certificates can be\n     listed with the security command using the list-smartcards or\n     export-smartcard options. Keychain Access GUI cannot be used to\n     manipulate or list these certificates.\n\n\n     Card Provisioning\n\t      In order to use smartcards with macOS, identities must be\n\t      populated into Slot 9a (PIV Authentication) and 9d (Key\n\t      Managment), and optionally 9c, if signing functions such as e-\n\t      mail signing are to be used.\n\n     Supported Services\n\t      Authentication Login, Screen Saver, ssh, sudo, Safari, PAM\n\t      Authorization, su, Finder\n\n\t      Authentication is performed using the PIV Authentication\n\t      Identity (9a).  For login, the Key Management key (9d) is used\n\t      to unlock the encrypted harddrive (Apple Silicon devices) and to\n\t      unlock Keychain.\n\n\t      Encryption and Signing Mail and code signing\n\n\t      Requires signing certificate.\n\n\t      Mail in macOS will use Digital Signing and Encryption Identities\n\t      on an attached smartcard.  Signing and Encryption buttons will\n\t      appear in the toolbar when a case-sensitive email address\n\t      matches the subject or subject alternative name on a smartcard's\n\t      signing or encryption certificate.\n\nSETUP\n     macOS smart card support can be configured for either fixed key mapping\n     or attribute based mapping. To configure fixed keymapping, use sc_auth(8)\n     or use the pairing notification dialog which automatically appears when\n     an unassociated SmartCard is inserted into a reader. This dialog can be\n     globally suppressed by:\n\n\t   sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard UserPairing -bool NO\n\n     To configure attribute mapping, use the appropriate AttributeMapping\n     section in the configuration file as described below. A configuration\n     file is not provided by default. If no AttributeMapping section exists or\n     the configuration file is missing, attribute matching is not used. If\n     both fixed key mapping and attribute mapping are able to associate the\n     inserted SmartCard with a user, attribute mapping takes precedence.\n\n     By default, certificates do not need to be trusted to allow pairing.\n     Certificate trust can be globally modified using the\n     checkCertificateTrust setting:\n\n\t   sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard checkCertificateTrust -int <level>\n\n     Possible trust level values are:\n\n     0\t certificate trust check is turned off\n\n     1\t certificate trust check is turned on\n\n     2\t certificate trust check is turned on and revocation check is set to\n\t the soft level (If the OCSP/CRL server is unreachable, authentication\n\t succeeds)\n\n     3\t certificate trust check is turned on and revocation check is set to\n\t the hard level (A verified positive response from the OCSP/CRL server\n\t is needed to succeed)\n\nCONFIGURATION FILE\n     A configuration file for SmartCardServices may be set up using\n     /etc/SmartcardLogin.plist and should use a standard plist format. The\n     file permissions must be world readable (644) and recommended ownership\n     is root or a system administrator.\n\n     It may contain the following optional sections:\n\n     UserSelectorPath\n\t      This string value points to the custom UserSelector process\n\t      which is used for associating users with SmartCards. If this\n\t      section is not found or the component at that path does not\n\t      exist, the system UserSelector is used.\n\n     TrustedAuthorities\n\t      It is possible to specify the Certificate Authorities to be used\n\t      for the trust evaluation of SmartCard certificates. This trust\n\t      works in conjunction with Certificate Trust settings (1, 2, or 3\n\t      required) and is also referred to as Certificate Pinning. Place\n\t      SHA-256 fingerprints of Certificate Authorities (as string\n\t      values, comma delimited, and without spaces) in an array named\n\t      TrustedAuthorities. When Certificate Pinning is used, only\n\t      SmartCard certificates issued by a Certificate Authorities in\n\t      this list will be evaluated as trusted. Please note that\n\t      TrustedAuthorities will be ignored when the\n\t      checkCertificateTrust setting is set to 0 (off).\n\n     AttributeMapping\n\t      This section is used to set up an optional attribute mapping for\n\t      the system UserSelector. For each available user record in\n\t      OpenDirectory, certificate field values are combined into a\n\t      format string which is then compared to a predefined attribute\n\t      string. Specifying multiple OpenDirectory attribute strings or\n\t      using conditional formatting in the format string is not\n\t      supported. All items in this section are mandatory.\n\n\t      fields contains an array of string values. This is the list of\n\t      certificate field names that will be used to compare against the\n\t      attribute string. The following field names are supported:\n\n\t      -   Common Name\n\n\t      -   RFC 822 Name\n\n\t      -   NT Principal Name\n\n\t      -   Organization\n\n\t      -   OrganizationalUnit:1\n\n\t      -   OrganizationalUnit:2\n\n\t      -   OrganizationalUnit:3\n\n\t      -   Country\n\n\t      formatString contains a string value which specifies how\n\t      certificate fields will be concatenated. Dollar sign plus number\n\t      (starting with 1) is replaced with the field value at the\n\t      appropriate index.\n\n\t      dsAttributeString contains a string value. This defines the\n\t      target attributes for the desired OpenDirectory user record. It\n\t      will be compared against the generated format strings.\n\n     NotEnforcedGroup\n\t      NotEnforcedGroup contains a string value. This defines the name\n\t      of an Open Directory group that will not be included in\n\t      mandatory smartcard enforcement, when enabled.  This is\n\t      sometimes referred to as User Based Enforcement, and provides\n\t      per-user granularity to SmartcardServices.\n\n\t      Please see section SMARTCARD ENFORCEMENT for more details."

This result will be compared to a\n     directory attribute - in this case, the dsAttrTypeNative:longName field.\n     When a match is found, the corresponding user is considered associated\n     with the SmartCard.\n\nOFFLINE SMARTCARD LOGIN VIA KERBEROS CACHING\n     In environments where macOS clients may not always be able to reach\n     Directory Servers, cached SmartCard login support is possible via\n     Kerberos caching. This configuration allows users with network accounts\n     to authenticate via SmartCard when operating outside the enterprise\n     environment. Note: Initial account setup requires machine binding and\n     access to the directory server.\n\nKERBEROS ATTRIBUTE MAPPING CONFIG EXAMPLE\n     Sample configuration (Please note that if copying and pasting the\n     provided example, the second line starting with <!DOCTYPE and third line\n     ending with .dtd\"> should be a single line.

When used in\n     conjunction with Kerberos Caching, a mobile user account will allow users\n     to authenticate either online and offline.\n\nSMARTCARD ENFORCEMENT\n     There may be a requirement to use a SmartCard for user authentication in\n     your environment. Enforcing the use of the SmartCard for the entire\n     system can be done using MDM or a command:\n\n\t   sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard enforceSmartCard -bool true\n\n     In addition, the system might be configured to allow users who are not\n     paired with SmartCard to login with password using MDM or the command:"
