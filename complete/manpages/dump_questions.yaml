The various methods are:\n\n       dump command args\n\t      Outputs one or more commands.\n\n       dump procedure args\n\t      Outputs one or more procs in sourceable form.\n\n       dump variable args\n\t      Outputs the values of variables in sourceable form.  Recognizes\n\t      nested arrays.  The -filter pattern is used as to filter array\n\t      element names and is interepreted as a glob pattern (defaults to\n\t      {*}).  It is passed down for nested arrays.\n\n       dump widget args\n\t      Outputs one or more widgets by giving their configuration\n\t      options.\tThe -filter pattern is used as to filter the config\n\t      options and is interpreted as a case insensitive regexp pattern\n\t      (defaults to {.*}).\n\nSEE ALSO\n       idebug(n), observe(n), tkcon(1), tkcon(n), tkconrc(5)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       Tk, console, dump\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) Jeffrey Hobbs <jeff at hobbs.org>"
