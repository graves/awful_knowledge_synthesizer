    Manpage text:

    The snrest gateway status command displays the current status of the
           StorNext registrations with a Quantum API Gateway.  This typically
           reports that either all or none of the internal endpoints in StorNext
           are registered with a particular API Gateway..  But there is also the
           possibility, especially in transitory states or when connectivity to
           the API Gateway is problematic, that only a subset of the internal
           endpoints are registered.  If any endpoints are not currently
           registered the system will continue to try to register those endpoints
           until successful.

           There is an additional option to get extra detail on the registration
           status with the -d option.  This provides a detailed display of
           individual internal endpoints that register with the API Gateway and
           thus is primarily intended for use by Quantum Support.

           The snrest gateway ping command tests connectivity to the API Gateway.
           If the API Gateway cannot be contacted an error message is displayed
           and the command exits with a non-zero exit status.  By default, the
           following will ping the currently configured API Gateway:
