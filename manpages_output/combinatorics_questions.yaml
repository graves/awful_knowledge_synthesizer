Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `combinatorics`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nmath::combinatorics(n)\t       Tcl Math Library \tmath::combinatorics(n)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nNAME\n       math::combinatorics - Combinatorial functions in the Tcl Math Library\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       package require Tcl  8.2\n\n       package require math  ?1.2.3?\n\n       ::math::ln_Gamma z\n\n       ::math::factorial x\n\n       ::math::choose n k\n\n       ::math::Beta z w\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The math package contains implementations of several functions useful\n       in combinatorial problems.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::math::ln_Gamma z\n\t      Returns the natural logarithm of the Gamma function for the\n\t      argument z.\n\n\t      The Gamma function is defined as the improper integral from zero\n\t      to positive infinity of\n\n\t\tt**(x-1)*exp(-t) dt\n\n\n\t      The approximation used in the Tcl Math Library is from Lanczos,\n\t      ISIAM J. Numerical Analysis, series B, volume 1, p. 86.  For \"x\n\t      > 1\", the absolute error of the result is claimed to be smaller\n\t      than 5.5*10**-10 -- that is, the resulting value of Gamma when\n\n\t\texp( ln_Gamma( x) )\n\n\t      is computed is expected to be precise to better than nine\n\t      significant figures.\n\n       ::math::factorial x\n\t      Returns the factorial of the argument x.\n\n\t      For integer x, 0 <= x <= 12, an exact integer result is\n\t      returned.\n\n\t      For integer x, 13 <= x <= 21, an exact floating-point result is\n\t      returned on machines with IEEE floating point.\n\n\t      For integer x, 22 <= x <= 170, the result is exact to 1 ULP.\n\n\t      For real x, x >= 0, the result is approximated by computing\n\t      Gamma(x+1) using the ::math::ln_Gamma function, and the result\n\t      is expected to be precise to better than nine significant\n\t      figures.\n\n\t      It is an error to present x <= -1 or x > 170, or a value of x\n\t      that is not numeric.\n\n       ::math::choose n k\n\t      Returns the binomial coefficient C(n, k)\n\n\t\t C(n,k) = n! / k! (n-k)!\n\n\t      If both parameters are integers and the result fits in 32 bits,\n\t      the result is rounded to an integer.\n\n\t      Integer results are exact up to at least n = 34.\tFloating point\n\t      results are precise to better than nine significant figures.\n\n       ::math::Beta z w\n\t      Returns the Beta function of the parameters z and w.\n\n\t\t Beta(z,w) = Beta(w,z) = Gamma(z) * Gamma(w) / Gamma(z+w)\n\n\t      Results are returned as a floating point number precise to\n\t      better than nine significant digits provided that w and z are\n\t      both at least 1.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
