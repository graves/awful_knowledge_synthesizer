For block special devices, all processes using any file on that\n       device are listed.\n\n       The fuser utility shall write to standard error additional information\n       about the named files indicating how the file is being used.\n\n       Any output for processes running on remote systems that have a named\n       file open is unspecified.\n\n       A user may need appropriate privilege to invoke the fuser utility.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The fuser utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of\n       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.\n\n       The following options shall be supported:\n\n       -c     The file is treated as a mount point and the utility shall\n\t      report on any files open in the file system.\n\n       -f     The report shall be only for the named files.\n\n       -u     The user name, in parentheses, associated with each process ID\n\t      written to standard output shall be written to standard error."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the fuser command to list process IDs of all processes that have open files in a specific directory, such as /var/log?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to display both the process IDs and associated user names for files open in the /tmp directory?
