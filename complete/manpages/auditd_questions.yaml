It manages the resulting audit log files\n     and specified log file locations.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -d      Starts the daemon in debug mode — it will not daemonize."

Non-\n     privileged users that are members of this group may read the audit trail\n     log files.\n\nNOTE\n     To assure uninterrupted audit support, the auditd daemon should not be\n     started and stopped manually.  Instead, the audit(8) command should be\n     used to inform the daemon to change state/configuration after altering\n     the audit_control file.\n\n     If auditd is started on-demand by launchd(8) then auditing should only be\n     started and stopped with audit(8).\n\n     On Mac OS X, auditd uses the asl(3) API for writing system log messages.\n     Therefore, only the audit administrator and members of the audit review\n     group will be able to read the system log entries.\n\nFILES\n     /var/audit \tDefault directory for storing audit log files.\n\n     /etc/security\tThe directory containing the auditing configuration\n\t\t\tfiles audit_class(5), audit_control(5),\n\t\t\taudit_event(5), and audit_warn(5)."
