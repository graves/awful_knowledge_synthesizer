You might use this to identify all\n       files in an archive which contain lines matching the specified pattern\n       and either print out the pathnames or extract the files.\n\n       The pattern will be used as a Perl regular expression (as opposed to a\n       simple grep regex).\n\n       Multiple tar archive filenames can be specified - they will each be\n       processed in turn.\n\nOPTIONS\n       --basename (alias -b)\n\t   When matching files are extracted, ignore the directory path from\n\t   the archive and write to the current directory using the basename\n\t   of the file from the archive.  Beware: if two matching files in the\n\t   archive have the same basename, the second file extracted will\n\t   overwrite the first.\n\n       --ignore-case (alias -i)\n\t   Make pattern matching case-insensitive.\n\n       --list-only (alias -l)\n\t   Print the pathname of each matching file from the archive to\n\t   STDOUT.  Without this option, the default behaviour is to extract\n\t   each matching file.\n\n       --verbose (alias -v)\n\t   Log debugging info to STDERR.\n\n       --help (alias -?)\n\t   Display this documentation.\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright 2010 Grant McLean <grantm@cpan.org>\n\n       This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n       under the same terms as Perl itself.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2024-12-14\t\t\t   PTARGREP(1)"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of ptargrep?
  manpageQuestion2: How can I use ptargrep to search for lines containing 'error' in all .tar files in the current directory, ignoring case and listing only the matching filenames?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using ptargrep to extract all files from a tar archive that contain the pattern 'warning' and save them to the current directory without preserving their original directory structure?
