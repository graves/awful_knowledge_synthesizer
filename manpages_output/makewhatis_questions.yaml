Directories may be\n     separated by colons instead of spaces.  If no directories are specified,\n     the contents of the MANPATH environment variable will be used, or if that\n     is not set, the default directory /usr/share/man will be processed.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -a \t      Appends to the output file(s) instead of replacing them.\n\t\t      The output will be sorted with duplicate lines removed,\n\t\t      but may have obsolete entries.\n\n     -i column\t      Indents the description by column characters.  The\n\t\t      default value is 24.\n\n     -n name\t      Uses name instead of whatis."
