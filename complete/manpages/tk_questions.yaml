The command can take any of a\n       number of different forms depending on the option argument.  The legal\n       forms are:\n\n       tk appname ?newName?\n\t      If newName is not specified, this command returns the name of\n\t      the application (the name that may be used in send commands to\n\t      communicate with the application).  If newName is specified,\n\t      then the name of the application is changed to newName.  If the\n\t      given name is already in use, then a suffix of the form “ #2” or\n\t      “ #3” is appended in order to make the name unique.  The\n\t      command's result is the name actually chosen.  newName should\n\t      not start with a capital letter.\tThis will interfere with\n\t      option processing, since names starting with capitals are\n\t      assumed to be classes;  as a result, Tk may not be able to find\n\t      some options for the application.  If sends have been disabled\n\t      by deleting the send command, this command will reenable them\n\t      and recreate the send command.\n\n       tk caret window ?-x x? ?-y y? ?-height height?\n\t      Sets and queries the caret location for the display of the\n\t      specified Tk window window.  The caret is the per-display cursor\n\t      location used for indicating global focus (e.g. to comply with\n\t      Microsoft Accessibility guidelines), as well as for location of\n\t      the over-the-spot XIM (X Input Methods) or Windows IME windows.\n\t      If no options are specified, the last values used for setting\n\t      the caret are return in option-value pair format.  -x and -y\n\t      represent window-relative coordinates, and -height is the height\n\t      of the current cursor location, or the height of the specified\n\t      window if none is given.\n\n       tk scaling ?-displayof window? ?number?\n\t      Sets and queries the current scaling factor used by Tk to\n\t      convert between physical units (for example, points, inches, or\n\t      millimeters) and pixels.\tThe number argument is a floating\n\t      point number that specifies the number of pixels per point on\n\t      window's display.  If the window argument is omitted, it\n\t      defaults to the main window.  If the number argument is omitted,\n\t      the current value of the scaling factor is returned.\n\n\t      A “point” is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch.  A\n\t      scaling factor of 1.0 corresponds to 1 pixel per point, which is\n\t      equivalent to a standard 72 dpi monitor.\tA scaling factor of\n\t      1.25 would mean 1.25 pixels per point, which is the setting for\n\t      a 90 dpi monitor; setting the scaling factor to 1.25 on a 72 dpi\n\t      monitor would cause everything in the application to be\n\t      displayed 1.25 times as large as normal.\tThe initial value for\n\t      the scaling factor is set when the application starts, based on\n\t      properties of the installed monitor, but it can be changed at\n\t      any time.  Measurements made after the scaling factor is changed\n\t      will use the new scaling factor, but it is undefined whether\n\t      existing widgets will resize themselves dynamically to\n\t      accommodate the new scaling factor.\n\n       tk inactive ?-displayof window? ?reset?\n\t      Returns a positive integer, the number of milliseconds since the\n\t      last time the user interacted with the system. If the -displayof\n\t      option is given then the return value refers to the display of\n\t      window; otherwise it refers to the display of the application's\n\t      main window.\n\n\t      tk inactive will return -1, if querying the user inactive time\n\t      is not supported by the system, and in safe interpreters.\n\n\t      If the literal string reset is given as an additional argument,\n\t      the timer is reset and an empty string is returned. Resetting\n\t      the inactivity time is forbidden in safe interpreters and will\n\t      throw and error if tried.\n\n       tk useinputmethods ?-displayof window? ?boolean?\n\t      Sets and queries the state of whether Tk should use XIM (X Input\n\t      Methods) for filtering events.  The resulting state is returned.\n\t      XIM is used in some locales (i.e., Japanese, Korean), to handle\n\t      special input devices. This feature is only significant on X.\n\t      If XIM support is not available, this will always return 0.  If\n\t      the window argument is omitted, it defaults to the main window.\n\t      If the boolean argument is omitted, the current state is\n\t      returned.  This is turned on by default for the main display.\n\n       tk windowingsystem\n\t      Returns the current Tk windowing system, one of x11 (X11-based),\n\t      win32 (MS Windows), or aqua (Mac OS X Aqua).\n\nSEE ALSO\n       send(n), winfo(n)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       application name, send\n\nTk\t\t\t\t      8.4\t\t\t\t tk(n)"
