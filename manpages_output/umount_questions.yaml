It calls the unmount(2) system call to\n     remove a special device or the remote node (rhost:path) from the\n     filesystem tree at the point node.  If either special or node are not\n     provided, the appropriate information is taken from the list of\n     filesystems provided by getfsent(3).\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -a      All the filesystems described via getfsent(3) are unmounted.\n\n     -A      All the currently mounted filesystems except the root are\n\t     unmounted.\n\n     -f      The filesystem is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices\n\t     continue to work, but all other files return errors if further\n\t     accesses are attempted.  The root filesystem cannot be forcibly\n\t     unmounted."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `umount`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-h host\n\t     Only filesystems mounted from the specified host will be\n\t     unmounted.  This option implies the -A option and, unless\n\t     otherwise specified with the -t option, will only unmount NFS\n\t     filesystems.\n\n     -t type\n\t     Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on\n\t     filesystems of the specified type.  More than one type may be\n\t     specified in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem\n\t     types can be prefixed with “no” to specify the filesystem types\n\t     for which action should not be taken.  For example, the umount\n\t     command:\n\n\t\t   umount -A -t nfs,hfs\n\n\t     umounts all currently-mounted filesystems of the type NFS and\n\t     HFS.  (The -a option only unmounts entries in the /etc/fstab\n\t     list.)\n\n     -v      Verbose, additional information is printed out as each filesystem\n\t     is unmounted.\n\nNOTES\n     Due to the complex and interwoven nature of Mac OS X, umount may fail\n     often.  It is recommended that diskutil(1) (as in, ``diskutil unmount\n     /mnt'') be used instead."
