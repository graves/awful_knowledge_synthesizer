In the\n       case of above or below, the direction will be reversed if the menu\n       would show offscreen.  [-height height] Specifies a desired height for\n       the menubutton.\tIf an image or bitmap is being displayed in the\n       menubutton then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms\n       acceptable to Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in lines of text.  If this\n       option is not specified, the menubutton's desired height is computed\n       from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n       [-indicatoron indicatorOn] The value must be a proper boolean value.\n       If it is true then a small indicator rectangle will be displayed on the\n       right side of the menubutton and the default menu bindings will treat\n       this as an option menubutton.  If false then no indicator will be\n       displayed.  [-menu menu] Specifies the path name of the menu associated\n       with this menubutton.  The menu must be a child of the menubutton.\n       [-state state] Specifies one of three states for the menubutton:\n       normal, active, or disabled.  In normal state the menubutton is\n       displayed using the foreground and background options.  The active\n       state is typically used when the pointer is over the menubutton.  In\n       active state the menubutton is displayed using the activeForeground and\n       activeBackground options.  Disabled state means that the menubutton\n       should be insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate\n       the widget and will ignore mouse button presses.  In this state the\n       disabledForeground and background options determine how the button is\n       displayed.  [-width width] Specifies a desired width for the\n       menubutton.  If an image or bitmap is being displayed in the menubutton\n       then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to\n       Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in characters.  If this option is not\n       specified, the menubutton's desired width is computed from the size of\n       the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the menubutton such as its colors,\n       font, text, and initial relief.\tThe menubutton command returns its\n       pathName argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not\n       exist a window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A menubutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap, or\n       image and is associated with a menu widget.  If text is displayed, it\n       must all be in a single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the\n       screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of the\n       wrapLength option) and one of the characters may optionally be\n       underlined using the underline option.  In normal usage, pressing mouse\n       button 1 over the menubutton causes the associated menu to be posted\n       just underneath the menubutton.\tIf the mouse is moved over the menu\n       before releasing the mouse button, the button release causes the\n       underlying menu entry to be invoked.  When the button is released, the\n       menu is unposted."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `menubutton`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nMenubuttons are typically organized into groups called menu bars that\n       allow scanning: if the mouse button is pressed over one menubutton\n       (causing it to post its menu) and the mouse is moved over another\n       menubutton in the same menu bar without releasing the mouse button,\n       then the menu of the first menubutton is unposted and the menu of the\n       new menubutton is posted instead.\n\n       There are several interactions between menubuttons and menus;  see the\n       menu manual entry for information on various menu configurations, such\n       as pulldown menus and option menus.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The menubutton command creates a new Tcl command whose name is\n       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget.\tIt has the following general form:\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
