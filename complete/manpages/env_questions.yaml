    Details of -S (split-string) processing
         The processing of the -S option will split the given string into separate
         arguments based on any space or <tab> characters found in the string.
         Each of those new arguments will then be treated as if it had been
         specified as a separate argument on the original env command.

         Spaces and tabs may be embedded in one of those new arguments by using
         single (“'”) or double (‘"’) quotes, or backslashes (‘\’).  Single quotes
         will escape all non-single quote characters, up to the matching single
         quote.  Double quotes will escape all non-double quote characters, up to
         the matching double quote.  It is an error if the end of the string is
         reached before the matching quote character.

         If -S would create a new argument that starts with the ‘#’ character,
         then that argument and the remainder of the string will be ignored.  The
         ‘\#’ sequence can be used when you want a new argument to start with a
         ‘#’ character, without causing the remainder of the string to be skipped.
