If any\n       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See\n       \"Reporting Bugs\" below.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   Updated Modules and Pragmata\n       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170922_24 to\n\t   5.20180414_24.\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       •   The \"readpipe()\" built-in function now checks at compile time that\n\t   it has only one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar\n\t   context, thus ensuring that it doesn't corrupt the stack at\n\t   runtime.  [GH #2793] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/2793>\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.24.4 represents approximately 7 months of development since Perl\n       5.24.3 and contains approximately 2,400 lines of changes across 49\n       files from 12 authors.\n\n       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there\n       were approximately 1,300 lines of changes to 12 .pm, .t, .c and .h\n       files.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.4:\n\n       Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, John SJ Anderson, Karen Etheridge,\n       Karl Williamson, Renee Baecker, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd Rinaldo, Tony\n       Cook, Yves Orton, Zefram.\n\n       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically\n       generated from version control history.\tIn particular, it does not\n       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who\n       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.\n\n       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN\n       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles\n       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug\n       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at\n       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see\n       \"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\" in perlsec for details of\n       how to report the issue.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5244DELTA(1)"
