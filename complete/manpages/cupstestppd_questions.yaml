It can also\n       be used to list the supported options and available fonts in a PPD\n       file.  The results of testing and any other output are sent to the\n       standard output.\n\n       The first form of cupstestppd tests one or more PPD files on the\n       command-line.  The second form tests the PPD file provided on the\n       standard input.\n\nOPTIONS\n       cupstestppd supports the following options:\n\n       -I filename\n\t    Ignores all PCFileName warnings.\n\n       -I filters\n\t    Ignores all filter errors."
