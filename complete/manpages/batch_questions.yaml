(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)\tAs an\n     alternative, the following keywords may be specified: midnight, noon, or\n     teatime (4pm) and time-of-day may be suffixed with AM, PM, or UTC for\n     running in the morning, the evening, or in UTC time.  The day on which\n     the job is to be run may also be specified by giving a date in the form\n     month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the forms\n     DD.MM.YYYY, DD.MM.YY, MM/DD/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, MMDDYYYY, or MMDDYY.  The\n     specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day.\n     Time can also be specified as: [now] + count time-units, where the time-\n     units can be minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years and at may be\n     told to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the\n     job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.\tThe shortcut next can\n     be used instead of + 1."

The working directory, the\n     environment (except for the variables TERM, TERMCAP, DISPLAY and _) and\n     the umask are retained from the time of invocation.  An at or batch\n     command invoked from a su(1) shell will retain the current userid.  The\n     user will be mailed standard error and standard output from his commands,\n     if any.
