If namespace is not specified, then the\n\t      children are returned for the current namespace.\tThis command\n\t      returns fully-qualified names, which start with a double colon\n\t      (::).  If the optional pattern is given, then this command\n\t      returns only the names that match the glob-style pattern.  The\n\t      actual pattern used is determined as follows: a pattern that\n\t      starts with double colon (::) is used directly, otherwise the\n\t      namespace namespace (or the fully-qualified name of the current\n\t      namespace) is prepended onto the pattern."

    Manpage text:

    As mentioned above, namespace names are looked up differently than the
           names of variables and commands.  Namespace names are always resolved
           in the current namespace.  This means, for example, that a namespace
           eval command that creates a new namespace always creates a child of the
           current namespace unless the new namespace name begins with ::.

           Tcl has no access control to limit what variables, commands, or
           namespaces you can reference.  If you provide a qualified name that
           resolves to an element by the name resolution rule above, you can
           access the element.

           You can access a namespace variable from a procedure in the same
           namespace by using the variable command.  Much like the global command,
           this creates a local link to the namespace variable.  If necessary, it
           also creates the variable in the current namespace and initializes it.
           Note that the global command only creates links to variables in the
           global namespace.  It is not necessary to use a variable command if you
           always refer to the namespace variable using an appropriate qualified
           name.
