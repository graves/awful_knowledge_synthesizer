This may eventually be replaced by an UDP client that is built\n       directly into the postscreen(8) server.\n\nPROTOCOL\n       With each connection, the dnsblog(8) server receives a DNS\n       white/blacklist domain name, an IP address, and an ID.  If the IP\n       address is listed under the DNS white/blacklist, the dnsblog(8) server\n       logs the match and replies with the query arguments plus an address\n       list with the resulting IP addresses, separated by whitespace, and the\n       reply TTL.  Otherwise it replies with the query arguments plus an empty\n       address list and the reply TTL; the reply TTL is -1 if there is no\n       reply, or a negative reply that contains no SOA record.\tFinally, the\n       dnsblog(8) server closes the connection.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as dnsblog(8) processes\n       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command \"postfix reload\"\n       to speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\n       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf\n\t      configuration files.\n\n       daemon_timeout (18000s)\n\t      How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a\n\t      request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.\n\n       postscreen_dnsbl_sites (empty)\n\t      Optional list of DNS white/blacklist domains, filters and weight\n\t      factors.\n\n       ipc_timeout (3600s)\n\t      The time limit for sending or receiving information over an\n\t      internal communication channel.\n\n       process_id (read-only)\n\t      The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       process_name (read-only)\n\t      The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.\n\n       syslog_facility (mail)\n\t      The syslog facility of Postfix logging.\n\n       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog\n\t      records, so that, for example, \"smtpd\" becomes \"prefix/smtpd\".\n\nSEE ALSO\n       smtpd(8), Postfix SMTP server\n       postconf(5), configuration parameters\n       syslogd(5), system logging\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nHISTORY\n       This service was introduced with Postfix version 2.8.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
