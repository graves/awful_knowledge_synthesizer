Otherwise, it creates an ensemble called\n       ensName.  If the ensName is a simple name like \"foo\", then an ensemble\n       command named \"foo\" is added to the current namespace context.  If a\n       command named \"foo\" already exists in that context, then it is deleted.\n       If the ensName contains namespace qualifiers like \"a::b::foo\", then the\n       namespace path is resolved, and the ensemble command is added that\n       namespace context.  Parent namespaces like \"a\" and \"b\" are created\n       automatically, as needed.\n\n       If the ensName contains spaces like \"a::b::foo bar baz\", then\n       additional words like \"bar\" and \"baz\" are treated as sub-ensembles.\n       Sub-ensembles are merely parts within an ensemble; they do not have a\n       Tcl command associated with them.  An ensemble like \"foo\" can have a\n       sub-ensemble called \"foo bar\", which in turn can have a sub-ensemble\n       called \"foo bar baz\".  In this case, the sub-ensemble \"foo bar\" must be\n       created before the sub-ensemble \"foo bar baz\" that resides within it.\n\n       If there are any arguments following ensName, then they are treated as\n       commands, and they are executed to update the ensemble.\tThe following\n       commands are recognized in this context:  part and ensemble.\n\n       The part command defines a new part for the ensemble.  Its syntax is\n       identical to the usual proc command, but it defines a part within an\n       ensemble, instead of a Tcl command.  If a part called partName already\n       exists within the ensemble, then the part command returns an error.\n\n       The ensemble command can be nested inside another ensemble command to\n       define a sub-ensemble."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ensemble`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWHAT IS AN ENSEMBLE?\n       The usual \"info\" command is a composite command--the command name info\n       must be followed by a sub-command like body or globals.\tWe will refer\n       to a command like info as an ensemble, and to sub-commands like body or\n       globals as its parts.\n\n       Ensembles can be nested.  For example, the info command has an ensemble\n       info namespace within it.  This ensemble has parts like info namespace\n       all and info namespace children.\n\n       With ensembles, composite commands can be created and extended in an\n       automatic way.  Any package can find an existing ensemble and add new\n       parts to it.  So extension writers can add their own parts, for\n       example, to the info command.\n\n       The ensemble facility manages all of the part names and keeps track of\n       unique abbreviations.  Normally, you can abbreviate info complete to\n       info comp.  But if an extension adds the part info complexity, the\n       minimum abbreviation for info complete becomes info complet.\n\n       The ensemble facility not only automates the construction of composite\n       commands, but it automates the error handling as well.  If you invoke\n       an ensemble command without specifying a part name, you get an\n       automatically generated error message that summarizes the usage\n       information.  For example, when the info command is invoked without any\n       arguments, it produces the following error message:\n\t      wrong # args: should be one of...\n\t\tinfo args procname\n\t\tinfo body procname\n\t\tinfo cmdcount\n\t\tinfo commands ?pattern?\n\t\tinfo complete command\n\t\tinfo context\n\t\tinfo default procname arg varname\n\t\tinfo exists varName\n\t\tinfo globals ?pattern?\n\t\tinfo level ?number?\n\t\tinfo library\n\t\tinfo locals ?pattern?\n\t\tinfo namespace option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\tinfo patchlevel\n\t\tinfo procs ?pattern?\n\t\tinfo protection ?-command? ?-variable? name\n\t\tinfo script\n\t\tinfo tclversion\n\t\tinfo vars ?pattern?\n\t\tinfo which ?-command? ?-variable? ?-namespace? name\n       You can also customize the way an ensemble responds to errors.  When an\n       ensemble encounters an unspecified or ambiguous part name, it looks for\n       a part called @error.  If it exists, then it is used to handle the\n       error.  This part will receive all of the arguments on the command line\n       starting with the offending part name.  It can find another way of\n       resolving the command, or generate its own error message."
