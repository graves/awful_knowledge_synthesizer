If a log file is\n     determined to require archiving, newsyslog rearranges the files so that\n     “logfile” is empty, “logfile.0” has the last period's logs in it,\n     “logfile.1” has the next to last period's logs in it, and so on, up to a\n     user-specified number of archived logs.  Optionally the archived logs can\n     be compressed to save space.\n\n     A log can be archived for three reasons:\n\n\t   1.\tIt is larger than the configured size (in kilobytes).\n\n\t   2.\tA configured number of hours have elapsed since the log was\n\t\tlast archived.\n\n\t   3.\tThis is the specific configured hour for rotation of the log."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `newsyslog`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe granularity of newsyslog is dependent on how often it is scheduled to\n     run by cron(8).  Since the program is quite fast, it may be scheduled to\n     run every hour without any ill effects, and mode three (above) assumes\n     that this is so.\n\nOPTIONS\n     The following options can be used with newsyslog:\n\n     -f config_file\n\t     Instruct newsyslog to use config_file instead of\n\t     /etc/newsyslog.conf and /etc/newsyslog.d/*.conf for its\n\t     configuration file.\n\n     -a directory\n\t     Specify a directory into which archived log files will be\n\t     written.  If a relative path is given, it is appended to the path\n\t     of each log file and the resulting path is used as the directory\n\t     into which the archived log for that log file will be written.\n\t     If an absolute path is given, all archived logs are written into\n\t     the given directory.  If any component of the path directory does\n\t     not exist, it will be created when newsyslog is run.\n\n     -d directory\n\t     Specify a directory which all log files will be relative to.  To\n\t     allow archiving of logs outside the root, the directory passed to\n\t     the -a option is unaffected."

This option is useful for diagnosing system\n\t     problems by providing you with fresh logs that contain only the\n\t     problems.\n\n     -N      Do not perform any rotations.  This option is intended to be used\n\t     with the -C or -CC options when creating log files is the only\n\t     objective.\n\n     -R tagname\n\t     Specify that newsyslog should rotate a given list of files, even\n\t     if trim conditions are not met for those files.  The tagname is\n\t     only used in the messages written to the log files which are\n\t     rotated.  This differs from the -F option in that one or more log\n\t     files must also be specified, so that newsyslog will only operate\n\t     on those specific files.  This option is mainly intended for the\n\t     daemons or programs which write some log files, and want to\n\t     trigger a rotate based on their own criteria.  With this option\n\t     they can execute newsyslog to trigger the rotate when they want\n\t     it to happen, and still give the system administrator a way to\n\t     specify the rules of rotation (such as how many backup copies are\n\t     kept, and what kind of compression is done).  When a daemon does\n\t     execute newsyslog with the -R option, it should make sure all of\n\t     the log files are closed before calling newsyslog, and then it\n\t     should re-open the files after newsyslog returns.\tUsually the\n\t     calling process will also want to specify the -s option, so\n\t     newsyslog will not send a signal to the very process which called\n\t     it to force the rotate.  Skipping the signal step will also mean\n\t     that newsyslog will return faster, since newsyslog normally waits\n\t     a few seconds after any signal that is sent."
