A list of\n     installed cryptexes and their identifiers can be retrieved via\n     cryptexctl-list(1).\n\n     When a cryptex is uninstalled cryptexd(8) will attempt to dispose of any\n     services that were loaded from the cryptex and unmount the disk image.\n     Complete uninstallation requires a reboot to ensure all processes are\n     killed and all files are no longer in use before cryptexd(8) can safely\n     finish the uninstallation.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -i | --immediate\n\t      Force physical uninstalltion to happen immediately if possible.\n\t      Normally uninstallation does not take full effect until the next\n\t      reboot. This option will attempt to dispose of services loaded\n\t      from the cryptex and unmount the disk image. Note that even if\n\t      the disk image is unmounted successfully, there is no guarantee\n\t      that all services from the cryptex have been disposed of.\n\t      Exercise caution with this option."
