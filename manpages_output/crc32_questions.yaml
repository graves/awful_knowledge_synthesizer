[ -channel chan | -filename\n       file | message ]\n\n       ::crc::Crc32Init ?seed?\n\n       ::crc::Crc32Update token data\n\n       ::crc::Crc32Final token\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This package provides a Tcl implementation of the CRC-32 algorithm\n       based upon information provided at\n       http://www.naaccr.org/standard/crc32/document.html If either the critcl\n       package or the Trf package are available then a compiled version may be\n       used internally to accelerate the checksum calculation.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::crc::crc32 ?-format format? ?-seed value? [ -channel chan | -filename\n       file | message ]\n\t      The command takes either string data or a channel or file name\n\t      and returns a checksum value calculated using the CRC-32\n\t      algorithm. The result is formatted using the format(n) specifier\n\t      provided. The default is to return the value as an unsigned\n\t      integer (format %u).\n\nOPTIONS\n       -channel name\n\t      Return a checksum for the data read from a channel. The command\n\t      will read data from the channel until the eof is true. If you\n\t      need to be able to process events during this calculation see\n\t      the PROGRAMMING INTERFACE section\n\n       -filename name\n\t      This is a convenience option that opens the specified file, sets\n\t      the encoding to binary and then acts as if the -channel option\n\t      had been used. The file is closed on completion.\n\n       -format string\n\t      Return the checksum using an alternative format template.\n\n       -seed value\n\t      Select an alternative seed value for the CRC calculation. The\n\t      default is 0xffffffff. This can be useful for calculating the\n\t      CRC for data structures without first converting the whole\n\t      structure into a string. The CRC of the previous member can be\n\t      used as the seed for calculating the CRC of the next member.\n\t      Note that the crc32 algorithm includes a final XOR step. If\n\t      incremental processing is desired then this must be undone\n\t      before using the output of the algorithm as the seed for further\n\t      processing. A simpler alternative is to use the PROGRAMMING\n\t      INTERFACE which is intended for this mode of operation.\n\nPROGRAMMING INTERFACE\n       The CRC-32 package implements the checksum using a context variable to\n       which additional data can be added at any time. This is expecially\n       useful in an event based environment such as a Tk application or a web\n       server package. Data to be checksummed may be handled incrementally\n       during a fileevent handler in discrete chunks. This can improve the\n       interactive nature of a GUI application and can help to avoid excessive\n       memory consumption.\n\n       ::crc::Crc32Init ?seed?\n\t      Begins a new CRC32 context. Returns a token ID that must be used\n\t      for the remaining functions. An optional seed may be specified\n\t      if required.\n\n       ::crc::Crc32Update token data\n\t      Add data to the checksum identified by token. Calling\n\t      Crc32Update $token \"abcd\" is equivalent to calling Crc32Update\n\t      $token \"ab\" followed by Crc32Update $token \"cb\". See EXAMPLES.\n\n       ::crc::Crc32Final token\n\t      Returns the checksum value and releases any resources held by\n\t      this token. Once this command completes the token will be\n\t      invalid. The result is a 32 bit integer value.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       % crc::crc32 \"Hello, World!\"\n       3964322768"
