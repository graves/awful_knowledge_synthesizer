    NAME
           perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

    DESCRIPTION
           This file contains most of the documentation of the perl public API, as
           generated by embed.pl.  Specifically, it is a listing of functions,
           macros, flags, and variables that may be used by extension writers.
           Besides perlintern and config.h, some items are listed here as being
           actually documented in another pod.

           At the end is a list of functions which have yet to be documented.
           Patches welcome!  The interfaces of these are subject to change without
           notice.

           Some of the functions documented here are consolidated so that a single
           entry serves for multiple functions which all do basically the same
           thing, but have some slight differences.  For example, one form might
           process magic, while another doesn't.  The name of each variation is
           listed at the top of the single entry.  But if all have the same
           signature (arguments and return type) except for their names, only the
           usage for the base form is shown.  If any one of the forms has a
           different signature (such as returning "const" or not) every function's
           signature is explicitly displayed.

    Manpage text:

    Anything not listed here or in the other mentioned pods is not part of
           the public API, and should not be used by extension writers at all.
           For these reasons, blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be
           avoided when writing extensions.

           In Perl, unlike C, a string of characters may generally contain
           embedded "NUL" characters.  Sometimes in the documentation a Perl
           string is referred to as a "buffer" to distinguish it from a C string,
           but sometimes they are both just referred to as strings.

           Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the
           "PL_" prefix.  Again, those not listed here are not to be used by
           extension writers, and can be changed or removed without notice; same
           with macros.  Some macros are provided for compatibility with the
           older, unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future
           release.

           Perl was originally written to handle US-ASCII only (that is characters
           whose ordinal numbers are in the range 0 - 127).  And documentation and
           comments may still use the term ASCII, when sometimes in fact the
           entire range from 0 - 255 is meant.
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the perlapi resource?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you ensure that Perl API global variables are correctly referenced in your extension code?
  manpageQuestion3: What should extension writers avoid when using the Perl API according to the manpage?

    Manpage text:

    The non-ASCII characters below 256 can have various meanings, depending
           on various things.  (See, most notably, perllocale.)  But usually the
           whole range can be referred to as ISO-8859-1.  Often, the term
           "Latin-1" (or "Latin1") is used as an equivalent for ISO-8859-1.  But
           some people treat "Latin1" as referring just to the characters in the
           range 128 through 255, or sometimes from 160 through 255.  This
           documentation uses "Latin1" and "Latin-1" to refer to all 256
           characters.

           Note that Perl can be compiled and run under either ASCII or EBCDIC
           (See perlebcdic).  Most of the documentation (and even comments in the
           code) ignore the EBCDIC possibility.  For almost all purposes the
           differences are transparent.  As an example, under EBCDIC, instead of
           UTF-8, UTF-EBCDIC is used to encode Unicode strings, and so whenever
           this documentation refers to "utf8" (and variants of that name,
           including in function names), it also (essentially transparently) means
           "UTF-EBCDIC".  But the ordinals of characters differ between ASCII,
           EBCDIC, and the UTF- encodings, and a string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may
           occupy a different number of bytes than in UTF-8.

If the input is a number\n       that doesn't fit in an octet, FALSE is returned.  (Perl's documentation\n       uses a colloquial definition of Latin-1, to include all code points\n       below 256.)\n\n       Variant \"isFOO_uvchr\" is exactly like the \"isFOO_L1\" variant, for\n       inputs below 256, but if the code point is larger than 255, Unicode\n       rules are used to determine if it is in the character class.  For\n       example, \"isWORDCHAR_uvchr(0x100)\" returns TRUE, since 0x100 is LATIN\n       CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON in Unicode, and is a word character."

    Manpage text:

    Variant "isFOO_LC_uvchr" acts exactly like "isFOO_LC" for inputs less
           than 256, but for larger ones it returns the Unicode classification of
           the code point.

           Variants "isFOO_LC_utf8" and "isFOO_LC_utf8_safe" are like
           "isFOO_LC_uvchr", but are used for UTF-8 encoded strings.  The two
           forms are different names for the same thing.  Each call to one of
           these classifies the first character of the string starting at "p".
           The second parameter, "e", points to anywhere in the string beyond the
           first character, up to one byte past the end of the entire string.
           Although both variants are identical, the suffix "_safe" in one name
           emphasizes that it will not attempt to read beyond "e - 1", provided
           that the constraint "s < e" is true (this is asserted for in
           "-DDEBUGGING" builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input character is
           malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
           return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to
           change in future releases.

The hash key is specified as \"key\".  The\n\t   \"hash\" parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then\n\t   Perl will compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so\n\t   created.  It will be \"NULL\" if the operation failed or if the value\n\t   did not need to be actually stored within the hash (as in the case\n\t   of tied hashes).  Otherwise the contents of the return value can be\n\t   accessed using the \"He?\" macros described here.  Note that the\n\t   caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count\n\t   of \"val\" before the call, and decrementing it if the function\n\t   returned NULL.  Effectively a successful \"hv_store_ent\" takes\n\t   ownership of one reference to \"val\".  This is usually what you\n\t   want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so if all\n\t   your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, \"hv_store\"\n\t   will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't\n\t   need to do anything further to tidy up.  Note that \"hv_store_ent\"\n\t   only reads the \"key\"; unlike \"val\" it does not take ownership of\n\t   it, so maintaining the correct reference count on \"key\" is entirely\n\t   the caller's responsibility.  The reason it does not take\n\t   ownership, is that \"key\" is not used after this function returns,\n\t   and so can be freed immediately.  \"hv_store\" is not implemented as\n\t   a call to \"hv_store_ent\", and does not create a temporary SV for\n\t   the key, so if your key data is not already in SV form then use\n\t   \"hv_store\" in preference to \"hv_store_ent\"."

The\n\t       reason for the extra code would be because these are from the\n\t       \"LC_NUMERIC\" locale category, which is normally kept set by\n\t       Perl so that the radix is a dot, and the separator is the empty\n\t       string, no matter what the underlying locale is supposed to be,\n\t       and so to get the expected results, you have to temporarily\n\t       toggle into the underlying locale, and later toggle back.  (You\n\t       could use plain \"nl_langinfo\" and\n\t       \"STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING\" for this but then you\n\t       wouldn't get the other advantages of \"Perl_langinfo()\"; not\n\t       keeping \"LC_NUMERIC\" in the C (or equivalent) locale would\n\t       break a lot of CPAN, which is expecting the radix (decimal\n\t       point) character to be a dot.)"

    SV Handling
           An SV (or AV, HV, etc.) is allocated in two parts: the head (struct sv,
           av, hv...) contains type and reference count information, and for many
           types, a pointer to the body (struct xrv, xpv, xpviv...), which
           contains fields specific to each type.  Some types store all they need
           in the head, so don't have a body.

           In all but the most memory-paranoid configurations (ex: PURIFY), heads
           and bodies are allocated out of arenas, which by default are
           approximately 4K chunks of memory parcelled up into N heads or bodies.
           Sv-bodies are allocated by their sv-type, guaranteeing size consistency
           needed to allocate safely from arrays.

           For SV-heads, the first slot in each arena is reserved, and holds a
           link to the next arena, some flags, and a note of the number of slots.
           Snaked through each arena chain is a linked list of free items; when
           this becomes empty, an extra arena is allocated and divided up into N
           items which are threaded into the free list.

If you want to throw a\n\t   non-string object, or build an error message in an SV yourself, it\n\t   is preferable to use the \"croak_sv\" function, which does not\n\t   involve clobbering \"ERRSV\".\n\n\t    void  vcroak(const char* pat, va_list* args)\n\n       \"vwarn\"\n\t   This is an XS interface to Perl's \"warn\" function.\n\n\t   This is like \"warn\", but \"args\" are an encapsulated argument list.\n\n\t   Unlike with \"vcroak\", \"pat\" is not permitted to be null.\n\n\t    void  vwarn(const char* pat, va_list* args)\n\n       \"vwarner\"\n\t   This is like \"warner\", but \"args\" are an encapsulated argument\n\t   list.\n\n\t    void  vwarner(U32 err, const char* pat, va_list* args)\n\n       \"warn\"\n       \"warn_nocontext\"\n\t   These are XS interfaces to Perl's \"warn\" function.\n\n\t   They take a sprintf-style format pattern and argument list, which\n\t   are used to generate a string message.

In the latter case, you will be asked\n       to submit a patch to document the function.
