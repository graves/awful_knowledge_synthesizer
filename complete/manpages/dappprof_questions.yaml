Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       dappprof [-acehoTU] [-u lib] { -p PID | command }\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       dappprof prints details on user and library call times for processes as\n       a summary style aggragation. By default the user fuctions are traced,\n       options can be used to trace library activity. Output can include\n       function counts, elapsed times and on cpu times.\n\n       The elapsed times are interesting, to help identify functions that take\n       some time to complete (during which the process may have slept). CPU\n       time helps us identify syscalls that are consuming CPU cycles to run.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a     print all data\n\n       -c     print function counts\n\n       -e     print elapsed times, ns\n\n       -o     print CPU times, ns\n\n       -T     print totals\n\n       -p PID examine this PID\n\n       -u lib trace this library instead\n\n       -U     trace all library and user functions\n\nEXAMPLES\n       run and examine the \"df -h\" command,\n\t      # dappprof df -h\n\n       print elapsed times, on-cpu times and counts for \"df -h\",\n\t      # dappprof -ceo df -h\n\n       print elapsed times for PID 1871,\n\t      # dappprof -p 1871\n\n       print all data for PID 1871,\n\t      # dappprof -ap 1871\n\nFIELDS\n       CALL   Function call name\n\n       ELAPSED\n\t      Total elapsed time, nanoseconds\n\n       CPU    Total on-cpu time, nanoseconds\n\n       COUNT  Number of occurrences\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       dappprof will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       dapptrace(1M), dtrace(1M), apptrace(1)"
