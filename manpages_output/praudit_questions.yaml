If no file argument is\n     specified, the standard input is used by default.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -d del  Specifies the delimiter.  The default delimiter is the comma.\n\n     -l      Prints the entire record on the same line.  If this option is not\n\t     specified, every token is displayed on a different line.\n\n     -n      Do not convert user and group IDs to their names but leave in\n\t     their numeric forms.\n\n     -p      Specify this option if input to praudit is piped from the tail(1)\n\t     utility.  This causes praudit to sync to the start of the next\n\t     record.\n\n     -r      Prints the records in their raw form.  Show records and event\n\t     types in a numeric form (also known as raw form).\tThis option is\n\t     exclusive from -s."
