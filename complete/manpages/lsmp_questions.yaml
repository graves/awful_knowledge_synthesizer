Run with root privileges to\n\t  see detailed info about port destinations etc.\n\n     lsmp -v Show information in detail for Kernel object based ports.\n\t  Including thread ports and special ports attached to it.\n\n     lsmp -a Show mach port usage for all tasks in the system\n\n     lsmp -j <path> Save output as JSON to <path>.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The lsmp command prints information about every active right in a task's\n     port space, giving a view into the inter-process communication behavior\n     of that task.\n\n     Following is an explanation of each symbol and values from the output.\n     name\t : Task unique name for a port. A \"-\" signifies that this is a member of a port-set\n     ipc-object  : A unique identifier for a kernel object. A \"+\" sign implies that this entry is expanded from above ipc-object.\n     rights\t : Rights corresponding to this name. Possible values are recv, send, send-once and port-set.\n     flags\t : Flags indicating port status.\n\t\t     T : Port has tempowner set\n\t\t     G : Port is guarded\n\t\t     S : Port has strict guarding restrictions\n\t\t     I : Port has importance donation flag set\n\t\t     R : Port is marked reviving\n\t\t     P : Port has task pointer set\n     boost\t : Importance boost count\n     reqs\t : Notifications armed on this port.\n\t\t     D : Dead name notification\n\t\t     N : No sender notification\n\t\t     P : Port Destroy requests\n     recv\t : Number of recv rights for this name.\n     send\t : Number of send rights stored at this name. This does NOT reflect the total number of send rights for this recv right.\n     sonce\t : Number of outstanding send-once rights for this receive right.\n     oref\t : Do send rights exist somewhere for this receive right?\n     qlimit\t : Queue limit for this port. If orefs column shows -> then it indicates the queue limit on the destination port. And a <- indicates this port right is destined to receive messages from process referred in identifier column.\n     msgcount\t : Number of messages enqueued on this port. See qlimit for -> and <- explanations.\n     context\t : Mach port context value.\n     identifier  : A unique identifier for a kernel object or task's name for this right. This field is described by the type column."
