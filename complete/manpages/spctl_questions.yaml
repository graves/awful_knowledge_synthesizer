The --anchor option takes the\n     hash of a (full) certificate and turns it into a requirement matching any\n     signature based on that anchor certificate.  Alternatively, it can take\n     the absolute path of a certificate file on disk, containing the DER form\n     of an anchor certificate.\tFinally, the --hash option generates a code\n     requirement that denotes only and exactly one program whose CodeDirectory\n     hash is given.
