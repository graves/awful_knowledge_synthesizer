The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a\n       terminal using nroff(1), normally via man(1), or printing using\n       troff(1).\n\n       input is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in\n       code).  If input isn't given, it defaults to \"STDIN\".  output, if\n       given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If output\n       isn't given, the formatted output is written to \"STDOUT\".  Several POD\n       files can be processed in the same pod2man invocation (saving module\n       load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of input and output\n       files on the command line.\n\n       --section, --release, --center, --date, and --official can be used to\n       set the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will assume\n       various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.\n\n       pod2man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font\n       named \"CW\".  If yours is called something else (like \"CR\"), use --fixed\n       to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for\n       printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and\n       bold italic fixed-width output.\n\n       Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man\n       also takes care of formatting func(), func(n), and simple variable\n       references like $foo or @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for\n       them; complex expressions like $fred{'stuff'} will still need to be\n       escaped, though.  It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens\n       into en dashes, makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes,\n       fixes \"paired quotes,\" and takes care of several other troff-specific\n       tweaks.\tSee Pod::Man for complete information.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -c string, --center=string\n\t   Sets the centered page header for the \".TH\" macro to string.  The\n\t   default is \"User Contributed Perl Documentation\", but also see\n\t   --official below.\n\n       -d string, --date=string\n\t   Set the left-hand footer string for the \".TH\" macro to string.  By\n\t   default, the modification date of the input file will be used, or\n\t   the current date if input comes from \"STDIN\", and will be based on\n\t   UTC (so that the output will be reproducible regardless of local\n\t   time zone).\n\n       --errors=style\n\t   Set the error handling style.  \"die\" says to throw an exception on\n\t   any POD formatting error.  \"stderr\" says to report errors on\n\t   standard error, but not to throw an exception.  \"pod\" says to\n\t   include a POD ERRORS section in the resulting documentation\n\t   summarizing the errors.  \"none\" ignores POD errors entirely, as\n\t   much as possible.\n\n\t   The default is \"die\".\n\n       --fixed=font\n\t   The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults\n\t   to \"CW\".  Some systems may want \"CR\" instead.  Only matters for\n\t   troff(1) output.\n\n       --fixedbold=font\n\t   Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to \"CB\".  Only\n\t   matters for troff(1) output.\n\n       --fixeditalic=font\n\t   Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a\n\t   misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique\n\t   version, not an italic version).  Defaults to \"CI\".\tOnly matters\n\t   for troff(1) output.\n\n       --fixedbolditalic=font\n\t   Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width\n\t   font.  Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to \"CB\".\n\t   Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as \"CX\".\n\t   Only matters for troff(1) output.\n\n       -h, --help\n\t   Print out usage information.\n\n       -l, --lax\n\t   No longer used.  pod2man used to check its input for validity as a\n\t   manual page, but this should now be done by podchecker(1) instead.\n\t   Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does\n\t   anything.\n\n       --lquote=quote\n       --rquote=quote\n\t   Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text.  --lquote sets the\n\t   left quote mark and --rquote sets the right quote mark.  Either may\n\t   also be set to the special value \"none\", in which case no quote\n\t   mark is added on that side of C<> text (but the font is still\n\t   changed for troff output).\n\n\t   Also see the --quotes option, which can be used to set both quotes\n\t   at once.  If both --quotes and one of the other options is set,\n\t   --lquote or --rquote overrides --quotes.\n\n       -n name, --name=name\n\t   Set the name of the manual page for the \".TH\" macro to name.\n\t   Without this option, the manual name is set to the uppercased base\n\t   name of the file being converted unless the manual section is 3, in\n\t   which case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.\n\t   If it is, a path like \".../lib/Pod/Man.pm\" is converted into a name\n\t   like \"Pod::Man\".  This option, if given, overrides any automatic\n\t   determination of the name.\n\n\t   Although one does not have to follow this convention, be aware that\n\t   the convention for UNIX man pages for commands is for the man page\n\t   title to be in all-uppercase, even if the command isn't.\n\n\t   This option is probably not useful when converting multiple POD\n\t   files at once.\n\n\t   When converting POD source from standard input, the name will be\n\t   set to \"STDIN\" if this option is not provided.  Providing this\n\t   option is strongly recommended to set a meaningful manual page\n\t   name.\n\n       --nourls\n\t   Normally, L<> formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are\n\t   formatted to show both the anchor text and the URL.\tIn other\n\t   words:\n\n\t       L<foo|http://example.com/>\n\n\t   is formatted as:\n\n\t       foo <http://example.com/>\n\n\t   This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given,\n\t   so this example would be formatted as just \"foo\".  This can produce\n\t   less cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly\n\t   important.\n\n       -o, --official\n\t   Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the\n\t   standard Perl release, if --center is not also given.\n\n       -q quotes, --quotes=quotes\n\t   Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to quotes.  If\n\t   quotes is a single character, it is used as both the left and right\n\t   quote.  Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the\n\t   string is used as the left quote and the second is used as the\n\t   right quote.\n\n\t   quotes may also be set to the special value \"none\", in which case\n\t   no quote marks are added around C<> text (but the font is still\n\t   changed for troff output).\n\n\t   Also see the --lquote and --rquote options, which can be used to\n\t   set the left and right quotes independently.  If both --quotes and\n\t   one of the other options is set, --lquote or --rquote overrides\n\t   --quotes.\n\n       -r version, --release=version\n\t   Set the centered footer for the \".TH\" macro to version.  By\n\t   default, this is set to the version of Perl you run pod2man under.\n\t   Setting this to the empty string will cause some *roff\n\t   implementations to use the system default value.\n\n\t   Note that some system \"an\" macro sets assume that the centered\n\t   footer will be a modification date and will prepend something like\n\t   \"Last modified: \".  If this is the case for your target system, you\n\t   may want to set --release to the last modified date and --date to\n\t   the version number.\n\n       -s string, --section=string\n\t   Set the section for the \".TH\" macro.  The standard section\n\t   numbering convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system\n\t   calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for\n\t   games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator\n\t   commands.  There is a lot of variation here, however; some systems\n\t   (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous\n\t   information, and 7 for devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8,\n\t   or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers that are\n\t   reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n\t   By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in \".pm\",\n\t   in which case section 3 will be selected.\n\n       --stderr\n\t   By default, pod2man dies if any errors are detected in the POD\n\t   input.  If --stderr is given and no --errors flag is present,\n\t   errors are sent to standard error, but pod2man does not abort.\n\t   This is equivalent to \"--errors=stderr\" and is supported for\n\t   backward compatibility.\n\n       -u, --utf8\n\t   By default, pod2man produces the most conservative possible *roff\n\t   output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different\n\t   *roff implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations\n\t   cannot handle non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII\n\t   characters are converted either to a *roff escape sequence that\n\t   tries to create a properly accented character (at least for troff\n\t   output) or to \"X\".\n\n\t   This option says to instead output literal UTF-8 characters.  If\n\t   your *roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output\n\t   format to use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-\n\t   ASCII characters.  However, be warned that *roff source with\n\t   literal UTF-8 characters is not supported by many implementations\n\t   and may even result in segfaults and other bad behavior.\n\n\t   Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your\n\t   POD source should be properly declared unless it's US-ASCII.\n\t   Pod::Simple will attempt to guess the encoding and may be\n\t   successful if it's Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will warn, which by\n\t   default results in a pod2man failure.  Use the \"=encoding\" command\n\t   to declare the encoding.  See perlpod(1) for more information.\n\n       -v, --verbose\n\t   Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n       As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that\n       output includes errata (a \"POD ERRORS\" section generated with\n       \"--errors=pod\"), pod2man will exit with status 0.  If any of the\n       documents being processed do not result in an output document, pod2man\n       will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a POD document\n       being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of\n       \"die\", pod2man will abort immediately with exit status 255.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       If pod2man fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for\n       information about what those errors might mean.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\t   pod2man program > program.1\n\t   pod2man SomeModule.pm /usr/perl/man/man3/SomeModule.3\n\t   pod2man --section=7 note.pod > note.7\n\n       If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you\n       probably want to set the C and D registers to set contiguous page\n       numbering and even/odd paging, at least on some versions of man(7).\n\n\t   troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...\n\n       To get index entries on \"STDERR\", turn on the F register, as in:\n\n\t   troff -man -rF1 perl.1\n\n       The indexing merely outputs messages via \".tm\" for each major page,\n       section, subsection, item, and any \"X<>\" directives.  See Pod::Man for\n       more details.\n\nBUGS\n       Lots of this documentation is duplicated from Pod::Man.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Russ Allbery <rra@cpan.org>, based very heavily on the original pod2man\n       by Larry Wall and Tom Christiansen.\n\nCOPYRIGHT AND LICENSE\n       Copyright 1999-2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012-2019 Russ Allbery\n       <rra@cpan.org>\n\n       This program is free software; you may redistribute it and/or modify it\n       under the same terms as Perl itself.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Pod::Man, Pod::Simple, man(1), nroff(1), perlpod(1), podchecker(1),\n       perlpodstyle(1), troff(1), man(7)\n\n       The man page documenting the an macro set may be man(5) instead of\n       man(7) on your system.\n\n       The current version of this script is always available from its web\n       site at <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/podlators/>.
