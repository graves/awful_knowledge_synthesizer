This command\n       may be used to invoke various operations on the skiplist. It has the\n       following general form:\n\n       skiplistName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t      Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n       Skip lists are an alternative data structure to binary trees. They can\n       be used to maintain ordered lists over any sequence of insertions and\n       deletions. Skip lists use randomness to achieve probabilistic\n       balancing, and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in\n       skip lists are much simpler and faster than those for binary trees.\n\n       To read more about skip lists see Pugh, William.  Skip lists: a\n       probabilistic alternative to balanced trees In: Communications of the\n       ACM, June 1990, 33(6) 668-676.\n\n       Currently, the key can be either a number or a string, and comparisons\n       are performed with the built in greater than operator.  The following\n       commands are possible for skiplist objects:\n\n       skiplistName delete node ?node...?\n\t      Remove the specified nodes from the skiplist.\n\n       skiplistName destroy\n\t      Destroy the skiplist, including its storage space and associated\n\t      command.\n\n       skiplistName insert key value\n\t      Insert a node with the given key and value into the skiplist. If\n\t      a node with that key already exists, then the that node's value\n\t      is updated and its node level is returned. Otherwise a new node\n\t      is created and 0 is returned.\n\n       skiplistName search node ?-key key?\n\t      Search for a given key in a skiplist. If not found then 0 is\n\t      returned.  If found, then a two element list of 1 followed by\n\t      the node's value is retuned.\n\n       skiplistName size\n\t      Return a count of the number of nodes in the skiplist.\n\n       skiplistName walk cmd\n\t      Walk the skiplist from the first node to the last. At each node,\n\t      the command cmd will be evaluated with the key and value of the\n\t      current node appended.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the struct::skiplist command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the struct::skiplist command to insert a key-value pair into a skiplist and retrieve the node level if the key already exists?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you demonstrate how to search for a specific key in a skiplist using the struct::skiplist command and handle the result?
