In\n     the absence of any options, nfsstat displays NFS client and server\n     statistics.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -c      Show NFS client statistics.\n\n     -e      Show NFS server exported directory statistics.\n\n     -m [mountpath]\n\t     Show NFS mount information.\n\n     -s      Show NFS server statistics.\n\n     -3      Print only NFS v3 statistics.\n\n     -4      Print only NFS v4 statistics.\n\n     -u      Show NFS server active user statistics.\n\n     -f JSON\n\t     Print output as JSON format.\n\n     -w wait\n\t     Display a shorter summary at wait second intervals.\n\n     -n net|user\n\t     Show network addresses as numbers, or show users as uid numbers.\n\t     This option can appear multiple times."
