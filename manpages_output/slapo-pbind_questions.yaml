The remote\n       connection is managed using an instance of the ldap backend.\n\n\n       The pbind overlay uses a subset of the ldap backend's config\n       directives. They are described in more detail in slapd-ldap(5).\n\n       Note: this overlay is built into the ldap backend; it is not a separate\n       module.\n\n\n       overlay pbind\n\t      This directive adds the proxy bind overlay to the current\n\t      backend.\tThe proxy bind overlay may be used with any backend,\n\t      but it is mainly intended for use with local storage backends.\n\n\n       uri <ldapurl>\n\t      LDAP server to use.\n\n\n       tls <TLS parameters>\n\t      Specify the use of TLS.\n\n\n       network-timeout <time>\n\t      Set the network timeout."
