Each delivery request\n       specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain or host to deliver\n       to, and one or more recipients.\tThis program expects to be run from\n       the master(8) process manager.\n\n       The local(8) daemon updates queue files and marks recipients as\n       finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried\n       again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent to the\n       bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.\n\nCASE FOLDING\n       All delivery decisions are made using the bare recipient name (i.e. the\n       address localpart), folded to lower case.  See also under ADDRESS\n       EXTENSION below for a few exceptions.\n\nSYSTEM-WIDE AND USER-LEVEL ALIASING\n       The system administrator can set up one or more system-wide\n       sendmail-style alias databases.\tUsers can have sendmail-style\n       ~/.forward files.  Mail for name is delivered to the alias name, to\n       destinations in ~name/.forward, to the mailbox owned by the user name,\n       or it is sent back as undeliverable."

    An alias or ~/.forward file may list any combination of external
           commands, destination file names, :include: directives, or mail
           addresses.  See aliases(5) for a precise description. Each line in a
           user's .forward file has the same syntax as the right-hand part of an
           alias.

           When an address is found in its own alias expansion, delivery is made
           to the user instead. When a user is listed in the user's own ~/.forward
           file, delivery is made to the user's mailbox instead.  An empty
           ~/.forward file means do not forward mail.

           In order to prevent the mail system from using up unreasonable amounts
           of memory, input records read from :include: or from ~/.forward files
           are broken up into chunks of length line_length_limit.

           While expanding aliases, ~/.forward files, and so on, the program
           attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The duplicate_filter_limit
           configuration parameter limits the number of remembered recipients.

    MAIL FORWARDING
           For the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is re-submitted as a new
           message, so that each recipient has a separate on-file delivery status
           record.

           In order to stop mail forwarding loops early, the software adds an
           optional Delivered-To: header with the final envelope recipient
           address. If mail arrives for a recipient that is already listed in a
           Delivered-To: header, the message is bounced.

    MAILBOX DELIVERY
           The default per-user mailbox is a file in the UNIX mail spool directory
           (/var/mail/user or /var/spool/mail/user); the location can be specified
           with the mail_spool_directory configuration parameter. Specify a name
           ending in / for qmail-compatible maildir delivery.

           Alternatively, the per-user mailbox can be a file in the user's home
           directory with a name specified via the home_mailbox configuration
           parameter. Specify a relative path name. Specify a name ending in / for
           qmail-compatible maildir delivery.

    Mailbox delivery can be delegated to an external command specified with
           the mailbox_command_maps and mailbox_command configuration parameters.
           The command executes with the privileges of the recipient user
           (exceptions: secondary groups are not enabled; in case of delivery as
           root, the command executes with the privileges of default_privs).

           Mailbox delivery can be delegated to alternative message transports
           specified in the master.cf file.  The mailbox_transport_maps and
           mailbox_transport configuration parameters specify an optional message
           transport that is to be used for all local recipients, regardless of
           whether they are found in the UNIX passwd database.  The
           fallback_transport_maps and fallback_transport parameters specify an
           optional message transport for recipients that are not found in the
           aliases(5) or UNIX passwd database.

           In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery, the local(8) daemon
           prepends a "From sender time_stamp" envelope header to each message,
           prepends an X-Original-To: header with the recipient address as given
           to Postfix, prepends an optional Delivered-To: header with the final
           envelope recipient address, prepends a Return-Path: header with the
           envelope sender address, prepends a > character to lines beginning with
           "From ", and appends an empty line.  The mailbox is locked for
           exclusive access while delivery is in progress. In case of problems, an
           attempt is made to truncate the mailbox to its original length.

    EXTERNAL COMMAND DELIVERY
           The allow_mail_to_commands configuration parameter restricts delivery
           to external commands. The default setting (alias, forward) forbids
           command destinations in :include: files.

           Optionally, the process working directory is changed to the path
           specified with command_execution_directory (Postfix 2.2 and later).
           Failure to change directory causes mail to be deferred.

           The command_execution_directory parameter value is subject to
           interpolation of $user (recipient username), $home (recipient home
           directory), $shell (recipient shell), $recipient (complete recipient
           address), $extension (recipient address extension), $domain (recipient

           RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)

    DIAGNOSTICS
           Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message
           files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt
           queue afterwards.

           Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the
           postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.

    SECURITY
           The local(8) delivery agent needs a dual personality 1) to access the
           private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms, 2) to impersonate the
           recipient and deliver to recipient-specified files or commands. It is
           therefore security sensitive.

           The local(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution
           of $1 etc. in alias_maps, because that would open a security hole.

           The local(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the
           proxymap(8) server within alias_maps. Instead it will open the table
           directly.  Before Postfix version 2.2, the local(8) delivery agent will
