In this case the file whose\n     accessibility is to be determined is located relative to the directory\n     associated with the file descriptor fd instead of the current working\n     directory.  If faccessat() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the fd\n     parameter, the current working directory is used and the behavior is\n     identical to a call to access().  Values for flag are constructed by a\n     bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in\n     <fcntl.h>:"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the access system call?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the access() function to check if a file named 'example.txt' is readable by the current user?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using faccessat() to check if a file located in the directory specified by file descriptor 3 is writable, considering that the path is relative to that directory?
