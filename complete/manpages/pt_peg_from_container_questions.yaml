From CONTAINER format\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       package require Tcl  8.5\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package does not exist.  There is no need for it.  The CONTAINER\n       format for parsing expression grammars is a piece of Tcl code which,\n       then sourced, provides a class whose instances have the grammar we wish\n       to import loaded.  Another way of looking at this is, the CONTAINER\n       output is its own import package.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category pt of the\n       Tcllib SF Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].\n       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either\n       package and/or documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       EBNF, LL(k), PEG, TDPL, context-free languages, expression, grammar,\n       matching, parser, parsing expression, parsing expression grammar, push\n       down automaton, recursive descent, state, top-down parsing languages,\n       transducer\n\nCATEGORY\n       Parsing and Grammars\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2009 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
