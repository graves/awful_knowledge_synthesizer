This option\n\t     is intended for applications such as shutdown(8), that call halt\n\t     or reboot and log this themselves.\n\n     -N      The file system cache is not flushed during the initial process\n\t     clean-up, however the kernel level reboot(2) is still processed\n\t     with a sync.  This option can be useful for performing a\n\t     “best-effort” reboot when devices might be unavailable.  This can\n\t     happen when devices have been disconnected."

  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the reboot command with the -N option to perform a 'best-effort' reboot when some devices are disconnected?
