This also controls the locations that are searched for by man(1)\n       for developer tool manpages.\n\n       This allows you to easily switch between different versions of the\n       Xcode tools and can be used to update the path to the Xcode if it is\n       moved after installation.\n\n   Usage\n       When multiple Xcode applications are installed on a system (e.g.\n       /Applications/Xcode.app, containing the latest Xcode, and\n       /Applications/Xcode-beta.app containing a beta) use xcode-select\n       --switch path/to/Xcode.app to specify the Xcode that you wish to use\n       for command line developer tools."
