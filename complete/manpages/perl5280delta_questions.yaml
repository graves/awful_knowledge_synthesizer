    The "sprintf" %j format size modifier is now available with pre-C99
           compilers
           The actual size used depends on the platform, so remains unportable.

       Close-on-exec flag set atomically
           When opening a file descriptor, perl now generally opens it with its
           close-on-exec flag already set, on platforms that support doing so.
           This improves thread safety, because it means that an "exec" initiated
           by one thread can no longer cause a file descriptor in the process of
           being opened by another thread to be accidentally passed to the
           executed program.

           Additionally, perl now sets the close-on-exec flag more reliably,
           whether it does so atomically or not.  Most file descriptors were
           getting the flag set, but some were being missed.

           scope of "use feature 'bitwise'" are no longer experimental.  Because
           the number-specific ops are spelled the same way as the existing
           operators that choose their behaviour based on their operands, these
           operators must still be enabled via the "bitwise" feature, in either of

    hostname() won't accept arguments in Perl 5.32
           Passing arguments to "Sys::Hostname::hostname()" was already
           deprecated, but didn't have a removal date.  This has now been
           scheduled for Perl 5.32.  [GH #14662]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14662>

       Module removals
           The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
           future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
           Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list
           them as prerequisites.

           The core versions of these modules will now issue "deprecated"-category
           warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation
           warnings, install the modules in question from CPAN.

           Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are
           encouraged to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily
           hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-
           capable Perl installation, not usually on concerns over their design.

    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
           generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
           include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
           reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

           Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
           modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
           community for helping Perl to flourish.

           For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
           database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
           <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.
