This is accomplished by copying the data from the disk and\n       relabeling the destination disk with the name of the source disk.  The\n       source disk is also relabeled with its original name with a suffix\n       added (this is \".old\" by default but this can be changed with the -s\n       option.\n\n       WARNING: Using this command incorrectly can cause loss of data.\tPlease\n       ensure that you understand the procedures to safely execute this\n       command completely.  Also, this command is not supported for filesystem\n       disks that contain data, it must be used for Exclusive Metadata or\n       Journal disks only.\n\n       Attempting to run this command on a disk that is being used on an\n       actively running filesystem will cause data corruption.\tAll\n       referencing filesystems must be stopped and remain stopped during the\n       processing of this command."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use sndiskmove to migrate the contents of a disk named 'SourceVolume' to a new disk named 'DestinationVolume', with the source disk relabeled with a suffix of '.old'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using sndiskmove to copy data from a disk named 'oldDisk' to a new disk named 'newDisk', with a buffer size of 256MB and verbose output enabled?
