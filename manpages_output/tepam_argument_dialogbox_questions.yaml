Each entry element of a form is defined via a data entry\n       item that can be provided to argument_dialogbox in two formats:\n\n       tepam::argument_dialogbox item_name item_attributes ?item_name\n       item_attributes? ?...?\n\t      Using this first format, each data entry item is defined via a\n\t      named argument. The item name defines thereby the entry element\n\t      type that has to be used in the form. The item data, called item\n\t      attributes, defines the variable which is attributed to the data\n\t      entry element as well as eventual formatting and context\n\t      information."

This procedure has three arguments; the first one is the\n       widget path, the second one a subcommand and the third argument has\n       various purposes:\n       proc tepam::ad_form(<WidgetName>) {W Command {Par \"\"}} {\n\t  upvar Option Option; # if required\n\t  variable argument_dialogbox; # if required\n\t  switch $Command {\n\t     \"create\" <CreateCommandSequence>\n\t     \"set_choice\" <SetChoiceCommandSequence>\n\t     \"set\" <SetCommandv>\n\t     \"get\" <GetCommandSequence>\n\t  }\n       }\n       Argument_dialogbox takes care about the -label and -text attributes for\n       all entry widgets. For the entry widget it creates a frame into which\n       the entry widget components can be placed. The path to this frame is\n       provided via the W argument.  The entry widget procedure has to support\n       3 mandatory and an optional command, defined via the Command argument:\n\n       create The entry widget is called a first time with the command create\n\t      to build the entry widget.\n\n\t      The frames that are made available by argument_dialogbox for the\n\t      entry widgets are by default only extendable in the X direction.\n\t      To make them also extendable in the Y direction, for example for\n\t      extendable list boxes, the command ad_form(make_expandable) $W\n\t      has to be executed when an entry widget is built.\n\n       set_choice\n\t      The entry widget procedure is only called with the set_choice\n\t      command when the -choices or -choicevariable has been specified.\n\t      The command is therefore only relevant for list and combo boxes.\n\n\t      The available selection list, either specified with the -choices\n\t      or -choicevariable attribute is provided via the Par argument to\n\t      the entry widget procedure which can initialize the selection\n\t      list with this data.\n\n       set    If a default value is either defined via the -default attribute\n\t      or via a preceding call the entry widget procedure is called\n\t      with the set command. The argument Par contains in this case the\n\t      value to which the entry widget has to be initialized.\n\n       get    The entry widget procedure's command get has to return the\n\t      actual value of the entry widget.\n\n       Eventually specified entry widget item attributes are available via the\n       Option array variable of the calling procedure. This variable becomes\n       accessible inside the entry widget procedure via the upvar command.\n\n       There may be a need to store some information in a variable. The array\n       variable argument_dialogbox has to be used for this purpose together\n       with array indexes starting with \"$W,\", e.g.\n       argument_dialogbox($W,values).\n\n       Examples of entry widget procedures are directly provided by the TEPAM\n       package source file that specifies the standard entry widget\n       procedures. The simplest procedure is certainly the one for the basic\n       entry widget:\n       proc tepam::ad_form(entry) {W Command {Par \"\"}} {\n\t  switch $Command {\n\t     \"create\" {pack [entry \\$W.entry] -fill x \\\n\t\t\t       -expand yes -pady 4 -side left}\n\t     \"set\" {\\$W.entry insert 0 $Par}\n\t     \"get\" {return [\\$W.entry get]}\n\t  }\n       }\n       It is also possible to relay on an existing entry widget procedure to\n       create a new, more specific one. The radiobox widget is used for\n       example, to create a new entry widget that allows selecting either the\n       option left, center or right. The original radiobox widget is called\n       with the set_choice command immediately after the create command, to\n       define the fixed list of selection options.\n       proc tepam::ad_form(rcl) {W Command {Par \"\"}} {\n\t  set Res [ad_form(radiobox) $W $Command $Par]\n\t  if {$Command==\"create\"} {\n\t     ad_form(radiobox) $W set_choice {left center right}\n\t  }\n\t  return $Res\n       }\n       Please consult the TEPAM package source file to find additional and\n       more complex examples of entry widget procedures.\n\nVARIABLES\n       The argument_dialogbox is using two variables inside the ::tepam\n       namespace:\n\n       argument_dialogbox\n\t      Application specific entry widget procedures can use this array\n\t      variable to store their own data, using as index the widget path\n\t      provided to the procedure, e.g.\n\t      argument_dialogbox($W,<sub_index>).\n\n       last_parameters\n\t      This array variable is only used by an argument dialog box when\n\t      its context has been specified via the -context attribute. The\n\t      argument dialog box' position and size as well as its entered\n\t      data are stored inside this variable when the data are\n\t      acknowledged and the form is closed. This allows the form to\n\t      restore its previous state once it is called another time.\n\n\t      To reuse the saved parameters not just in the actual application\n\t      session but also in another one, it is sufficient to store the\n\t      last_parameter variable array in a configuration file which is\n\t      loaded the next time an application is launched.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       tepam_introduction(n), tepam_procedure(n)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       entry mask, parameter entry form\n\nCATEGORY\n       Argument entry form, mega widget\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2009/2010, Andreas Drollinger"
