See TCC AUTHORIZATION below.  To avoid feedback loops\n     when filtering output using shell pipelines, eslogger automatically\n     suppresses events for all processes that are part of its process group.\n\n     eslogger is not intended to be used by applications.  It is not meant\n     provide the same functionality, performance and schema stability as\n     natively interfacing with the Endpoint Security API does.\tIt cannot\n     provide the integrity protection granted to System Extensions.\n     Applications should continue to interface with EndpointSecurity(7)\n     natively."

Default, and the only\n\t\t\t\t  format currently supported, is json.\tSee\n\t\t\t\t  FORMATS below.\n\n     --list-events\t\t  List supported events on standard output and\n\t\t\t\t  exit.\n\n     --oslog\t\t\t  Emit event data to the unified logging\n\t\t\t\t  system instead of to standard output.  See\n\t\t\t\t  log(1) on configuring and using the unified\n\t\t\t\t  logging system.

Changing the subsystem will make\n\t\t\t\t  the default log profile ineffective,\n\t\t\t\t  resulting in a message size limit of 1k.\n\t\t\t\t  Configuring category for oversize messages\n\t\t\t\t  is recommended when using --oslog-category.\n\t\t\t\t  eslogger uses the main category for\n\t\t\t\t  operational logging, such as fatal errors.\n\nEVENTS\n     Events are specified by their short name, such as exec or exit.  Use\n     --list-events to list the currently supported events by their short name.\n     eslogger supports all notify events that EndpointSecurity supports.  By\n     design, eslogger does not support any auth events.\n\n     Some fields available in native Endpoint Security API clients are not\n     available in eslogger.  Currently, the only such field is es_token_t\n     state part of es_thread_state_t, which is used only in\n     remote_thread_create events.\n\nFORMATS\n     The only supported format for event data is json, which is either JSON\n     Lines, when writing to standard output, or JSON, when writing to the\n     unified logging system.  While no formal schema is provided, the data is\n     modelled after es_message_t as provided by EndpointSecurity(7).\n     Semantics, field names and optionality corresponds to the C counterparts\n     as documented in the libEndpointSecurity(3) header documentation in the\n     SDK.  A schema_version is provided with every event.  No schema stability\n     guarantees are being made across schema_version changes.  New events may\n     be added without bumping schema_version.  schema_version is specific to\n     the JSON representation of events.  schema_version is distinct from the\n     version field, which denotes the message version as emitted by\n     EndpointSecurity(7)."
