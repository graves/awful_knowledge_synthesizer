Later it has been then modified to\n     work at the ip and bridging level, integrated with the IPFW packet\n     filter, and extended to support multiple queueing and scheduling\n     policies."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the dummynet tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How can dnctl be used to set a bandwidth limit of 10 Mbps on the eth0 interface?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use with dnctl to introduce a 500ms delay on traffic passing through the lo0 interface?
