The result may be padded with the\n\t      character = to signal a partial encoding at the end of the input\n\t      string.\n\n       ::base32::decode estring\n\t      This commands takes the estring and decodes it under the\n\t      assumption that it is a valid base32 encoded string. The result\n\t      of the decoding is returned as the result of the command.\n\n\t      Note that while the encoder will generate only uppercase\n\t      characters this decoder accepts input in lowercase as well.\n\n\t      The command will always throw an error whenever encountering\n\t      conditions which signal some type of bogus input, namely if\n\n\t      [1]    the input contains characters which are not valid output\n\t\t     of a base32 encoder,\n\n\t      [2]    the length of the input is not a multiple of eight,\n\n\t      [3]    padding appears not at the end of input, but in the\n\t\t     middle,\n\n\t      [4]    the padding has not of length six, four, three, or one\n\t\t     characters,\n\nCODE MAP\n       The code map used to convert 5-bit sequences is shown below, with the\n       numeric id of the bit sequences to the left and the character used to\n       encode it to the right. It should be noted that the characters \"0\" and\n       \"1\" are not used by the encoding. This is done as these characters can\n       be easily confused with \"O\", \"o\" and \"l\" (L).\n\n\t    0 A    9 J\t 18 S\t27 3\n\t    1 B   10 K\t 19 T\t28 4\n\t    2 C   11 L\t 20 U\t29 5\n\t    3 D   12 M\t 21 V\t30 6\n\t    4 E   13 N\t 22 W\t31 7\n\t    5 F   14 O\t 23 X\n\t    6 G   15 P\t 24 Y\n\t    7 H   16 Q\t 25 Z\n\t    8 I   17 R\t 26 2"
