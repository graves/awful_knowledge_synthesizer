By default only the user\n     quotas are printed.\n\n     Options:\n\n     -g      Print group quotas for the group of which the user is a member.\n\t     The optional -u flag is equivalent to the default.\n\n     -v      quota will display quotas on filesystems where no storage is\n\t     allocated.\n\n     -q      Print a more terse message, containing only information on\n\t     filesystems where usage is over quota.\n\n     Specifying both -g and -u displays both the user quotas and the group\n     quotas (for the user).\n\n     Only the super-user may use the -u flag and the optional user argument to\n     view the limits of other users.  Non-super-users can use the -g flag and\n     optional group argument to view only the limits of groups of which they\n     are members."
