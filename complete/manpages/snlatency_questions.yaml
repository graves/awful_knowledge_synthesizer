The file system to\n       measure is selected via the pathname parameter.\n\n       snlatency uses a special RPC to the MDC in a loop to measure the time\n       to send the message, the time for the FSM process to service the\n       request, and the time to send the response back up to the system call\n       level.  The average of repeat calls is averaged and the latencies\n       printed out in micro seconds.\n\n       If the MDC is not local, then the NTP clock algorithm is used to adjust\n       for the difference between the two host's clocks before calculating the\n       results, it is not used when the MDC the same host.  The reason for\n       this is that the NTP algorithm assumes the latency in both directions\n       is the same and in effect averages them out.  Comparing the latencies\n       seen between the client local to the MDC and remote clients will show\n       how much of the latency is caused by network infrastructure."
