This\n\t\tfunction is safe to call during an interrupt context."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the fuiword function in the context of system programming on macOS?
  manpageQuestion2: How can the fuiword function be used to retrieve a 16-bit unsigned integer from user-space memory at address 0x12345678?
  manpageQuestion3: In what scenarios would the fuiword function be preferred over fubyte for accessing user-space data?
