It takes an HTML\n\t      string, parses it and invokes a command prefix for every tag\n\t      encountered. It is not necessary for the HTML to be valid for\n\t      this parser to function. It is the responsibility of the command\n\t      invoked for every tag to check this. Another responsibility of\n\t      the invoked command is the handling of tag attributes and\n\t      character entities (escaped characters). The parser provides the\n\t      un-interpreted tag attributes to the invoked command to aid in\n\t      the former, and the package at large provides a helper command,\n\t      ::htmlparse::mapEscapes, to aid in the handling of the latter.\n\t      The parser does ignore leading DOCTYPE declarations and all\n\t      valid HTML comments it encounters.\n\n\t      All information beyond the HTML string itself is specified via\n\t      options, these are explained below.\n\n\t      To help understand the options, some more background information\n\t      about the parser.\n\n\t      It is capable of detecting incomplete tags in the HTML string\n\t      given to it. Under normal circumstances this will cause the\n\t      parser to throw an error, but if the option -incvar is used to\n\t      specify a global (or namespace) variable, the parser will store\n\t      the incomplete part of the input into this variable instead.\n\t      This will aid greatly in the handling of incrementally arriving\n\t      HTML, as the parser will handle whatever it can and defer the\n\t      handling of the incomplete part until more data has arrived.\n\n\t      Another feature of the parser are its two possible modes of\n\t      operation. The normal mode is activated if the option -queue is\n\t      not present on the command line invoking the parser. If it is\n\t      present, the parser will go into the incremental mode instead.\n\n\t      The main difference is that a parser in normal mode will\n\t      immediately invoke the command prefix for each tag it\n\t      encounters. In incremental mode however the parser will generate\n\t      a number of scripts which invoke the command prefix for groups\n\t      of tags in the HTML string and then store these scripts in the\n\t      specified queue. It is then the responsibility of the caller of\n\t      the parser to ensure the execution of the scripts in the queue.\n\n\t      Note: The queue object given to the parser has to provide the\n\t      same interface as the queue defined in tcllib -> struct. This\n\t      means, for example, that all queues created via that tcllib\n\t      module can be immediately used here. Still, the queue doesn't\n\t      have to come from tcllib -> struct as long as the same interface\n\t      is provided.\n\n\t      In both modes the parser will return an empty string to the\n\t      caller.\n\n\t      The -split option may be given to a parser in incremental mode\n\t      to specify the size of the groups it creates. In other words,\n\t      -split 5 means that each of the generated scripts will invoke\n\t      the command prefix for 5 consecutive tags in the HTML string. A\n\t      parser in normal mode will ignore this option and its value.\n\n\t      The option -vroot specifies a virtual root tag. A parser in\n\t      normal mode will invoke the command prefix for it immediately\n\t      before and after it processes the tags in the HTML, thus\n\t      simulating that the HTML string is enclosed in a <vroot>\n\t      </vroot> combination. In incremental mode however the parser is\n\t      unable to provide the closing virtual root as it never knows\n\t      when the input is complete. In this case the first script\n\t      generated by each invocation of the parser will contain an\n\t      invocation of the command prefix for the virtual root as its\n\t      first command.  The following options are available:\n\n\t      -cmd cmd\n\t\t     The command prefix to invoke for every tag in the HTML\n\t\t     string. Defaults to ::htmlparse::debugCallback.\n\n\t      -vroot tag\n\t\t     The virtual root tag to add around the HTML in normal\n\t\t     mode. In incremental mode it is the first tag in each\n\t\t     chunk processed by the parser, but there will be no\n\t\t     closing tags. Defaults to hmstart.\n\n\t      -split n\n\t\t     The size of the groups produced by an incremental mode\n\t\t     parser. Ignored when in normal mode. Defaults to 10.\n\t\t     Values <= 0 are not allowed.\n\n\t      -incvar var\n\t\t     The name of the variable where to store any incomplete\n\t\t     HTML into. This makes most sense for the incremental\n\t\t     mode. The parser will throw an error if it sees\n\t\t     incomplete HTML and has no place to store it to. This\n\t\t     makes sense for the normal mode. Only incomplete tags are\n\t\t     detected, not missing tags.  Optional, defaults to 'no\n\t\t     variable'."

See\n\t\t     ::htmlparse::debugCallback for a description.\n\n\t\t     In incremental mode, however, the generated scripts will\n\t\t     invoke the command prefix with five arguments appended.\n\t\t     The last four of these are the same which were mentioned\n\t\t     above. The first is a placeholder string (@win@) for a\n\t\t     clientdata value to be supplied later during the actual\n\t\t     execution of the generated scripts. This could be a tk\n\t\t     window path, for example. This allows the user of this\n\t\t     package to preprocess HTML strings without committing\n\t\t     them to a specific window, object, whatever during\n\t\t     parsing. This connection can be made later. This also\n\t\t     means that it is possible to cache preprocessed HTML. Of\n\t\t     course, nothing prevents the user of the parser from\n\t\t     replacing the placeholder with an empty string.\n\n       ::htmlparse::debugCallback ?clientdata? tag slash param\n       textBehindTheTag\n\t      This command is the standard callback used by the parser in\n\t      ::htmlparse::parse if none was specified by the user. It simply\n\t      dumps its arguments to stdout.  This callback can be used for\n\t      both normal and incremental mode of the calling parser. In other\n\t      words, it accepts four or five arguments. The last four\n\t      arguments are described below. The optional fifth argument\n\t      contains the clientdata value passed to the callback by a parser\n\t      in incremental mode. All callbacks have to follow the signature\n\t      of this command in the last four arguments, and callbacks used\n\t      in incremental parsing have to follow this signature in the last\n\t      five arguments."
