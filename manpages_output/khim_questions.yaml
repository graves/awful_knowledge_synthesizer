It\n       works by designating some seldom-used key of the keyboard as a\n       \"Compose\" key (this key is distinct from any key so labeled, and is\n       often \"Pause,\" \"F12\" or \"L2\"), and having the \"Compose\" key, followed\n       by a two-key sequence, have the effect of inserting some character in a\n       widget.\tIn addition, the \"Compose\" key, when struck twice in\n       succession, brings up a dialog containing a Unicode character map,\n       allowing arbitrary characters to be inserted.\n\n       The vast bulk of the package's functionality is implemented in a single\n       bindtag, KHIM.  An application can request that any text or entry\n       widget use the package to allow for entry of arbitrary characters by\n       placing this binding tag ahead of the Text or Entry binding tag for the\n       widget:\n\n       text .t -width 80 -height 24\n       bindtags .t {.t KHIM Text . all}\n\n\n       Note that the KHIM tag must precede the Text or Entry class binding, or\n       the package will not function correctly.\n\n\n\nPROCEDURES\n       In addition to commands supporting the KHIM binding tag, the following\n       commands are exported from the package:"
