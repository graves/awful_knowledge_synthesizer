Also, less does not\n       have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input\n       files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).\tLess uses\n       termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of\n       terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On\n       a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the\n       screen are prefixed with a caret.)"

Otherwise, less looks in a standard\n       place for the lesskey file: On Unix systems, less looks for a lesskey\n       file called \"$HOME/.less\".  On MS-DOS and Windows systems, less looks\n       for a lesskey file called \"$HOME/_less\", and if it is not found there,\n       then looks for a lesskey file called \"_less\" in any directory specified\n       in the PATH environment variable.

    Manpage text:

    The -e option works differently.  If the -e option is not set, less
           behaves as if the -e option were set.  If the -e option is set, less
           behaves as if the -E option were set.

           The -m option works differently.  If the -m option is not set, the
           medium prompt is used, and it is prefixed with the string "--More--".
           If the -m option is set, the short prompt is used.

           The -n option acts like the -z option.  The normal behavior of the -n
           option is unavailable in this mode.

           The parameter to the -p option is taken to be a less command rather
           than a search pattern.

           The LESS environment variable is ignored, and the MORE environment
           variable is used in its place.

    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
           Environment variables may be specified either in the system environment
           as usual, or in a lesskey(1) file.  If environment variables are
           defined in more than one place, variables defined in a local lesskey
           file take precedence over variables defined in the system environment,
           which take precedence over variables defined in the system-wide lesskey
           file.
