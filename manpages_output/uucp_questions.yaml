Each file argument is\n       either a pathname on the local machine or is of the form\n\n\t      system!path\n\n       which is interpreted as being on a remote system.  In the first form,\n       the contents of the first file are copied to the second.  In the second\n       form, each source file is copied into the destination directory.\n\n       A file be transferred to or from system2 via system1 by using\n\n\t      system1!system2!path.\n\n       Any pathname that does not begin with / or ~ will be appended to the\n       current directory (unless the -W or --noexpand option is used); this\n       resulting path will not necessarily exist on a remote system.  A\n       pathname beginning with a simple ~ starts at the UUCP public directory;\n       a pathname beginning with ~name starts at the home directory of the\n       named user.  The ~ is interpreted on the appropriate system.  Note that\n       some shells will interpret a simple ~ to the local home directory\n       before uucp sees it; to avoid this the ~ must be quoted."
