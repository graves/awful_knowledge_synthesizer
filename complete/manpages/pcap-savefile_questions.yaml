    Manpage text:

    All fields in the per-file header are in the byte order of the host
           writing the file.  Normally, the first field in the per-file header is
           a 4-byte magic number, with the value 0xa1b2c3d4.  The magic number,
           when read by a host with the same byte order as the host that wrote the
           file, will have the value 0xa1b2c3d4, and, when read by a host with the
           opposite byte order as the host that wrote the file, will have the
           value 0xd4c3b2a1.  That allows software reading the file to determine
           whether the byte order of the host that wrote the file is the same as
           the byte order of the host on which the file is being read, and thus
           whether the values in the per-file and per-packet headers need to be
           byte-swapped.

           If the magic number has the value 0xa1b23c4d (with the two nibbles of
           the two lower-order bytes of the magic number swapped), which would be
           read as 0xa1b23c4d by a host with the same byte order as the host that
           wrote the file and as 0x4d3cb2a1 by a host with the opposite byte order
           as the host that wrote the file, the file format is the same as for
           regular files, except that the time stamps for packets are given in
           seconds and nanoseconds rather than seconds and microseconds.
