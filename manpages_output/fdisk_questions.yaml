Sector 0 of a bootable hard disk must contain boot code, an\n     MBR partition table, and a magic number (0xAA55).\tThese MBR partitions\n     (also known as BIOS partitions) can be used to break the disk up into\n     several pieces.\n\n     The BIOS loads sector 0 of the boot disk into memory, verifies the magic\n     number, and begins executing the code at the first byte.  The normal DOS\n     MBR boot code searches the MBR partition table for an “active” partition\n     (indicated by a ‘*’ in the first column), and if one is found, the boot\n     block from that partition is loaded and executed in place of the original\n     (MBR) boot block.\n\n     The options are as follows:"
