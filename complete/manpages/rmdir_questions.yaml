In order to remove both a\n     parent directory and a subdirectory of that parent, the subdirectory must\n     be specified first so the parent directory is empty when rmdir tries to\n     remove it.\n\n     The following option is available:\n\n     -p      Each directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all\n\t     components will be removed, if they are empty, starting with the\n\t     last most component.  (See rm(1) for fully non-discriminant\n\t     recursive removal.)\n\n     -v      Be verbose, listing each directory as it is removed.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The rmdir utility exits with one of the following values:\n\n     0\t     Each directory entry specified by a directory operand referred to\n\t     an empty directory and was removed successfully."
