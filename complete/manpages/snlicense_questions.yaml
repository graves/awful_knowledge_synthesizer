The currently supported license types can be displayed by\n       typing snlicense -h.\n\n       The optional nocap argument is for internal use only to prevent a hang\n       when certain components are not fully initialized.\n\n\nOPTIONS\n       -f license-file\n\t      Will use an alternative license file.  The default license file\n\t      is /Library/Preferences/Xsan/license.dat.\n\n       -h     Display help\n\n       -i file\n\t      Import licenses from the specified file\n\n       -m     Will cause the output to be printed in a machine readable format\n\n       -n     No RAS messages for license warnings and errors\n\n       -p     Shows whether a product key is needed and if so, whether it\n\t      exists and is valid\n\n       -P cvfsid\n\t      Validates the product key for both MDCs of an HA pair\n\n       -s system-id\n\t      Check the license entry for the specified system-identifier\n\n       -r json|ascii\n\t      Report on license service usage.\n\n       -v     Will cause more license info to be reported\n\n\nUSAGE\n       Use this command with the -i option to import licenses from the command\n       line or without the -i option to check the current status of a\n       particular license.  To check the status, execute the program with the\n       desired license type. See examples below for more info.\n\n\nIMPORTING LICENSES\n       The -i file_to_import option can be used to import licenses from the\n       downloaded license file into the local license file.\n\n       NOTE:  The licenses are only imported to the local computer.  For High\n       Availability (HA) systems, the license file must be imported on both\n       computers.\n\n\nLICENSE EXPIRATION\n       Some licenses are cross-checked for expiration such that if one license\n       expires, all cross-checked licenses are considered expired.\n\n       The -v option can be used to determine the expiration date of the\n       feature and the expiration date of the feature with cross-checking.\n\n\n       • The \"Actual expiration\" is when the feature itself expires.\n\n       • \"License expiration\" is when the feature will become unusable due to\n\t one or more cross-checked licenses expiring.\n\n\n       Note: In some cases it is invalid to mix expiring licenses with non-\n       expiring licenses.  One notable exception is the maintenance license\n       (which typically has an expiration).\n\n       The -v option will display a warning if there is mixed-expiration error\n       on the specified license.\n\n\nLICENSE SERVICE REPORT\n       The -r option reports on the license service usage.  The license\n       service is only used with 'san_client' and 'file_system' licenses.\n\n\nEXAMPLES FOR CHECKING LICENSE STATUS\n       When the command is run, the license info for the indicated Xsan\n       feature is reported. Note that if license status cannot be determined\n       for a feature it is treated as NOT licensed. Also note some features\n       have an associated capacity and some do not.\n\n\n       Examples:\n\n       Properly licensed with capacity available:\n\n\t    % snlicense proxy\n\t    - The proxy license status is: Good\n\n\t    % snlicense -v proxy\n\t    - Found existing license: proxy\n\t    - License expiration:     None\n\t    - Actual expiration:      None\n\t    - Licensed capacity:      65535 connections\n\t    - Current used capacity:  NA\n\t    - The proxy license status is: Good\n\n\n       Properly licensed (non-capacity license):\n\n\t    % snlicense maintenance\n\t    - The maintenance license status is: Good\n\n\t    % snlicense -v maintenance\n\t    - Found existing license: maintenance\n\t    - License expiration:     None\n\t    - Actual expiration:      None\n\t    - The maintenance license status is: Good\n\n\n       Unlicensed feature:\n\n\t    % snlicense failover\n\t    - The failover license status is: License Missing\n\n\t    % snlicense -v failover\n\t    - The failover license status is: License Missing\n\n\n       A valid temporary license:\n\n\t    % snlicense -v failover\n\t    - Found existing license: failover\n\t    - License expiration:     Thu Nov  1 23:59:59 2012\n\t    - Actual expiration:      Thu Nov  1 23:59:59 2012\n\t    - The failover license status is: Good\n\n\n       Expired license:\n\n\t    % snlicense failover\n\t    - The failover license status is: Expired\n\n\t    % snlicense -v failover\n\t    - Found existing license: failover\n\t    - License expiration:     Thu Jan  1 23:59:59 2009\n\t    - Actual expiration:      Thu Jan  1 23:59:59 2009\n\t    - The failover license status is: Expired\n\n       Mixed permanent and expiring licenses:\n\n\t    % snlicense server\n\t    - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed\n\t      (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).\n\n\t    % snlicense -v server\n\t    - Found existing license: server\n\t    - License expiration:     Jan  1 23:59:59 2009\n\t    - Actual expiration:      None\n\t    - Licensed capacity:      10 connections\n\t    - Current used capacity:  NA\n\t    - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed\n\t      (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).\n\n\t    % snlicense failover\n\t    - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed\n\t      (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).\n\n\t    % snlicense -v failover\n\t    - Found existing license: failover\n\t    - License expiration:     Jan  1 23:59:59 2009\n\t    - Actual expiration:      Jan  1 23:59:59 2009\n\t    - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed\n\t      (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).\n\n\nEXIT VALUES\n       snlicense will return one of the following upon exit.\n\n\t  0 - No error, feature licensed and usable\n\t  1 - Feature not licensed but not in use\n\t  2 - Current feature capacity undetermined but feature not in use\n\t  3 - Feature has no license string in the license file\n\t  4 - Feature has a license but the expiration date has been reached\n\t  5 - Feature has a license but the capacity has been reached\n\t  6 - Feature has a license but the current capacity could not be determined\n\t  7 - Feature license status could not be determined\n\t  8 - Invalid mixture of temporary and permanent licenses detected\n\nLIMITATIONS\n       Only the Linux platform is supported with snlicense commands.\n\n       For Windows license information, follow the instructions in \"License\n       Dialog (cvntlicense.exe)\"."
