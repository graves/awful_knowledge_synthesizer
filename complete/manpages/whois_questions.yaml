The IANA whois\n     server knows about IP address and AS numbers as well as domain names.\n\n     There are a few special cases where referrals do not work, so whois goes\n     directly to the appropriate server.  These include point-of-contact\n     handles for ARIN, nic.at, NORID, and RIPE, and domain names under ac.uk.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -a      Use the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) database.\n\t     It contains network numbers used in those parts of the world\n\t     covered neither by APNIC, AfriNIC, LACNIC, nor by RIPE.  The\n\t     query syntax is documented at\n\t     https://www.arin.net/resources/whoisrws/whois_api.html#nicname"
