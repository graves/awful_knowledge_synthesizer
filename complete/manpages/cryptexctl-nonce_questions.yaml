In the\n     current implementation, all cryptexes are personalized with a single\n     nonce which is rolled when the host performs a software update. In the\n     future, each cryptex will have an individual nonce.\n\n     This nonce can be used with cryptexctl-create(1) to personalize a cryptex\n     for a device when the device is not present.\n\nOPTIONS\n     A list of options with descriptions:\n\n     [-r | --roll]\n\t     Roll the cryptex's personalization nonce. This will invalidate\n\t     the existing personalization for the cryptex such it will not be\n\t     accepted at the next validation (usually at the next boot). This\n\t     is not a live revocation and does not affect the state of the\n\t     already-active cryptex. Once rolled, a new nonce is generated at\n\t     the next boot, and thus the cryptex nonce will not be queryable\n\t     until then."
