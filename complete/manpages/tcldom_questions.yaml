DOM provides a view\n       of a XML (or HTML) document as a tree structure.  Currently, TclDOM\n       only supports XML documents.\n\n\n       The package implements most of the DOM Level 1 interfaces and also some\n       Level 2 and Level 3 interfaces.\tThere are also a number of non-\n       standard commands and methods provided for the convenience of\n       application developers (these are documented).\n\n\n       The DOM specification should be read in conjunction with this reference\n       manual, as it explains the meaning and purpose of the various\n       interfaces.  This manual is not a tutorial on how to use the DOM.\n\n\n       TclDOM also provides several implementations of the API, with a layered\n       architecture.  A generic layer provides a stable API to the\n       application, and specific implementations may register themselves.\n       Currently, three implementations exists: a pure-Tcl implementation, a C\n       implementation (based on TclDOMPro) and another C implementation based\n       on the Gnome libxml2 & gdome2 libraries.\n\n\nPACKAGES AND NAMESPACES\n       The TclDOM generic layer defines the  package and also a Tcl namespace\n       using that name.  The generic layer also uses the package name .\n\n\n       Implementations define their own package name and Tcl namespace within\n       the generic layer:\n\n\n\t      Tcl implementation\n\n\t      Package , Tcl namespace ::dom::tcl.\n\n\n\t      TclDOMPro\n\n\t      Package , Tcl namespace ::dom::c.\n\n\n\t      libxml2\n\n\t      Package , Tcl namespace ::dom::libxml2.\n\n\n\nTOKENS\n       The TclDOM API uses  as identifiers for nodes within the document tree.\n       This technique has been used to allow alternate implementations of\n       TclDOM to be efficient, while retaining compatibility with the pure-Tcl\n       implementation.\n\n\n       The format of the token itself as well as the data structure referred\n       to by the token are  public and an application should not rely on\n       these.  Instead, an application should use the accessor methods\n       provided by the API.\n\n\nDOM INTERFACES\n       Each  in the DOM specification is implemented with a Tcl command in the\n       dom namespace.  A few interfaces have not been mapped to Tcl commands\n       because Tcl already provides the required functionality, for example\n       the  interface.\n\n\n       s for interfaces are methods (subcommands) of the corresponding Tcl\n       command.\n\n\n       Each  of an interface is a configuration option for an object in the\n       document tree.\n\n\nCONVENIENCE COMMANDS AND METHODS\n       DOM doesn't always provide an interface, method or attribute for every\n       function required.  For example, until DOM Level 3 for was no standard\n       for creating, parsing and serializing a document.  Sometimes using the\n       standard DOM interface is awkward.  TclDOM provides a number of non-\n       standard features to overcome these problems.\n\n\n       A major convenience is that each method of the  interface is also\n       defined as a command.  For example, rather than using\n       dom::DOMImplementation create to create a new document, the shorter\n       command dom::create may be used.\n\n\n       Implementations may also provide direct access to specific features.\n       Refer to the documentation for a DOM implementation.\n\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::dom::DOMImplementation\n\n\n       The ::dom::DOMImplementation command implements the  DOM interface.  It\n       is used to provide implementation-specific features not explicitly\n       defined in the DOM specification.\n\n\n\t      Command Options\n\n\n\t      The following command options may be used.  These are also\n\t      available as commands.\n\n\n\t\t     hasFeature  hasFeature feature\n\n\t\t     Provides a test for existence of a feature.  Returns  if\n\t\t     a feature is implemented,\totherwise.  Uses the default\n\t\t     DOM implementation.\n\n\n\t\t     create  create type\n\n\t\t     Creates the root node of a new DOM document, using the\n\t\t     default DOM implementation.  The document element type\n\t\t     may be specified as an argument, in which case that\n\t\t     element is created.  The return value is a token\n\t\t     referring to the root node of the newly created document.\n\n\n\t\t     createDocument  createDocument nsURI type doctype\n\n\t\t     Creates the root node of a new DOM document, using the\n\t\t     default DOM implementation.  The document element\n\t\t     namespace URI and local-name (element type) may be\n\t\t     specified as an argument, in which case that element is\n\t\t     created.  If the document type is given then the newly\n\t\t     created document is configured to use that document type.\n\t\t     The return value is a token referring to the root node of\n\t\t     the newly created document.\n\n\n\t\t     createDocumentType  createDocumentType token name\n\t\t     publicid systemid internaldtd\n\n\t\t     Creates a Document Type Declaration, using the default\n\t\t     DOM implementation.  The return value is a token for the\n\t\t     newly created document type declaration.\n\n\n\t\t     createNode  createNode token xpath\n\n\t\t     May create a node in the document.   token specifies a\n\t\t     context for the XPath expression given by\txpath.\tThe\n\t\t     expression must resolve to a node.  If the node exists\n\t\t     then no further action is taken.  Otherwise the node is\n\t\t     created.  The token of the matched or newly created node\n\t\t     is returned.\n\n\n\t\t     destroy  destroy token\n\n\t\t     This method frees all data structures associated with a\n\t\t     DOM node.\tThe  token argument must refer to a valid\n\t\t     token for any node in the document tree.  The node is\n\t\t     removed from the tree before it is destroyed.  If the\n\t\t     node has children, they will also be destroyed.\n\n\n\t\t     isNode  isNode token\n\n\t\t     Tests whether the given token is a valid token for some\n\t\t     DOM node in the default DOM implementation.\n\n\n\t\t     parse  parse xml ? option value?\n\n\t\t     This method parses XML formatted text given by the  xml\n\t\t     argument and constructs a DOM tree for the document.  The\n\t\t     return result is the token of the root node of the newly\n\t\t     created document.\n\n\n\t\t     This method requires an event-based XML parser to be\n\t\t     loaded to perform the parsing operation.  The  package\n\t\t     itself does not include an XML parser.  Support for the\n\t\t     use of  is provided.  Any other Tcl event-based XML\n\t\t     parser implementing the TclXML API may also be used.  The\n\t\t     -parser may be used to specify which XML parser to use.\n\n\n\t\t     In some circumstances, a DOM implementation may parse the\n\t\t     XML document directly, for example libxml2.  In this\n\t\t     case, it may not be possible to interpose on the parsing\n\t\t     operation.\n\n\n\t\t     Valid configuration options are:\n\n\n\t\t\t     -parser  ? {} expat tcl?\n\n\t\t\t    This option specifies which XML parser to use to\n\t\t\t    parse the XML data.  If an empty string is given\n\t\t\t    then the default behaviour described above is\n\t\t\t    used.  The value  expat specifies that the Expat\n\t\t\t    parser must be used.  The value  tcl specifies\n\t\t\t    that the Tcl-only parser must be used.  If an\n\t\t\t    explicit value is given and that parser cannot be\n\t\t\t    loaded then the command will fail, despite the\n\t\t\t    fact that another parser may be available.\n\n\n\t\t\t     -progresscommand script\n\n\t\t\t    This option specifies a Tcl command to be invoked\n\t\t\t    from time to time while the DOM tree is being\n\t\t\t    constructed.  The script will be invoked after a\n\t\t\t    certain number of element start tags have been\n\t\t\t    processed, given by the  -chunksize option.\n\n\n\t\t\t     -chunksize integer\n\n\t\t\t    This option specifies how many element start tags\n\t\t\t    to process before invoking the script given by the\n\t\t\t    -progresscommand option.\n\n\n\n\t\t     selectNode  selectNode token xpath ? option value ... ?\n\n\t\t     Resolves the XPath location path given by\txpath.\t token\n\t\t     is the initial context for the location path.  Returns\n\t\t     the resulting nodeset as a Tcl list.\n\n\n\t\t     The following options may be specified:\n\n\n\t\t\t     -namespaces\n\n\t\t\t    The value for this option is a list of prefix-URI\n\t\t\t    pairs.  Each of these pairs defines an XML\n\t\t\t    Namespace and its prefix for the purposes of\n\t\t\t    evaluating the XPath expression.  The document\n\t\t\t    itself may use a different prefix for the same XML\n\t\t\t    Namespace.\n\n\n\t\t\t    This option may be repeated, in which case the\n\t\t\t    lists of namespace pairs are merged and all of the\n\t\t\t    XML Namespaces registered.\n\n\n\n\t\t     serialize\tserialize token ? option value?\n\n\t\t     This method returns the XML formatted text corresponding\n\t\t     to the node given by  token.  The text is guaranteed to\n\t\t     be a well-formed XML document, unless the\t-method option\n\t\t     specifies a non-XML output method.\n\n\n\t\t     Valid configuration options are:\n\n\n\t\t\t     -newline elementlist\n\n\t\t\t    This option specifies a list of element types for\n\t\t\t    which newline characters will be added before and\n\t\t\t    after the start and end tags for those elements\n\t\t\t    upon serialization.\n\n\n\t\t\t    White space is significant in XML, so the  package\n\t\t\t    never adds extra white spacefor purposes of\n\t\t\t    \"pretty-printing\" the XML source document.\tOn\n\t\t\t    some platforms, such as VMS, this can actually\n\t\t\t    cause serious problems due to line length\n\t\t\t    limitations.  This option provides the convenience\n\t\t\t    of adding newlines to certain nominated element\n\t\t\t    types for formatting the source into lines.\n\n\n\t\t\t    Examples:\n\n\n\t\t\t    Suppose the following DOM document is constructed:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   set doc [::dom::DOMImplementation create]\n\t\t\t\t   set top [::dom::document createElement $doc Root]\n\t\t\t\t   set node [::dom::document createElement $top First]\n\t\t\t\t   ::dom::document createElement $node Second\n\t\t\t\t   ::dom::document createElement $top First\n\n\n\n\t\t\t    Without the  -newline option the serialized\n\t\t\t    document would be:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   ::dom::DOMImplementation serialize $doc\n\n\n\n\t\t\t    With the  -newline option the serialized document\n\t\t\t    would be:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   ::dom::DOMImplementation serialize $doc -newline First"
