           whose names are matched by the pattern given in the parentheses.  For
           example, `(g*)m*=43' highlights all matches beginning with `m' in
           groups whose names  begin with `g' using the color code `43'.  In case
           of the `lc', `rc', and `ec' codes, the group pattern is ignored.

           Note also that all patterns are tried in the order in which they appear
           in the parameter value until the first one matches which is then used.
           Patterns may be matched against completions, descriptions (possibly

           followed by a description.  For consistent coloring it may be necessary
           to use more than one pattern or a pattern with backreferences.

           When printing a match, the code prints the value of lc, the value for
           the file-type or the last matching specification with a `*', the value
           of rc, the string to display for the match itself, and then the value

To use more than the 8\n\t      named colors (red, green, etc.) construct the fg_col/bg_col\n\t      pairs where fg_col and bg_col are decimal integers, e.g 128/200.\n\t      The maximum color value is 254 if the terminal supports 256\n\t      colors.\n\n\t      bg overrides the color and other attributes of all characters in\n\t      the window.  Its usual use is to set the background initially,\n\t      but it will overwrite the attributes of any characters at the\n\t      time when it is called.  In addition to the arguments allowed\n\t      with attr, an argument @char specifies a character to be shown\n\t      in otherwise blank areas of the window.  Owing to limitations of\n\t      curses this cannot be a multibyte character (use of ASCII\n\t      characters only is recommended).\tAs the specified set of\n\t      attributes override the existing background, turning attributes\n\t      off in the arguments is not useful, though this does not cause\n\t      an error."

    Limitations
           Although reading and writing of the file in question is efficiently
           handled, zsh's internal memory management may be arbitrarily baroque;
           however, mapfile is usually very much more efficient than anything
           involving a loop.  Note in particular that the whole contents of the
           file will always reside physically in memory when accessed (possibly
           multiple times, due to standard parameter substitution operations).  In
           particular, this means handling of sufficiently long files (greater
           than the machine's swap space, or than the range of the pointer type)
           will be incorrect.

           No errors are printed or flagged for non-existent, unreadable, or
           unwritable files, as the parameter mechanism is too low in the shell
           execution hierarchy to make this convenient.

           It is unfortunate that the mechanism for loading modules does not yet

    Manpage text:

    Aside from the default colour, the ANSI standard for terminal escape
           codes provides for eight colours. The bright attribute brings this to
           sixteen. These basic colours are commonly used in terminal applications
           due to being widely supported. Expanded 88 and 256 colour palettes are
           also common and, while the first sixteen colours vary somewhat between
           terminals and configurations, these add a generally consistent and
           predictable set of colours.

           In order to use the zsh/nearcolor module, it only needs to be loaded.
           Thereafter, whenever a colour is specified using a hex triplet, it will
           be compared against each of the available colours and the closest will
           be selected. The first sixteen colours are never matched in this
           process due to being unpredictable.

           It isn't possible to reliably detect support for true colour in the
           terminal emulator. It is therefore recommended to be selective in
           loading the zsh/nearcolor module. For example, the following checks the

    THE ZSH/NEWUSER MODULE
           The zsh/newuser module is loaded at boot if it is available, the RCS
           option is set, and the PRIVILEGED option is not set (all three are true
           by default).  This takes place immediately after commands in the global
           zshenv file (typically /etc/zshenv), if any, have been executed.  If
           the module is not available it is silently ignored by the shell; the
           module may safely be removed from $MODULE_PATH by the administrator if
           it is not required.

           On loading, the module tests if any of the start-up files .zshenv,
           .zprofile, .zshrc or .zlogin exist in the directory given by the
           environment variable ZDOTDIR, or the user's home directory if that is

           shell than zsh).

           If the file newuser is found, it is then sourced in the same manner as
           a start-up file.  The file is expected to contain code to install
           start-up files for the user, however any valid shell code will be
           executed.

           The zsh/newuser module is then unconditionally unloaded.

           Note that it is possible to achieve exactly the same effect as the
           zsh/newuser module by adding code to /etc/zshenv.  The module exists
           simply to allow the shell to make arrangements for new users without
           the need for intervention by package maintainers and system
           administrators.

Option -m will compile a\n\t      multi-line pattern; that is, ^ and $ will match newlines within\n\t      the pattern.  Option -x will compile an extended pattern,\n\t      wherein whitespace and # comments are ignored.  Option -s makes\n\t      the dot metacharacter match all characters, including those that\n\t      indicate newline.\n\n       pcre_study\n\t      Studies the previously-compiled PCRE which may result in faster\n\t      matching.\n\n       pcre_match [ -v var ] [ -a arr ] [ -n offset ] [ -b ] string\n\t      Returns successfully if string matches the previously-compiled\n\t      PCRE.\n\n\t      Upon successful match, if the expression captures substrings\n\t      within parentheses, pcre_match will set the array match to those\n\t      substrings, unless the -a option is given, in which case it will\n\t      set the array arr.  Similarly, the variable MATCH will be set to\n\t      the entire matched portion of the string, unless the -v option\n\t      is given, in which case the variable var will be set.  No\n\t      variables are altered if there is no successful match.  A -n\n\t      option starts searching for a match from the byte offset\n\t      position in string.  If the -b option is given, the variable\n\t      ZPCRE_OP will be set to an offset pair string, representing the\n\t      byte offset positions of the entire matched portion within the\n\t      string.  For example, a ZPCRE_OP set to \"32 45\" indicates that\n\t      the matched portion began on byte offset 32 and ended on byte\n\t      offset 44.  Here, byte offset position 45 is the position\n\t      directly after the matched portion.  Keep in mind that the byte\n\t      position isn't necessarily the same as the character position\n\t      when UTF-8 characters are involved.  Consequently, the byte\n\t      offset positions are only to be relied on in the context of\n\t      using them for subsequent searches on string, using an offset\n\t      position as an argument to the -n option.  This is mostly used\n\t      to implement the \"find all non-overlapping matches\"\n\t      functionality.\n\n\t      A simple example of \"find all non-overlapping matches\":\n\n\t\t     string=\"The following zip codes: 78884 90210 99513\"\n\t\t     pcre_compile -m \"\\d{5}\"\n\t\t     accum=()\n\t\t     pcre_match -b -- $string\n\t\t     while [[ $? -eq 0 ]] do\n\t\t\t b=($=ZPCRE_OP)\n\t\t\t accum+=$MATCH\n\t\t\t pcre_match -b -n $b[2] -- $string\n\t\t     done\n\t\t     print -l $accum\n\n       The zsh/pcre module makes available the following test condition:\n\n       expr -pcre-match pcre\n\t      Matches a string against a perl-compatible regular expression.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     [[ \"$text\" -pcre-match ^d+$ ]] &&\n\t\t     print text variable contains only \"d's\".\n\n\t      If the REMATCH_PCRE option is set, the =~ operator is equivalent\n\t      to -pcre-match, and the NO_CASE_MATCH option may be used.  Note\n\t      that NO_CASE_MATCH never applies to the pcre_match builtin,\n\t      instead use the -i switch of pcre_compile.\n\nTHE ZSH/PARAM/PRIVATE MODULE\n       The zsh/param/private module is used to create parameters whose scope\n       is limited to the current function body, and not to other functions\n       called by the current function.\n\n       This module provides a single autoloaded builtin:\n\n       private [ {+|-}AHUahlmrtux ] [ {+|-}EFLRZi [ n ] ] [ name[=value] ... ]\n\t      The private builtin accepts all the same options and arguments\n\t      as local (zshbuiltins(1)) except for the `-T' option.  Tied\n\t      parameters may not be made private.\n\n\t      The `-p' option is presently a no-op because the state of\n\t      private parameters cannot reliably be reloaded.  This also\n\t      applies to printing private parameters with `typeset -p'.\n\n\t      If used at the top level (outside a function scope), private\n\t      creates a normal parameter in the same manner as declare or\n\t      typeset.\tA warning about this is printed if WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL\n\t      is set (zshoptions(1)).  Used inside a function scope, private\n\t      creates a local parameter similar to one declared with local,\n\t      except having special properties noted below.\n\n\t      Special parameters which expose or manipulate internal shell\n\t      state, such as ARGC, argv, COLUMNS, LINES, UID, EUID, IFS,\n\t      PROMPT, RANDOM, SECONDS, etc., cannot be made private unless the\n\t      `-h' option is used to hide the special meaning of the\n\t      parameter.  This may change in the future.\n\n       As with other typeset equivalents, private is both a builtin and a\n       reserved word, so arrays may be assigned with parenthesized word list\n       name=(value...) syntax.\tHowever, the reserved word `private' is not\n       available until zsh/param/private is loaded, so care must be taken with\n       order of execution and parsing for function definitions which use\n       private.  To compensate for this, the module also adds the option `-P'\n       to the `local' builtin to declare private parameters.\n\n       For example, this construction fails if zsh/param/private has not yet\n       been loaded when `bad_declaration' is defined:\n\t      bad_declaration() {\n\t\tzmodload zsh/param/private\n\t\tprivate array=( one two three )\n\t      }\n\n       This construction works because local is already a keyword, and the\n       module is loaded before the statement is executed:\n\t      good_declaration() {\n\t\tzmodload zsh/param/private\n\t\tlocal -P array=( one two three )\n\t      }\n\n       The following is usable in scripts but may have trouble with autoload:\n\t      zmodload zsh/param/private\n\t      iffy_declaration() {\n\t\tprivate array=( one two three )\n\t      }\n\n       The private builtin may always be used with scalar assignments and for\n       declarations without assignments.\n\n       Parameters declared with private have the following properties:\n\n       •      Within the function body where it is declared, the parameter\n\t      behaves as a local, except as noted above for tied or special\n\t      parameters.\n\n       •      The type of a parameter declared private cannot be changed in\n\t      the scope where it was declared, even if the parameter is unset.\n\t      Thus an array cannot be assigned to a private scalar, etc.\n\n       •      Within any other function called by the declaring function, the\n\t      private parameter does NOT hide other parameters of the same\n\t      name, so for example a global parameter of the same name is\n\t      visible and may be assigned or unset.  This includes calls to\n\t      anonymous functions, although that may also change in the\n\t      future.  However, the private name may not be created outside\n\t      the local scope when it was not previously declared.\n\n       •      An exported private remains in the environment of inner scopes\n\t      but appears unset for the current shell in those scopes.\n\t      Generally, exporting private parameters should be avoided.\n\n       Note that this differs from the static scope defined by compiled\n       languages derived from C, in that the a new call to the same function\n       creates a new scope, i.e., the parameter is still associated with the\n       call stack rather than with the function definition.  It differs from\n       ksh `typeset -S' because the syntax used to define the function has no\n       bearing on whether the parameter scope is respected.\n\nTHE ZSH/REGEX MODULE\n       The zsh/regex module makes available the following test condition:\n\n       expr -regex-match regex\n\t      Matches a string against a POSIX extended regular expression.\n\t      On successful match, matched portion of the string will normally\n\t      be placed in the MATCH variable.\tIf there are any capturing\n\t      parentheses within the regex, then the match array variable will\n\t      contain those.  If the match is not successful, then the\n\t      variables will not be altered.\n\n\t      For example,\n\n\t\t     [[ alphabetical -regex-match ^a([^a]+)a([^a]+)a ]] &&\n\t\t     print -l $MATCH X $match\n\n\t      If the option REMATCH_PCRE is not set, then the =~ operator will\n\t      automatically load this module as needed and will invoke the\n\t      -regex-match operator.\n\n\t      If BASH_REMATCH is set, then the array BASH_REMATCH will be set\n\t      instead of MATCH and match.\n\n\t      Note that the zsh/regex module logic relies on the host system.\n\t      The same expr and regex pair could produce different results on\n\t      different platforms if a regex with non-standard syntax is\n\t      given.\n\n\t      For example, no syntax for matching a word boundary is defined\n\t      in the POSIX extended regular expression standard. GNU libc and\n\t      BSD libc both provide such syntaxes as extensions (\\b and\n\t      [[:<:]]/[[:>:]] respectively), but neither of these syntaxes is\n\t      supported by both of these implementations.\n\n\t      Refer to the regcomp(3) and re_format(7) manual pages on your\n\t      system for locally-supported syntax.\n\nTHE ZSH/SCHED MODULE\n       The zsh/sched module makes available one builtin command and one\n       parameter.\n\n       sched [-o] [+]hh:mm[:ss] command ...\n       sched [-o] [+]seconds command ...\n       sched [ -item ]\n\t      Make an entry in the scheduled list of commands to execute.  The\n\t      time may be specified in either absolute or relative time, and\n\t      either as hours, minutes and (optionally) seconds separated by a\n\t      colon, or seconds alone.\tAn absolute number of seconds\n\t      indicates the time since the epoch (1970/01/01 00:00); this is\n\t      useful in combination with the features in the zsh/datetime\n\t      module, see the zsh/datetime module entry in zshmodules(1).\n\n\t      With no arguments, prints the list of scheduled commands.  If\n\t      the scheduled command has the -o flag set, this is shown at the\n\t      start of the command.\n\n\t      With the argument `-item', removes the given item from the list.\n\t      The numbering of the list is continuous and entries are in time\n\t      order, so the numbering can change when entries are added or\n\t      deleted.\n\n\t      Commands are executed either immediately before a prompt, or\n\t      while the shell's line editor is waiting for input.  In the\n\t      latter case it is useful to be able to produce output that does\n\t      not interfere with the line being edited.  Providing the option\n\t      -o causes the shell to clear the command line before the event\n\t      and redraw it afterwards.  This should be used with any\n\t      scheduled event that produces visible output to the terminal; it\n\t      is not needed, for example, with output that updates a terminal\n\t      emulator's title bar.\n\n\t      To effect changes to the editor buffer when an event executes,\n\t      use the `zle' command with no arguments to test whether the\n\t      editor is active, and if it is, then use `zle widget' to access\n\t      the editor via the named widget.\n\n\t      The sched builtin is not made available by default when the\n\t      shell starts in a mode emulating another shell.  It can be made\n\t      available with the command `zmodload -F zsh/sched b:sched'.\n\n       zsh_scheduled_events\n\t      A readonly array corresponding to the events scheduled by the\n\t      sched builtin.  The indices of the array correspond to the\n\t      numbers shown when sched is run with no arguments (provided that\n\t      the KSH_ARRAYS option is not set).  The value of the array\n\t      consists of the scheduled time in seconds since the epoch (see\n\t      the section `The zsh/datetime Module' for facilities for using\n\t      this number), followed by a colon, followed by any options\n\t      (which may be empty but will be preceded by a `-' otherwise),\n\t      followed by a colon, followed by the command to be executed.\n\n\t      The sched builtin should be used for manipulating the events.\n\t      Note that this will have an immediate effect on the contents of\n\t      the array, so that indices may become invalid.\n\nTHE ZSH/NET/SOCKET MODULE\n       The zsh/net/socket module makes available one builtin command:\n\n       zsocket [ -altv ] [ -d fd ] [ args ]\n\t      zsocket is implemented as a builtin to allow full use of shell\n\t      command line editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.\n\n   Outbound Connections\n       zsocket [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename\n\t      Open a new Unix domain connection to filename.  The shell\n\t      parameter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor associated\n\t      with that connection.  Currently, only stream connections are\n\t      supported.\n\n\t      If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the target\n\t      file descriptor for the connection.\n\n\t      In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.\n\n\t      File descriptors can be closed with normal shell syntax when no\n\t      longer needed, for example:\n\n\t\t     exec {REPLY}>&-\n\n   Inbound Connections\n       zsocket -l [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename\n\t      zsocket -l will open a socket listening on filename.  The shell\n\t      parameter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor associated\n\t      with that listener.  The file descriptor remains open in\n\t      subshells and forked external executables.\n\n\t      If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the target\n\t      file descriptor for the connection.\n\n\t      In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.\n\n       zsocket -a [ -tv ] [ -d targetfd ] listenfd\n\t      zsocket -a will accept an incoming connection to the socket\n\t      associated with listenfd.

Note that\n\t      use of the print builtin with the -u option will, as a side\n\t      effect, release the lock, as will redirection to the file in the\n\t      shell holding the lock.  To work around this use a subshell,\n\t      e.g. `(print message) >> file'.  Status 0 is returned if the\n\t      lock succeeds, else status 1."
