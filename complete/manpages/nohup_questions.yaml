Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `nohup`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nNOHUP(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t      NOHUP(1)\n\nNAME\n     nohup – invoke a utility immune to hangups\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     nohup [--] utility [arguments]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The nohup utility invokes utility with its arguments and at this time\n     sets the signal SIGHUP to be ignored.  If the standard output is a\n     terminal, the standard output is appended to the file nohup.out in the\n     current directory.  If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to\n     the same place as the standard output.\n\n     Some shells may provide a builtin nohup command which is similar or\n     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The following variables are utilized by nohup:\n\n     HOME  If the output file nohup.out cannot be created in the current\n\t   directory, the nohup utility uses the directory named by HOME to\n\t   create the file.\n\n     PATH  Used to locate the requested utility if the name contains no ‘/’\n\t   characters.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The nohup utility exits with one of the following values:"
