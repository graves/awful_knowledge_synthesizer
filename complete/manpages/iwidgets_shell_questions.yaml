This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget.\tIt has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for shell widgets:\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName activate\n\t      Display the shell and wait based on the modality.  For\n\t      application and system modal activations, perform a grab\n\t      operation, and wait for the result.  The result may be returned\n\t      via an argument to the deactivate method.\n\n       pathName center ?widget?\n\t      Centers the shell with respect to another widget.  The widget\n\t      argument is optional.  If provided, it should be the path of\n\t      another widget with to center upon.  If absent, then the shell\n\t      will be centered on the screen as a whole.\n\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::shell command.\n\n       pathName childsite\n\t      Returns the pathname of the child site widget.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::shell command.\n\n       pathName deactivate ?arg?\n\t      Deactivate the display of the shell.  The method takes an\n\t      optional argument to be passed to the activate method which\n\t      returns the value.  The optional argument is only effective for\n\t      application and system modal dialogs."
