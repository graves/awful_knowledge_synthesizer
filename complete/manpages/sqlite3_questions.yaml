If the database file does exist,\n       it will be opened.\n\n       For example, to create a new database file named \"mydata.db\", create a\n       table named \"memos\" and insert a couple of records into that table:\n\n       $ sqlite3 mydata.db\n       SQLite version 3.43.2 2023-10-10 13:08:14\n       Enter \".help\" for usage hints.\n       sqlite> CREATE TABLE memos(text, priority INTEGER);\n       sqlite> INSERT INTO memos VALUES('deliver project description', 10);\n       sqlite> INSERT INTO memos VALUES('lunch with Christine', 100);\n       sqlite> SELECT * FROM memos;\n       deliver project description|10\n       lunch with Christine|100\n       sqlite>\n\n\n       If no database name is supplied, the ATTACH sql command can be used to\n       attach to existing or create new database files.  ATTACH can also be\n       used to attach to multiple databases within the same interactive\n       session.  This is useful for migrating data between databases, possibly\n       changing the schema along the way.\n\n       Optionally, a SQL statement or set of SQL statements can be supplied as\n       a single argument.  Multiple statements should be separated by semi-\n       colons.\n\n       For example:\n\n       $ sqlite3 -line mydata.db 'SELECT * FROM memos WHERE priority > 20;'\n\t   text = lunch with Christine\n       priority = 100"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the sqlite3 command-line tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use sqlite3 to execute a SQL query that selects all records from the 'memos' table where the priority is greater than 20?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using sqlite3 to attach multiple databases and perform a query across them?

For example:\n\n       sqlite> .help\n\n\n       The available commands differ by version and build options, so they are\n       not listed here.
