Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `postdrop`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPOSTDROP(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t   POSTDROP(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       postdrop - Postfix mail posting utility\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       postdrop [-rv] [-c config_dir]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The postdrop(1) command creates a file in the maildrop directory and\n       copies its standard input to the file.\n\n       Options:\n\n       -c config_dir\n\t      The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead\n\t      of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      environment setting below.\n\n       -r     Use a Postfix-internal protocol for reading the message from\n\t      standard input, and for reporting status information on standard\n\t      output. This is currently the only supported method.\n\n       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v\n\t      options make the software increasingly verbose. As of Postfix\n\t      2.3, this option is available for the super-user only.\n\nSECURITY\n       The command is designed to run with set-group ID privileges, so that it\n       can write to the maildrop queue directory and so that it can connect to\n       Postfix daemon processes.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Fatal errors: malformed input, I/O error, out of memory. Problems are\n       logged to syslogd(8) and to the standard error stream.  When the input\n       is incomplete, or when the process receives a HUP, INT, QUIT or TERM\n       signal, the queue file is deleted.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\n       MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      Directory with the main.cf file. In order to avoid exploitation\n\t      of set-group ID privileges, a non-standard directory is allowed\n\t      only if:\n\n\t      •      The name is listed in the standard main.cf file with the\n\t\t     alternate_config_directories configuration parameter.\n\n\t      •      The command is invoked by the super-user.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this\n       program.  The text below provides only a parameter summary. See\n       postconf(5) for more details including examples.\n\n       alternate_config_directories (empty)\n\t      A list of non-default Postfix configuration directories that may\n\t      be specified with \"-c config_directory\" on the command line, or\n\t      via the MAIL_CONFIG environment parameter.\n\n       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf\n\t      configuration files.\n\n       import_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The list of environment parameters that a Postfix process will\n\t      import from a non-Postfix parent process.\n\n       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.\n\n       syslog_facility (mail)\n\t      The syslog facility of Postfix logging.\n\n       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog\n\t      records, so that, for example, \"smtpd\" becomes \"prefix/smtpd\".\n\n       trigger_timeout (10s)\n\t      The time limit for sending a trigger to a Postfix daemon (for\n\t      example, the pickup(8) or qmgr(8) daemon).\n\n       Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later:\n\n       authorized_submit_users (static:anyone)\n\t      List of users who are authorized to submit mail with the\n\t      sendmail(1) command (and with the privileged postdrop(1) helper\n\t      command).\n\nFILES\n       /var/spool/postfix/maildrop, maildrop queue\n\nSEE ALSO\n       sendmail(1), compatibility interface\n       postconf(5), configuration parameters\n       syslogd(8), system logging\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
