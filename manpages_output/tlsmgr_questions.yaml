It stores and\n       retrieves cache entries on request by smtpd(8) and smtp(8) processes,\n       and periodically removes entries that have expired.\n\n       The tlsmgr(8) also manages the PRNG (pseudo random number generator)\n       pool. It answers queries by the smtpd(8) and smtp(8) processes to seed\n       their internal PRNG pools.\n\n       The tlsmgr(8)'s PRNG pool is initially seeded from an external source\n       (EGD, /dev/urandom, or regular file).  It is updated at configurable\n       pseudo-random intervals with data from the external source. It is\n       updated periodically with data from TLS session cache entries and with\n       the time of day, and is updated with the time of day whenever a process\n       requests tlsmgr(8) service.\n\n       The tlsmgr(8) saves the PRNG state to an exchange file periodically and\n       when the process terminates, and reads the exchange file when\n       initializing its PRNG.\n\nSECURITY\n       The tlsmgr(8) is not security-sensitive. The code that maintains the\n       external and internal PRNG pools does not \"trust\" the data that it\n       manipulates, and the code that maintains the TLS session cache does not\n       touch the contents of the cached entries, except for seeding its\n       internal PRNG pool.\n\n       The tlsmgr(8) can be run chrooted and with reduced privileges.  At\n       process startup it connects to the entropy source and exchange file,\n       and creates or truncates the optional TLS session cache files.\n\n       With Postfix version 2.5 and later, the tlsmgr(8) no longer uses root\n       privileges when opening cache files. These files should now be stored\n       under the Postfix-owned data_directory.\tAs a migration aid, an attempt\n       to open a cache file under a non-Postfix directory is redirected to the\n       Postfix-owned data_directory, and a warning is logged.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to the syslog daemon.\n\nBUGS\n       There is no automatic means to limit the number of entries in the TLS\n       session caches and/or the size of the TLS cache files.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically, because tlsmgr(8)\n       is a persistent processes.  Use the command \"postfix reload\" after a\n       configuration change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary.
