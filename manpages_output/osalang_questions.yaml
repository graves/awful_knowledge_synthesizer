Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `osalang`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOSALANG(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t    OSALANG(1)\n\nNAME\n     osalang – information about installed OSA languages\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     osalang [-dlL]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     osalang prints information about installed OSA languages.\tWith no\n     options, it prints an unadorned list of language names to standard\n     output.  These names can be passed to the -l options of osacompile(1) and\n     osascript(1).  The options are as follows:\n\n     -d    Only print the default language.\n\n     -l    List in long format.  For each language, osalang will print its\n\t   component subtype, manufacturer, and capability flags.  There are\n\t   eight groups of optional routines that scripting components can\n\t   support.  Each flag is either a letter, meaning the group is\n\t   supported, or ‘-’, meaning it is not.  The letters map to the\n\t   following groups:\n\n\t\t c     compiling scripts.\n\t\t g     getting source data.\n\t\t x     coercing script values.\n\t\t e     manipulating the event create and send functions.\n\t\t r     recording scripts.\n\t\t v     “convenience” APIs to execute scripts in one step.\n\t\t d     manipulating dialects.\n\t\t h     using scripts to handle Apple Events."
