The ID may include an\n       optional @offset suffix which may be used to start replaying at a\n       specific time offset.  The @offset is specified as a number in seconds\n       since the start of the session with an optional decimal fraction.\n\n       Path names may be relative to the I/O log directory /var/log/sudo-io\n       (unless overridden by the -d option) or fully qualified, beginning with\n       a ‘/’ character.  When a command is run via sudo with log_output\n       enabled in the sudoers file, a “TSID=ID” string is logged via syslog(3)\n       or to the sudo log file.  The ID may also be determined using\n       sudoreplay's list mode."

In interactive mode, sudoreplay will attempt to adjust\n       the terminal size to match that of the session and write directly to\n       the terminal (not all terminals support this).  Additionally, it will\n       poll the keyboard and act on the following keys:\n\n       ‘\\n’ or ‘\\r’  Skip to the next replay event; useful for long pauses.\n\n       ‘ ’ (space)   Pause output; press any key to resume.\n\n       ‘<’\t     Reduce the playback speed by one half.\n\n       ‘>’\t     Double the playback speed.\n\n       The session can be interrupted via control-C.
