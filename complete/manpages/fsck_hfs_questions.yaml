It is\n     normally started by fsck(8) run from /etc/rc.boot during automatic\n     reboot, when a HFS file system is detected.  When preening file systems,\n     fsck_hfs will fix common inconsistencies for file systems that were not\n     unmounted cleanly.  If more serious problems are found, fsck_hfs does not\n     try to fix them, indicates that it was not successful, and exits.\n\n     The third form of fsck_hfs checks the specified file systems and tries to\n     repair all detected inconsistencies."
