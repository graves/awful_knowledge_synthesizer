The other packages are performing low-\n       level text processing and utility tasks geared towards parser\n       generation and mainly accessed by page through plugins.\n\n       The packages implementing the plugins are not documented as regular\n       packages, as they cannot be loaded into a general interpreter, like\n       tclsh, without extensive preparation of the interpreter. Preparation\n       which is done for them by the plugin manager.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.\n       Please report such in the category page of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       page, parser generator, text processing\n\nCATEGORY\n       Page Parser Generator\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
