- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `concat`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nconcat(n)\t\t     Tcl Built-In Commands\t\t     concat(n)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nNAME\n       concat - Join lists together\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       concat ?arg arg ...?\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This command joins each of its arguments together with spaces after\n       trimming leading and trailing white-space from each of them.  If all\n       the arguments are lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them\n       into a single list.  It permits any number of arguments; if no args are\n       supplied, the result is an empty string.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Although concat will concatenate lists, flattening them in the process\n       (so giving the following interactive session):\n\n\t      % concat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}\n\t      a b c d e f {g h}\n\n       it will also concatenate things that are not lists, as can be seen from\n       this session:\n\n\t      % concat \" a b {c   \" d \"  e} f\"\n\t      a b {c d e} f\n\n       Note also that the concatenation does not remove spaces from the middle\n       of values, as can be seen here:\n\n\t      % concat \"a   b\tc\" { d e f }\n\t      a   b   c d e f\n\n       (i.e., there are three spaces between each of the a, the b and the c).\n\nSEE ALSO\n       append(n), eval(n), join(n)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       concatenate, join, lists\n\nTcl\t\t\t\t      8.3\t\t\t     concat(n)"
