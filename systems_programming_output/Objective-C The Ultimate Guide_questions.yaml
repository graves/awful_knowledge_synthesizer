Object-oriented \napproaches are required to give the type of capability seen in the Cocoa \nframeworks. Second, since Objective-C is an extension of ANSI C, exist-\ning C applications are converted to utilize the software frameworks with-\nout  sacrificing  any  of  the  efforts  that  went  into  their  creation.  Because \nObjective-C includes C, you receive all of the advantages of C while deal-\ning with it.\n\nYou may select whether to use object-oriented programming methods \n(for example, to create a new class) and when to use procedural program-\nming techniques (define a structure and some functions instead of a class).\nFurthermore, Objective-C is a very basic programming language.

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nObjective-C is exceptionally dynamic when compared to other C-based  \nobject-oriented languages. For usage at runtime, the compiler saves a lot  \nof information about the objects themselves. Decisions taken at compile  \ntime are deferred until after the program has been executed. Objective-C  \nprograms have a lot of flexibility and power because of their dynamism. It  \nprovides two major advantages that are difficult to get with other ostensi-\nbly object-oriented languages.\n\nObjective-C has an open, dynamic binding approach that can allow a  \nbasic interactive user interface design. Messages are not always bound by  \nthe receiver's class or method name. Therefore a software framework may  \nenable users to make decisions at runtime and provide developers a cre-\native latitude in their design. (Terms like dynamic binding, message, class,  \nand receiver will be defined later in this text.)\n\nDynamism allows for the creation of advanced development tools. It's  \nfeasible to construct tools that monitor, intervene, and disclose the underly-\ning structure and activity of Objective-C programs using an interface to the  \nruntime system, which offers access to information about running apps.\n\nDIFFERENTIATING OBJECTIVE-C VERSUS SWIFT\n\nSwift is the programming language that Apple introduced in June 2014.  \nObjective-C has all the flaws one would anticipate from a language derived  \nfrom C. To differentiate keywords and types from C types, Objective-C  \nprefixes new keywords with @. Swift is not based on C. Therefore, it may  \ncombine all Objective-C types and object-related keywords and extract  \ntheir many @ symbols.\n\nIn addition to other modern programming languages, Swift code  \nnearly resembles natural English. This readability makes it easier for exist-\ning programmers from JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and C++ to adopt  \nSwift as part of their toolchain, in contrast to the painful experience that  \nObjective-C programmers had.\n\nDIFFERENTIATING OBJECTIVE-C FROM C++\n\nWilkerson states that C++ was introduced in 1979 to combine objects and  \ninstance methods with the original C programming language. Objective-C  \nlanguage was founded on the belief that object-oriented programming\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

Nevertheless, in C++, the focus is often on com-\npile-time conclusions. C++ is a middle-level programming language that \nruns  on  several  cross-platform  operating  systems  including  Windows, \nUNIX, Mac OS, etc. Objective-C, in contrast, is a general-purpose, object-\noriented programming language that Apple uses in its operating systems \nand Cocoa APIs, etc.\n\nUPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES OF OBJECTIVE-C\nUpsides\n\n•  Compatibility with both C++ and Objective-C++\n\n•  Effective attributes such as method swizzling\n\n•  More dependable assistance in coding Binary Frameworks.\n\nDownsides\n\n•  Since  Objective-C  is  built  upon  C,  namespacing  is  required.  All \nclasses  inside  an  Objective-C  program  must  be  globally  unique. \nTherefore, there is a practice of prefixing class names to avoid con-\nflict.

    An Objective-C identifier recognizes a variable, function, or other user-defined items. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore and ends with zero or more letters, underscores, or numbers (0 to 9). Punctuation characters such as @, $, and percent are not permitted within identifiers in Objective-C. Objective-C is a computer language that is case sensitive. Thus, in Objective-C, Manpower and manpower are two different IDs. The following are some instances of appropriate identifiers:

    WHITESPACE IN OBJECTIVE-C

    A blank line has simply whitespace, potentially with a remark, and is completely ignored by an Objective-C compiler.

    In Objective-C, whitespace refers to blanks, tabs, newline characters, and comments. Whitespace divides one section of a statement from another and allows the compiler to determine where one element, such as int, ends, and the next element starts in a statement. As a result, in the following sentence

    int ages;

    For the compiler to distinguish between int and age, there must be at least one whitespace character (typically a space). In contrast, the following statement,

    fruit = grapes + apples; // get total fruit

The return type of a function with no return value is void. As an example, consider void exit (int status).\n2 | Function arguments as void\nSome Objective-C functions do not accept any parameters. A void can be accepted by a function that has no parameters. For instance, int rand(void).\n\nVARIABLES IN OBJECTIVE-C\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

A variable description describes a data type and includes a list of one or more variables of that type, as seen below.\n\ntype variablelist;\n\nIn this case, a type must be a valid Objective-C data type, such as char, w char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object. The variable list can have one or more identifier names separated by commas. Here are some examples of valid declarations.\n\nint    c, d, e;\nchar   k, kh;\nfloat  g, salary;\ndouble q;\n\nThe line int c, d, e; declares and defines the variables c, d, and e; and tells the compiler to create variables of type int called c, d, and e.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

A variable declaration only has significance at the time of compilation; the compiler requires the actual variable declaration when linking the program.\n\nA variable declaration is essential when you are utilizing many files. You specify your variable in one of the files accessible at the time of program linking.  To define a variable at any location, you will utilize the extern keyword. Variables are declared several times in Objective-C programs, but they can only be defined once per file, function, or code block.\n\nExample: Try out the following example, in which variables are declared \n\nat the top but defined and initialized inside the main function.\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n// Variable-declaration:\nextern int x, y;\nextern int z;\nextern float f;\n\nint main () {\n  /* variable-definition: */\n  int x, y;\n  int z;\n  float f;\n\n  /* actual-initialization */\n  x = 10;\n  y = 20;\n\n  z = x + y;\n  NSLog(@\"The value of z : %d \\n\", z);\n\n  f = 70.0/3.0;\n  NSLog(@\"The value of f : %f \\n\", f);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\n---\n\n18    ◾    Objective-C\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

    An operator in Objective-C is a symbol that instructs the compiler to do particular mathematical or logical operations. The Objective-C language has several built-in operators, including the following:

    • Arithmetic Operators

    • Assignment Operators

    • Relational Operators

    • Bitwise Operators

    • Logical Operators

    • Misc Operators

    Crash Course in Objective-C    ◾    23

    This session will walk us through arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and other operators.

    ARITHMETIC OPERATORS IN OBJECTIVE-C

    The table mentioned below lists all the arithmetic operators offered by the Objective-C programming language. Assume variable A has a value of 20, and variable B has a value of 30, then.

    Operator        Description

    +               Adds the two operands
    -               Subtracts the second operand from the first
    *               Multiplies both the operands
    /               Divides numerator by the denominator
    %               Modulus Operator and the remainder of after integer division
    ++             The increment operator increases the integer value by one
    −−             The decrement operator decreases the integer value by one

    Example

    C + D will give 30
    C − D will give −12
    C * D will give 100
    D / C will give 3
    D % C will give 0

    C++ will give 14

    C−− will give 7

    RELATIONAL OPERATORS

    The table below lists all the relational operations provided by the Objective-C programming language. Assume variable C has a value of 20 and variable D has a value of 30, then.

    Operator        Description

    ==              Compares the values of two operands; if they are equal, the condition becomes true.

    A simple assignment operator assigns the right operands' values to the left operand.
    It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the resulting value to the left operand.
    It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the resulting value to the left operand.
    Multiplication AND assignment, This operation multiplies the right operand by the left operand and assigns the product to the left operand.
    Divide AND assignment divide the left operand by the right operand and assign the resulting value to the left operand.
    AND assignment operator, modulus. It uses two operands to calculate the modulus and assigns the result to the left operand.

    Z = X + Y will assign value of X + Y into Z

    Z += X is equivalent to Z = Z + X

    Z -= X is equivalent to Z = Z – X

    Z *= X is equivalent to Z = Z * X

    Z /= X is equivalent to Z = Z / X

    Z %= X is equivalent to Z = Z % X

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nCall by value  \nThis method replicates the real value of an argument into the function's formal parameter. Changes to the parameter within the function do not affect the argument in this case.  \nCall by reference  \nThis method inserts an argument's address into the formal parameter. The address is utilized within the function to obtain the actual parameter used in the call. This signifies that changes to the parameter affect the argument.  \n\nTo pass arguments, Objective-C employs call by value by default. In general, this implies that code within a function cannot change the arguments used to call the function, and the preceding example is utilized the same way when using the max() function.  \n\nBLOCKS IN OBJECTIVE-C  \n\nAn Objective-C class is a type of object that combines data with associated functionality. It is sometimes more appropriate to express a single job or unit of action rather than the collection of methods.  \n\nThe addition of blocks to C, Objective-C, and C++ has made it possible to create separate chunks of code that can be handed to methods and functions like values. Add blocks to collections like NSArray or NSDictionary as they are Objective-C objects. They are comparable to closures or lambdas in other programming languages since they may also catch values from the surrounding scope.  \n\nCrash Course in Objective-C ◾ 35  \n\nSimple Block Declaration Syntax  \n\nreturntype (^block_Name)(argument_Type);  \n\nImplementation of a Simple Block  \n\nreturntype (^block_Name)(argument_Type)= ^{\n};  \n\nHere's an easy example:  \n\nvoid (^simpleBlock)(void) = ^{\n    NSLog(@\"This is block\");\n };  \n\nBLOCKS TAKE ARGUMENTS AND RETURN VALUES  \n\nBlocks, like methods and functions, can take arguments and return values.

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nObjective-C pointers are simple and enjoyable to learn. Some Objective-C  \nprogramming  tasks  are  easier  to  accomplish  with  pointers,  while  oth-\ners,  such  as  dynamic  memory  allocation,  cannot  be  performed  without \nthem.  As  a  result,  learning  pointers  are  required  to  become  a  proficient \nObjective-C  programmers.  Let  us  begin  by  studying  them  in  small  and \neasy steps.\n\nAs you may know, each variable is a memory location. Each mem-\nory location has an address in Objective-C that can be accessed using \nthe ampersand (&) operator, representing a memory address. Consider \nthe  following  example,  which  prints  the  addresses  of  the  variables \nspecified.\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main () {\n   int  var1;\n   char var2[10];\n\n   NSLog(@\"The Address of var1 variable is: %x\\n\", \n&var1 );\n   NSLog(@\"The Address of var2 variable is: %x\\n\", \n&var2 );\n\n   return 0;\n}\n\nWHAT EXACTLY ARE POINTERS IN OBJECTIVE-C?\n\nA  pointer  in  Objective-C  is  a  variable  whose  value  is  the  address  of \nanother variable, i.e., the memory location's direct address. Like any vari-\nable or constant, a pointer must be declared before using them to hold any \nvariable address. A pointer variable declaration has the following general \nform:\n\ntype *var_name;\n\nIn  Objective-C  the  pointer's  base  type  is  type,  which  must  be  a  valid \nObjective-C data type, and the pointer variable's name is var_name. The \nasterisk * in Objective-C is used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk \n\n \n \n \n42    ◾    Objective-C\n\nused for multiplication. In this case, though, the asterisk indicates a vari-\nable as a pointer. The valid pointer declarations are as follows:\n\nint    *ip;    /* pointer to integer */\ndouble *dp;    /* pointer to double */\nfloat  *fp;    /* pointer to float */\nchar   *ch     /* pointer to character */\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThe true data type of all pointer values, whether integer, float, character  \nor otherwise, is a lengthy hexadecimal number representing a memory  \nlocation. The sole distinction between pointers of various data types is the  \ndata type of the variable or constant pointed to by the pointer.\n\nHow Do Pointers Work?\n\nThere are just a handful of significant actions that we will do regularly  \nusing pointers. (a) we create a pointer variable, (b) we assign the address of  \na variable to a pointer, and (c) we ultimately access the value at the address  \naccessible via the pointer variable. This is accomplished using the unary  \noperator *, which returns the variable's value at the location given by its  \nargument. The following illustration employs these operations:\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main () {\n   int var = 30;    /* actual variable-declaration */\n   int *ip;         /* pointer variable-declaration */\n\n   ip = &var;       /* store address of var in the \npointer variable*/\n\n   NSLog(@\"Address of var variable: %x\\n\", &var  );\n\n   /* address stored in the pointer variable */\n   NSLog(@\"Address stored in the ip variable: %x\\n\", \nip );\n\n   /* access value using the pointer */\n   NSLog(@\"The Value of *ip variable: %d\\n\", *ip );\n\n   return 0;\n}\n\n \n \n   \n \n \n \nCrash Course in Objective-C    ◾    43\n\nOBJECTIVE-C NULL POINTERS\n\nIn Objective-C, it is usually a good idea to assign a NULL value to a \npointer variable if the allocated address is unknown. This is done during \nvariable declaration. A null pointer is a pointer in Objective-C that has \nbeen assigned the value NULL.\n\nThe NULL pointer in Objective-C is a zero-valued constant declared in \n\nnumerous standard libraries. Take a look at the following program:\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main () {\n   int *ptr = NULL;\n   NSLog(@\"Value of the ptr is : %x\\n\", ptr  );\n   return 0;\n}\n\nThe following outcome is produced when the given code is compiled\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

The value is true if the provided identifier is defined (non-zero). The value is false if the symbol is not specified (zero). The following is the definition of the defined operator:\n\n```c\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n#if !defined(MESSAGE)\n   #define MESSAGE \"We wish\"\n#endif\n\nint main(void) {\n   NSLog(@\"Here message is: %s\\n\", MESSAGE);  \n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**PARAMETERIZED MACROS**\n\nSimulating functions using parameterized macros is one of OCPP's most powerful features. For example, we may have the following code to square a number:\n\n```c\nint square(int a) {\n    return a * a;\n}\n```\n\nWe may modify the preceding code using a macro as follows:\n\n```c\n#define square(a) ((a) * (a))\n```\n\nBefore using them, macros with parameters must be specified with the #define directive. The parameter list enclosed by parentheses must come immediately after the macro name. Spaces are not permitted between the macro name and the open parenthesis. As an example,\n\n```c\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n#define MAX(x,y) ((x) > (y)?  (x) : (y))\n\nint main(void) {\n   NSLog(@\"The Max between 30 and 20 is %d\\n\", MAX(20, \n30));  \n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Typedef in Objective-C**\n\nThe Objective-C programming language includes a typedef keyword used to rename a type. Below mentioned is an example of how to define the term BYTE for one-byte numbers:\n\n```c\ntypedef unsigned char BYTE;\n```\n\nFollowing this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for instance:\n\n```c\nBYTE by1, by2;\n```\n\nUppercase letters are used by convention for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is only a symbolic abbreviation.

Consider the following example, in which the cast operator divides one integer variable by another in a floating-point operation:\n\n```objc\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main() {\n   int sum = 27, count = 15;\n   CGFloat mean;\n\n   mean = (CGFloat) sum / count;\n   NSLog(@\"The Value of mean : %f\\n\", mean );\n\n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNote that the cast operator takes precedence over the division operator. Thus, the sum value is first changed to type `double` before being divided by count, returning a `double` value.\n\nType conversions can be implicit (done automatically by the compiler) or explicit (expressed explicitly using the cast operator). When type conversions are required, it is considered good programming practice to utilize the cast operator.\n\nINTEGER PROMOTION\n\nInteger promotion is when values of the integer type \"smaller\" than `int` or `unsigned int` are upgraded to `int` or `unsigned int`. Consider adding a character to an `int`.\n\n```objc\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n   int x = 27;\n   char c = 'c';  \n   int sum;\n\n   sum = x + c;\n   NSLog(@\"The Value of sum : %d\\n\", sum );\n\n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\nUSUAL ARITHMETIC CONVERSION\n\nThe usual arithmetic conversions are done implicitly to cast their values in a common type. If operands continue to be of various types, the compiler converts them to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy.\n\nUsual arithmetic conversions.\n\nThe assignment operators and the logical operators `&&` and `||` do not undergo the standard arithmetic conversions. To further comprehend the concept, consider the following example.\n\n```objc\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main() {\n   int x = 27;\n   char c = 'c';  \n   CGFloat sum;\n\n   sum = x + c;\n   NSLog(@\"The Value of sum : %f\\n\", sum );\n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\n--- \n\nThis version has been corrected for formatting, spelling, and syntax errors while preserving the original content.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

An NSError object has three fundamental attributes: an error domain (expressed by a string), a domain-specific error code, and a user info dictionary providing application-specific information.\n\nNSError\n\nNSError objects are used in Objective-C programs to provide information about runtime faults that users should be aware of. Typically, a program will display this error information in a dialog or sheet. However, it may interpret data and either request that the user attempt to recover from the error or seek to repair the issue on its own.\n\nThe NSError Object consists of:\n\n• Domain: The error domain must not be nil and can be one of the preset NSError domains or an arbitrary string specifying a new domain.\n\n• Code: The error code.\n\n• User Info: The error's userInfo dictionary, which may be null.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to generate a custom error.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nAs humans, we are constantly confronted with data and perceptions that we must interpret. We must separate the underlying structure from the surface features and identify the critical relationships at work. Abstractions explain causes and consequences, uncover patterns and frameworks, and distinguish between what is and is not relevant. Object orientation offers an abstraction of the data on which you work; moreover, it gives a tangible grouping between the data and the operations performed on the data – giving the data behavior.\n\nOPERATIONS AND DATA\n\nData and actions on data have typically been separated in programming languages. Except when operations affect it, data is static and immutable. \n\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003357506-2\n\n67\n\n68    ◾    Objective-C\n\nProcedures and functions that act on data don't have a permanent state of their own; they're solely helpful for affecting data.\n\nThis separation is, of course, based on how computers operate, so it's not something you can lightly dismiss. It provides the backdrop against which we labor, just as the differences between matter and energy and nouns and verbs do. All programmers, even object-oriented programmers, must specify the data structures that their programs will utilize and the functions that will operate on the data at some point.\n\nThis is all there is to it in a procedural programming language like C. The language may provide multiple forms of data and function organization, but it will not divide the world. The fundamental parts of the design are functions and data structures.\n\nObject-oriented programming restructures the world at a higher level rather than disputing it. It divides processes and data into objects, then combined into organized networks to produce a complete program. Objects and object interactions are the fundamental design components of an object-oriented programming language.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nEvery object contains state (data) and behavior (operations on data).  \nThey are similar to conventional physical things in this regard.

    Learning object-oriented programming is all about moving from thinking about functions and data structures to thinking about object behaviors. It may seem strange at first, but as you acquire expertise with object-oriented programming, we'll discover that it's a more natural way of thinking. Lists, containers, tables, controllers, and even managers are all analogous to real-world objects in programming. Using programming objects as an example simply expands the comparison naturally.

    The types of abstractions that a programming language allows us to encode may be used to evaluate it. Extraneous issues should not distract us, nor should we be obliged to explain ourselves using a language that does not correspond to the reality we're attempting to depict.

    OOP in Objective-C ◾ 71

    If, for example, you must constantly attend to the business of matching the correct data with the correct method, you are compelled to be aware of the complete program at a low level of implementation at all times. While we may still create programs with a high degree of abstraction, the transition from concept to implementation can be challenging and increasingly tricky as programs become more complex.

    Object-oriented programming languages provide us with a more extensive vocabulary and a richer model to work in by giving a greater degree of abstraction.

    THE OBJECT MODEL

    The object-oriented programming insight is to integrate state and behavior data and data operations into a high-level unit, an object, and provide language support. A collection of related functions and a data structure that fulfils those functions form an object. The functions in Objective-C are known as the object's methods, and the data structure's fields are known as its instance variables.

    Model of object.

    If we've ever worked on a challenging programming problem, our design certainly incorporated sets of functions that work on a specific type of data implicit "objects" without language support.

    Object-oriented programming makes these function groups clear and allows us to think about the group rather than its components. The only

    The network's objects will not be identical. In addition to Faucet objects, a program that replicates water use may include Pipe objects that carry water to the Faucet and Valve objects that control the flow between pipes. There may be a Building object to coordinate a system of pipes, valves, and faucets, some Appliance objects that can switch valves on and off (equivalent to dishwashers, toilets, and washing machines), and perhaps some User objects to operate the appliances and faucets. When a Building object in Objective-C is asked how much water is being utilized, it may request information from each Faucet and Valve object. When a user turns on an appliance, it must first turn on a valve to get the water it needs.

    THE METAPHOR OF MESSAGING

    Each programming paradigm has its own set of terms and metaphors. The vocabulary of object-oriented programming encourages you to consider what happens in a program from a unique viewpoint.

    There's a temptation, for example, to consider things to be actors with human-like motivations and capacities. It's tempting to speak about an object determining what to do in a scenario, requesting information from other objects, introspecting to get the required information, transferring responsibilities to another object, or managing a process.

    This metaphor requires you to conceive objects as executing their methods rather than functions or methods doing the job, as you would in a procedural programming language. Objects are the agents of the program's action rather than passive receptacles for state and behavior.

    This metaphor is quite helpful. An object is similar to an actor in specific ways: it has a specific job to perform in the program's overall design. Within that role, it may work somewhat independently of the other components. It interacts with other things as they perform their functions, yet it is self-contained and may operate independently. It can't deviate from the script, just like a performer onstage, yet the part it performs might be diverse and intricate.

    Objects as actors mesh well with the primary metaphor of object-oriented programming, which is that objects interact through messages. Instead of executing a method like a function, we send a message to an object and ask it to do one of its methods.

    This metaphor leads to a beneficial way of thinking about methods and objects; however, it takes some getting accustomed to it. It isolates procedures from the specific data they operate on and instead focuses on

    74    ◾    Objective-C

    behavior. A start method, for example, in an object-oriented programming interface, may start an operation, an archive method, and a draw method, for example, might output an image. The method name does not tell which action is started, which information is saved, or which picture is drawn. These procedures may be performed differently by distinct objects.

    Methods are, therefore, a vocabulary of abstract activities. To make one of those behaviors concrete, you must associate the method with an object. This is accomplished by designating the object as the message's recipient. The process that is started, the data archived, and the rendered picture are all determined by the item you choose as the recipient.

    Methods are called via a specific receiver since they are objects (the owner of the method and the data structure the method will act on). The same procedure might be implemented differently by different receivers. As a result, various receivers might respond to the same message differently. A message's outcome can't be determined just based on the message or method name; it additionally relies on the object that receives the message.

    The messaging metaphor nicely captures the concept that actions may be abstracted from their specific implementations by separating the message (the requested behavior) from the receiver (the owner of a method that can react to the request).

    A module in Objective-C is nothing more than a file containing source code to a C programmer. A practical technique to divide a vast (or even not-so-large) program into manageable bits is to break it down into separate files. Each item may be worked on and compiled separately and then connected after the program is completed.

    Using the static storage class designator to restrict the scope of names to the files where they are declared improves source module independence. This kind of module is a file system-defined unit. It's a container for source code rather than a logical language unit. Each coder decides what gets inside the container. We don't have to use them to group logically similar pieces of the code. We may put your socks in one drawer, underwear in another, and so on, or you can use another organization system or jumble everything up.

    Object-oriented programming languages allow us to utilize file containers for your source code, but they also have a logical module called class definitions. As you would anticipate, each class is often specified in its source file. Logical modules are paired with container modules.

    In Objective-C, for example, the component of the Valve class that interacts with Pipe objects may be defined in the same file as the Pipe class, resulting in a container module for Pipe-related code and the Valve class being divided into several files. No matter how many files the source code was in, the Valve class definition would still work as a modular unit inside the program's construction. It would still be a logical module.

    Under "Processes of Abstraction," the mechanisms that make class definitions logical components of the language are addressed in depth.

    Reusability

    In Objective-C one of the main goals of object-oriented programming is to make the code you create as reusable as possible – to have it serve many various scenarios and applications – so that you don't have to re-implement something that has previously been done even if just slightly differently.

    The following elements impact reusability: how stable and bug-free the code is; how clear the documentation is; how simple and easy the programming interface is; how efficiently the code accomplishes its job; and how complete the feature set is.

    These considerations aren't limited to the object model. They are used to determine the reusability of any code, including standard C functions and class declarations. Functions that are efficient and well-documented, for example, are more reusable than those that are undocumented and unreliable.

    Nonetheless, a broad comparison reveals that class definitions favor reusable code in ways that functions do not. There are many ways to make functions more reusable, such as giving data as arguments rather than assuming particular global variables. Despite this, only a tiny portion of functions is extended beyond the purposes they were developed. In at least three ways, their reusability is constrained by design:

    • The names of functions are global; each function must have its own name (except for those declared static). This naming restriction makes it difficult to depend extensively on library code when developing a complicated system. The programming interface would be difficult to grasp and so large that significant generalizations would be challenging to express.

    In contrast, classes may share programming interfaces. When the same naming conventions are used repeatedly, a large amount of functionality is packed into a compact, easy-to-understand interface.

    • One by one, functions are chosen from a library. It is up to programmers to choose the specific functions they need.

    • On the other hand, objects are functional bundles rather than individual methods and instance variables. Users of an object-oriented library in Objective-C won't get bogged down putting together their answers to a problem since they offer integrated services.

    • Functions are usually linked to unique data structures created for a given application. Data and function interaction is an inevitable aspect of the interface. Only those who agree to utilize the same data structures as the function's arguments will find it beneficial.

    An object does not have this difficulty since it conceals its data. One of the main reasons classes is reused more readily than functions is this.

    An object's data is secured and will not be accessed by any other portion of the program. As a result, methods may rely on their reliability. They can be confident that data has not become irrational or unusable due to external access. Consequently, a data structure supplied to an object is more reliable than one passed to a function, and methods may rely on it more. As a result, reusable methods are easy to develop.

    A class may also be re-implemented to utilize a new data structure without altering its interface since an object's data is concealed. All applications that utilize the class may update to the new version without reprogramming; no source code changes are necessary.

    OOP in Objective-C ◾ 81

    In object-oriented programming, inheritance is one of the most important concepts. Inheritance in Objective-C allows us to define a class in terms of another class, making application development and maintenance easier. This also allows for the reuse of code functionality and a quick implementation time.

    Instead of developing entirely new data members and member functions when creating a class, the programmer can specify that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. The old class is the base class, while the new class is the derived class.

    The concept of inheritance establishes a connection – for instance, mammal IS-A animal, dog IS-A mammal, dog IS-A animal, etc.

    ---

    BASE AND DERIVED CLASSES

    Objective-C only supports multilevel inheritance, which means that it may have just one base class but supports multilevel inheritance. All Objective-C classes are derived from the superclass NSObject.

    @interface derivedclass: baseclass

    Consider the following for a base class Person and its derived class Employee:

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    @interface Person : NSObject {
       NSString *personName;
       NSInteger personAge;
    }

    - (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age;
    - (void)print;

    @end

    @implementation Person

    - (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age {
       personName = name;
       personAge = age;

       return self;
    }

    - (void)print {
       NSLog(@"The Name is: %@", personName);
       NSLog(@"The Age is: %ld", personAge);
    }

    @end

    @interface Employee : Person {
       NSString *employeeEducation;

Only how the subclass varies from the superclass is specified in the subclass specification; everything else is assumed to be the same.

    Definitions of Subclass

    A subclass may update the definition it inherits from its superclass in three ways.

    It may add additional methods and instance variables to the class definition it inherits. The most typical motivation for creating a subclass is to solve a problem. Subclasses always add additional methods and instance variables if the methods demand it.

    Replacing an existing method in Objective-C with a new one might change the behavior it inherits. This is accomplished by simply creating a new method with the same name as an inherited one. The new version takes precedence over the previous one. (The inherited method remains valid for the class that defined it and any classes that inherit it.)

    It may improve or expand the behavior it inherits by replacing an existing method with a new one, but it keeps the old one by integrating it into the new one. In the body of the new method, a subclass sends a message to execute the old version. Each class in an inheritance chain may influence the behavior of a method in some way. Class D, for example, may override a method specified in class C and integrate C's version, while C's version incorporates a version declared in the root class, as shown in Figure.

    Subclasses tend to round out the definition of a superclass, making it more particular and specialized. Instead of subtracting code, they add and occasionally change it. It's worth noting that methods and instance variables can't be deleted or overridden in most cases.

    DYNAMISM

    The issue of how much memory a program will take was once resolved when the source code was built and linked. As soon as the program begins, it is given the entire RAM it would ever need. This memory could not be expanded or contracted.

    In hindsight, it's clear that this was a significant constraint. It restricted how programs are built and what a program could perform. It limited not just the programming approach but also the design. The development of methods like malloc, which dynamically allocates memory while a program runs, opened up previously unimaginable possibilities.

    Compile-time and link-time limitations are restrictive because they require decisions based on information discovered in the programmer's source code rather than information gained from the user as the program runs.

    The interface of an object includes method names. When a message instructs an object to complete a task, the message specifies the method the object should use. Because several objects might have methods with the same name, a message's meaning is understood concerning the object that receives it. The same message might trigger two different methods when delivered to two different objects.

    Polymorphism's key advantage is that it simplifies the programming interface. It enables the establishment of conventions that are reused from class to class. Rather than establishing a new name for each new function, you add to a program. We may reuse existing names. Separate from the classes that implement them, the programming interface may be defined as a collection of abstract behaviors.

    Polymorphism is defined as having several forms. Polymorphism often happens when a hierarchy of classes is connected via inheritance.

    Because of Objective-C polymorphism, a call to a member function will run a different code depending on the kind of object that invokes the function.

    Consider the following scenario: we have a class Shape that offers the fundamental interface for all forms. The shape is the foundation class from which squares and rectangles are formed.

    We have the function printArea, which will display information about the OOP feature polymorphism.

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    @interface Shape : NSObject {
       CGFloat area;
    }

    POSING IN OBJECTIVE-C

    Before discussing Posing in Objective-C, it's important to note that posing
    was declared deprecated in Mac OS X 10.5 and is no longer accessible for
    use. Those who are unconcerned about the deprecated methods can there-
    fore skip this chapter.

    A class in Objective-C can completely replace another class in a pro-
    gram. It is argued that the replacing class "poses as" the target class.
    Instead, the posing class receives all messages sent to the target class in
    versions that allow posing.

    As shown above, the poseAsClass method in NSObject allows us to
    replace the existing class.

    POSING RESTRICTIONS

    • Only one of a class's direct or indirect superclasses is used.

    • No new instance variables are defined in the posing class not present
    in the target class (though it may define or override methods).

    • Before the posing, the target class may not have received any messages.

    • A posing class can use super to call overridden methods, integrating
    the target class's implementation.

    • A posing class in Objective-C can override methods defined in
    categories.

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    @interface MyString : NSString

    @end

    @implementation MyString

    - (NSString *)stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:(NSString *)target
    withString:(NSString *)replacement {
       NSLog(@"Target string: %@", target);
       NSLog(@"Replacement string: %@", replacement);
    }

    @end

    int main() {
       NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
       [MyString poseAsClass:[NSString class]];
       NSString *string = @"Test";
       [string stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"a" withString:@"c"];

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:

    ```objective-c
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
        Sample_Class *sample_Class = [[Sample_Class alloc] init];

        NSLog(@"ExternalID: %@", [sample_Class getExternalID]);
        [pool drain];
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    The internal ID is not returned explicitly in the preceding case. We delete the `UNIQUEINTERNALKEY` and simply make the remaining value available to the `getExternalID` function.

    The above example only employs a string operation, but it may include numerous features such as encryption and decryption.

    PROTOCOLS IN OBJECTIVE-C

    Objective-C allows us to design protocols that specify the techniques utilized in a specific context. Protocols are implemented in protocol-conforming classes.

    A network URL handling class, for example, will have a protocol containing methods such as the `processCompleted` delegate method, which informs the caller class once the network URL fetching operation is complete.

    ```objective-c
    @protocol ProtocolName
    @required
    // list of the required methods
    @optional
    // list of the optional methods
    @end
    ```

    The methods with the keyword `@required` are implemented in the classes that adhere to the protocol, whereas the methods with the keyword `@optional` are optional.
    Here is the syntax:

    ```objective-c
    @interface MyClass : NSObject <MyProtocol>
    .....
    @end
    ```

    This implies that any instance of `MyClass` will react not just to the methods stated directly in the interface but also to the methods needed in `MyProtocol`. There is no need to redeclare the protocol methods in the class interface; simply implementing the protocol suffices.

    If you want a class to use several protocols, describe them as a comma-separated list. We have a delegate object that retains the reference to the protocol-implementing calling object.

    @end

    @interface PrintClass : NSObject {

    - (void) setDelegate:(id)newDelegate;

    @implementation PrintClass
    - (void)printDetails {
        NSLog(@"Printing Details");
        [delegate processCompleted];
    }

    - (void) setDelegate:(id)newDelegate {
        delegate = newDelegate;
    }
    @end

    - (void)startAction;

    @implementation Sample_Class
    - (void)startAction {
        PrintClass *printClass = [[PrintClass alloc] init];

        [printClass printDetails];
    }

    - (void)processCompleted {
        NSLog(@"The Printing Process Completed");
    }
    @end

    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

        [sampleClass startAction];
        [pool drain];
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    ---

    We saw how the delegate methods are called and performed in the preceding example. It begins with `startAction`, and after the process is finished, the delegate method `processCompleted` is called to notify the action is finished.

    We shall never have a program developed without a delegate in any iOS or Mac app. As a result, we must understand how delegates are used. To minimize memory leaks, delegate objects should utilize the `unsafe_unretained` property type.

    **DYNAMIC BINDING IN OBJECTIVE-C**

    Dynamic binding decides which method to call at runtime rather than compile time. Late binding is another term for dynamic binding. All methods in Objective-C are dynamically resolved at runtime. Both methods namely the selector and the receiving object decide the specific code run.

    Polymorphism is enabled through dynamic binding. Consider the following set of objects: Rectangle and Square. A `printArea` method is implemented differently for each object.

    **CLASS CLUSTERS**

    The foundation framework makes considerable use of class clusters as a design pattern. A collection of private concrete subclasses is grouped under a class cluster's public abstract superclass. This collection of classes simplifies an object-oriented framework's publicly visible design without decreasing its functional richness. The abstract factory design pattern in Objective-C is used to create class clusters.

    Instead of developing many classes for comparable tasks, we construct a single class that will handle everything depending on the input value.

    In NSNumber, for example, there are several clusters of classes such as char, int, bool, and so on. We combine them all into a single class that handles all of the related actions in one place. The value of these basic types is wrapped into objects by NSNumber.

    **WHAT EXACTLY IS A COMPOSITE OBJECT?**

    We build a composite object by embedding a private cluster object in an object of our design. This composite object in Objective-C can rely on the cluster object for basic functionality, intercepting messages that it wishes to handle in a certain way. This approach decreases the amount of code we must build and allows us to use the Foundation Framework's proven functionality.

    Composite object.

    **102    ◾    Objective-C**

    The composite object in Objective-C must declare itself to be a subclass of the cluster's abstract superclass. It must override the primitive methods of the superclass as a subclass. It can also override derived methods, although this isn't required because the derived methods make their way via the primitive ones in Objective-C.

    The count method of NSArray class is an example; the implementation of a method overridden by the intervening object might be as basic as

    - (unsigned)count {
       return [embedded_Object count];
    }

    **An Example of a Composite Object**

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThe Class A object's memory life cycle is shown in the diagram above.  \nAs you can see, the retain count in Objective-C is shown under the object;  \nwhen the retain count reaches 0, the item is liberated, and its memory is  \nreallocated for other objects to utilize.\n\nOOP in Objective-C    ◾    109\n\nThe  alloc/init  function  in  NSObject  is  used  to  construct  the  class  A \n\nobject. The number of retains is now 1.\n\nClass B now keeps Class A's object, and Class A's object now has a retain \n\ncount of two.\n\nThe item is then copied by Class C. It is now constructed as a new instance \nof Class A, with the same instance variables. The retain count is 1 instead of the \noriginal object's retain count. The dotted line in the diagram represents this.\n\nClass  C  uses  the  release  method  to  release  the  copied  object,  which \n\ncauses the keep count to drop to zero and the item to be destroyed.\n\nThe keep count for the original Class A Object is two, and it must be \nreleased twice before it may be destroyed. This is accomplished using Class \nA and Class B release statements to set the keep count to 1 and 0, respec-\ntively. The thing is finally destroyed.\n\nBasic MRR Rules\n\n•  We own whatever we make: A method that starts with \"alloc,\" \"new,\" \n\n\"copy,\" or \"mutableCopy\" is used to construct an object.\n\n•  We may use retained to acquire ownership of an object: A received \nobject is usually guaranteed to stay valid inside the method in which \nit was received. That method may also return the object to its invoker \nsecurely. Retain is used in two scenarios.\n\n•  We use an accessor method or an init method to gain ownership \n\nof an object we wish to save as a property value.\n\n•  To avoid the invalidation of an object as a result of another action.\n\n•  When we no longer need something, we must give up ownership of \nit: A release message or an autorelease message is used to relinquish \ncontrol of an item.

It  \nis  an  object-oriented  language.  Thus,  individuals  with  experience  with  \nobject-oriented programming languages will find it simple.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION AND INTERFACE  \n\nIn Objective-C, the file where the class is declared is referred to as the inter-\nface file, and the file where the class is defined as the implementation file.\n\nA basic interface file, MyExample.h, might look like this:\n\n@interface MyClass:NSObject { \n   // class-variable declared\n}\n\n// class-properties declared\n// class-methods and instance-methods declared \n@end\n\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003357506-3\n\n113\n\n \n\n114    ◾    Objective-C  \n\nThe implementation file MyExample.m might look like this:\n\n@implementation MyClass\n   // class-methods defined\n@end  \n\nOBJECT CREATION  \n\nThe following is how objects are created:\n\nMyExample *objectName = [[MyClass alloc]init] ;  \n\nMETHODS  \n\nThe following method is declared in Objective-C:\n\n-(returnType)method_Name:(type_Name) variable1 :(type_\nName)variable2;\n\nExample:\n\n-(void)calculateAreaForRectangleWithLength:(CGfl\noat)length\nandBreadth:(CGfloat)breadth;\n\nWe may be wondering what the andBreadth string is for; it's an optional \nstring that helps us read and comprehend the method more readily, espe-\ncially when we call it. We use the following line to call this function in the \nsame class:\n\n[self calculateAreaForRectangleWithLength:40 \nandBreadth:30];\n\nAs previously stated, the usage of andBreadth aids us in understanding \nthat breadth is 20. Self is used to indicate that the method is a class method.\n\nClass Methods  \n\nClass methods are accessed without first constructing a class object. They \nare not linked with any variables or objects. An example is shown below.\n\n+(void)simpleClass_Method;\n\n\nThese  are  accessed  by  using  the  class  name  (let's  say  MyExample)  as\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

    An iOS emulator comprises two sorts of devices: iPhones and iPads in various versions. iPhone models include the iPhone (standard), iPhone Retina, and iPhone 5. The iPad comes in two varieties: iPad and iPad Retina.

    We may replicate the location in an iOS simulator to experiment with the app's latitude and longitude effects. In the simulator, we can also mimic memory warnings and in-call status. The simulator can be used for most purposes, although it cannot test device functions such as the accelerometer. As a result, we may always require an iOS device to test all application situations thoroughly.

    FIRST iPHONE APPLICATION

    Developing the First App:

    We'll make a simple single-view application (a blank App) to run on the iOS simulator.

    The procedures are as follows.

    • Step 1: Launch Xcode and choose to Create a new Xcode project.

    • Step 2: Click on Single View Application.

    • Step 3: Enter the product name, the application name, the organization name, and finally, the corporate identification.

    • Step 4: Ensure that Use Automatic Reference Counting is enabled to automatically release the resources allocated when they are no longer needed. Next, click.

    Interface and API ◾ 119

    • Step 5: Choose the project directory and click Create.

    • Step 6: We will be able to choose between supported orientations and build and release options. There is a field deployment goal: the device version we want to support; let's say we choose 4.3, the minimum deployment target allowed right now. These are not necessary, and we may concentrate on executing the program for the time being.

    • Step 7: Now, pick the iPhone simulator from the drop-down beside the Run button and press the Run button.

    • Step 8: We have now successfully run our first application.

    Let's modify the backdrop color to get started with the interface builder. Choose ViewController.xib. Change the color of the backdrop on the right side and run.

    **Step 15:** Now, start the application by clicking the run button.

    **Step 16:** Now press the button.

    **Step 17:** The action on the button has updated the label that we established.

    **Step 18:** From the above example, IBOutlet establishes a reference to the UIElement (here for the UILabel). Similarly, the IBAction associates the UIButton with a method invoked at the event touch-up inside.

    **Step 19:** We may experiment with actions by selecting different events as we create them.

    **DELEGATES IN iOS**

    **Delegation example:**

    Assume that object A requests an action from object B. Object A should be aware that B has completed the task and take the appropriate action when the activity is finished. This is accomplished with the assistance of delegates.

    The main principles in the preceding example are:

    - B's delegate object is A.
    - A will be a reference for B.
    - B's delegate methods will be implemented by A.
    - B will inform A via delegate techniques.

    Here is the text with formatting corrected and any spelling or structural issues addressed:

    ---

    In ARC, we do not need to employ release and retain. Therefore, all of its associated objects will be freed when the view controller is deleted. Similarly, sub-objects of any object are released when their parent object is released. Note that the whole class will not be released if other classes hold a strong reference to an object of a class. Therefore, poor qualities are advised for delegates.

    MEMORY MANAGEMENT TOOLS

    With the use of Xcode instrumentation, memory utilization is analyzed. It has features like Activity Monitor, Allocations, Leaks, and Zombies.


    Interface and API    ◾    171

    ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR MEMORY ALLOCATIONS

    • Step 1: Launch an existing application.

    • Step 2: Select Product and then Profile.

    • Step 3: On the following page, pick Allocations and then Profile.

    • Step 4: We'll look at memory allocation for various objects.

    • Step 5: We can switch between view controllers to see if the memory is appropriately released.

    • Step 6: Similarly, we may utilize Activity Monitor instead of Allocations to observe the total Memory assigned to the application.

    • Step 7: We can access our memory use and pinpoint any leaks using these tools.

    APPLICATION DEBUGGING IN iOS

    While developing an application, we may make mistakes that lead to many faults. We must debug the program to correct these issues or flaws.

    CHOOSING A DEBUGGER

    Xcode includes two debuggers, notably GDB and LLDB. GDB is the default debugger type. LLDB is a debugger included in the open-source LLVM compiler project. The "edit active schemes" option allows you to modify the debugger.

    HOW TO LOCATE CODING ERRORS

    We must construct your application and compile the code to identify coding-related issues. If the code includes errors, the compiler will show all messages, errors, warnings, and potential causes.

    Click Product followed by Analyze to spot possible flaws in an application.

    Breakpoints enable us to determine the various states of our application's objects, facilitating the identification of several problems, including logical errors. Simply clicking on the line number will establish a breakpoint. To remove a breakpoint, click and drag it out of the document.

    172    ◾    Objective-C

    When we launch the program and press the playVideo button, it will halt at the line number where we put the breakpoint. It allows users to assess the current condition of the application when the breakpoint is hit. It is simple to determine which thread triggered the breakpoint. You can see objects like self, sender, and so on down the bottom, which carry the values of the relevant objects, and we can expand some of these objects to see their state.

    Click the continue button (leftmost button) to proceed with the application.

    Some Google services in Objective-C, such as Drive, Gmail, and many more, have public APIs used to build apps that enable users to interact with their data in these services. To use these services, applications must implement one of the OAuth 2.0 client flows to gain user approval and access tokens that provide access to the APIs.

    To obtain access tokens for the signed-in user, we may use the Google Sign-In library, which implements the OAuth 2.0 procedure.

    Before we begin
    We must first finish the basic Google Sign-In integration.

    1. Determine which scopes have been granted: Before calling a Google API, use the `grantedScopes` property of `GIDGoogleUser` to see which scopes have been given to our app.

    ```objective-c
    NSString *driveScope = @"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly";

    // Check if user has granted Drive scope
    if (![user.grantedScopes containsObject:driveScope]) {
      // request the additional drive scope
    }
    ```

    Whether or not the user has authorized a specific scope, we may need to request an additional scope to support a specific interaction.

    2. Ask for extra scopes: If we need to request more scopes, use the `addScopes:presentingViewController:callback` or `addScopes:presentingWindow:callback` methods to ask the user to allow our app to be more accessible.

    To request read-only access to a user's Drive via Objective-C, for example:

    ```objective-c
    NSArray *additionalScopes = @[ @"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly" ];
    [GIDSignIn.sharedInstance addScopes:additionalScopes
               presentingViewController:self
               callback:^(GIDGoogleUser * _Nullable user,
                                          NSError * _Nullable error) {
        if (error) { return; }
        if (user == nil) { return; }

        // Check if the user granted access to the scopes we requested.
    }];
    ```

    3. Make an API call using new tokens: Wrap your Google API requests in a `doWithFreshTokens:` block to guarantee that they always have valid access tokens.

The creation of effects in general and the modification of objects and object references in particular rarely occurs, as transparently as feasible to other parts of the code and as far away from transformational code as practicable.\n\nData and behavior are brought together, and access modifiers are uti-\nlized to enable only reasonable dependencies wherever feasible.

    On the one hand, this approach develops positive characteristics, such as local understandability and modular composability. On the other hand, its typically imperative emphasis hinders these positive characteristics. In addition, mutable objects are not easily employed safely in a parallel setting, and pure object orientation is sometimes too cumbersome for tiny applications. In contrast, the functional method is distinguished by its lightweight characteristics and its restriction and isolation of effects.

    The functional method provides fewer tools for organizing software systems, abstracting data, and eliminating unwanted dependencies. In contrast, the object-oriented method provides effective replies with its associated objects and properties.

    Therefore, the advantages of one strategy are the disadvantages of the other. Combining both strategies combines their strengths and compensates for their respective deficiencies. We get the potential benefits of both without their downsides. The amount to which this promise is fulfilled is also contingent on the language used.

    We wonder what the Cocoa Target-Action paradigm might look like if it were designed with Functional Programming in mind. The last consideration is that we implemented block methods as read-only attributes. What if method properties were read/write? At runtime, we might write `NSString.plus = <something else>` for the whole class or for a particular instance.

    WRITE OBJECTIVE-C CODE

    If we have never developed for iOS or Mac OS X, we must familiarize ourselves with Objective-C, the major programming language. Objective-C is not a difficult programming language, and once we get familiar with it, we will recognize its beauty. The Objective-C programming language permits complex object-oriented programming. It expands the conventional ANSI C programming language by adding syntax for class and method definitions. Additionally, it encourages the dynamic expansion of classes and interfaces, which any class may adopt.

    If we are acquainted with ANSI C, the material below should assist you in learning the fundamental syntax of Objective-C. And if we've coded in other object-oriented languages, we'll discover that Objective-C supports

    182    ◾    Objective-C

    many conventional object-oriented principles, like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

    The Objective-C Programming Language provides a comprehensive explanation of the Objective-C language.

    Objective-C language is the superset of the C programming language.
    The Objective-C programming language defines a syntax for establishing classes and methods, invoking object methods, dynamically extending classes, and developing problem-specific programming interfaces. Being a superset of the C programming language, Objective-C offers the same syntax as C. We have access to all the standard components, including basic types (int, float, etc.), structures, functions, pointers, and control-flow constructs like if…else and for expressions. In addition, we have access to the standard C library functions, such as those defined in stdlib.h and stdio.h.

    Objective-C extends ANSI C with the following syntax and features:

    • Introduction of new classes

    • Class and instance methods

    The text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Objective-C as a Superset of C**\n\nExplain how Objective-C extends ANSI C with the addition of object-oriented features, while maintaining compatibility with standard C syntax and libraries. Use specific examples from the text to demonstrate your understanding of how Objective-C supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the core C functionality and the added object-oriented capabilities, and provide at least two concrete examples from the text to support your explanation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Objective-C Syntax for Class and Method Definitions**\n\nGiven the following Objective-C code snippet: \n\n@interface MyClass \n- (void)myMethod; \n@end \n\n@implementation MyClass \n- (void)myMethod { \n    NSLog("Hello, world!"); \n} \n@end \n\n\nUsing the information provided in the text, explain the role of the @interface and @implementation blocks in Objective-C. Specifically, address:\n1. How these blocks define the interface and implementation of a class.\n2. The purpose of the method declaration ("- (void)myMethod;") versus the method definition ("- (void)myMethod { ... } ").\n3. Why Objective-C uses this particular syntax for class definitions compared to other object-oriented languages.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference concepts from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of Objective-C''s class and method structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Objective-C Programming Concepts**\n\nThe text mentions that Objective-C is a superset of C, allowing access to all standard C components while adding object-oriented features.

Define the interface for this Calculator class, including method declarations for each operation. \n2. Implement the methods in the @implementation block, ensuring proper use of Objective-C syntax and conventions. \n3. Explain how this implementation demonstrates the principles of encapsulation, inheritance (if applicable), and polymorphism (if applicable) as discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include working Objective-C code that adheres to the syntax described in the text, and your explanation must directly reference concepts from the text to demonstrate understanding of object-oriented programming principles in Objective-C.'

    • Calling a method (called messaging)

    • Declaration of attributes (and automatic synthesizing of accessor methods from them)

    • Static and dynamic typing

    • Blocks are enclosed code portions and may be executed at any moment

    • Protocols and categories as extensions to the fundamental language

    Don't worry if we're unfamiliar with these Objective-C features right now. As we continue reading this essay, you will discover more about them. If we are procedural programmers new to object-oriented notions, it may be helpful to see an object as a structure with related methods. This concept is not too distant from the truth, especially regarding runtime implementation.

    In addition to offering the majority of abstractions and methods available in other object-oriented programming languages, Objective-C is a highly dynamic programming language, which is its most significant feature. It is dynamic in that it allows the behavior of an application to be decided as it is running (i.e., during runtime) as opposed to being fixed when the application is developed. Thus, the dynamic nature of Objective-C liberates a program from limitations imposed during compilation and linking; it pushes the majority of symbol resolution responsibilities to runtime when the user is in control.

    CLASSES AND OBJECTS

    As with most other object-oriented programming languages, Objective-C classes enable data encapsulation and specify the operations performed on that data. An object is a class's instance during runtime. It holds a copy of the instance variables specified by its class and pointers to the class's methods. An object is created in a two-step method known as allocation and initialization.

    The text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr.

    The Objective-C definition of a class involves two independent components: the interface and the implementation. The interface section includes the class declaration and specifies the class's public interface. Like C, we create header and source files to segregate public declarations from implementation details. (Other declarations are included in the implementation file if they are part of the programmatic interfaces but are intended to be private.) The filename extensions for these files are mentioned in the table below.

    Extension | Source Type
    ---------|-----------
    .h      | Files with headers. Header files include declarations for classes, types, functions, and constants.
    .m      | Files for implementation. This extension indicates that the file contains both Objective-C and C code. It is also known as a source file.
    .mm     | Files for implementation. This extension allows C++ code to be included in Objective-C and C code implementation files. Use this extension only if our Objective-C code refers to C++ classes or features.

    When including header files in our source code, add a pound import (#import) directive as one of the first lines in a header or source file; an #import directive is similar to C's #include directive, but it ensures that the same file is never included more than once. Import the framework's umbrella header file in Objective-C, which has the same name as the framework, if we need to import most or all of the framework's header files. The following is the syntax for importing the (fictitious) Gizmo framework's header files:

    ```objective-c
    #import <Gizmo/Gizmo.h>
    ```

    The syntax for declaring a class called MyClass in Objective-C, which inherits from the base (or root) class, NSObject, is shown below. (A root class is one from which all other classes directly or indirectly derive.) The @interface compiler directive begins the class definition and concludes with the @end directive. The name of the parent class comes after the class name (and is separated by a colon). A class in Objective-C can only have one parent.

    Declaration of members and method.

    The initial declaration has an asterisk (*). Object references in Objective-C must always be pointers. Don't be concerned if this criterion does not make total sense to us. We don't have to be a pointer specialists to start Objective-C programming. Just remember to insert an asterisk in front of the variable names for statically typed object declarations. The id type implies a pointer.

    METHODS AND COMMUNICATION

    If we are new to object-oriented programming, it may be helpful to conceive of a method as an object-specific function. We invoke its method by sending a message to, or messaging, an object. In Objective-C, there are two types of methods: instance methods and class methods.

    A method whose execution is restricted to a specific instance of a class is an instance method. In other words, we must construct an instance of the class before using an instance method. Instance methods are the most prevalent method type.

    The execution of a class method is limited to the method's class. An object instance doesn't need to be the recipient of a message.

    The method's declaration includes the method type identifier, a return type, one or more signature keywords, and information on the argument type and name. Here is the method declaration for insertObject:atIndex: instance.

    Declaration of object.

    A minus sign precedes the declaration of instance methods (−), whereas class methods are indicated by a plus sign (+). The section titled "Class Methods" describes class methods in greater detail.

    The actual name of a method (insertObject:atIndex:) is the concatenation of all signature keywords, including colons. The colon characters indicate that a parameter is present. In the preceding illustration, the method accepts two parameters. If a method has no parameters, the colon following the first and only signature keyword is omitted.

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:

    ---

    When calling a method, a message is sent to the object that implements the method. (Although "sending a message" is commonly used as a synonym for "calling a method," the actual sending is performed by the Objective-C runtime.) A message comprises the method's name and the parameter information required (properly conforming to type). All messages sent to an object are dispatched dynamically, making the polymorphic behavior of Objective-C classes possible. (Polymorphism refers to the capacity of various object types to respond to the same message.) Occasionally, the method invoked is implemented by a superclass of the receiving object's class.

    ---

    Functional Programming    ◾    187

    For the runtime to dispatch a message, a message expression is necessary. A message expression encloses the message (along with any necessary parameters) within brackets ([and]) and, just inside the leftmost bracket, the object receiving the message. For instance, the following syntax is used to send the insertObject:atIndex: message to an object held by the myArray variable:

    [myArray insertObject:anObject atIndex:0];

    To avoid declaring multiple local variables to store interim results, we can nest message expressions in Objective-C. Each expression's return value is used as a parameter or as the receiving object of another message. To retrieve the values, we could, for instance, replace any of the variables used in the previous example with messages. Consequently, if we had another object named myAppObject with methods for accessing the array object and the object to insert into the array, you could have written the preceding example as follows:

    For invoking accessor methods, Objective-C additionally supports a dot-notation syntax. Accessor methods get and set an object's state, which is critical to encapsulation, a fundamental aspect of all objects. Objects conceal or encapsulate their state and provide a standard interface for all instances to access that data. We may rewrite the preceding example using dot-notation syntax as follows:

    [myAppObject.theArray insertObject:myAppObject.objectToInsert atIndex:0];

    For assignment, we may also use dot-notation syntax:

    myAppObject.theArray = aNewArray;

    This is merely another way of saying [myAppObject setTheArray: aNewArray];. A reference to a dynamically typed object (object of type id) is not used in a dot-notation expression.

    We've already used dot syntax to assign a variable in our First iOS App:

    self.user_Name = self.textField.text;

    CLASS METHODS

    Even though the preceding examples send messages to an instance of a class, it is also possible to send messages to the class itself. (A class is a runtime-generated object of type Class.) When communicating with a class, the method you specify must be a class method rather than an instance method. Class methods in C++ are comparable to static class methods.

    Class methods are frequently used as factory methods to create new class instances or to access shared information associated with the class. The syntax for a class method declaration is identical to that of an instance method, except that the method type identifier is preceded by a plus sign (+) instead of a minus sign (−).

    Following is an example of using a class method as a factory method for a class. In this instance, the array method is a class method on the NSArray and NSMutableArray classes that allocates, initializes, and returns a new class instance.

    NSMutableArray *myArray = nil;  // nil is essentially same as NULL

    Properties and Accessor Methods Are Declared

    The property is some data encapsulated or stored by an object in the broadest sense. It is either an attribute or a relationship to one or more other objects, such as a name or a color. The class of an object defines an interface that allows users of its objects to retrieve and modify the values of encapsulated properties. The methods that carry out these operations are referred to as accessor methods.

    There are two categories of accessor methods, each of which must adhere to a naming convention. The "getter" accessor method that returns a property's value has the same name as the property. A "setter" accessor method has the form setPropertyName:, with the first letter of the property name capitalized. Properly named accessor methods are essential to several Cocoa and Cocoa Touch framework technologies, including key-value coding (KVC), a mechanism for indirectly accessing an object's properties via their names.

    Functional Programming ◾ 189

    Declared properties provide a notational convenience for the declaration and implementation of accessor methods in Objective-C. In our First iOS App, the user_Name property was declared:

    @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *user_Name;

    Declared properties avoid the need to implement getter and setter methods for each accessible property in the class. Instead, we use the property declaration to indicate the desired behavior. The compiler can then generate (or synthesis) real getter and setter methods based on that declaration. Declared properties decrease the amount of boilerplate code we have to write, making our code clearer and less prone to errors. To acquire and set items of an object's state, use defined properties or accessor methods.

    In our class interface, we put property declarations with method declarations. Public properties are declared in the class header files, whereas private properties are declared in a class extension in the source file. Controller objects, such as delegates and view controllers, should typically have private properties.

    The @property compiler directive is used in the basic property declaration, followed by the type information and the property name. Custom options can describe how the accessor methods operate, whether the property is a weak reference and whether it is read-only. Following the @property directive, the alternatives are in parentheses.

    The lines of code below demonstrate a few additional property declarations:

    @property (copy) MyModelObject *theObject;  // Copy object during assignment.
    @property (readonly) NSView *rootView;   // Declare only getter method.
    @property (weak) id delegate;         // Declare delegate as weak reference

    The compiler automatically synthesizes declared properties. When a property is synthesized, it generates accessor methods for it and a private instance variable that "backs" the property. The name of the instance variable is the same as the property's name but with an underscore prefix (_). In methods for object initialization and deallocation, our App should directly access an instance variable (rather than its property).


    190    ◾    Objective-C

    We can override auto synthesis and explicitly synthesize a property to give an instance variable a new name. In the class implementation, use the @synthesize compiler directive to instruct the compiler to build the accessor methods and the appropriately named instance variable.† As an example:

    @synthesize enabled = _isEnabled;

    In addition, when we declare a property, we may give custom names for the accessor methods, which are commonly used to force the getter methods of Boolean properties to have a standard form, as illustrated here:

    @property (assign, getter=isEnabled) BOOL enabled; // Assign the new value, change name of getter method

    A block in Objective-C is an object that encapsulates a work unit or code segment that may be performed at any moment. Essentially, they are anonymous, portable functions that may be sent as inputs to methods and functions or returned from methods and functions. Blocks contain typed argument lists and may have an inferred or stated return type. Additionally, we may assign a block to a variable and then call it like we would a function.

    A caret (^) is used to denote blocks syntactically. There are additional, well-known syntax norms for block arguments, return values, and body (the executed code). The following diagram illustrates the syntax for assigning a block to a variable.

    Blocks.

    † Write Objective-C Code

    Functional Programming ◾ 191

    The block variable may then be accessed as if it were a function:

    int result = myBlock(4); // result 28

    A block shares local lexical scope info. If you implement a method and that method specifies a block, the block has access to the method's local variables and arguments (including stack variables) and functions and global variables, including instance variables. If a variable is defined with the __block modifier, its value is modified inside the block. As long as there is a reference to the block, the local variables continue even after the method or function inside the block has returned and its local scope has been deleted.

    As arguments of a method or function, blocks might act as callbacks. When called, the method or function does some work and, at the proper times, calls back to the code that initiated it through the block to seek further information or acquire program-specific behavior. Blocks make it possible for the caller to give the callback code at invocation. Instead of encapsulating the necessary data in a "context" structure, blocks collect data from the same lexical scope as the host method or function. As the block code does not need to be implemented in a distinct method or function, the implementation code may be simplified and made easy to comprehend.

    Many Objective-C framework methods use block arguments. For instance, the Foundation framework's NSNotificationCenter class specifies the following function with a block parameter:

    - (id)addObserverForName:(NSString *)name object:(id)obj queue:(NSOperationQueue *)queue usingBlock:(void (^)(NSNotification *note))block

    This technique installs a notification center observer (notifications are discussed in Streamline our App with Design Patterns). When a notice with the specified name is posted, the block is called to handle it.

    ```objc
    opQ = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:@"CustomOperationCompleted"

    **PROTOCOLS AND CATEGORIES**

    A protocol specifies methods that may be implemented by any class, even if those classes do not share a superclass. Protocol methods create behavior that is agnostic to specific classes. Protocols merely specify an interface that other classes must implement. When your class implements a protocol's methods, it is said to conform to that protocol.

    A protocol specifies a set of methods that forms a contract between objects without needing them to be instances of a specific class. This contract allows these items to communicate with one another. One object wants to inform another object about the events it is experiencing, or it may seek guidance on these occurrences.

    The UIApplication class implements an application's needed functionality. Instead of requiring you to subclass UIApplication to get basic messages on the current status of the application, the UIApplication class provides these notifications by invoking particular methods of the delegate object it has allocated. An object that implements the UIApplicationDelegate protocol's methods may receive these alerts and respond appropriately.

    In the interface block, you indicate that your class adheres to or adopts a protocol by enclosing the protocol's name in angle brackets (<…>) following the name of the class from which our class inherits. In our First iOS App, you adopted the UITextFieldDelegate protocol in the following line of code:

    @interface HelloEveryoneViewController : UIViewController <UITextFieldDelegate> {

    We are not required to declare the protocol methods that we implement.
    A protocol's declaration resembles that of a class interface, with the distinction that protocols do not have a parent class and do not have instance variables (although they can declare properties). The following is a basic protocol declaration with only one method:

    @protocol MyProtocol
    - (void)myProtocolMethod;
    @end

    Adopting a protocol for many delegate protocols is as simple as implementing the techniques described by that protocol. Some protocols need us to say that you support the protocol explicitly, and protocols might have both required and optional methods.

    When we start looking through the header files of the Objective-C frameworks, we'll come across something like this:

    @interface NSDate (NSDateCreation)

    This line defines a category by surrounding the category's name in parentheses, per syntax standard. A category is an Objective-C language feature that allows us to expand the interface of a class without subclassing. The category's methods become part of the class type (within the program's scope) and are inherited by all subclasses of the class. We may send a message to any class instance (or its subclasses) to activate a category-defined method.

    Categories are used to organize similar method declarations inside a header file. Even distinct category definitions are included in separate header files. These strategies are used throughout the frameworks' header files for clarity.

When a message is sent to a super, the  \nruntime first searches for the method implementation in the superclass.\n\nBoth self and super is mostly used for transmitting messages. When the  \nself class implements the method to call, we send a message to the self. For  \ninstance:\n\n[self doSomeWork];\n\nIn dot notation, the self is also called the accessor method created by a  \ndefined property. As an example:\n\nNSString *theName = self.name;\n\nMessages to super are frequently sent in overrides (reimplementations)  \nof methods inherited from a superclass. The method invoked in this sce-\nnario has the same signature as the method overwritten.\n\nCREATE THE VIDEO App\n\nCreate the code for an introductory video player App.\n\nSet the App's Audio Behavior\n\nAt the app level, the audio session manages audio behavior.

It must be deal-\nlocated when the object is no longer needed so that our application utilizes \nmemory as effectively as possible. To prevent memory leaks and references \nto nonexistent objects, it is essential to comprehend Objective-memory C's \nmanagement environment.\n\nUnlike  C#,  Objective-C  does  not  employ  trash  collection.  Instead,  it \nemploys  a  reference-counting  environment  that  monitors  the  number \nof  instances  of  an  object.  As  long  as  at  least  one  reference  to  the  object \nexists, the Objective-C runtime guarantees that the object is in memory. \nNevertheless, if there are no longer any references to the object, the run-\ntime is permitted to release it and utilize the memory for something else. \nIf we attempt to access an object after it has been released, your application \nmay probably crash.\n\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003357506-5\n\n207\n\n\n208    ◾    Objective-C\n\nIn Objective-C, there are two mutually incompatible methods for man-\n\naging object references:\n\n•  Send ways to manually add or reduce the number of references to an \n\nobject.\n\n•  Allow the new automated reference counting (ARC) mechanism in \n\nXcode 4.2 (and later) to perform the job for you.\n\n•  Although ARC is the recommended method for managing memory \nin new programs, it is still vital to understand what is going on below \nthe hood. The first section of this chapter demonstrates how to man-\nually track object references, followed by a discussion of the practical \nramifications of ARC.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Memory Management in Objective-C**\n\nExplain how Objective-C manages memory differently from C# and what the implications are for developers when using manual reference counting versus ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).\n- **Step 1**: Compare and contrast the memory management models of C# and Objective-C.\n- **Step 2**: Describe the role of reference counting in Objective-C and how it prevents memory leaks.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using manual reference counting versus ARC, considering the context of modern software development practices.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the two models and provide a balanced analysis of their practical implications.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Manual Reference Counting in Objective-C**\n\nGiven the following code snippet, manually manage the memory using reference counting principles:}\n\n// Create an object\nNSNumber *number = [[NSNumber alloc] initWithInteger:42];\n\n// Use the object\nNSLog("The number is %d", [number intValue]);\n\n// Release the object\n[number release];\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain each of the memory management steps (alloc, init, release) in terms of reference counting.\n- **Part B**: Propose a modification to this code that would prevent a potential memory leak if the object is used in a longer-running context (e.g., a long-lived class instance).\n- **Part C**: Justify why manual reference counting can lead to common errors such as over-releasing or under-releasing, and how developers must be careful when managing references.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a thorough understanding of Objective-C''s memory management model and its practical implementation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**ARC vs Manual Memory Management**\n\nConsider the following two scenarios:}\n\n**Scenario 1**: Developing a new iOS application for modern devices.\n**Scenario 2**: Refactoring an older Objective-C project that was developed before Xcode 4.2.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each scenario, determine whether ARC or manual memory management is appropriate and explain your reasoning based on the text.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the introduction of ARC has impacted development practices in Objective-C, including changes in code structure and developer responsibilities.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example that illustrates how ARC automatically manages memory in a way that would require manual intervention in a non-ARC environment. Explain the difference in code behavior between the two approaches.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the two models and provide concrete examples of their behaviors under different development contexts.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nA framework is conceptually just a mechanism to modularize compiled  \ncode. Frameworks are the best approach to sharing code reused inside and  \noutside your company. They make maintaining library dependencies sim-\npler than managing a binary package and a global header.\n\nA framework is a specific kind of macOS bundle (and macOS bundles  \nare simply files) intended for usage by developers. Often, a framework bun-\ndle includes development resources (typically statically-built libraries and  \ninterface headers), but it may also include graphics, storyboards, xibs, and  \nproperty list files.\n\nA compiler may extract built binaries from a framework and link them  \nduring build or run time. The Finder presents bundles with a .framework  \nextension as regular folders for easy review by a developer.\n\nDue  to  these  unique  characteristics,  framework  bundles  need  precise  \ndirectory layouts  and file placements to function successfully, especially  \nfor their most frequent use, binary code distribution.\n\nWHY MUST WE PERFORM THIS?\n\nThere are several reasons why we would want to design a framework and  \na few reasons why we must. Frameworks are the ideal approach for us and  \nour  developers  to  provide  built  libraries  for  usage  outside  our  business.  \nThey  may  also  make  the  structure  of  a  large  application  much  easier  to  \nmaintain since we can divide the application into many targets and man-\nage each project individually. Fundamentally, there are three fundamental  \nreasons why frameworks exist:\n\nCode Management    ◾    209\n\n•  Modularity: Remove and replace independent portions of your source  \nwithout worrying about weird compiler errors or linker issues. Work  \non discrete portions of our codebase.\n\n•  Reuse:  Group-related  processes  so  that  they  are  reused  across  our  \n\napplication or applications.\n\n•  Encapsulation: Develop portions of your codebase to be wholly inde-\n\npendent and interference-free.\n\nWe  are  likely  already  familiar  with  these  concepts.  However,  due  \nto the intricacies of establishing a framework, many individuals avoid  \ndoing so.\n\nHowever,  if  we're  designing  iOS  applications  that  are  more  complex  \n\nthan the most fundamental, we should consider frameworks.\n\nANATOMY OF A FRAMEWORK\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

Use examples from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part B**: The passage states that frameworks are ideal for sharing code outside a business. Construct an argument that supports this claim using at least two of the three reasons provided in the text.\n- **Part C**: The text mentions that frameworks may include development resources like libraries and headers, as well as graphics and storyboards. Explain how these different components contribute to the overall functionality of a framework, referencing at least two types of files mentioned in the passage.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate logical reasoning based on the content of the text and integrate the concepts discussed in the passage.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThere are several methods to build and package a framework bundle, and  \nour decisions should be based on how you see the framework being used  \nin production. If we've never done anything like this before, it's good to  \nfamiliarize ourselves with Apple's instructions on framework bundles  \nbefore proceeding.\n\nTypically, a structure includes the following:\n\n• Compilation of binary code: A well-constructed framework should \n\nhave numerous binaries for various processor architectures.\n\n• Interface header: Since this is Objective-C, we will need to supply \n\nheaders for each class in our framework.\n\n• Different resources: Sometimes, frameworks are utilized to distrib-\nute additional resources. There are always better methods to share \nresources that belong to our code, such as a dedicated resources \npackage. Thus we would not recommend doing this.\n\nSTATIC AND DYNAMIC FRAMEWORKS\n\nThere are two types of frameworks: static and dynamic. The distinction \nbetween the two is precisely as it sounds: static frameworks are connected \nduring the construction phase, while dynamic frameworks are linked dur-\ning the compilation phase.\n\nApple's frameworks are all dynamically linked, whereas yours may be \neither. Before iOS 8, dynamic linking of frameworks is only supported on \nmacOS; however, it is now supported on iOS.\n\nStatic frameworks might increase your application's disc size and build \ntime since the complete binary is transferred and linked during the build. \nDynamic frameworks only employ the necessary portions of the frame-\nwork at build time and execute linking during runtime, possibly increas-\ning your App's start time but decreasing its total disc size.\n\nA further benefit of dynamic frameworks is that frameworks are updated \n\nwithout rebuilding the application since linking occurs on every startup.\n\nDynamic frameworks are unquestionably the more current approach, \nbut there are excellent reasons to utilize static frameworks, particularly for \ncode distributed outside the enterprise.\n\nARCHITECTURES AND SLICING OF PROCESSORS\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Framework Type Selection and Justification**\n\nGiven the trade-offs between static and dynamic frameworks as described in the text, decide which type of framework is most appropriate for each of the following scenarios. For each scenario, explain your reasoning using the concepts of binary linking, disk space, build time, and runtime performance.\n\n1. A mobile application that needs to be distributed to a wide audience with limited storage capacity.\n2. An enterprise-level application that requires frequent updates without requiring users to recompile or reinstall the app.\n3. A game that is expected to have long-term usage with frequent player interactions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between static and dynamic frameworks in each case, citing specific trade-offs from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Processor Architecture and Framework Slicing**\n\nThe text mentions that frameworks should include binaries for various processor architectures. Consider a framework intended for deployment on both iOS and macOS devices.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the framework would need to be structured to support multiple architectures, referencing the concept of ''slicing'' as described in the text.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the implications of not properly slicing frameworks for different architectures, including potential runtime errors or compatibility issues.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the architecture handling requirements for static versus dynamic frameworks, using examples from the text to support your analysis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of framework architecture slicing and its impact on cross-platform compatibility.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning About Framework Linking and Updates**\n\nThe text describes how static and dynamic frameworks handle linking during the build process and runtime. Consider the following scenario: A developer is creating a framework that will be used in multiple projects, some of which are updated frequently.\n- **Part A**: Explain why dynamic frameworks would be more advantageous in this situation, using the text''s explanation of how updates are handled.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument for when static frameworks might still be preferable, even with frequent updates, based on the trade-offs discussed in the text.\n- **Part C**: Design a hypothetical scenario where both static and dynamic frameworks would be appropriate, explaining why each is suitable in its specific context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of linking, updating, and performance from the text to provide a comprehensive analysis.'

If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\n Typically, a  framework's  binaries  include  many copies of the same code \ntailored  to  various  processor  architectures.  These  parts  are  called  slices \nsince they are combined into a single binary. To construct an appropriate \nframework, we must include slices for each version of the ARM instruc-\ntion set used by iOS devices that we want to support and a slice for the \nspecific x86 version of iOS used by the iPhone simulator.\n\nDEVELOPING A DYNAMIC STRUCTURE\n\nCreating a dynamic framework using Xcode is far less complicated than \nwe may believe. We will create the ExampleKit framework in this example, \nwhich includes the EKObject data structure and the EKSession processing \nobject. We can locate both classes in this location, but we shouldn't inter-\nact with them just yet.\n\nCreate a new Xcode project to begin. Select \"Cocoa Touch Framework\" \nand name our project ExampleKit. Building a git repository for our project \nis a smart idea.\n\nSETTING UP OUR PROJECT\n\nLet's examine what Apple's template currently gives us before we continue.\n\n•  We  already  have  an  umbrella  header  with  explicit  instructions  for \n\nimporting public headers.\n\n•  All required construction stages are currently in place.\n\n•  Setting code signing to \"do not code sign.\"\n\nCode Management    ◾    211\n\nAs we'll see when we construct a static framework, these are advanta-\ngeous qualities. Apple has completed the majority of the challenging tasks \nfor us. We simply need to specify a deployment target, the minimal version \nof iOS we want to support.\n\nDEVELOPING OUR CODE\n\nIf we've previously created an iOS App target, we're likely acquainted with \n\"target membership.\" We know that resources are included in the App's \n\"copy resources\" build phase, implementation files must be included in the \n\"compile sources\" build phase, and header files are not typically specified \nin an App's build phases.\n\nAdd both classes to your project and ensure that they have been copied \nto the source directory. After doing so, ensure that both.m files are mem-\nbers of our framework's \"ExampleKit\" target.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Framework Construction Concepts**\n\nBased on the provided text, explain the process of creating a dynamic framework in Xcode, including the purpose of ''slices'' and how they are used to support multiple processor architectures.\n- **Step 1**: Describe what a ''slice'' is in the context of frameworks and why it''s necessary for iOS development.\n- **Step 2**: Outline the steps required to create a dynamic framework using Xcode, referencing the example of ExampleKit.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how including slices for different ARM instruction sets and x86 versions ensures compatibility with iOS devices and the simulator.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly define ''slices'' and demonstrate understanding of how they contribute to framework compatibility.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Target Membership in Framework Development**\n\nThe text discusses target membership in the context of iOS app development. Explain how this concept applies to framework creation, using the ExampleKit framework as a case study.\n- **Part A**: Describe what ''target membership'' means and why it''s important for frameworks.\n- **Part B**: Detail the process of adding classes to a framework project and ensuring they are included in the correct target.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast target membership in an iOS app with that in a framework, using specific details from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of how target membership affects build phases and framework structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Code Signing and Deployment Targets**\n\nThe text mentions setting code signing to ''do not code sign'' and specifying a deployment target. Using the information provided, explain the implications of these settings in the context of framework development.\n- **Part A**: Explain why code signing might be disabled during framework development and its impact on the build process.\n- **Part B**: Describe how setting a deployment target affects the compatibility of the framework with different iOS versions.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why developers should carefully consider both settings when building frameworks for distribution.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must logically connect these settings to the overall framework build and distribution process.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nHere is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:\n\n---\n\n**Headers are also part of the construction process and must be target members when constructing a framework. We may have previously seen that the target membership option is accessible in the file inspector.h files. Add them as additional members of the target.**\n\n**ACCESS CONTROL**\n\nWhen we uploaded the header files to the target, we were also presented with an access control picker. Ensure both header files are set to \"Public\" as opposed to \"Project\" or \"Private.\"\n\nThese names are somewhat deceptive; all headings will be accessible to our customers and searchable in the finder, but headers must be expressly made public to be imported into the umbrella header. In general, we should place headers that our customers should use in \"Public\" and headers that are particular to our library's implementation in \"Project\" and \"Private.\" They are not hidden but won't appear in code completion, won't be imported in our umbrella header, and are commonly recognized as not being used outside the framework. (This is something Swift permits that Objective-C does not – real file and project privacy.)\n\n**UMBRELLA HEADER**\n\nRegarding the umbrella header, we must return and make our newly created class interfaces visible. This allows them to be imported with a single sentence. In the ExampleKit.h file, import them as follows:\n\n```objective-c\n#import <ExampleKit/EKObject.h>\n#import <ExampleKit/EKSession.h>\n```\n\n**UNIVERSAL SUPPORT**\n\nWe're using an Xcode template explicitly intended for developing dynamic frameworks, so most of the setting has already been completed. Compile our code once to ensure that everything is functioning properly before continuing.\n\nRemember when we were discussing the business of slicing? Xcode will only construct our framework for the specified platform and related slices. Thus, if we develop an iPhone simulator, we will get a framework with an x86 slice but no ARM slice. If we develop for iPhones, we will get a framework with arm slice(s). However, simulator support is not included.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Target Membership and Access Control in Xcode**\n\nIn the context of framework development, explain the implications of setting a header file to "Public" versus "Project" or "Private" as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Why must headers that are intended for customer use be marked as "Public"? Justify your answer based on the text''s explanation of how headers are imported into the umbrella header.\n- **Part B**: What is the difference between a header being "Private" and "Project" in terms of accessibility and code completion?

    ---

    Once this is complete, we will be able to add each heading as a member to the target and set a level of access control. Ensure that EKSession.h and EKObject.h are "public," but exclude ExampleKit.h from the target's membership.

    UMBRELLA HEADER

    Similarly to the dynamic framework, we will expose our headers in the umbrella header to import them all at once. Proceed to ExampleKit.h and import them as follows:

    #import <ExampleKit/EKObject.h>
    #import <ExampleKit/EKSession.h>

    Construct our "ExampleKit" target and ensure it builds without any issues.

    PACKAGING

    Because we're using a template intended for a static library, we'll need to modify our target to generate a static framework. Our template does not provide the required directory structure and symbolic links, so we'll need to modify our target's build settings and write a script to do some hard work.

    MODIFY BUILD SETTINGS TO SUPPORT STATIC FRAMEWORKS

    • Change the Public Headers Search Path option to include/$(PROJECT_NAME).

    • Change setting for Dead Code Stripping to NO.

    • Change the Style of the Strip to Non-Global Symbols.

    Rebuild our static target, then right-click on "libExampleKit.a" and choose "Show in Finder." Our static library has been condensed into a single bundle and some headers. However, there is currently no unified framework.

    MODULE SUPPORT

    The dynamic framework template automatically generates a module map at build time and installs it in the corresponding directory. Clang Modules are a superior method of importing files than #include (or #import, which is simply #include without the duplication) and are required if we want your framework to be compatible with Swift projects. Create a new empty file with the name "module.modulemap". It requires no target membership.

    framework module ExampleKit {
        umbrella header "ExampleKit.h"

        export *
        module * { export * }
    }

    CREATING THE BUNDLE STRUCTURE

    Add the following script as the last build step for our static library target:

    set -e
    export FRAMEWORK_LOCN="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PRODUCT_NAME}.framework"

    Utilizing our static library in Xcode is equivalent to utilizing any of Apple's dynamically linked-platform frameworks. We do not need to mention ExampleKit.framework as an embedded binary; just add it to our App target's "Linked Libraries and Frameworks" target and verify that our framework bundle resides inside the app project folder. We may get a finished version of the static ExampleKit framework and a properly connected application.

    RECOMMENDATIONS

    Developing a universal structure is just half of the fight. Suppose we want to provide our framework for usage by more than a few individuals with particular use cases in mind. In that case, there are a few things we should do to ensure that it will operate in a completely foreign codebase regardless of the circumstances.

    Creating a decent framework cannot be reduced to a collection of rules; it requires a whole shift in perspective. We must consider that our user is an engineer who may attempt to accomplish various things with our framework. They may get access to secret implementations, subclass things they shouldn't, and put our custom data structures in collections in unforeseen ways. They may create terrible code, retain items in memory for too long, or apply our programming patterns poorly. Our objective is to generate as many potential situations as possible and prepare for them in advance.
    Nevertheless, there are a few solutions to a variety of typical issues.

    Code Management ◾ 221

    COMPILING AND CONSTRUCTING THE FRAMEWORK

    To properly construct our framework for simulators and real devices such as iPhones, we must first have appropriate architectural settings.

    Open our framework's .xcodeproj file, navigate the build settings tab, and search for the Valid Architectures setting. We will notice that the debug and release options already contain the values armv7, arm7s, and arm64; if not, add them; compatibility with real devices requires these architectures.

    We may add the Any Simulator SDK option for Simulators in Debug

    The only difference between MRR and ARC is that we handle the retain and release manually in the former while handled automatically in the latter.
    The diagram shown below is an example of how memory management works in Objective-C.

    Manual retain-release.

    The Class A object's memory life cycle is shown in the diagram above. As you can see, the retain count is shown under the object; when the retain count reaches 0, the item is liberated, and its memory is reallocated for other objects to utilize.

    The alloc/init function in NSObject is used to construct the Class A object. The number of retains is now 1.

    Class B now keeps Class A's object, and Class A's object now has a retain count of 2.

    The item is then copied by Class C. It is now constructed as a new instance of Class A, with the same instance variables. The retain count is 1 instead of the original object's retain count. The second horizontal line in the diagram represents this.

    Class C uses the release method to release the copied object, which causes the retain count to drop to 0 and the item to be destroyed.

    The retain count for the original Class A Object is 2, and it must be released twice before it may be destroyed. This is accomplished using Class A and Class B release statements to set the retain count to 1 and 0, respectively. The thing is finally destroyed.

    Basic MRR Rules

    • We own whatever we make: a method that starts with "alloc," "new," "copy," or "mutableCopy" is used to construct an object.

    • We may use retain to acquire ownership of an object: a received object is usually guaranteed to stay valid inside the method in which it is received. That method may also return the object to its invoker securely. Retain is used in two scenarios.

    • We use an accessor method or an init method to gain ownership of an object we wish to save as a property value.

    Tools and approaches we may use to identify and diagnose the problems.

    Many of the tools and approaches, including the usage of NSZombie to aid detect over-released objects, are explained in Technical Note TN2239, iOS Debugging Magic.

    Instruments may be used to monitor reference counting events and detect memory leaks.

    THE GOAL OF MEMORY MANAGEMENT

    The objective of any memory management system is to lower a program's memory footprint. Controlling the lifespan of objects produced inside the application accomplishes this. According to memory management best practices, objects should only live for as long as necessary and not a millisecond longer.

    iOS and OS X Apps have developed an object ownership model. An internal reference-counting mechanism keeps track of how many owners each object has. When an item is claimed as one's own, the reference count increases by one. The opposite also holds true. After the item is released (when it is no longer needed), its reference count is decreased. As long as the reference count is more than zero, the existence of an object is assured. However, once the count approaches zero, the operating system is permitted to delete it.

    Historically, developers manually managed an object's reference count using specific memory management methods supplied by the NSObject protocol. The term for this is Manual Retain Release (MRR). Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is implemented in Xcode 4.2 to insert these method calls automatically.

    Avoid Crashing

    Manually regulating object ownership may be difficult and time-consuming, mainly because a programmer must remember to surrender possession of the object when using it. This is a routine that is required but not always practicable. This implies that every alloc, retain, and copy call must be paired with a release or autorelease on the same object.

    A memory leak or a dangling pointer will happen if these calls are not balanced. If an object is not released, its underlying memory will never be removed, resulting in a memory leak. Minimal leakage will have no discernible impact on your software. However, if enough memory is used, the software will ultimately crash! In contrast, if we repeatedly attempt to release an object, we will have what is known as a dangling pointer. When we attempt to access the hanging pointer, you will be requesting an invalid memory location, and your software will likely fail once again.

    Strong vs Weak

    Both strong and weak references exist between things. A strong reference implies ownership; a strong property increments the object's reference count. The referent object is the owner of the referred item. A weak reference means that the object referred to does not possess the referenced item. Weak references do not increase the object's reference count. The lifespan of an item is defined by the number of strong references to it. An item is not released as long as it is strongly referenced. The weak identifies a reference that does not maintain the life of the referred object. If there are no strong references to an object, the weak reference is null.

    Strong is the default attribute for object types in ARC. An item is considered "alive" as long as a strong pointer points.

    ---

    Atomic and Nonatomic

    Atomicity relates to the behavior of the class or object in a multithreaded environment. Atomic accessors guarantee that the value is entirely set or retrieved in the thread that is accessing the variable.

    In setting or retrieving a specific property, an atomic accessor is considered thread-safe.

    Atomic accessors do not guarantee thread safety for the whole class. They merely assure that the property is not accessed during the set.

    Making accessors atomic reduces speed since the compiler must run more instructions when accessing our values.

    Make them atomic when threads are possible.
    If we know they are not accessed in a threaded environment, make them nonatomic.

    This design helps work with many classes, especially if they are challenging to use or comprehend. If the classes beneath the facade are expected to change, the facade class can keep the same API while things change behind the scenes. For example, if you decide to update our backend service, we will only need to alter the code that utilizes our API, not the code within our Facade.

    When to Use the Facade Pattern?

    DECORATOR

    The Decorator design dynamically adds behaviors and responsibilities to an object without altering its code. It is an alternative to subclassing in which the functionality of a class is altered by wrapping it in another object. Category and Delegation are two typical implementations of this pattern in Objective-C. Extensions and Delegation are two extremely typical implementations of this paradigm in Swift.

    This is used to separate implementation-specific behavior from the generic class. Many iOS UI components, such as UIScrollView, employ delegates to control their behavior. As this is an application-specific job, the UIScrollView class is unaware of the scrolled content. To inform the application of scrolling events, the UIScrollViewDelegate is used. The application may implement the delegate and intercept the scrolling events given by UIScrollView.

This externalized  \nstate is later restored without breaking encapsulation; private data stays  \nprivate. Archiving, Serialization, and State Restoration are examples of  \nMemento pattern implementations.\n\nADAPTER\n\nThe Adapter design pattern transforms a class's interface into another  \ninterface that customers anticipate. The adapter makes it possible for  \nclasses with conflicting interfaces to collaborate. It decouples the cli-  \nent from the targeted object's class. Apple employs protocols to do its  \ntasks. Protocols like UITableViewDelegate, UIScrollViewDelegate,  \nNSCoding, and NSCopying may be familiar. Using the NSCopying  \nprotocol as an example, any class may implement a standard copy  \nfunction.\n\nWhen to Use an Adapter?\n\n• When a third-party class is required, its interface does not match the  \n\nactual application's code.\n\n• In the lack of specialized functionality and limited extensibility, an  \n\nAdapter is used with existing subclasses.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Decorator Pattern Principles**\n\nUsing the description of the Decorator design pattern and its application to Christmas trees, explain how the pattern can be applied to software development.\n- **Step 1**: Define the core concept of the Decorator pattern using the text''s analogy with tree decorations.\n- **Step 2**: Identify two distinct components of a software system that could benefit from the Decorator pattern.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the pattern allows for dynamic extension without altering the original class.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate both the textual analogy and a real-world software example, demonstrating an understanding of the pattern''s flexibility and non-intrusive nature.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Adapter Pattern in Objective-C**\n\nBased on the text''s description of the Adapter design pattern and Apple''s use of protocols, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the Adapter pattern enables compatibility between classes with incompatible interfaces. Use the NSCopying protocol as an example from the text.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the Adapter pattern with the Decorator pattern in terms of their primary purposes and implementation strategies.\n- **Part C**: Propose a scenario where the Adapter pattern would be more appropriate than the Decorator pattern in an Objective-C application. Justify your choice using the text''s definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference Apple''s protocols and demonstrate an understanding of when to use each design pattern.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Design Patterns**\n\nThe text describes three design patterns: Decorator, Memento, and Adapter. Consider the following scenario:\n- **Part A**: Identify which pattern would best suit a situation where a class needs to keep its state external for later restoration. Justify your choice using the Memento pattern''s description.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the Adapter pattern differs from the Decorator pattern in terms of their impact on an object''s interface and behavior. Use examples from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument for why the Decorator pattern is preferred over inheritance in scenarios involving dynamic modifications. Reference the tree decoration analogy provided in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all three patterns and demonstrate critical thinking about their appropriate application in software design.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nIllustration of Adapter Pattern  \nSuppose you have a Bird class with the fly() and create sound methods (). Additionally, the ToyDuck class has a squeak() function. Now that you're short on ToyDuck items, you want to replace them with Bird items. Birds possess comparable skills, but their interface is distinct; thus, we cannot use them directly. Consequently, we will use the Adapter pattern. A bird would be our client, whereas ToyDuck would be our customer.\n\nOBSERVER  \n\nThe Observer design pattern establishes a one-to-many dependence between objects such that when the state of one object changes, its dependents are immediately alerted and changed. The Observer pattern is simply a publish-and-subscribe paradigm with loose coupling between the topic and its observers. There may be communication between the observer and the observed item without each party knowing a great deal about the other. The observer pattern is implemented in Cocoa in two ways: Notifications and Key-Value Observing (KVO). Delegate: This is used to prevent implementation-specific behavior from being included in the generic class. Many iOS UI components, such as UIScrollView, employ delegates to control their behavior. As this is an application-specific job, the UIScrollView class is unaware of the scrolled content. To inform the application of scrolling events, the UIScrollViewDelegate is used. The application may implement the delegate and intercept the scrolling events given by UIScrollView.\n\nWhen Should We Use a Decorator Pattern?\n\nWhen an expansion is required, the Decorator design pattern is used. For instance, the Windows operating system features need \"optional\" components such as the title bar, status bar, and scrollbars.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Adapter Pattern Application**\n\nGiven the Bird class with fly() and makeSound() methods, and the ToyDuck class with squeak() method, explain how the Adapter pattern can be implemented to allow a ToyDuck instance to behave like a Bird.\n- **Step 1**: Define the Bird interface with fly() and makeSound().\n- **Step 2**: Create an adapter class that wraps a ToyDuck instance and implements the Bird interface.\n- **Step 3**: Implement the fly() and makeSound() methods in the adapter to delegate calls to the ToyDuck''s squeak() method.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must include how the Adapter pattern enables compatibility between disparate interfaces, and you must explicitly reference the example of replacing ToyDucks with Birds using this pattern.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Observer Pattern and Loose Coupling**\n\nExplain the Observer design pattern in your own words, and provide an example from the text that illustrates its use in Cocoa.\n- **Part A**: Define the Observer pattern and describe how it establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects.\n- **Part B**: Reference the text''s explanation of Notifications and Key-Value Observing (KVO) as two implementations of the Observer pattern in Cocoa.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the Observer pattern promotes loose coupling, using an example from the text where the observed object does not need to know about its observers.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define the Observer pattern and demonstrate understanding of its implementation in Cocoa as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Decorator Pattern and Optional Features**\n\nThe Decorator design pattern is used when an expansion is required. Provide a real-world example from the text that illustrates this concept, and explain how it works.\n- **Part A**: Reference the Windows operating system example given in the text where components like the title bar, status bar, and scrollbars are optional.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the Decorator pattern allows these components to be added or removed dynamically without altering the core functionality of the window.\n- **Part C**: Compare the Decorator pattern to the Adapter pattern, highlighting the key difference in their purposes and use cases.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your example must clearly demonstrate the application of the Decorator pattern as described in the text, and you must explicitly contrast it with the Adapter pattern.'

We may build a family of algorithms using interfaces and \nencapsulate and make them interchangeable, enabling us to choose which \nalgorithm to execute at runtime.\n\nFACTORY\n\nFactory method design makes adding or deleting new kinds from the \ncodebase easier. We just need a new class and a new factory to create a \nnew type.\n\nCode Management    ◾    233\n\nCOMMAND\n\nThe Command design pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allow-\ning you to parameterize clients, queue or log requests, and offer undoable \nactivities. The request object connects one or more operations on a single \nreceiver. The Command pattern distinguishes between objects that make \na request and those that receive and execute that request. For example, \nMechanism of targeted action.\n\nCOMPOSITE\n\nThe Composite design pattern assembles linked elements into tree struc-\ntures to describe part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to handle indi-\nvidual objects and object combinations consistently. It is a component \nof the Model-View-Controller aggregation pattern. For example, View \nHierarchy.\n\nITERATOR\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Decorator and Composite Patterns**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, explain how the Decorator pattern and the Composite pattern can be used together to model a Christmas tree with decorations.\n- **Step 1**: Describe how the Decorator pattern is applied to add decorations (e.g., lights, garland) to a base tree object.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the Composite pattern can be used to represent the hierarchical structure of the tree and its decorations.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why combining these two patterns provides a more flexible and maintainable design than using either pattern alone.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must reference specific concepts from both patterns and demonstrate an understanding of their complementary roles in object-oriented design.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Strategy and Factory Patterns**\n\nThe text describes the Strategy and Factory patterns. Using these concepts, design a system for managing different types of Christmas decorations (e.g., lights, garland, ornaments).\n- **Part A**: Define an interface for the Strategy pattern that represents a decoration''s behavior (e.g., "light up", "add ornament").\n- **Part B**: Implement a Factory method that creates instances of specific decoration types based on input parameters.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the combination of these two patterns allows for dynamic modification of decoration behaviors and easy addition of new decoration types.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of both patterns and show how they work together to provide flexibility in the system.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Design Patterns**\n\nThe text describes several design patterns, including Command, Iterator, and Strategy. Consider the scenario of managing a Christmas decoration inventory.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the Command pattern can be used to encapsulate requests for adding or removing decorations.\n- **Part B**: Describe how the Iterator pattern can be applied to traverse and display the contents of the inventory.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why the Composite pattern might be more appropriate than the Iterator pattern in this scenario, based on the text''s description of part-whole hierarchies.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts from all three patterns and demonstrate a clear understanding of their applicability to real-world scenarios.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThe Iterator design pattern enables sequential access to the components  \nof a collection or other aggregate object without disclosing its underlying  \nrepresentation. The Iterator pattern moves the accessing and traversal of  \na collection's items from the collection itself to an iterator object. Iterator  \nprovides an interface for accessing collection items and maintains the  \ncurrent element's position. Different iterators may implement distinct tra-\nversal strategies. For example, Enumerators.\n\nMEDIATOR\n\nThe Mediator design pattern specifies an item that encapsulates how a col-\nlection of things communicate. The mediator encourages loose coupling \nby preventing objects from explicitly referencing one another, enabling us \nto modify their interaction independently. This increases the reusability \nof some items. In this paradigm, a \"mediator object\" centralizes compli-\ncated communication and control logic across system components. These \nobjects inform the mediator object when their status changes and reply to \nrequests made by the mediator object. Instances include Controller Classes \nin the AppKit Framework and View Controllers in UIKit.\n\nSINGLETON\n\nThe Singleton design pattern assures that a class has only one instance and \ngives a global point of access to that instance. The class maintains track \nof its one instance and prevents further instances from being generated. \n\n234    ◾    Objective-C\n\nSingleton classes should be used when it makes sense for a single object \nto offer access to a global resource. Typically, it employs lazy loading to \ngenerate the instance only when required for the first time.\n\nWhen Should We Use the Singleton Design Pattern?\n\nIf we are needed to manage resources, you should implement this design \ntechnique. We must replace a Singleton with a connection pooling HTTP \nclient that is more efficient and resource-friendly.\n\nIllustration of Singleton Pattern\nThe Singleton function is indicated when just one instance of a class or a \nsingle object copy is required. Global access is allowed for a single instance. \nIt employs a lazy loading strategy to create a single instance on the first \nattempt.\n\nMVC\n\n•  Models: These are in charge of the domain data or a data access layer \nthat manipulates the data; for example, consider the \"Person\" or \n\"PersonDataProvider\" classes.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Iterator and Mediator Patterns**\n\nCompare and contrast the Iterator and Mediator design patterns as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary purpose of each pattern based on their definitions.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the Iterator pattern enables sequential access to a collection''s elements without exposing its internal structure.\n- **Step 3**: Describe how the Mediator pattern facilitates communication between objects by centralizing interaction logic.\n- **Step 4**: Provide an example of a real-world scenario where each pattern would be appropriate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish the roles and responsibilities of each pattern, using specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Singleton Pattern Logic**\n\nExplain the implications of implementing the Singleton design pattern in a mobile application context, as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Discuss the scenarios where a Singleton would be appropriate, such as managing global resources or ensuring single access to a shared object.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the potential drawbacks of using a Singleton, including issues with testing and thread safety.\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative design pattern that could replace the Singleton in situations where it is not suitable, providing reasoning for your choice.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the trade-offs involved in using the Singleton pattern and its alternatives.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with MVC Components**\n\nThe text describes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where Models manage domain data, Views handle presentation, and Controllers facilitate interaction. Consider a mobile application that displays a list of user profiles.\n- **Part A**: Identify which component (Model, View, or Controller) is responsible for retrieving and managing user profile data. Justify your answer based on the text''s description of each role.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the Controller would handle user input, such as selecting a profile from the list.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example scenario where the Model and View interact directly without the Controller, and explain why this would violate the principles of MVC as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the roles of each component within the MVC framework and demonstrate a deep understanding of how they should interact.'

    ---

    In MVVM, the View solely contains visual aspects such as layout, animation, and initializing UI components. The ViewModel is a specific layer that exists between the View and the Model. ViewModel is the authoritative representation of View. In other words, the ViewModel offers a collection of interfaces, each representing a UI component in the View. We utilize the "binding" approach to link UI components to ViewModel interfaces.

    Specifically, for MVVM in iOS programming, the View is represented by UIView/UIViewController. We only do:

    • Initiate, layout, and display UI components.

    • Connect UI elements to the ViewModel.

    In contrast, we perform the following in the ViewModel:

    • Create controller logic, including pagination and error handling.

    • Write presentational logic and give View interfaces.

    Feature Assessment

    The MVVM View has more responsibilities than the MVP View, even though this is not immediately apparent in our little example. Because the first one changes its state from the View Model by establishing bindings, the second one transmits all events to the Presenter without updating itself.

    Testability – the View Model is ignorant of the View, simply allowing us to test it. The View is checked, but as it is dependent on UIKit, we may wish to avoid it.

    Easy to use – it has the same amount of code as MVP in our example, but in the actual App, where we would have to send all events from the View to the Presenter and manually update the View, MVVM would be far slimmer if bindings are utilized.

    Code Management ◾ 237

    VIPER

    Difficulties with MVVM:

    It is compounded on iOS by the absence of bindings and the inclination to continue transferring too many tasks from a view controller class to a view model class.

    Without good, reusable, tested, and single-responsibility components, the use of any MVVM solution is limited.

    Simply stating "we're using MVVM" or having a rudimentary implementation of MVVM in a project without analyzing how it improves our code reuse, efficiency, and adherence to the single responsibility principle can mislead us on how beneficial or maintainable the design is.

    The text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr.

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nVIPER applies Clean Architecture to iOS applications. VIPER in Objective-C is an acronym that stands for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. Clean Architecture separates the logical framework of an application into different levels of responsibility. This makes it easy to separate dependencies (such as our database) and test interactions at layer boundaries.\n\nThe main VIPER components are:\n\n• View: It shows what the Presenter instructs it to and communicates user input to the Presenter.\n\n• Interactor: It includes business logic given by a use case.\n\n• Presenter: It contains view logic for preparing material for display (as provided by the Interactor) and responding to user inputs (by requesting new data from the Interactor).\n\n• Entity: It stores fundamental model items used by the Interactor.\n\n• Routing: It contains navigation logic detailing the sequence in which screens are shown.\n\nWHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF EMPLOYING iOS DESIGN PATTERNS?\n\nThe design pattern improves the definition of interfaces and is device-specific.

In this chapter, we will discuss code optimization.\n\n**OBJECTIVE-C CODE OPTIMIZATION AT COMPILE TIME**\n\nCode optimization is developing or rewriting code so that a program utilizes the least amount of memory or disk space, requires the least CPU time or network bandwidth, or makes the most effective use of additional cores.\n\nCode compilation is one of the necessary procedures (together with linking, bundling the resources, code signing, and so on).\n\nOur source code was initially created in a high-level programming language, such as Objective-C, Swift, or C++. It is the compiler's responsibility to convert our high-level source code into low-level machine code to generate an executable program. There are other sorts of compilers, but in the iOS/macOS ecosystem, we only deal with frontend and backend compilers. The frontend translates our source code into an intermediate language that the backend can comprehend. This intermediate representation is converted into machine code by the backend, taking into account the individual operating system and processor architecture. This is the core of these two entities.\n\nDifferent pipelines exist for Swift and Objective-C, although LLVM supports both.\n\n--- \n\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003357506-6\n\n239\n\n240    ◾    Objective-C\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nLLVM is a large project that consists of LLVM Core as the backend, and Clang as the \"LLVM native\" frontend for the C language family (C/Objective-C/C++/Objective-C ++), and an interaction protocol between the frontend and backend. The primary component of this protocol is LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) – the intermediate language that can be understood by both the front and back ends. It is irrelevant to LLVM Core whatever front-end generated the source code's IR-code.

    **242 ◾ Objective-C**

    Clang passes LLVM IR to LLVM Core, optimizing (if appropriate) and converting the code to target-specific machine code. Consequently, we have a collection of object files (*.o) that are subsequently linked and combined into an executable or dynamic library. This final output is often referred to as a "a.out," ".dylib," or ".so" file.

    As was previously evident, LLVM Core is where code optimization occurs, and Intermediate Representation is the source of these optimizations.

    Here are the LLVM optimization levels and their short descriptions:

    - **None** [-O0]: The compiler does not optimize source code. With this option, the compiler aims to decrease the cost of compilation and deliver anticipated results from debugging. Statements are independent: if you pause the program with a breakpoint between statements, you may add a new value to any variable or move the program counter to any other statement in the function and get the expected results from the source code. Use this option during development when we intend to resolve logic issues and need a quick compilation time. Do not utilize this shipping option for our executable.

    - **Fast** [-O, O1]: The compiler performs simple optimizations to improve code performance while reducing the effect on compile time. Additionally, this option consumes more RAM during compilation.

    - **Faster** [-O2]: The compiler executes almost all available optimizations that do not need a trade-off between space and time. This option prevents the compiler from making loop unrolling and function inlining. This option boosts both compilation time and produced code performance.

This option may cause the resulting code to be larger since the compiler will aggressively inline routines. (This choice is often not advised.)\n\n• Fastest, Smallest [-Os]: The compiler does all optimizations that do not normally increase the size of the source code. This is the preferable method for shipping code since it reduces the memory footprint of the executable.\n\n---\n\nCode Optimization ◾ 243\n\n• Quickest and Aggressive Optimisation [-Ofast]: This option allows \"Fastest\" and aggressive optimizations that may violate stringent standards compliance but should function well with well-behaved code.\n\nSECURE CODE\n\n• Incorrect platform usage: To save sensitive data, use adequate keychain security.\n\n• Keychain safety: Make certain that the program deletes the user's data when the user logs out.\n\nKeychain data linked with the program is not cleared off by default following uninstalling. If a user reinstalls the software and attempts to login with a different user, it may unintentionally provide access to the prior user's account.

    Naming

    Everything should prefix with a 2–3 letter prefix in general. Longer prefixes are permissible but not preferred.

    If the code is application-specific, it is a good idea to prefix classes with an application's particular name. If we want to use the code in other Apps or open-source, it is a good idea to do something unique to us or our firm for the prefix.

    Here are a few examples if our firm is Awesome Buckets and you have an application called Bucket Hunter:

    ABLoadingView // Simple view that can be used in other applications

    BHAppDelegate // Application specific code
    BHLoadingView // 'ABLoadingView' customized for Bucket Hunter application

    The majority of Apple's current Cocoa API is built on OpenStep interface objects, and it is the most important Objective-C development environment in use today.

    Swift, which Apple launched at WWDC 2014, was described as "Objective-C without the C." The Objective-C programming language has a lengthy history. Although it has languished as a niche language for most of that time, the arrival of the iPhone has rocketed it to popularity: Objective-C was named the winner of the TIOBE Programming Language Award for 2011 in January 2012. This award is given to the language with the highest use growth over the past 12 months; in 2011, Objective-C jumped from eighth to the fifth position on the index.

    The origins of Objective-C may be traced to a section of International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) where Tom Love and Brad Cox sought to increase the productivity of programmers. In 1981, a special edition of Byte magazine presented Smalltalk, a breakthrough new programming language created by Alan Kay and his colleagues at Xerox PARC. Smalltalk introduced a whole new way of conceiving program development, which Kay termed "object-oriented." Instead of writing a program as a set of operations ("procedures") that accept data as inputs, a program would be re-oriented around the data itself, which would be organized into "objects." Smalltalk envisioned programs as collections of objects that would exchange messages, therefore invoking "methods" (perform actions). The invoked methods were chosen "dynamically," that is, while the program was executing. A Smalltalk application may edit itself in real-time in reaction to human input.

    Objective-C has been around for 35 years, making it older than many current macOS and iOS software developers. Swift, which debuted in 2014, is swiftly gaining momentum and displacing Objective-C from the market. Observations indicate that about half of the most popular applications in the App Store are created in Swift, which is a significant increase in just 5 years.

    The million-dollar issue is whether developers should consider Objective-C for new iOS projects or go for Swift from the beginning. Let's examine the present state of Objective-C.

    First, nobody has ever heard any official word from Apple on the deprecation of Objective-C support or even a possible date when it would be discontinued. A large amount of code created in Objective-C is still being maintained, and a large number of popular applications are built in this language. Consider: who would commit to transferring all those

    Appraisal ◾ 261

    applications to a different language simply for its purpose? Imagine the amount of time and money that such a project would need with no apparent return.

    Thus, we can conclude that Objective-C will continue to exist in the foreseeable future. Objective-C programmers may rest confident that their talents will continue to be in demand. With new applications and young developers picking the language to learn, the situation is different.

    A COMPARISON OF OBJECTIVE-C AND SWIFT

    Let's analyze how Objective-C compares to Swift and what might tip the scales in this matter to determine if it's a smart idea to choose it as the language for our new iOS App project.

    Let's explore the differences between Objective-C and Swift in further depth.

    • Objective-C's performance is sluggish owing to runtime code compilation. According to an official Apple release, Swift is 2.6 times more efficient than Objective-C.

On the other hand, Swift is similar to plain English, making its learning curve simpler than that of Objective-C.\n\n• The primary difference in code safety is how Objective-C and Swift handle null pointers. A null pointer in Objective-C does not result in an application crash, making it challenging to identify and repair. In Swift, however, null pointers result in easily identifiable crashes. Overall, Objective-C applications may include more hidden problems than Swift applications.\n\n• Objective-C demands the maintenance of two code files: time- and effort. With Swift, we need to maintain a single code file, reducing the time and human labor required.\n\n• Objective-C often requires more lines of code than Swift.\n\n• Objective-C lacks support for dynamic libraries and instead utilizes static ones.

    In Objective-C, polymorphism exists immediately at compile time.
    It employs YES and NO values, as well as BOOl.
    Objective-C has lesser templates than Swift

    ADVANTAGES OF OBJECTIVE-C

    • The language was built as a preprocessor GCC package for current C compilers.

    • C++ is more compatible with Objective-C.

    • Objective-C has more stability.

    • Private API use is simplified in Objective-C.

    NEGATIVES OF OBJECTIVE-C

    • Contrary to C++, Objective-C does not enable operator overloading.

    • The original version of Objective-C did not enable garbage collection but still utilizes a C-based runtime, which increases the application's size.

    Appraisal ◾ 263

    • Since it is based on C Compilers, it requires a header file to function properly.

    • Objective-C is a rather complicated language, although this is anticipated given its antiquity.

    SHOULD WE GO FOR OBJECTIVE-C?

    As can be seen, even a cursory comparison of the primary features of both languages reveals that Swift is superior to Objective-C. Moreover, one of Objective-C's last advantages over Swift has lately been eliminated.

    Swift 5, the most recent version of the programming language, has ABI stability, a significant step toward attaining outstanding performance and security. Swift's lack of ABI stability was a significant issue until recently, but it has been addressed.

    With the release of the newest version of Swift, Apple is pushing developers to utilize it for future iOS applications. The youthful language has a lot of unique benefits over the older and more demanding Objective-C, so it makes sense.

    WHY SHOULD WE LEARN OBJECTIVE-C IN 2022?
    Most macOS, XCode, and iOS kernel codes are written in C and C++. Since Objective-C is officially not a programming language but rather a huge preprocessor for pure C, it "fits in" with them rather well.

You must use ARC while programming in Swift (although there are also life hacks here).\n\nFurthermore, ARC does not resolve several issues, such as the lifetime of an object. Consider that there is a 14-minute voicemail. The customer has already listened to 12 – and they \"ate up\" the entire RAM. In Objective-C, they may be readily purged at the level of pointers and bytes, leaving just the current minute and the two preceding seconds. And on Swift, this will need a high degree of abstraction and a significant amount of code (or using Objective-C tricks via the Swift interface).\n\nC++ is also used to create libraries that implement video or image recognition, computer vision, and cryptographic computations.

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nA significant portion of programming Objective-C involves handling the references that running code has to objects and the references that objects hold to one another. Before introducing ARC, Objective-C used manual memory management on iOS and garbage collection on OS X. Both of these strategies have their benefits and drawbacks. Now it employs ARC, which incorporates the most advantageous elements of both approaches.\n\nAutomatic Reference Counting, or ARC, is a compile-time system that inserts manual memory management calls into the code as it is con-\nstructed. The compiler is quite intelligent, and the ARC code is well opti-\nmized. While ARC has liberated developers from writing manual memory \nmanagement code, it cannot break reference cycles like garbage collection \ncan-based platforms. For this reason, developers must instruct the com-\npiler on how to prevent reference cycles.\n\nWhen an item no longer receives strong references, it is deallocated.

    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:

    Commonly, strong and weak references are "owned" and "owned by," respectively. When an item has another object, it employs a strong reference. If an item is owned by another object and has a reference to its owner, the reference is weak. This is not adequate reasoning for all references, but it is a helpful method for remembering the memory management principles of Objective-C.

    As a specific example, let's examine NSArray. Arrays hold robust references to every element they include. We may consider an array to be the owner of these things, even if other objects may also own them.

    The Delegation pattern in Objective-C provides a further illustration. Delegation is a typical technique for using loosely connected callbacks, particularly in user interface programs. A typical example of delegation in iOS is the UITableViewDataSource protocol. View controller-owned table views must know what to present to the user. The view controller must send this information to the table view.

    Weak references in the UITableViewDataSource.

    OBJECTIVE-C: EXCEPTIONS AND ERRORS

    There are two sorts of mistakes that can occur when a program runs in Objective-C. Unexpected errors are "serious" programming errors that cause your program to terminate prematurely. These are known as exceptions because they indicate a rare occurrence in your software. On the other hand, expected errors in Objective-C occur naturally throughout the execution of a program and can be utilized to evaluate the success of an activity. These are known as errors.

    We might also think of the contrast between exceptions and errors as distinguishing their target audiences. In general, exceptions are used to notify the programmer of a problem, whereas errors notify the user that a requested action is not being accomplished.

    Control flow of exception and error.

    For example, attempting to access a non-existent array index is an exception (a programming error), but failing to open a file is an error.

When a piece of code detects \nan exception, it may \"throw\" exception to the closest error-handling block, \nwhich  can  \"catch\"  and  correctly  handle  particular  errors.

The real excep-\ntion handling occurs inside the @catch() clause. In this instance, we just \nshow  a  descriptive  error  notice,  but  we'll  likely  need  to  create  code  to \naddress the issue in other situations.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThis code will not throw an error since it supplies a valid interval (0, 10) to generateRandomInteger(). Change the interval to something like (0, −10), and we'll see the @catch() block in action. When the framework classes receive exceptions, this is what happens beneath the hood (e.g., the NSRangeException raised by NSArray).\n\nWe may also re-throw exceptions that you've already caught. This is handy if we want to be notified when an exception occurs but do not want to handle it ourselves. We may easily omit the argument to the @throw directive as a convenience:\n\n@try {\n    result = generateRandomInteger(0, -10);\n}\n@catch (NSException *exception) {\n    NSLog(@\"Problem! Caught exception: %@\", [exception name]);\n\n    // Re-throw current exception.\n    @throw\n}\n\nThe caught exception is then sent up to the next-highest handler, which in this case is the top-level exception handler.

    ```

    The `generateRandomInteger()` attempts to create a new integer between the specified "default" boundaries rather than producing an NSException object. The example demonstrates how to use `@throw` with various objects, but it isn't the ideal application architecture, nor is it the most efficient use of Objective-C exception-handling facilities. If we truly want to use the thrown value, as the preceding code does, we would be better served with a simple conditional check using NSError, as detailed in the next section.

    Furthermore, several of Apple's core frameworks anticipate an NSException object to be thrown, so use caution when integrating with the standard libraries.

    **ERROR HANDLING**

    Errors are intended to be an efficient and easy method to determine if an activity was successful or not, while exceptions are intended to alert programmers when something has gone wrong. In contrast to exceptions, errors are intended to be utilized in routine control flow statements.

    ---

    **THE NSError CLASS**

    The only similarity between mistakes and exceptions is that they are both implemented as objects. The `NSError` class incorporates all information required to indicate errors:

    - **code** – An `NSInteger` that provides a unique identification for the error.
    - **Domain** – An instance of `NSString` that defines the error's domain (described in more detail in the next section).

    • userInfo – An instance of NSDictionary containing application-specific data about the problem. This is used far more often than the userInfo dictionary of NSException.

    In addition to these essential characteristics, NSError contains many variables that help in displaying and processing errors. These are all shortcuts into the userInfo dictionary given in the preceding list.

    • localizedDescription – An NSString holding the error's whole explanation, often including the failure's cause. Typically, this figure is shown to the user via an alert panel.

    • localizedFailureReason – An NSString offering an independent explanation of the error's cause. This is only used by customers that want to separate the error's cause from its entire explanation.

    • recoverySuggestion – An NSString provides the user with instructions on how to recover from the mistake.

    • localizedRecoveryOptions – An NSArray of titles for the error dialog's buttons. A single OK button to dismiss the warning is presented if this array is empty.

    • helpAnchor – An NSString to show when the Help anchor button is pressed in an alert panel.

    Similar to NSException, the initWithDomain:code:userInfo function may be used to initialize NSError objects with specific data.

    ERROR DOMAINS

    An error domain is essentially a namespace for error codes. Codes must be distinct within a single domain, although they may overlap with codes from different domains. In addition to avoiding code clashes, domains give information about the source of an issue. NSMachErrorDomain, NSPOSIXErrorDomain, NSOSStatusErrorDomain, and NSCocoaError Domain are the four primary built-in error domains. The NSCocoaError Domain includes error codes for most of Apple's standard Objective-C frameworks; however, some frameworks define their error domains (e.g., NSXMLParserErrorDomain).

    CUSTOM ERRORS

    We may set custom errors by taking a double reference to an NSError object and filling it with your data. Remember that your function or method should return an object or nil depending on its success (do not return the NSError reference).

    The following example utilizes an error rather than an exception to handle erroneous arguments sent to the generateRandomInteger() method. Observe that **error is a double-pointer, allowing us to initialize the underlying value inside the method. It is crucial to verify that the user has given a genuine **error argument using if (error != NULL). This is done in functions that generate errors. Since the **error parameter is a double-pointer, the *error parameter may assign a value to the underlying variable. Again, we check for mistakes using the return value (if (result == nil)) rather than the error variable.

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    NSNumber *generateRandomInteger(int minimum, int maximum, NSError **error) {

        if (minimum >= maximum) {
            if (error != NULL) {

                // Populate the error reference.

    `NSError's` `localizedDescription`, `localizedFailureReason`, and associated attributes are kept in its `userInfo` dictionary using special keys provided by `NSLocalizedDescriptionKey`, `NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey`, and so on. So, to characterize the issue, we just add some strings to the proper keys, as demonstrated in the previous sample.

    Generally, we should provide constants for specific error domains and codes to ensure consistency between classes.

    **THE OBJECTIVE-C LANGUAGE'S FEATURES**

    Here is a shortlist of factors that, in my opinion, make Objective-C a strong and enjoyable programming language.

    **CLASSES ARE OBJECTS**

    Each class in Objective-C is an instance of a meta-class produced and handled automatically by the runtime. It is possible to create class methods, pass classes as arguments, store them in collections, etc. We just send a message to the class we want to instantiate to generate an instance. There is no need to redesign a "factory" system. No particular constructor mechanism is required at the language level. This helps to keep the language simple and effective.

    Moreover, meta-classes are also objects!

  finalExamQuestion1: |-
    **Synthesis of Objective-C Class Properties**\n\nGiven that in Objective-C, classes are objects and meta-classes are also objects, explain how the following code demonstrates this concept:\n```objective-c
    Class myClass = @class MyClass;
    MyClass *instance = [[myClass alloc] init];
    ```\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Describe what happens when `@class MyClass` is used in the first line.\n- **Part B**: Explain why it is valid to send a message (`alloc` and `init`) to a class object (which is itself an object).\n- **Part C**: Justify why this approach simplifies the process of working with classes compared to traditional constructor-based languages.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the text's explanation that 'classes are objects' and 'meta-classes are also objects', and demonstrate understanding of how these concepts enable dynamic runtime behavior.
  finalExamQuestion2: |-
    **Application of Objective-C Runtime Concepts**\n\nThe text mentions that in Objective-C, classes are automatically generated meta-classes. Consider the following code snippet:\n```objective-c
    Class myMetaClass = object_getClass([MyClass class]);
    ```\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain what `object_getClass` does in this context and why it is used instead of directly referencing the meta-class.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the concept of a 'meta-class' allows for dynamic behavior in Objective-C, such as adding methods at runtime.\n- **Part C**: Compare this to traditional class-based languages (e.g., Java or C++), and explain why Objective-C's approach provides more flexibility in object-oriented programming.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text's discussion on meta-classes and their role in enabling dynamic runtime behavior, and demonstrate understanding of how this contrasts with static class-based languages.
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Objective-C Object Model**\n\nThe text explains that in Objective-C, classes are objects and meta-classes are also objects. Consider the following scenario: You are writing a framework that needs to dynamically add methods to existing classes at runtime.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain how you would use Objective-C''s runtime to add a new method to the `NSString` class without modifying its source code.\n- **Part B**: Discuss why this approach is more flexible than using traditional inheritance or composition in other object-oriented languages.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example of a custom category that demonstrates dynamic method addition, and explain how it leverages the object model described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of Objective-C''s runtime capabilities and show how they align with the text''s explanation that ''classes are objects'' and ''meta-classes are also objects''.'

    Similar to Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, and Groovy… Extremely beneficial since we do not always know in advance what our runtime objects will be. Using dynamic typing in Objective-C is straightforward. This, for instance, defines a variable that may store a reference to an object:

    id myObject;


    Appraisal ◾ 281

    OPTIONAL STATIC TYPING

    Nonetheless, Objective-C also supports static typing. The ideal of both worlds.

    This defines a variable capable of storing a reference to an object of type NSView or a subclass:

    NSView *myObject;

    CATEGORIES

    Categories allow us to design new methods and add them to classes whose source code we do not know (such as the standard Cocoa classes provided by Apple). This facilitates class extension without the need for subclassing. Extremely helpful for adapting existing classes to the specifications of frameworks we want to utilize or build.

    MESSAGE SENDING

    We communicate with things through messages. Typically, the recipient of a message has a method that directly corresponds to the message (i.e., that has the same name or, in Objective-C terms, the same selector). In this situation, the method will be called. Nevertheless, this is not the only potential conclusion. An object may also handle a message by forwarding it to another object, broadcasting it to many objects, introspecting it, applying custom logic, etc.

    The Syntax for Expressing Messages

    Objective-C's message patterns are similar to natural language phrases with gaps (prefixed with colons). When we create code to convey a message to an object, we fill in the blanks with real data to form a coherent statement. This expressing message is derived from Smalltalk and makes the code extremely expressive.

    Sending a message to an ordered collection, for example, requesting it to insert a specified item at index 10:

    [myCollection insert:myObject atIndex:10]

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Dynamic and Static Typing in Objective-C**\n\nCompare and contrast dynamic typing and static typing as presented in the text. Provide an example of each, and explain how they serve different purposes in object-oriented programming.\n- **Dynamic Typing Example**: Use the `id` type to demonstrate a variable that can hold any object. Explain why this is useful in Objective-C''s flexible design.\n- **Static Typing Example**: Use `NSView *myObject;` to show how it restricts the variable to a specific class type. Discuss the benefits of this restriction in terms of code safety and performance.\n- **Conclusion**: Justify why Objective-C provides both typing systems, and explain how they complement each other in practice.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between dynamic and static typing using examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of their respective roles in programming.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Categories and Message Passing**\n\nThe text describes categories as a way to add methods to existing classes without subclassing. Using this information, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain why categories are beneficial for framework integration, using an example from the text (e.g., adapting Cocoa classes).\n- **Part B**: Discuss how message passing in Objective-C allows for flexible behavior, even when the method is not directly implemented by the recipient. Use the `insert:atIndex:` example to illustrate this concept.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that explains why categories and message forwarding are essential features of Objective-C''s object model.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanation of categories and message sending, demonstrating an understanding of how these features enable dynamic and extensible programming.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Message Syntax and Object Interaction**\n\nThe text describes Objective-C''s message syntax as resembling natural language phrases with gaps (e.g., `insert:atIndex:`). Using this metaphor, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Create a custom message syntax for a hypothetical class, such as `NotificationCenter`, that sends a notification with a specific payload. Explain how your syntax aligns with the text''s description of message patterns.\n- **Part B**: Design a scenario where an object forwards a message to another object, and explain how this demonstrates the flexibility of Objective-C''s messaging system.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the expressive nature of Objective-C''s message syntax contributes to code readability and maintainability, using examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must creatively apply the text''s concepts of message syntax and object interaction, showing a deep understanding of how these features enhance programming in Objective-C.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nA message sending expression may be interpreted as a sentence, with  \nthe subject being the receiver and the message being the remainder of the  \nsentence (e.g., an action that we want the recipient to perform): \"myCollec-  \ntion insert myObject at index 10.\"\n\n282    ◾    Objective-C\n\nINTROSPECTION\n\nObject introspection is simple. For example, we may ask an object for its  \nclass using the following syntax:\n\n[myObject class]\n\nDetermine whether an object contains the method \"foo\":\n\n[myObject respondsToSelector:@selector(foo)]\n\nRequest the signature of an object's method \"foo\":\n\n[myObject methodSignatureForSelector:@selector(foo)]\n\nAsk whether a class is a subclass of another:\n\n[class1 isSubclassOfClass:class2]\n\nDYNAMIC OPERATING TIME\n\nObjective-C has a dynamic runtime. It permits the creation of messages  \nat runtime, the dynamic creation of classes, the dynamic addition of  \nmethods to existing classes, the modification of method implementations, etc.\n\nAUTOMATIC GARBAGE COLLECTION\n\nThe automated garbage collector works simultaneously with the applica-  \ntion code on its thread. It employs a generational approach to increase effi-  \nciency by focusing on memory zones that are more likely to contain trash.  \nIt works for both objects and raw C memory blocks allocated using the  \nNSAllocateCollactable() method and equivalent techniques. The malloc()  \noperates as expected, enabling access to memory that the collector does  \nnot maintain.\n\nThe garbage collector is an opt-in service; our application may instead  \ndepend on a reference counting mechanism if we prefer not to utilize it.  \nThis system has an inventive approach for delayed release that significantly  \nreduces the effort of human reference counting.\n\nNote that the iPhone does not support the automated trash collector at  \n\nthe time of writing.\n\n283    ◾    Appraisal\n\nC INSIDE\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:

    access each user or user group has to a file. As a result, it is not guaranteed that our software will have read or write access to a certain file and the necessary rights to delete or execute it. Using the isReadableFileAtPath, isWritableFileAtPath, isExecutableFileAtPath, and isDeletableFileAtPath methods is the easiest way to determine whether our application has a certain access permission. Each method accepts a single input in the form of the file's path and returns a boolean value of YES or NO. For instance, the following code fragment verifies if a file is writable:

    NSFileManager *filemgr;

    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];

    if ([filemgr isWritableFileAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt"] == YES)
            NSLog(@"The File is writable");
    else
            NSLog(@"The File is read only");

    File Moving/Renaming

    The moveItemAtURL function is used to rename a file (given proper permissions). This function gives a boolean YES or NO result and accepts as inputs the pathname of the file to be relocated, the destination path, and an optional NSError object with information about any issues found during the operation. This option is set to NULL if no error description information is required. This procedure will fail if the destination file path already exists.

    NSFileManager *filemgr;

    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];

    NSURL *oldPath = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/tmp/myfiles.txt"];
    NSURL *newPath= [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/tmp/newfiles.txt"];

    [filemgr moveItemAtURL: oldPath toURL: newPath error: nil];



    Making a File Copy

    The copyItemAtPath function is used to copy files. Like the move method, this function takes as arguments the source and destination pathnames and an optional NSError object. The returned boolean result indicates whether or not the operation was successful:

    NSFileManager *filemgr;

    filemgr = [NSFileManager defaultManager];

If the file/tmp/newfiles.txt had previously existed in the preceding example, it and any data it contained would have been replaced by the source file's contents. A more adaptable system is necessary. The Foundation Framework provides this in the form of the NSFileHandle class.\n\nManaging Files Utilizing the NSFileHandle Class\n\nThe NSFileHandle class has a variety of methods intended to give a more sophisticated mechanism for interacting with files. This class is used to manage devices and network sockets, and files. In the following sections, we will examine some of the most frequent applications of this class.\n\nCreating an Object of Type NSFileHandle\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding File Operations in Objective-C**\n\nExplain the difference between reading a file using the `contentsAtPath:` method of NSFileManager and using the `NSFileHandle` class to open a file for reading.\n- **Step 1**: Describe how `contentsAtPath:` works, including what happens to an existing file if it is used to create a new one.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast the flexibility of `NSFileHandle` with `contentsAtPath:`, highlighting its ability to handle appending data to a file.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example scenario where using `NSFileHandle` would be more appropriate than `contentsAtPath:`.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly distinguish between the two methods and demonstrate understanding of their intended use cases.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nHere is the corrected and properly formatted text from your PDF:\n\nWhen a file is opened for reading, writing, or modification, an NSFileHandle object is produced (reading and writing). The fileHandleForReadingAtPath, fileHandleForWritingAtPath, and fileHandleForUpdatingAtPath functions do this. After opening a file, it must be closed using the closeFile method after we are through working with it. If an attempt to open a file fails, such as when a non-existent file is attempted to be opened for reading, these methods return nil.\n\nThe following code sample, for instance, opens a file for reading and writing and then closes it without actually modifying the file:\n\nNSFileHandle *file;\n\nfile = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForWritingAtPath: @\"/tmp/myfiles.txt\"];\n\nif (file == nil)\n        NSLog(@\"Failed to open the file\");\n\n[file closeFile];\n\nNSFileHandle File Offsets and Seeking\n\nNSFileHandle objects keep track of the current location inside a file. This is known as file offset. When a file is opened for the first time, its offset is 0 (the beginning of the file). This indicates that all read or write operations using the NSFileHandle methods will begin at offset 0 in the file. To conduct actions at various positions inside a file, such as appending data to the end, it is essential to first seek for the desired offset. Use the seekToEndOfFile function to relocate the current offset to the end of the file. For instance, seekToFileOffset enables us to define the specific place inside the file where the offset should be positioned. The last way to identify the current offset is the offsetInFile method. The offset is saved as an unsigned long to accommodate large file sizes.\n\nThe following example opens a file for reading and then uses a series of methods to shift the offset to various locations, printing the current offset after each change:\n\nNSFileHandle *file;\n\nfile = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForUpdatingAtPath:  \n@\"/tmp/myfiles.txt\"];\n\nif (file == nil)\n        NSLog(@\"Failed to open the file\");\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding File Handling in Objective-C**\n\nExplain how NSFileHandle objects are used to manage file operations such as reading, writing, and closing files. Include the following elements in your explanation:\n- The purpose of the `fileHandleForReadingAtPath`, `fileHandleForWritingAtPath`, and `fileHandleForUpdatingAtPath` methods.\n- The importance of calling the `closeFile` method after file operations are complete.\n- A brief description of how file offsets work, including the use of `seekToEndOfFile` and `seekToFileOffset`.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must be comprehensive and demonstrate a clear understanding of the NSFileHandle class and its role in file management.'

    **Logical Reasoning with File Operations**\n\nConsider the following code snippet from the text:\n\n```
    NSFileHandle *file;

    file = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForWritingAtPath: @"/tmp/myfiles.txt");
    if (file == nil)
            NSLog(@"Failed to open the file");

    [file closeFile];
    ```\n\n- **Part A**: What is the purpose of this code? Explain why it does not actually modify the file.\n- **Part B**: Suppose you want to write "Hello, World!" to the file. Rewrite the code to achieve this goal. Include at least two methods from the NSFileHandle class in your solution.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of not calling `closeFile` on an NSFileHandle object.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analyzing File Offset Manipulation**\n\nThe text describes how to change the current offset within a file using methods like `seekToEndOfFile` and `seekToFileOffset`. Consider the following scenario:\n\n1. A file is opened for updating.\n2. The initial offset is 0 (beginning of the file).\n3. `seekToEndOfFile` is called.\n4. `seekToFileOffset: 100` is called.\n5. `offsetInFile` is called to retrieve the current offset.\n\n- **Part A**: What is the final value returned by `offsetInFile` after these steps? Justify your answer based on how file offsets work in NSFileHandle.\n- **Part B**: Explain why it is important to manage file offsets when performing multiple read/write operations on a single file. Provide an example of a situation where improper offset management could lead to data corruption.\n- **Part C**: How does the use of `seekToFileOffset:` differ from using `seekToEndOfFile`? In what scenarios would each method be more appropriate?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate logical reasoning about file offset manipulation and its implications for file operations in Objective-C.'

The readDataOfLength function\nreads a specified number of bytes from a file, beginning at the current\n\noffset. For example, the code below reads 5 bytes from offset 10 in a file.\nThe data read is returned in the form of an NSData object:\n\nNSFileHandle *file;\nNSData *databuffer;\n\nfile = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:  \n@\"/tmp/myfiles.txt\"];\n\nif (file == nil)\n        NSLog(@\"Failed to open the file\");\n\n[file seekToFileOffset: 10];\n\ndatabuffer = [file readDataOfLength: 5];\n\n[file closeFile];\n\nDATA SAVING TO A FILE\n\nThe writeData method writes the data in an NSData object to the file\nbeginning at the offset point. In Objective-C, it should be noted that this\ndoes not insert data but rather replaces any existing data in the file at the\nrelevant spot.\n\nTo see this in action, we must first create a file. Create a file called\nquickfox.txt in the/tmp directory, enter the following content, and save it:\n\nThe quick brown fox overtook the sluggish hound.\nNext, we'll develop a program that opens the file for updating, navigates\n\nto position 10, and then adds some data there:\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n```\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

Explain how this relates to the concept of reading from a specific offset.\n- **Part B**: What would be the result of calling [file writeData:databuffer] after seeking to offset 20, if databuffer contains 10 bytes of data? Justify your answer based on the text''s description of writing data to files.\n- **Part C**: Construct a scenario where reading and writing to different offsets in a file would overwrite existing data.

    In today's age of ubiquitous mobile devices and constant Internet connections, networking is a fundamental issue. On iOS alone, many Apps use the network in one way or another, either by utilizing built-in mechanisms such as iCloud synchronization or GameKit's communication architecture or by communicating directly with Internet-based servers. In addition, customer expectations often conflict with the capabilities and constraints of wide-area mobile networks like EDGE, 3G, and HDPSA+, leaving you, the application developer, to optimize a high-latency, low-throughput network channel.

    Fortunately, I have vast knowledge and expertise to contribute to this subject. This section presented the URL loading mechanism and asynchronous, synchronous, and synthetic-synchronous network access. We will learn the best practices for handling various forms of data transmitted via the network and how to handle system-independent binary data effectively. We will also learn how to identify services on the network and establish your services and make their information accessible in the same way.

    Probably most significantly, we will discover the reasoning behind the following network-centric programming fundamentals on the Mac and iOS:

    • The main thread should never visit the network.

    • When feasible, use asynchronous network primitives.

    • Use streams for all data processing.

    • Ensure that data processing and transport handling are ignorant of one other.

    BASIC PRINCIPLES

    While the data access APIs on the Mac and iOS are typically storage-agnostic, there might be significant differences between loading a file from a disc and reading it through the network. To reinforce the teachings of this section, we'll take a few moments to clarify these distinctions and provide a solid foundation for whatever we may learn about networking in the future.

    With both network and local file access, several issues might affect the performance of our program. These fall into two major categories:

    The text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Network Programming Principles**\n\nBased on the principles outlined in the text, explain why it is "best practice" to avoid having the main thread perform network operations. Your answer should incorporate at least two of the following concepts from the text: asynchronous network primitives, streams for data processing, and the separation of data processing from transport handling.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how these principles work together to ensure a responsive user interface and efficient resource management.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Network Access Best Practices**\n\nThe text discusses the differences between loading data from a local file and retrieving it over the network. Design a simple iOS application that demonstrates the following:\n- **Part A**: Load a local file asynchronously using streams, ensuring that the main thread remains unblocked.\n- **Part B**: Retrieve the same data from a remote server using asynchronous network primitives, and compare the performance characteristics of both approaches.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the separation of data processing and transport handling ensures that your application can handle both local and remote data sources seamlessly.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a clear description of each component and demonstrate an understanding of the underlying principles from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Network Programming Fundamentals**\n\nThe text emphasizes that "the main thread should never visit the network." Consider a scenario where an iOS app needs to fetch real-time stock prices from a server.\n- **Part A**: Justify why this operation must be handled asynchronously and not on the main thread, using the principles discussed in the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that explains why streams are preferred for data processing over direct memory allocation, referencing the text''s discussion on streams and data handling.\n- **Part C**: Design a system where both local file access and network requests are handled in a way that maintains separation between data processing and transport handling. Explain how this system adheres to the best practices outlined in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts from the text and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of network programming fundamentals.'

    Latency in Objective-C refers to the length of time required to reach the desired resource. This often refers to the seek-time of the underlying storage media when discussing local drives. This refers to the round-trip time of a network command packet.

    Throughput is the rate at which data may be sent to or retrieved from a resource. Typically, local drives have a fast throughput and may transfer hundreds of megabytes per second. This might range from tens of gigabytes per second to a few kilobytes per second on a network.

    Bandwidth availability is also related to these two categories. For local storage, reads and writes often pass across a hardware bus, which offers a much greater throughput than hard drives. Therefore, unless many discs are used concurrently, the total throughput is likely to equal that of the physical media utilized by a specific process. This indicates that if we read or write to numerous devices simultaneously, we will likely not see a significant increase in the throughput of each device compared to if we handled each device individually.

    However, on the network, available bandwidth is often far more limited, and a single activity may rapidly use all available bandwidth, saturating the connection. Therefore, conducting multiple processes in parallel would likely result in a slowdown of all activities as the available bandwidth is divided among them. In addition, there are other nodes, such as wireless access points and routers, between your device and the real resource. Any of them may have bandwidth issues and any number of other clients, and they may impose particular restrictions to prevent anyone client from using excessive bandwidth. Many popular access points and routers, for instance, only let four concurrent HTTP requests from a single client to a single destination resource; all others are denied until some of the first four are completed. Therefore, it is generally advantageous for HTTP client software to apply the same restriction internally to prevent several concurrent activities from spinning their wheels and using local resources like memory, CPU, and battery life.

    In contrast, there is often minimal difference when requesting several resources from the same place through the network, although doing so with files on the same local disc might cause a significant slowdown. The seek time is the root source of delay in disk-based storage systems. When reading a single huge file, the disc will search the file once and then read a (mostly) contiguous stream of data. When multiple files are being read and written concurrently, the disk's read head must repeatedly travel back and forth across the magnetic platter to switch between the files, resulting in disc thrashing. These clunking and clicking noises are audible during moments of intense computer activity. Recent advancements in solid-state storage have led to the widespread use of solid-state drives (SSDs) over platter-based magnetic hard disc drives; therefore, the latency issue is far less of a concern in such storage systems. The iPhone employs solid-state storage.

    NETWORK DELAY

    The most common causes of latency in network transmissions are network congestion (which may occur at any point along the path) or inefficiency of the underlying transmission protocol. Both wired and wireless network connections employ variants of the Ethernet protocol. This protocol is responsible for identifying other devices on the local network and efficiently transporting data between them. However, mobile devices using the cellular network use a protocol such as GSM or HSDPA, which must sustain data throughput even when devices are traveling fast between endpoints such as cell towers. Consequently, these protocols have substantial overhead compared to Ethernet. This is exacerbated because most Ethernet or Wi-Fi devices have throughputs in the tens or hundreds of megabits per second, but HSDPA+ and "4G"1 cellular networks are only starting to surpass the 15 Mbit threshold. Consequently, it is usual to delay up to a full second (or even two!) while establishing a connection via a cellular network, especially with slower protocols such as GSM and 3G.

    If your application makes many connections, such as when retrieving data from a server using the HTTP protocol, the latency might be a significant issue. Imagine you must make around 20 distinct calls to get a complete list of 200 comments (the server returns 10 per page). By default, each call will establish a new connection, and each connection will have significant latency. If the latency is high, regardless of the actual throughput speed, this will take between 10 and 40 seconds, which is not a pleasant experience. If throughput is similarly sluggish, the situation worsens. I've seen an implementation of synchronizing data from such an API take over an hour when many calls are to be performed, with network delay accounting for over half of that time.

    ASYNCHRONICITY

    With so many possible problems awaiting that, we must interact with network resources in an entirely asynchronous manner. We cannot emphasize this point enough: it must always be asynchronous, regardless of the circumstances.

    It is easy to convince oneself in Objective-C that something does not need asynchronous execution. Possibly we use the network seldom; perhaps we only transmit or receive minimal quantities of data. Maybe we merely transfer data and do not wait for a response, or we only do network activities in reaction to user interaction. We've heard all these justifications, but we have some bad news: the network will still catch us. For instance:

    • We seldom use the network: If we do it seldom, the user is probably not anticipating it. Our user is more likely to be frustrated if our infrequent action causes the program to become unresponsive than if it were a regular occurrence since they cannot anticipate when it will occur.

    • We only transmit tiny data packets: Little packets may travel relatively rapidly on networks with limited capacity, but network delay disregards packet size. Establishing the connection may take so long that the program becomes unresponsive, even for a short time, which is a Bad Thing.

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThere are two fundamental types of sockets.\n\nStream sockets are meant to transmit vast volumes of ordered data between two ends of a connection. Typically, the underlying transport guarantees material delivery in the right sequence.\n\nOn the other hand, Datagram sockets do not give any delivery or ordering assurances. Each datagram is treated as an independent entity, and no effort is taken to guarantee that all datagrams follow the same path across \n\nAppraisal ◾ 299\n\nthe network. Depending on each node's circumstances and travel, each datagram might take a different path.\n\nDatagram sockets, typically utilizing the Unified Datagram Protocol (UDP) over the Internet Protocol (IP), are typically used for streaming media. A datagram from a specific location in the underlying data stream is expected to arrive at a specific time. Still, the data is reassembled without receiving every byte in order. If we've ever seen a live webcast, we've likely seen the speaker's picture replaced with fragments of an earlier frame, looking twisted and wrapped to follow the speaker's movement. This demonstrates the absence of datagrams. Occasionally, the video data offers a whole frame, and in between, the data consists simply of alterations to apply to the previous frame to form the current frame. When a whole frame is missing, the picture of the incorrect frame is warped to construct a new one, resulting in the aforementioned aesthetic effect.\n\nStreaming sockets and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over IP are used for most network communication. TCP guarantees delivery at the expense of time-to-destination guarantees. If a problem occurs during the transfer, the receiving endpoint may verify that it got the packet correctly and request a resend if necessary.\n\nThe text is from Objective-C The Ultimate Guide by Sufyan bin Uzayr."

These let each endpoint transmit the amount of data it can effectively handle to the other.  \nConsequently, unlike UDP (Unified Datagram Protocol), an endpoint  \nnever transmits data that the recipient cannot presently process. On the  \nother hand, Datagram protocols are intended to send data as quickly as  \npossible (or at least at a constant pace), enabling the receiver to simply  \nignore any packets that come before it can process them.\n\nWe shall use TCP/IP rather than datagrams in the following instances.  \nDatagram protocols often need additional application-level work to effec-\ntively handle failures such as missing packets, which is outside the scope  \nof this book.\n\nThe Internet Protocol sits underneath the TCP and UDP protocols.

For example, a conventional HTTP connection would provide a protocol of HTTP, a host of www.apple.com, and a port of 80 (the default port for HTTP services).\n\nAn example realm for HTTP may be a subfolder: presumably, most of the host is available, but accessing www.testsite.com/secure/ needs a credential. In this case, the realm would be \"secure\" since the credential would only provide access to objects inside the folder resource. The protection area also offers data such as the certificate trust chain for a secure connection and information on whether the credential will be transferred securely. We may use any of these to determine whether or not to return a valid credential to the server.\n\nThe essence of the issue is the generation of an NSURLCredential object.
