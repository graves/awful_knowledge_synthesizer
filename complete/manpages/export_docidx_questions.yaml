The proper way to use this\n       functionality is through the package doctools::idx::export and the\n       export manager objects it provides.\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       docidx export plugin API version 2.\n\n       export serial configuration\n\t      This command takes the canonical serialization of a keyword\n\t      index, as specified in section Keyword index serialization\n\t      format, and contained in serial, the configuration, a\n\t      dictionary, and generates docidx markup encoding the index.  The\n\t      created string is then returned as the result of the command.\n\n[DOCIDX] NOTATION OF KEYWORD INDICES\n       The docidx format for keyword indices, also called the docidx markup\n       language, is too large to be covered in single section.\tThe interested\n       reader should start with the document\n\n       [1]    docidx language introduction\n\n       and then proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the\n       documents\n\n       [1]    docidx language syntax and\n\n       [2]    docidx language command reference.\n\n       to get a thorough understanding of the language.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       The docidx export plugin recognizes the following configuration\n       variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.\n\n       string user\n\t      This standard configuration variable contains the name of the\n\t      user running the process which invoked the export plugin.  The\n\t      plugin puts this information into the provenance comment at the\n\t      beginning of the generated document.\n\n       string file\n\t      This standard configuration variable contains the name of the\n\t      file the index came from. This variable may not be set or\n\t      contain the empty string.  The plugin puts this information, if\n\t      defined, i.e. set and not the empty string, into the provenance\n\t      comment at the beginning of the generated document.\n\n       boolean newlines\n\t      If this flag is set the plugin will break the generated docidx\n\t      code across lines, with each markup command on a separate line.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the whole document will\n\t      be written on a single line, with minimum spacing between all\n\t      elements.\n\n       boolean indented\n\t      If this flag is set the plugin will indent the markup commands\n\t      according to the structure of indices. To make this work this\n\t      also implies that newlines is set. This effect is independent of\n\t      the value for aligned however.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted\n\t      as per the values of newlines and aligned, and no indenting is\n\t      done.\n\n       boolean aligned\n\t      If this flag is set the generator ensures that the arguments for\n\t      the manpage and url commands in a keyword section are aligned\n\t      vertically for a nice table effect. To make this work this also\n\t      implies that newlines is set. This effect is independent of the\n\t      value for indented however.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted\n\t      as per the values of newlines and indented, and no alignment is\n\t      done.\n\n       Note that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variables\n       format, and map, and their values.\n\nKEYWORD INDEX SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to\n       serialize keyword indices as immutable values for transport,\n       comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations. While a\n       keyword index may have more than one regular serialization only exactly\n       one of them will be canonical.\n\n       regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    An index serialization is a nested Tcl dictionary.\n\n\t      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, doctools::idx, and\n\t\t     its value. This value holds the contents of the index.\n\n\t      [3]    The contents of the index are a Tcl dictionary holding\n\t\t     the title of the index, a label, and the keywords and\n\t\t     references. The relevant keys and their values are\n\n\t\t     title  The value is a string containing the title of the\n\t\t\t    index.\n\n\t\t     label  The value is a string containing a label for the\n\t\t\t    index.\n\n\t\t     keywords\n\t\t\t    The value is a Tcl dictionary, using the keywords\n\t\t\t    known to the index as keys. The associated values\n\t\t\t    are lists containing the identifiers of the\n\t\t\t    references associated with that particular\n\t\t\t    keyword.\n\n\t\t\t    Any reference identifier used in these lists has\n\t\t\t    to exist as a key in the references dictionary,\n\t\t\t    see the next item for its definition.\n\n\t\t     references\n\t\t\t    The value is a Tcl dictionary, using the\n\t\t\t    identifiers for the references known to the index\n\t\t\t    as keys. The associated values are 2-element lists\n\t\t\t    containing the type and label of the reference, in\n\t\t\t    this order.\n\n\t\t\t    Any key here has to be associated with at least\n\t\t\t    one keyword, i.e. occur in at least one of the\n\t\t\t    reference lists which are the values in the\n\t\t\t    keywords dictionary, see previous item for its\n\t\t\t    definition.\n\n\t      [4]    The type of a reference can be one of two values,\n\n\t\t     manpage\n\t\t\t    The identifier of the reference is interpreted as\n\t\t\t    symbolic file name, refering to one of the\n\t\t\t    documents the index was made for.\n\n\t\t     url    The identifier of the reference is interpreted as\n\t\t\t    an url, refering to some external location, like a\n\t\t\t    website, etc.\n\n       canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a keyword index has the format as\n\t      specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies\n\t      the constraints below, which make it unique among all the\n\t      possible serializations of the keyword index.\n\n\t      [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are\n\t\t     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by\n\t\t     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.\n\n\t      [2]    The references listed for each keyword of the index, if\n\t\t     any, are listed in ascending dictionary order of their\n\t\t     labels, as generated by Tcl's builtin command lsort\n\t\t     -increasing -dict.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
