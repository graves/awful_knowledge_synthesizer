           "File::Glob" has a function called "glob", which just calls "bsd_glob".

           "File::Glob::glob()" was deprecated in Perl 5.8. A deprecation message

           To enable multiline matching one should use the "/m" regexp modifier

    In Perl 5.30, it will no longer be possible to use sysread(), recv(),
           syswrite() or send() to read or send bytes from/to :utf8 handles.

           Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a
           delimiter.

           A grapheme is what appears to a native-speaker of a language to be a
           character.  In Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may actually be
           several adjacent characters that together form a complete grapheme.
           For example, there can be a base character, like "R" and an accent,
           like a circumflex "^", that appear to be a single character when
           displayed, with the circumflex hovering over the "R".

           As of Perl 5.30, use of delimiters which are non-standalone graphemes
           is fatal, in order to move the language to be able to accept multi-
           character graphemes as delimiters.

           Also, as of Perl 5.30, delimiters which are unassigned code points but
           that may someday become assigned are prohibited.  Otherwise, code that
           works today would fail to compile if the currently unassigned delimiter
           ends up being something that isn't a stand-alone grapheme.  Because
           Unicode is never going to assign non-character code points, nor code
           points that are above the legal Unicode maximum, those can be
           delimiters.

           You should be using two different symbols instead.

           ${^ENCODING} is no longer supported.

           The special variable "${^ENCODING}" was used to implement the
           "encoding" pragma. Setting this variable to anything other than "undef"
           was deprecated in Perl 5.22. Full deprecation of the variable happened
           in Perl 5.25.3.

           Setting this variable to anything other than an undefined value throws
           a fatal error as of Perl 5.28.

           "B::OP::terse"

           This method, which just calls "B::Concise::b_terse", has been
           deprecated, and disappeared in Perl 5.28. Please use "B::Concise"
           instead.

    Manpage text:

    As an (ahem) accidental feature, "AUTOLOAD" subroutines were looked up
           as methods (using the @ISA hierarchy) even when the subroutines to be
           autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g. "Foo::bar()"), not as
           methods (e.g. "Foo->bar()" or "$obj->bar()").

           This bug was deprecated in Perl 5.004, has been rectified in Perl 5.28
           by using method lookup only for methods' "AUTOLOAD"s.

           The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-
           methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used to
           depend on inheriting "AUTOLOAD" for non-methods from a base class named
           "BaseClass", execute "*AUTOLOAD = \&BaseClass::AUTOLOAD" during
           startup.

           In code that currently says "use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);"
           you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change "use AutoLoader;" to
           "use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';".

           Use of code points over 0xFF in string bitwise operators

           The string bitwise operators, "&", "|", "^", and "~", treat their
           operands as strings of bytes. As such, values above 0xFF are
           nonsensical. Using such code points with these operators was deprecated
           in Perl 5.24, and is fatal as of Perl 5.28.

    In XS code, use of "to_utf8_case()"

           This function has been removed as of Perl 5.28; instead convert to call
           the appropriate one of: "toFOLD_utf8_safe".  "toLOWER_utf8_safe",

           "--libpods" in "Pod::Html"

           Since Perl 5.18, the option "--libpods" has been deprecated, and using
           this option did not do anything other than producing a warning.

           The "--libpods" option is no longer recognized as of Perl 5.26.

           The utilities "c2ph" and "pstruct"

           These old, perl3-era utilities have been deprecated in favour of "h2xs"
           for a long time. As of Perl 5.26, they have been removed.

           Trapping "$SIG {__DIE__}" other than during program exit.

           The $SIG{__DIE__} hook is called even inside an "eval()". It was never
           intended to happen this way, but an implementation glitch made this
           possible. This used to be deprecated, as it allowed strange action at a
           distance like rewriting a pending exception in $@. Plans to rectify
           this have been scrapped, as users found that rewriting a pending
           exception is actually a useful feature, and not a bug.

    Calling POSIX::%s() is deprecated

           The following functions in the "POSIX" module are no longer available:
           "isalnum", "isalpha", "iscntrl", "isdigit", "isgraph", "islower",
           "isprint", "ispunct", "isspace", "isupper", and "isxdigit".  The
           functions are buggy and don't work on UTF-8 encoded strings.  See their
           entries in POSIX for more information.

           The functions were deprecated in Perl 5.20, and removed in Perl 5.24.

       Perl 5.16
           Use of %s on a handle without * is deprecated

           It used to be possible to use "tie", "tied" or "untie" on a scalar
           while the scalar holds a typeglob. This caused its filehandle to be
           tied. It left no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob,
           and no way to untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.

           This was deprecated in Perl 5.14, and the bug was fixed in Perl 5.16.

           So now "tie $scalar" will always tie the scalar, not the handle it
           holds.  To tie the handle, use "tie *$scalar" (with an explicit
           asterisk).  The same applies to "tied *$scalar" and "untie *$scalar".
