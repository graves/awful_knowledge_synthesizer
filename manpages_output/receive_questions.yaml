They are in essence convenient wrappers\n       around the builtin commands read and fileevent.\n\n       ::term::receive::getch ?chan?\n\t      This command reads a single character from the channel with\n\t      handle chan and returns it as the result of the command.\n\n\t      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.\n\n\t      It is the responsibility of the caller to make sure that the\n\t      channel can provide single characters. On unix this can be done,\n\t      for example, by using the command of package\n\t      term::ansi::ctrl::unix.\n\n       ::term::receive::listen cmd ?chan?\n\t      This command sets up a filevent listener for the channel with\n\t      handle chan and invokes the command prefix cmd whenever\n\t      characters have been received, or EOF was reached.\n\n\t      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.\n\n\t      The signature of the command prefix is\n\n\t      cmd process string\n\t\t     This method is invoked when characters were received, and\n\t\t     string holds them for processing.\n\n\t      cmd eof\n\t\t     This method is invoked when EOF was reached on the\n\t\t     channel we listen on.  It will be the last call to be\n\t\t     received by the callback.\n\n       ::term::receive::unlisten ?chan?\n\t      This command disables the filevent listener for the channel with\n\t      handle chan.\n\n\t      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.

Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       character input, control, get character, listener, receiver, terminal\n\nCATEGORY\n       Terminal control\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2006 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
