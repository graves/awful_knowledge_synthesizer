    The macro STAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE traverses the tail queue referenced by head
         in the forward direction, assigning each element in turn to var.
         However, unlike STAILQ_FOREACH() here it is permitted to both remove var
         as well as free it from within the loop safely without interfering with
         the traversal.

         The macro STAILQ_INIT initializes the tail queue referenced by head.

         The macro STAILQ_INSERT_HEAD inserts the new element elm at the head of
         the tail queue.

         The macro STAILQ_INSERT_TAIL inserts the new element elm at the end of
         the tail queue.

         The macro STAILQ_INSERT_AFTER inserts the new element elm after the
         element listelm.

         The macro STAILQ_LAST returns the last item on the tail queue.  If the
         tail queue is empty the return value is NULL.

         The macro STAILQ_NEXT returns the next item on the tail queue, or NULL
         this item is the last.

         The macro STAILQ_REMOVE_HEAD removes the element at the head of the tail
         queue.  For optimum efficiency, elements being removed from the head of
         the tail queue should use this macro explicitly rather than the generic

    struct HEADNAME *headp;

         (The names head and headp are user selectable.)

         The macro TAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER evaluates to an initializer for the tail
         queue head.

         The macro TAILQ_CONCAT concatenates the tail queue headed by head2 onto
         the end of the one headed by head1 removing all entries from the former.

         The macro TAILQ_EMPTY evaluates to true if there are no items on the tail
         queue.

         The macro TAILQ_ENTRY declares a structure that connects the elements in
         the tail queue.

         The macro TAILQ_FIRST returns the first item on the tail queue or NULL if
         the tail queue is empty.

         The macro TAILQ_FOREACH traverses the tail queue referenced by head in
         the forward direction, assigning each element in turn to var.  var is set
         to NULL if the loop completes normally, or if there were no elements.

         The macro TAILQ_FOREACH_REVERSE traverses the tail queue referenced by
         head in the reverse direction, assigning each element in turn to var.

    Manpage text:

    The macros TAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE and TAILQ_FOREACH_REVERSE_SAFE traverse the
         list referenced by head in the forward or reverse direction respectively,
         assigning each element in turn to var.  However, unlike their unsafe
         counterparts, TAILQ_FOREACH and TAILQ_FOREACH_REVERSE permit to both
         remove var as well as free it from within the loop safely without
         interfering with the traversal.

         The macro TAILQ_INIT initializes the tail queue referenced by head.

         The macro TAILQ_INSERT_HEAD inserts the new element elm at the head of
         the tail queue.

         The macro TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL inserts the new element elm at the end of the
         tail queue.

         The macro TAILQ_INSERT_AFTER inserts the new element elm after the
         element listelm.

         The macro TAILQ_INSERT_BEFORE inserts the new element elm before the
         element listelm.

         The macro TAILQ_LAST returns the last item on the tail queue.  If the
         tail queue is empty the return value is NULL.

         The macro TAILQ_NEXT returns the next item on the tail queue, or NULL if
         this item is the last.
