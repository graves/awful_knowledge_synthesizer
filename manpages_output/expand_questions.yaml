Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `expand`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nEXPAND(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t     EXPAND(1)\n\nNAME\n     expand, unexpand – expand tabs to spaces, and vice versa\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     expand [-t tab1,tab2,...,tabn] [file ...]\n     unexpand [-a | -t tab1,tab2,...,tabn] [file ...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The expand utility processes the named files or the standard input\n     writing the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.  Backspace\n     characters are preserved into the output and decrement the column count\n     for tab calculations.  The expand utility is useful for pre-processing\n     character files (before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that\n     contain tabs.\n\n     The unexpand utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input\n     or the named files and writes the result on the standard output.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -a      (unexpand only.)  By default, only leading blanks and tabs are\n\t     reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.  If the -a option is\n\t     given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the\n\t     resultant file by replacing two or more characters."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the expand and unexpand utilities?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the expand command to convert tabs to spaces in a file named 'input.txt' with specific tab stops at positions 8 and 16?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to convert a file 'data.txt' back into its original tab-based format using unexpand, ensuring that all sequences of two or more spaces are replaced with a single tab?

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the expand command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the expand command to set tab stops every 4 columns instead of the default 8?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the expand command with multiple tab stops at specific column positions?
