The query can be a string\n     or a query expression.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -0 \t Prints an ASCII NUL character after each result path.\tThis\n\t\t is useful when used in conjunction with xargs -0.\n\n     -live\t Causes the mdfind command to provide live-updates to the\n\t\t number of files matching the query.  When an update causes\n\t\t the query results to change the number of matches is updated.\n\t\t The find can be cancelled by typing ctrl-C.\n\n     -count\t Causes the mdfind command to output the total number of\n\t\t matches, instead of the path to the matching items.\n\n     -onlyin dir\n\t\t Limit the scope of the search to the directory specified."
