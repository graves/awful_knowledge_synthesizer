Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl5122delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERL5122DELTA(1)       Perl Programmers Reference Guide       PERL5122DELTA(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perl5122delta - what is new for perl v5.12.2\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This document describes differences between the 5.12.1 release and the\n       5.12.2 release.\n\n       If you are upgrading from an earlier major version, such as 5.10.1,\n       first read perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.0\n       and 5.12.0, as well as perl5121delta, which describes earlier changes\n       in the 5.12 stable release series.\n\nIncompatible Changes\n       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.1. If any\n       exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.\n\nCore Enhancements\n       Other than the bug fixes listed below, there should be no user-visible\n       changes to the core language in this release.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   New Modules and Pragmata\n       This release does not introduce any new modules or pragmata.\n\n   Pragmata Changes\n       In the previous release, \"no VERSION;\" statements triggered a bug which\n       could cause feature bundles to be loaded and strict mode to be enabled\n       unintentionally.\n\n   Updated Modules\n       \"Carp\"\n\t   Upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.\n\n\t   Carp now detects incomplete caller() overrides and avoids using\n\t   bogus @DB::args. To provide backtraces, Carp relies on particular\n\t   behaviour of the caller built-in. Carp now detects if other code\n\t   has overridden this with an incomplete implementation, and modifies\n\t   its backtrace accordingly. Previously incomplete overrides would\n\t   cause incorrect values in backtraces (best case), or obscure fatal\n\t   errors (worst case)\n\n\t   This fixes certain cases of \"Bizarre copy of ARRAY\" caused by\n\t   modules overriding \"caller()\" incorrectly.\n\n       \"CPANPLUS\"\n\t   A patch to cpanp-run-perl has been backported from CPANPLUS 0.9004.\n\t   This resolves RT #55964\n\t   <http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55964> and RT #57106\n\t   <http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=57106>, both of\n\t   which related to failures to install distributions that use\n\t   \"Module::Install::DSL\".\n\n       \"File::Glob\"\n\t   A regression which caused a failure to find \"CORE::GLOBAL::glob\"\n\t   after loading \"File::Glob\" to crash has been fixed.\tNow, it\n\t   correctly falls back to external globbing via \"pp_glob\".\n\n       \"File::Copy\"\n\t   \"File::Copy::copy(FILE, DIR)\" is now documented.\n\n       \"File::Spec\"\n\t   Upgraded from version 3.31 to 3.31_01.\n\n\t   Several portability fixes were made in \"File::Spec::VMS\": a colon\n\t   is now recognized as a delimiter in native filespecs; caret-escaped\n\t   delimiters are recognized for better handling of extended\n\t   filespecs; \"catpath()\" returns an empty directory rather than the\n\t   current directory if the input directory name is empty; \"abs2rel()\"\n\t   properly handles Unix-style input.\n\nUtility Changes\n       •   perlbug now always gives the reporter a chance to change the email\n\t   address it guesses for them.\n\n       •   perlbug should no longer warn about uninitialized values when using\n\t   the \"-d\" and \"-v\" options.\n\nChanges to Existing Documentation\n       •   The existing policy on backward-compatibility and deprecation has\n\t   been added to perlpolicy, along with definitions of terms like\n\t   deprecation.\n\n       •   \"srand\" in perlfunc's usage has been clarified.\n\n       •   The entry for \"die\" in perlfunc was reorganized to emphasize its\n\t   role in the exception mechanism.\n\n       •   Perl's INSTALL file has been clarified to explicitly state that\n\t   Perl requires a C89 compliant ANSI C Compiler.\n\n       •   IO::Socket's \"getsockopt()\" and \"setsockopt()\" have been\n\t   documented.\n\n       •   alarm()'s inability to interrupt blocking IO on Windows has been\n\t   documented.\n\n       •   Math::TrulyRandom hasn't been updated since 1996 and has been\n\t   removed as a recommended solution for random number generation.\n\n       •   perlrun has been updated to clarify the behaviour of octal flags to\n\t   perl.\n\n       •   To ease user confusion, $# and $*, two special variables that were\n\t   removed in earlier versions of Perl have been documented.\n\n       •   The version of perlfaq shipped with the Perl core has been updated\n\t   from the official FAQ version, which is now maintained in the\n\t   \"briandfoy/perlfaq\" branch of the Perl repository at\n\t   <git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git>.\n\nInstallation and Configuration Improvements\n   Configuration improvements\n       •   The \"d_u32align\" configuration probe on ARM has been fixed.\n\n   Compilation improvements\n       •   An \"\"incompatible operand types\"\" error in ternary expressions when\n\t   building with \"clang\" has been fixed.\n\n       •   Perl now skips setuid \"File::Copy\" tests on partitions it detects\n\t   to be mounted as \"nosuid\".\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       •   A possible segfault in the \"T_PRTOBJ\" default typemap has been\n\t   fixed.\n\n       •   A possible memory leak when using caller() to set @DB::args has\n\t   been fixed.\n\n       •   Several memory leaks when loading XS modules were fixed.\n\n       •   \"unpack()\" now handles scalar context correctly for %32H and %32u,\n\t   fixing a potential crash.  \"split()\" would crash because the third\n\t   item on the stack wasn't the regular expression it expected.\n\t   \"unpack(\"%2H\", ...)\" would return both the unpacked result and the\n\t   checksum on the stack, as would \"unpack(\"%2u\", ...)\".  [GH #10257]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10257>\n\n       •   Perl now avoids using memory after calling \"free()\" in pp_require\n\t   when there are CODEREFs in @INC.\n\n       •   A bug that could cause \"\"Unknown error\"\" messages when\n\t   \"\"call_sv(code, G_EVAL)\"\" is called from an XS destructor has been\n\t   fixed.\n\n       •   The implementation of the \"open $fh, '>' \\$buffer\" feature now\n\t   supports get/set magic and thus tied buffers correctly.\n\n       •   The \"pp_getc\", \"pp_tell\", and \"pp_eof\" opcodes now make room on the\n\t   stack for their return values in cases where no argument was passed\n\t   in.\n\n       •   When matching unicode strings under some conditions inappropriate\n\t   backtracking would result in a \"Malformed UTF-8 character (fatal)\"\n\t   error. This should no longer occur.\tSee  [GH #10434]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10434>\n\nPlatform Specific Notes\n   AIX\n       •   README.aix has been updated with information about the XL C/C++ V11\n\t   compiler suite.\n\n   Windows\n       •   When building Perl with the mingw64 x64 cross-compiler \"incpath\",\n\t   \"libpth\", \"ldflags\", \"lddlflags\" and \"ldflags_nolargefiles\" values\n\t   in Config.pm and Config_heavy.pl were not previously being set\n\t   correctly because, with that compiler, the include and lib\n\t   directories are not immediately below \"$(CCHOME)\".\n\n   VMS\n       •   git_version.h is now installed on VMS. This was an oversight in\n\t   v5.12.0 which caused some extensions to fail to build.\n\n       •   Several memory leaks in stat() have been fixed.\n\n       •   A memory leak in \"Perl_rename()\" due to a double allocation has\n\t   been fixed.\n\n       •   A memory leak in \"vms_fid_to_name()\" (used by \"realpath()\" and\n\t   \"realname()\") has been fixed.\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.12.2 represents approximately three months of development since\n       Perl 5.12.1 and contains approximately 2,000 lines of changes across\n       100 files from 36 authors.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers.

There may also be\n       information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please\n       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed\n       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core\n       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,\n       figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to\n       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is\n       supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl\n       core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5122DELTA(1)"
