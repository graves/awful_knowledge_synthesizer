The result of the command is the\n\t      empty string.\n\n\t      If the argument canonvar is specified it is interpreted as the\n\t      name of a variable in the calling context. This variable will be\n\t      written to if and only if serial is a valid regular\n\t      serialization. Its value will be a boolean, with True indicating\n\t      that the serialization is not only valid, but also canonical.\n\t      False will be written for a valid, but non-canonical\n\t      serialization.\n\n\t      For the specification of regular and canonical serializations\n\t      see the section ToC serialization format.\n\n       ::doctools::toc::structure verify-as-canonical serial\n\t      This command verifies that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      canonical serialization of a table of contents and will throw an\n\t      error if that is not the case. The result of the command is the\n\t      empty string.\n\n\t      For the specification of canonical serializations see the\n\t      section ToC serialization format.\n\n       ::doctools::toc::structure canonicalize serial\n\t      This command assumes that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      regular serialization of a table of contents and will throw an\n\t      error if that is not the case.\n\n\t      It will then convert the input into the canonical serialization\n\t      of the contained table of contents and return it as its result.\n\t      If the input is already canonical it will be returned unchanged.\n\n\t      For the specification of regular and canonical serializations\n\t      see the section ToC serialization format.\n\n       ::doctools::toc::structure print serial\n\t      This command assumes that the argument serial contains a valid\n\t      regular serialization of a table of contents and returns a\n\t      string containing that table in a human readable form.\n\n\t      The exact format of this form is not specified and cannot be\n\t      relied on for parsing or other machine-based activities.\n\n\t      For the specification of regular serializations see the section\n\t      ToC serialization format.\n\n       ::doctools::toc::structure merge seriala serialb\n\t      This command accepts the regular serializations of two tables of\n\t      contents and uses them to create their union.  The result of the\n\t      command is the canonical serialization of this unified table of\n\t      contents.\n\n\t      Title and label of the resulting table are taken from the table\n\t      contained in serialb.\n\n\t      The whole table and its divisions are merged recursively in the\n\t      same manner:\n\n\t      [1]    All reference elements which occur in both divisions\n\t\t     (identified by their label) are unified with document\n\t\t     id's and descriptions taken from the second table.\n\n\t      [2]    All division elements which occur in both divisions\n\t\t     (identified by their label) are unified with the optional\n\t\t     document id taken from the second table, if any, or from\n\t\t     the first if none is in the second. The elements in the\n\t\t     division are merged recursively using the same algorithm\n\t\t     as described in this list.\n\n\t      [3]    Type conflicts between elements, i.e. finding two\n\t\t     elements with the same label but different types result\n\t\t     in a merge error.\n\n\t      [4]    All elements found in the second division but not in the\n\t\t     first are added to the end of the list of elements in the\n\t\t     merge result.\n\n       For the specification of regular and canonical serializations see the\n       section ToC serialization format.\n\nTOC SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to\n       serialize tables of contents as immutable values for transport,\n       comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       table of contents may have more than one regular serialization only\n       exactly one of them will be canonical.\n\n       regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    The serialization of any table of contents is a nested\n\t\t     Tcl dictionary.\n\n\t      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, doctools::toc, and\n\t\t     its value. This value holds the contents of the table of\n\t\t     contents.\n\n\t      [3]    The contents of the table of contents are a Tcl\n\t\t     dictionary holding the title of the table of contents, a\n\t\t     label, and its elements. The relevant keys and their\n\t\t     values are\n\n\t\t     title  The value is a string containing the title of the\n\t\t\t    table of contents.\n\n\t\t     label  The value is a string containing a label for the\n\t\t\t    table of contents.\n\n\t\t     items  The value is a Tcl list holding the elements of\n\t\t\t    the table, in the order they are to be shown.\n\n\t\t\t    Each element is a Tcl list holding the type of the\n\t\t\t    item, and its description, in this order. An\n\t\t\t    alternative description would be that it is a Tcl\n\t\t\t    dictionary holding a single key, the item type,\n\t\t\t    mapped to the item description.\n\n\t\t\t    The two legal item types and their descriptions\n\t\t\t    are\n\n\t\t\t    reference\n\t\t\t\t   This item describes a single entry in the\n\t\t\t\t   table of contents, referencing a single\n\t\t\t\t   document.  To this end its value is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary containing an id for the\n\t\t\t\t   referenced document, a label, and a longer\n\t\t\t\t   textual description which can be associated\n\t\t\t\t   with the entry.  The relevant keys and\n\t\t\t\t   their values are\n\n\t\t\t\t   id\t  The value is a string containing the\n\t\t\t\t\t  id of the document associated with\n\t\t\t\t\t  the entry.\n\n\t\t\t\t   label  The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  label for this entry. This string\n\t\t\t\t\t  also identifies the entry, and no\n\t\t\t\t\t  two entries (references and\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions) in the containing list\n\t\t\t\t\t  are allowed to have the same label.\n\n\t\t\t\t   desc   The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  longer description for this entry.\n\n\t\t\t    division\n\t\t\t\t   This item describes a group of entries in\n\t\t\t\t   the table of contents, inducing a hierarchy\n\t\t\t\t   of entries.\tTo this end its value is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary containing a label for the\n\t\t\t\t   group, an optional id to a document for the\n\t\t\t\t   whole group, and the list of entries in the\n\t\t\t\t   group.  The relevant keys and their values\n\t\t\t\t   are\n\n\t\t\t\t   id\t  The value is a string containing the\n\t\t\t\t\t  id of the document associated with\n\t\t\t\t\t  the whole group. This key is\n\t\t\t\t\t  optional.\n\n\t\t\t\t   label  The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  label for the group. This string\n\t\t\t\t\t  also identifies the entry, and no\n\t\t\t\t\t  two entries (references and\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions) in the containing list\n\t\t\t\t\t  are allowed to have the same label.\n\n\t\t\t\t   items  The value is a Tcl list holding the\n\t\t\t\t\t  elements of the group, in the order\n\t\t\t\t\t  they are to be shown.  This list has\n\t\t\t\t\t  the same structure as the value for\n\t\t\t\t\t  the keyword items used to describe\n\t\t\t\t\t  the whole table of contents, see\n\t\t\t\t\t  above. This closes the recusrive\n\t\t\t\t\t  definition of the structure, with\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions holding the same type of\n\t\t\t\t\t  elements as the whole table of\n\t\t\t\t\t  contents, including other divisions.\n\n       canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a table of contents has the\n\t      format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally\n\t      satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all\n\t      the possible serializations of this table of contents.\n\n\t      [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are\n\t\t     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by\n\t\t     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
