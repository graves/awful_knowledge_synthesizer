    Manpage text:

    -createreplica [--certAdminEmail ⟨Cert Admin Email⟩] ⟨master IP or name⟩
         ⟨admin user⟩
         Create a new replica from an existing LDAP master.

         -createrootcertauthority ⟨Certificate Authority Name⟩ ⟨Certificate
         Authority Admin Email⟩ ⟨Certificate Authority Organization Name⟩
         Create a CA on the OD master.

         -destroyldapserver [diradmin]
         Turns off the LDAP server and deletes its database.  The optional
         argument of the diradmin account name will then prompt for the diradmin
         password and will inform all replication peers of the server's
         destruction.

         -promotereplica ⟨admin-user⟩ ⟨archive-path⟩
         Converts an existing replica into a master using the current database.
         Path to an archive from the master can given in order to add the root
         CA's keys to the promoted master.

         -removereplica [--guid D1C9C376-D940-404D-9941-7AD24E6A37DA]
         -⟨replica-address⟩
         Removes a replication link with the specified server.  The GUID of the
         remote server being removed should be passed in with the --guid option.
         Replication links are unidirectional, so the corresponding command should
         be run on the target server to remove the other half of an existing
         replication link.
